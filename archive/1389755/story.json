            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt was venturing into Syina Forest, a not too well known area controlled by a powerful pokemon, or so he had heard. He looked around and saw many kinds of pokemon and antrhomon, those in the shape of humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt had lived alone for as long as he could remember, but he never worried about surviving, the pokemon where he had lived were very helpful, even saving his life on a few occasions when he was younger. More recently, He had been having desires that could have only been full filled by one of the all-female human-shaped population. But the ones he had lived with were his family, not biologically but in every other way. For their sake and his own, he could never ask of them what he desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just walked into a clearing when Matt heard a low rumbling. he looked around trying to figure out where it was coming from and noticed it was getting louder. he could feel the ground shaking like a avalanche was heading towards him. Matt looked to the trees ahead of him since it seemed to be coming form that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as if in slow motion, he saw a beautiful Humanoid burst through the foilage. she was about his height, had bright red skin, with almost platinum blonde fur around her chest and leading around her neck, with the same hair above her gorgeous face. she had large, round, pitch black eyes and a some-what pointed nose, with thin ears longer than her hand, and a cloud of a tail in the same platinum blonde fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to Matt and seemed to brighten, as if she had found something she had always been looking for. Then time crashed back to normal as three tree were knocked down at from where she had just came from. From the forest, the Pursuer, and source of the noise was revealed. A woman, made of stone, with a lower body comprised of what looked like a chain of boulders, reared up angrily. the woman who had been running darted behind him and lowered her self to the ground, looking out from behind his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may not be a match for your sister, but I can take it out on YOU!\" she screeched. The two of them covered their ears as the blast of sonic waves nearly knocked them over. When it faded, Matt looked down to see the woman pokemon shaking fearfully, looking like she was going to run away again. she looked up and met his gaze, and he was lost  in her endless eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's arms went up and he centered himself in front of her. The Onix woman hesitated, then laughed, \"I don't want to hurt you human, so step aside so I may take my revenge out on that Flareon girl for what her sister did to me!\" she seethed, pointing a shaking hand at the girl. Matt tried to stand up straighter, \"What could she have done that was so bad? Was this girl even a part of what happened?\" he wasnt' sure why he was standing up to a 28-foot long stone snake woman, but Matt knew he had to protect this Flareon girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She humiliated me! That bitch will regret doing such things to me!!!\" she moved forward. Matt stood his ground, not sure what to do. Her human half alone was 7 feet tall, she could just toss him aside and have her way with the girl. But then, an odd thought crossed his mind, and he said it as a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think her sister would do to you if she found out?\" He had no idea why he said it, he just did, and he prayed it would at least slow her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven better, she stopped in her tracks. The Onix woman was maybe 6 feet away from arms reach, and she had a freightened look on her face. Matt didn't know how scary the Flareon girl's sister was, but he went with it. \"Yeah, if what she did was so humiliating, think of what she'd do to you if you attacked her sister!\" It may have been a bluff, but it was a bluff with bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Onix woman slowly pulled herself back, looking defeated and angry. after a few seconds, she left the way she had came, whacking trees as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around to ask the Flareon girl if she was alright, but before a word left his mouth, she had jumped on him wrapping her arms and legs around his chest, rubbing her face against his. \"Oh, thank you, thank you, I can't say it enough. Please, let me show you my appreciation.\" she said as her grip around his torso lessened. Then Matt felt her hands going down his pants.</span></div></div>",

Don't you at least...um,\" Matt scrambled his brains to come up with a decent reason for refusing a feel up, \"Shouldn't we at least know each other's names before  we...do something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Flareon girl tilted her head slightly, then it dawned on her they didn't know each other's names. \"Oh, well, I'm Pyrina. And my hero is named...?\" she said, crawling on all fours towards him, her tail wagging with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Matt, nice to - mmh phu.\" Matt finished his sentence inside Pyrina's mouth. Her tongue went wild inside his mouth and she wrapped her arms around him once more so he couldn't push away again. She was incredibly warm, and her breath heated Matt's throat. His tongue felt particularly warm, then hot, then he pushed his hand between their mouths and turned away breathing rapidly and keeping the tip of his tonuge in some saliva that had pooled in his mouth. Matt doubted she had meant to, but Pyrina had burnt his tongue when they kissed. He was now glad he had stopped whatever she was planning originally<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she realized what had happened, \"Oh no! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please, I didn't mean it, don't be angry.\" she said lowering her head and covering it with her arms, her tail falling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt checked with his fingers, finding nothing hurt when he touched it, just the normal sensation at the area of contact, he figured his tongue had probably been ironicly licked by her inner-flames. \"it's alright, It just...got me by surprise.\" he reached out and picked up one of her hands. when she gripped his hand to pick herself up, Matt was very surprised at her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about that, but, I am a Fire-type, when I get excited, my flame sack over acts and I'll spontaneously breath fire.\" she looked down, seeming to accept something that had never been said. \"Since I obviously can't show you my affection, properly, I'll leave you alone.\" she started to walk away, but Matt grabbed her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say I wanted you to leave. It was an accident, you can't prevent things that happen naturally. It's just who we are.\" Matt rolled his eyes at himself in his head, 'jeez that was corny,' he thought, but when he met Pyrina's gaze once more, she was too overjoyed that he wanted to stay with her. Her tail went everywhere to illustrate her joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since kissing you is a bit difficult, maybe you could do something to me.\" she said as her face, impossibly, become more red. She moved her legs apart to bring up the point, she was completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt hesitated</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wait,\" said Matt, \"Why do it in such an open area, what if your sister finds us?\" He had no idea who Pyrina's sister was, but if she could do something so terrible to an Onix, she could do something worse to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're right, if she sees us before I introduce you, she might think otherwise, and that could turn out bad. I'll take you to meet her right away.\" she grabbed him by the hand and pulled Matt along thtough the forest. He stumbled a few times but managed to keep up with Pyrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, they arrived at the base of a mountain. Pyrina looked around, \"I don't see her. Syina! Syina!\" she started calling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Syina, as in the name of this forest?\" If her sister was indeed so powerful to have the forest named for her, then he was glad he would meet her before she found the two of them doing 'the victory dance'. \"So i'm going to meet the ruler of this forest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she doesn't like to be thought of as a ruler, she's more of a protecter, anyone who doesn't do their part can be punished, just like Donix, the woman you had just met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what does you sister do to those who cross her?\" asking for more of his own sake than knowledges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it depends, for Donix, she questioned my sister's authority while insulting her in person.\" 'Note to self,' Matt thought to himself, 'Watch the sarcasm.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nanother minute passed and no sign of Pyrina's sister. \"Maybe she's not here.\" Matt said to her. \"Well she couldn't possibily be anywhere else, we would have found her if she were anywhere else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? This forest is pretty big, we're looking for one person, we can't expect to find her right a-\" he was cut off by a quake that knocked him to his knees. he stood up and looked to his left. His entire body turned with it as his sight wondered from what it saw up, and up, and up, until it hurt to look up anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before him was a 200-foot tall humanoid Espeon, arms crossed, looking down on him with a look somewhere between disinterest, and examination. her great blue eyes went through Matt like a window, her ears were longer at least three times his height. Her frame had a slightly less hour-glass figure than Pyrina, and her bust was, scale-wise, not as large. He looked down to see a one-hundred foot tail swinging back and forth, thicker than himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Syina!\" Pyrina called up to her sister, \"I'd like you to meet someone!\" she wrapped her arms around one of his, \"This is Matt, he saved me from being hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" the giantess said in a calm voice, not moving other than her tail. \"Yes, he was very brave when he stood up to-\" Pyrina was cut off by her sister, \"Donix? I see. I suppose It is my fault she tried to attack you, but her anger towards me is only outweighed by her fear of me, I doubt she'll trouble either of you again.\" she said as if it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I was hoping, I could...spend time with him?\" Asked Pyrina, to her monolithic sister. \"You should know I'm aware of you true intentions, but I'm also aware of your feelings, and this boy's. I'll allow you two to do whatever you want, But if he so much as thinks of hurting you, or anyone else, He will be mine to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt hadn't been really looking or listening anymore, he was too shocked at Syina's size. He was as thick as her fingers, and half as tall. Matt ahd heard of Anthromon possessing the ability to become much bigger than humans, but the largest he had ever seen, weight-wise, had been about 30 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Matt felt the ground shake once more. From within the massive cave Syina had emerged, an almost equally massive black-haired humanoid with yellow rings on her arms, thighs, and ears came forth. she was a humanoid Umbreon, the top of her head was about level with Syina's shoulder, and when she was next to Syina, she wrapped her arms around the Espeon. \"What's going on honey?\" The Umbreon said with a loving voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dusk, this is Matt, he saved my younger sister, Pyrina, from Donix who was mad at us for what we did. Matt this is my lover, Dusk, She's from a different land and we've known eachother almost all our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt tried to play back what yhe had just learned in his head. Pyrina, was Syina's, the guardian of this forest, younger sister. Syina was 200-feet tall, and had a lesbian lover who was about 170 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's correct, Matt.\" Oh, and she could read his mind. \"Also correct, I've seen your memories, and know your original reason for coming to my forest. Had you persisted of your own accord to take advantage of my sister, the least I would have done was remove you from my forest. But, since you displayed enough self-control to at least meet her family, and that your past is clear of any contempt or sin, I am allowing you the privelage of being with my sister, who has not had luck to find her own lover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrina looked like she was about to say something, but she stopped, then nodded. she once again wrapped her arms around hiss and rubbed her cheek along his arm. \"Take care of her, and Pyrina, take care of him. You two shouldn't seperate, I believe the two of you will be quite the couple.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Come on Matt, I know where we can be alone.\" Said Pyrina with a small grin. Matt turned to Syina, almost like checking for permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already said you may do as you wish as long as you don't harm anyone. Know if you'll excuse us, we wish to conduct our business in private.\" the giantess said as she and Dusk turned back towards the cave. At the last second, Matt could have sworn he saw Dusk's hand reaching towards Syina's legs. While a thought he'd normally want to explore, he pushed it out and concentrated on Pyrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill  wrapped around his arm, she led Matt through the forest along the side of the mountain. She led him to a small clearing with a ten-foot cliff overlooking a huge lake. The sun was starting to set, and the lake was ablaze with it's reflection. \"This was where all of us would get together and watch the sunset, when my 3 sisters and I were young, and all the same height.\" Pyrina added for clarity, \"Syina, the oldest of us, would always think of ways to help the the pokemon support one another, Quina, my other older sister, always talked about finding true love, and Eve, my younger sister, never tired of training herself to become the most well-rounded of all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrina was looking out to the lake, smiling at her happy times. \"We don't see eachother as often. Syina is always patrolling the forest, or spending her time with Dusk. Eve left the forest for the Hoenn region, and I rarely see Quina, since she's looking for her 'one and only', but, I love all of them more than anything.They were all I had...until I met you, at least.\" she turned toward Matt, staring at him with her large, black eyes. \"Now I want to hear about you. Where did you grow up? Did you have siblings?\" she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've never met another human. For as Long as I can remember, I was raised by Pierra, a Gardevoir who couldn't be described as anything but my mother. The other adult pokemon became my aunts, the little ones became my sisters. All in all, there were about 50 of us in that small thicket.\" Matt smiled at his own memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you left. Weren't you happy?\" asked the inquisitve Flareon. \"Of course I was happy,\" Matt replied, \"But recently, I started having...urges. I started thinking me doing things to those who were in every way my family. Then, finally, I told them I wanted to see the world, but I honestly just needed to distance myself from them before I did somehting I'd regret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's when you came to our forest?\" \"Yes, and, when I first saw you run out of the foilage, I thought you were the most beautiful person I had ever seen, and when I looked into your eyes, I thought to myself, 'I have to protect her, no matter what', and the rest is history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was along silence, neither of them looked away from one another. Finally, the two of them embraced one another in a full on kiss. It lasted only seconds as to avoid the previous misfortune, but they held on to each other as if they might be seperated at any moment. Pyrina was so warm, her bright red skin was so smooth, and her platinum blonde fur was so soft, Matt had the thoguht that it was unfare that he witnessed Pyrina's unimpeded beauty while she held on to fabricated clothing. So he let go and stepped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Pyrina seemed disappointed their embrace was done, but she perked up a bit when she saw Matt pulling off his shirt. His shoes, pants, socks, and undergarments soon followed. He stood before his new found love for her to see him for all he was, going so far as to spin in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled at his antics and they once again came together. They held hands as they lay down in the grass, looking up at the stars. Matt became groggy after a few minutes and his eye lids fell. He didn't know if he had fallen asleep, but his eyes shot open when he felt something on his chest. He opened his eyes to see Pyrina's face staring back at him with a smile. She had a look of wanting in her eyes, and Matt obliged to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe folded her legs down and her torso lined up with his own.  Matt felt his body against hers, and he knew this moment was theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so...</span></div></div>",

She lowered herself in such a manner, that the wall of fur on her chest covered his face. This was when Matt discovered Pyrina's fur hid her rather large breasts, which added to the comfort of his lovers body. Then he winced some when he felt a strange sensation over his member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrina's extremely soft and fluffy tail swept back and forth, her smooth hairs wrapping around Matt's almost painfully aroused member. With is right hand, he reached to Pyrina's exposed and warm crotch. his index and middle finger felt their way around her nether regions until they found an opening. Pyrina was obiviously anticipating this moment, as Matt could feel her tail picking up pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's fingers slowly made their way into Pyrina's womanhood, and she shuddered from her physical pleasure. she turned her head away as embers issued from her mouth quite liberally. Not wanting to get burned, Matt changed their positions, getting out from under her and turning them on their sides, then where he was on top. During the last position change, he removed his fingers from Pyrina, but moved himself back abit, and spread Pyrina's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrina looked at him with bliss and curiousity. Matt wrapped his arms under her legs and held on to her thighs, then lowered his head between them. Only seconds later Pyrina was writhing with bliss, her legs wanting to close, but Matt's arms holding them in place. Form her mouth came a fan of flame, every time she exhaled it was accompanied by a jet of flame from her mouth. To avoid injuring Matt or burning the grass and trees around them, she lay back and looked to the sky, her involuntary flames issuing relentlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was immersed in granting his lifes love the first pleasure he would gladly do a thousand times over. He tasted her juices, and was not drawn away, if he was going to love her for his life, he had to love everything about her, inside and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nlittle did he realize his grip around her thighs dwindling, but he let go and placed his hand on her hips, not so much as looking up. Then he felt her legs wrap around his back, keeping him in place. Matt heard her squeels of pleasure, her moans of bliss, and her sighs of satisfaction, it all drove him to be more active in his pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\na moment later, he realized something was different, and he tried to pull away. but Pyrina's legs drew back and he was held in place against her womanhood. then he finally broke out and stepped back. \"Okay, I know we're very excited, but I do need...to...\" Matt looked at Pyrina who was laying on the ground before him. She looked, off. something about her seemed strange, but he couldn't make out a difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt, what's the matter?\" Pyrina said standing up. Immediately, Matt saw the differnce. She was now more than 2 feet taller than him.</span></div></div>",

She and Dusk made love so much?\" Matt had never knew how Pokemon grew, but he had apparently found out by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yes, We grow if we experience great pleasure, sorrow, or anger.\" Pyrina was thrilled that this development hadn't affected him negatively. \"Everyone has their limit, like my sister who stops just over 200 feet. But since this is my first time,\" she lowered herself to his height, smiling seductively, \"There's only one way to find out how big i'll get.\" She wrapped her arms around Matt, smothering his face in her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked up at her from his soft and fluffy embrace and wrapped his arms around her hips. Then he slid his hands up and down her surprisingly firm cheek, gripping once in a while to encourage her. Pyrina clearly got the message, her smile widened and she  dropped herself to her knees, then lay back. \"I think we can pick up where we left off?\" she said spreading her legs welcoming to her understanding love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt grinned and knelt down to her crotch, still warm with anticipation, and resumed his oral exploration of her cavern. Pyrina once again welcomed his presence with bliss ful moans and sighs. Now that Matt was anticipating it, He could feel Pyrina's body expanding, and felt his tongue reaching less and less. then he concentrated a bit more on her clitoris at the top of her opening by licking it, and inserting his fingers in to her progressively wetter sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt then stood up, making note that her bent knees were above waist. She looked to him, her hands dug into the ground to help resist closing her legs around his head. Pyrina was now twice his height, but Matt showed no sign of hesitation as he took a step closer, positioning his memeber to penetrate her womanhood. Matt slid in easily, he supported himself by placing his hands on her hip bones, and started thrusting into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrina giggled through her blissful gasps, thinking that the timing couldn't have been much better, because while she felt him inside her, she might not have if she had grown much bigger. But something about this time felt different then the rest, somehow fulfilling. When she felt him starting to fade, she placed her growing hands behind him and pushed him into her, as he thrusted with everything he had, to satisfy her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt found Her opening becoming larger and more difficult to find a proper spot gor her to feel. Not only this, but he felt himself about ready to come, he only hoped, that at least for this first time, it could be a mutual finish. As he held himself back for as long as he could, he finally couldn't stand anymore and released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he was disappointed that he could not satisfy her in the end, but a shuddering gasp from Pyrina, and her extensive grip on him answered his wish. Then he felt her fluids run down his front, but he only felt them for seconds, as his stamina had left, and he was quite ready for a rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was asleep before his head fell.</span></div></div>",

He was laying on a very soft bed, wrapped up to his waist in a cushy fur blanket. His only inconvenience was his leg was a sleep from the pressure on it, so he adjusted himself and immediately, his numb leg seized up from the lack of circulation. he kept his leg straight and tried pulling his leg away from the pressure, but found since he could feel his leg, he couldn't tell if he was pulling it out any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt raised his head and grogily opened his eyes. It took a minute for his eyes to adjust, he didn't see anything but big red and white blurs. Finally, his vision cleared up and he saw his legs were under something, and he was ON something. He looked up only to have his heart jump as he looked into the sleeping face of Pyrina, whose eyes were easily as big as his head. Matt then discovered his legs were pinned between Pyrina's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Matt probably wouldn't have objected to his situation, but He couldn't feel his leg and he wasn't fond of the numb feeling. He first tried pushing himself out of her cleavage, but it turned out to be too soft to be used as leverage. Matt looked up and noticed His giant lover's hand  was within reach. He grabbed her thumb and started to pull himself, bending his waist to try and help with the leverage. Her hand came towards him with all the force he was pulling with, and apparently that was enough to wake Pyrina, as she gave a large, gasping breath, looking around in alert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrina sat up quickly and her hands were torn from Matt's grasp, he fell through her jiggling, fur covered breasts and slid down her stomach right in to her lap. Matt hit the ground with his feet and they gave way, making him land on his bottom, with his naked back against Pyrina's love-sticky crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Matt, was it you that woke me up?\" her voice said from high above his head. Matt looked up to see her looking back at him, her head tilted slightly with a smile. \"Since you're there, does that mean you want to have another go?\" she said jokingly coy. Her hands reached for you and braought you eye-level with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked up and down at her, \"You must be over 20 feet tall,\" he said, \"I'd have a heck of a job doing the same thing as last night. Just as a question...How long does your growth last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without something to stimulate me, I'd return to normal size in the next couple of days. But if we were like my sister and Dusk, I'd keep growing until I hit my max, then i'd maintain it as long as I'm pleasured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for now, how about we keep you closer to my height, since it would be alot easier on me. If that's alright.\" Matt added as to not try and insinuate he had the final say to someone 4 times his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, we'll have all the time we want to find out just how big I can get.\" she said, puting him down so he could retrieve his clothes. She watched him dress, chuckling when he tripped trying to put on his pants, and when he was done she stood up and lifted him to her shoulder, where he scooted as close to her head as he could and put his arm under and behind her enormous ear, to support him self as he sat.</span></div></div>",

Finally, her form dove into the ground leaving only a hole. Her Steelix sister had a shocked look at first, but then grinned. She then also dove into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did they go?\" Pyrina said startled, holding Matt close to her. \"I see you two have been busy, Pyrina, But for now, please just stand back, these two are after me.\" said Syina as she carefully watched the ground around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ground under her feet caved in. It was so deep her left leg sunk down to her knee and Syina crashed down, catching her self with her remaining knee and hands. Then, her right hand sunk into the ground past her elbow. the pits had already filled before Syina could try and pull herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonix and her sister then ripped from the ground and charged up the shoulder of Syina's buried arm, then they wrapped around Syina's neck, each of them holding eachother by the tail, pulling with all the strength they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyina's large irises normally took up most of her eyes, but white could be seen along her bottom lid as she tried to dig her fingers under them to grip.</span></div></div>",

I could end up hurting her more!

And there, just visible on her left shoulder, an anthro eevee wearing a bandana. \"is that...?\" Matt heard Pyrina say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe Eevee wasted no time in pursuing the 2 snake women. She launched herself from Syina's shoulder and crossed her arms in an 'X' shape. just before making contact with the Steelix, she swept her arms outward, and something about it launched it through several trees. Then the Eevee quickly changed to Donix, approaching at nearly untracable speeds, leading into a flying kick that made full contact with her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonix tumbled away, leveling trees as she crashed, then, she stopped in mid-air. Then she and her sister rose high into the air, level with the now standing Syina's face. Matt was trembling as he saw her face, as was Pyrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyina's calm and blank face was replaced by a rage filled visage. her glance went from Donix to her sister, \"What you just attempted is unforgivable, the only thing saving your lives is the presensce of my sisters.

You managed to watch Pyrina disappear under the canopy of the taller trees as you were pulled skyward. You turn your head with some difficulty from the windshear to see your captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman covered in golden-brown feathers, with beautiful, almost cape-like pink and gold plummage soared through the sky with amazing grace and speed. You would have enjoyed it had you not been part of the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance, you could see a towering tree, at least  twice as tall as Syina, and at least three times as thick. You also saw at least two similar, but noticabley smaller, trees some distance from it. As you got closer to the massive tree you see what looks like a cloud of debris, but closer inspection tells you its hundreds of Bird-type pokemon and anthro-mon, all looking to be Pidgeys, Pidgeottos, and a few Pidgeots, though none of them were as big as your captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour captor flies through the storm of beating wings with not so much as a bank to either direction, like it was a very complex bird intersection and she had the rite-of-way. after clearing the wall of bird-pokemon, she made a rather rude 90 degree turn, straight up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe next thing you knew, she had slowed down tremendously in an uncomfortabley short amount of time. You were now in front of her as she flapped her wings to support her as she entered a large cove in the trunk of the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge might have been an understatement, Syina at her full height could have curled up in it! the 'ceiling' was almost 80 feet above, and most of the ground was made up of a massive nest. You were certain 8 Pidgeots the size of your captor could sleep spread eagle (pardon the pun) and not come close to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour captor landed on her free, reverse-jointed leg and slowed her wing beats to keep her balance as she lay you in the nest. You scramble to your feet only to fall on your rear as jet-lag catches up with you. The Pidgeot stood on both her feet and you notice shes about 10 feet tall. She folded her wings as she lowered herself to your level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Elleot, I am the head of the Pidge Family, what is your name?\" she inquired. Still woozy from your trip you give it without thinking. \"Thank you, now if my children ask when they grow up, I can give them their fathers name.\" she rose partially and approached you while you were on your back, but her sentence snapped at the last second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, WOAH!!! FATHER?! I was a virgin until last night with Pyrina, I don't have kids!!\" you say, trying to regain your coordination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, but once i'm done, you will in a few weeks, but you won't need to stay if you don't want to.\" she said advancing on you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a sec! Are you saying you want to RAPE me to have kids?! That's...that's not right...\" you scoot away on the ground from the giant bird-woman who was intent on taking your seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at it like that... You make it sound as though wanting to have children is wrong. I don't want to take you for myself, I plan on returning you to Syina's sister afterwards, just sit back and let me do the rest.\" she closed the distance on you and planted her feet to either side of you. You look up and finally get a clear look at Elleot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer down covered face was quite attractive, and her body length plummage arched behind her in a graceful way. her physique was slender and about the same from her chest to her waist, most likely for aero-dynamic assistance. she had no hands to speak of, but her outermost joint was closed, giving the illusion of an exremity. Her tail was perked and twitched some every now and then. Her legs bent backward from the waist and reached the ground on smooth, but tough, legs and was propped on her powerful talons that were digging into the wood of the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you could remove your garments,  for a moment I can be done soon enough.\" she said refering to your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if I say 'no'?\" you respond, trying your damnedest to be true to Pyrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll remove them myself as best I can without harming you.\" she replied, clicking her talons. Both your pants and underwear were tossed aside very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now just relax and leave everything to me, it will all be over soon and you will be back with your lover.\" she said as her legs bent to lower herslef onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! you don't have to do this....There are other men out there, why me?\"<br>\r\n\"Because your here now, and I can devout more time to my chicks sooner.\" she answered, resuming her descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you'll out grow me before I...before I have the chance to impregnate you.\" Pyrina had started at your height and ended up 5 times as big, though you had devoted some time to pleasuring her before the real thing, but Elleot would still have gotten too big for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not true, unlike Pyrina and her sisters, I don't have the growth trait. My mother did, which is why i'm so big, but it didn't pass along to me. You don't have to worry about disappointing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to persist in your attempts, but your hormonally enraptured member slid into her descending womanhood and you gave a slight shudder from the pleasuring, but, if anything, forced, sensation.</span></div></div>",

To grow bigger like your sister? Just because you were jealous?\" Matt regretted saying it immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrina turned around, her face redder than seemed possible, glaring at you with her black eyes. You felt as though you were frozen in place, unable to move as she stomped towards you. \"Jealous? You thought I was jealous of my sister?! You saved my life! Why would I use someone who had saved my life just to rival my sister! You think that I'm that low?! Resorting to petty trick like Charm or Infatuate, to get what I want?! I wanted to beleive you protected me out of concern, maybe so far as too assume you too had 'love at first sight', but maybe that just exists in my sister's dreams.\" she turned away as steam started appearing in her eyes. from that little stint, she had grown another 6 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked at her as she buried her face in her hands, the effects of Glare and his own irrationality gone. He placed his hand on her hip, which was about at level with his shoulders. \"I'm sorry I reacted that way.

As your hands unconciously kneeded at the ground, you felt yourself rise higher and higher still. You gazed down. Somewhat rough pink ground was growing harder under you and propelling you into the air slowly. It was explanding with your touch. In fact- the whole orb was! It was growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped down and fell to your knees. The orb shaked beneath you. You looked down at it. The drop frightened you. Skirting around the odd shapement you stared down across the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight frightened you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a large face, almost foxlike. There were feminine curves to the chin and cheeks and a bright yellow fringe of hair hung over her face. Long branchy ears portruded the top of her head. It made sense now... somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sitting atop the giant Flareon's breast. The Flareon grew whenever her breasts were stimulated. You felt your pants grow around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, you lost your footing atop the soft fleshy orb and fell down onto the pink structure- the nipple.

Even worse was that, as she grew, her nipple grew with her, forcing you to hold even tighter to prevent yourself from slipping, which made her grow even more.  It was a cycle that would continue until something finally decided to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out, that something was you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, her nipple became to big to keep any sort of a grip on and your hands slipped off of it.

Getting higher up, you clutch at the thick strands of fur, using the velvet strips to pull yourself back up and out of the warm depths between her humongous breasts. As they slowly rise and fall under you, your balance continuously loses out, and eventually you just duck into a crawl--which, in itself, becomes taxing, as the fur forest surges up higher around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure it was madness, but you were in a fitting scenario for it! And where else were you going to go? You didn't know what she was on top of as she grew, but you hoped it would support the both of you, because your mind was made up already. Sure, it was the mind in the head between your legs, but that just couldn't be helped at this point!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, FINALLY, you've reached the smoother reaches of her humongous areola; the span of bright pink tissue meets your advance with a teeny bit of yield, equal parts pliant and firm. You scrawl along further, your hand cupping a teeny little bump near the base of her huge nipple, and a soft, echoing giggle fills the air. Still, she clearly hasn't woken up. Using all your skill, which it turns out there was some of, at all, you scale the nipple itself, the thing as big as a house, and come to a precarious sit on the peak. For a time, you simply bask in it all, scanning her seemingly-endless body over, furred hills rolling on and on into the periphery and horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But enough beauty, you came here for fun! you crack your knuckles and lean in, getting down onto your knees. The teat is just big enough to where you can stay on top of it without sliding off--and you're counting on that, as you begin to knead deep into the pink mass, massaging it sloooowly, surely. You hear a deep, booming groan far away, and see her mountainous muzzle swing to the side in slow motion, before she shudders and twitches, then booms larger yet again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid nipple bulges wider, pushing higher as it firms even more at your loving, 650 feet bulging sensuously up to 800 feet, then 1,000 feet, then 1,500 feet, each burst of growth forcing her up in larger explosions as she smiles and huffs into the air, licking her lips and groaning cutely. She still isn't awake yet! The tent in your pants presses down into the ballooning digit, as her tit pushes bigger and bigger and bigger, pressing up lovingly against your gentle hands. A great, massive hand suddenly looms overhead, hovering across the growing landscape of her body like a big cloud. It's...it's headed for her sex!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt slowly creaked open the door to his bedroom. As it opened he was greeted with darkness but as he pushed the door fully open a dull yellow light enveloped the dark room. Golden rings shifted about on the bed as he got closer and as his eyes adjusted to the dim light he could see her. Abbi, his loyal and affectionate Umbreon. \"Hey Abbi, going to sleep already?\" He asked the Pokemon as he flicked on one of the lamps beside his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breon!\" Abbi barked as she narrowed her red eyes as they adjusted to the sudden light. Matt chuckled and ran his hands along her ebony body, stroking her soft fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry girl, I'll come to bed soon.\" He said as he pulled up a chair to the computer desk in the corner of the room. \"I'm just going to check my emails first, alright?\" The Umbreon only let out a sigh in response as she lazily watched him work his magic on the computer. She was taken in by Matt when she was just an Eevee. Abandoned in a box on the side of some backstreet, it was a miracle anyone actually found her,  but Matt did. After nursing her back to health he even took it upon himself to give her the lavish life of a house pet. It wasn't long after that before the affection they showed towards each other mixed with the moonlight beaming through the bedroom window to cause Abbi to evolve into the dark-type Umbreon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed again, this one out of more admiration than annoyance as she watched her owner type away on the computer. Abbi <i>really</i> loved Matt. He provided everything for her just out of the kindness of his heart and never asked for anything in return. He fed her, kept her warm, gave her cuddles when she wasn't feeling good, everything. Almost everything, actually. Despite being a human, Matt was atually the first male that showed any loving attention to the young Pokemon. Abbi was surprised when she started to feel a warm fuzzy feeling in her chest whenever Matt would change clothes in the morning. She even started finding that the affectionate cuddles he would so often give to her were lacking. To but it bluntly, Abbi developed a desire for Matt to be her mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the free time being a pet gives you, she even made it her mission to scope out his tastes so that she could hopefully get closer to him. Abbi's main method was to just hide somewhere in his bedroom and hope he started looking at porn on the computer. She remembered that the first time she watched him she was quite surprised to see images of female Pokemon on the computer screen. As she peered closer though, she found that all the Pokemon in the images were... big. Really really big. They were either drawn or digitally imposed to stand taller than humans or even buildings, often depicted using their size to dominate the smaller humans. She could recall her shock as if it was yesterday as an image of a massive Umbreon was standing over a man popped on the screen, the Pokemon pinning him to the ground with her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience had left her with a mixture of conflicting emotions. On one hand, Matt is sexually attracted to Pokemon. On the other, he almost exclusively looked at images where they would be absolutely giant. A far cry from the smaller than average Umbreon. Abbi was brought back to the present as he heard Matt turn off the computer. \"Alright Abbi, I'm coming to bed now.\" The Umbreon's bushy tail flicked in anticipation as Matt took his clothes off until he was standing in his boxers. One of the reasons why she always loved Summer. \"It's a full moon tonight too so i'll open the curtains for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swish the curtains were open, revealing the white glowing moon. Moonlight flooded the room as Matt turned off the lights and crawled into bed. Abbi's glowing rings flickered as she trotted over the bed next to him before an arm curled around her and pulled her close to Matt's bare body. The moonlight felt \"Goodnight Abbi.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umbreon.\" Abbi tiredly replied. Curled up beside his body with her head resting on his arm she watched as Matt drifted off to sleep, relishing in the closeness of their bodies. As they often did her thoughts wandered over to her chances of becoming mates with her owner. She knew without a doubt he was attracted to Pokemon. She even caught him sneaking looks at her behind a few times. The Umbreon definitely felt a connection there and dwelled on the thought. Maybe Matt wants to keep fantasy and reality separate and that's why he hasn't acted? Or is he really only interested in giant Pokemon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Umbreon sighed as she turned her head to look at the glowing moon outside the window. If she could just grow bigger she could tell for sure if Matt has any sexual feelings towards her. Or at least she would be able to force him to be his mate. Abbi snickered at the thought, he would end up loving it either way. Closing her eyes, she wished deeply that a miracle could occur so that she could grow bigger just for Matt. As she drifts off to sleep a bright yellow point of light zooms past the moon and fades away. Neither of them noticed as Abbi suddenly grew a little larger.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they both fell asleep Abbi fell into a dream. In it, she was stomping down a street that she barely fit in and her body was nearly twice as tall as the buildings to her sides. Matt was on her head, complimenting the giant Umbreon for her size and encouraging her to grow bigger. Abbi realized it was a dream. Over time growing into a giant had become one the fantasies she would play over and over in her head and the theme would often end up seeping into her dreams, not that she minded. In the dream she made herself bigger and squashed buildings and vehicles alike. She let the dream run on like this, getting bigger, bigger, bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a start the Umbreon woke up, taking a second to recognize she was back in dim bedroom, the hint of morning light just starting to brighten the horizon outside. She could feel her paws sweating and a dampness between her hind legs. Her dreams always ended abruptly like that, her excitement almost always jolting her awake much to her dismay. The Umbreon yawned and stretched out, not worrying about waking up Matt as she curled in his arms again. He was always a heavy sleeper and it usually took a lot of effort from both the alarm clock and her to wake him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbi sighed as she played through that dream in her mind again. <i>The power to make yourself grow</i>. Besides being mates with Matt, it was her innermost desire. Not only to rouse her owner's sexual interest toward her but the absolute power and dominance that would come with being giant was really enticing to her, the thought often making her heart flutter. As she found herself lost in thoughts of macrophilia, a strange sensation was beginning to wash over her body. Her chest felt tight and her muscles felt too big for her skin. She grumbled at the feeling as she rolled over, trying to get it to stop.  With the tightness intensifying she suddenly clenched all her muscles and was relieved to feel the strange sensation subside, but as she relaxed her muscles she was jostled in the bed as her body expanded in all directions by a few inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes bolted open. There was no doubt about it; her legs were sticking across the bed further, her torso was considerably thicker and her head inched higher across Matt's arm as he still slept. Pure joy swept over the Umbreon as she realized that she actually grew! Almost immediately she focused on that sensation again and was happy to feel that tight feeling spread across her body again. She did the same thing as before and clenched all of her muscles and then released, coaxing another growth spurt that made her body blow out an extra foot. By this point Abbi was feverishly panting, the excitement of having her fantasy come true right before her eyes overwhelming her as she realized she made herself as big as Mightyena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently tossing over she laid down facing Matt. He was still bigger than her but Abbi was determined to change that as she concentrated on her body becoming bigger. Clenching her muscles again, her body gained another foot in size. Placing a paw on his chest she grew herself again and watched as her paw expanded on Matt's bare body. She noticed that coaxing out a growth spurt was becoming easier and easier as she gained control over her new power. The bed creaked slightly as she blew herself up yet another foot, arousal beginning to cloud the panting Umbreon's mind as she realized she was just a little bit bigger than Matt. He had kicked the sheets off himself during the night on account of the warm weather giving Abbi a full view of his naked body. Much to her delight something equally as arousing was happening in Matt's dreams as a large tent formed in his boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she slowed her breathing and then slowly lifted herself up, the weight of her paws pushing down hard on the mattress. To be careful not wake her mate-to-be up she cautiously moved on the bed until she was standing directly over Matt. Abbi froze when the springs in the bed groaned in stress as the weight on the mattress moved. Matt let out a yawn and tossed his head but thankfully for Abbi was still deep asleep. Cautiously she lowered her larger body onto Matt until her soft fur was rubbing against his smooth skin. She gasped lightly as her sex landed against his crotch, the tent in his boxers rubbing slightly against her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbi mischievously looked down to Matt's face. The arousal clouding her mind had reached it's peak and she was intent on mating with her owner tonight. As she sat over her snoozing owner, it would be an understatement calling Matt a heavy sleeper. So much so that she decided to give him an even bigger surprise when he woke up by making herself larger. She clenched her muscles and focused on getting bigger eliciting a growth spurt that was slower and more controlled. She looked around as everything in the room, including Matt, seemingly shrunk before her and relished in the feeling of her weight slowly sinking more into the bed. She realized she could keep the growth going but decided to cut it short, the two extra feet from the spurt more than enough to make her the size of an Arcanine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was even smaller compared to her now, almost completely enveloped in her black furry mass. The Umbreons golden rings were flickering lightly as she worked herself to wake him up, dampening his boxers as she absentmindedly grinded against his hard bulge. She couldn't wait any longer. She was dying to see how Matt would react to see his own small little Umbreon all grown up. Leaning down she dragged her spongy tongue across his face, licking him over and over to wake him up. \"Stop it...\" Matt groaned as he tried to swat away the fleshy thing barraging his face. After Abbi stopped her licking did Matt finally got a chance to register the weight bearing down on him, his eyes widening in shock as he noticed the enlarged Umbreon pinning him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umbreon!\" Abbi called out as if saying \"Surprise!\". Looking down at him she could see he was still processing what was happening and probably trying to decide if he was still dreaming or not. A naughty thought filled her mind as she deliberated just dominating him and taking him there and now, but a more sensible side was telling her to wait to see what Matt thinks of her new size first. Considering his <i>history</i> with macrophilia, he might even have some cool ideas to utilize her new power. Either way, she was determined on taking Matt as her mate this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbi's golden-ringed tail swished behind her as she made up her mind.</span></div></div>",

Your property is a large block of land filled with remnant forest and small fields filled with various types of berries for a wide range of uses. Besides heading into town to sell berries or buy supplies, you are fairly isolated from the outside world and your interactions are mostly limited to the pesky Murkrow harassing your crops or the odd wild Pok\u00e9mon living in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't all that lonely, though. Before you moved to your new estate you had adopted an abandoned Eevee that was left outside your old town's Pok\u00e9mon nursery. She was energetic and adapted to the country life perfectly, frequently exploring the surrounding forests and pinching a few berries here and there. You had named her Clover, Clove for short, based on the amount of clover and grass debris she would get stuck in her fur when she went out adventuring. It was no surprise when one day she came back as a Leafeon covered in creamy fur and a green leafy tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost every morning you went out to the back porch of your cabin-like estate and watched the sun rise from your comfortable deck chair. From this vantage point you could see the morning light roll over the fields and forests before its warming glow reaches you. It was your daily ritual, so to speak. With eyes closed, a smile crept on your face as you heard the pitter-patter of Leafeon feet as she trotted over to join you. She jumped up on your lap, slowly walking over your body until she reached your face where she gave you a few good licks before settling down. She stares you straight in the eye and it isn't long before she begins rocking back and forth on-top of you, slowly rubbing her body against yours. Over the months she had become increasingly affectionate and it was only recently that this behavior had become a norm for the Leafeon, wanting to be as close to her master as intimately possible. Normally this would be considered bad behavior from a Pok\u00e9mon, but you guess you're partly to blame for giving in to her antics. You're not ashamed to admit that her incessant desire to mate with you was a really big turn-on. In fact, it was becoming common that you would unzip your pants for her and releasing your hard cock for Clover to pleasure herself on. You were apprehensive at first, but it quickly became a new step in your daily morning ritual that you look forward to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover continued her grinding, mewling as she stared at you with pleading eyes. Your heart nearly melts. How could you say no? She arcs her backside up as you reach down to unzip your fly causing your penis practically spring out, already hard from her teasing. Moving your hands to her rump, she slowly lowers herself down onto your penis, gasping lightly as it penetrates her. With your dick firmly hilted inside your Leafeon you lovingly caress her cheek as she steadily begins to gyrate her hips. slowly but surely she began to work your shaft. You lower arms onto the deck chair's armrest and let her do her thing. She loved being the dominant one during sex, always striving to be on top and watching smugly as she reduces you to a pleasure-wracked mess. You relax into your chair as you get used to her rhythmic thrusts. However, you are caught off-guard as she suddenly increases her speed, pumping your dick for all it's worth. You grip at the armrests in response to the jump in speed and intensity of her lovemaking, letting out involuntary gasps as she slams her tight vagina down on your dick over and over. It isn't long before you feel a climax approaching and grip the armrest harder. It never comes though as she abruptly stops her frantic rutting, you look up in confusion to your panting Leafeon and see the hint of a smug grin. \"Not yet.\" her face seemed to say. She was always one for teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover stands above you, her privates hovering just above yours. She held her head up high and closed her eyes and it seemed like the sunlight was warping around her. Wait, was she using Synthesis? She had recently learned that move a few days ago when you discovered a strange isolated berry in one of your fields. Clover had quickly snatched it and gobbled it down before you could do anything. Taking her to the Pok\u00e9Center as a precaution, it turned out that she was perfectly healthy but had mysteriously gained some levels along with a new move, Synthesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch Clover, confused as the sun continued warped around the Leafeon. Why this move in particular? Did she need more energy? In the past she had occasionally used moves to spice things up while we were making love, but right now you couldn't understand what impact Synthesis would have on their experience together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-leafeon...\" she moaned. You watched in suspense. You didn't notice it at first, but she was getting heavier. Slowly, she lowered herself onto you, eyes closed and mouth slightly agape as sunlight courses through her. You take the chance to stroke her warm fur, slowly moving your hands toward her rump. A strange sensation was coming off her. Out of curiosity you stop your stroking and caress both of her thighs. Your eyes widened, it was unmistakable. <i>She was growing!</i> You could feel her thighs broaden, stretch and expand in your hands, slowly parting your arms as her form grew. With the reality of what was occurring dawning on you, you notice her growing paws stretch up your chest and her face get closer to yours. Opening her eyes she watches as she grows closer to you, taking the opportunity to angle her head to give a big Leafeon kiss. You awkwardly try and return the kiss a few times, unaccustomed to her new size but Clover eventually gets impatient and takes the initiative, planting her muzzle against your lips. You're entranced by her as you both make out, the Leafeon sneaking her enlarged tongue into your mouth, entwining with yours. She practically covered you now, bearing down on you with added weight. Your deck chair was groaning in protest but thankfully her growth seemed to slow. Releasing you from her kiss, she pulled away and stared down at you. Her paws covered your shoulders and her backside engulfed most your lower body, you were completely pinned by her bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou estimate that she must be more than twice her size. You nervously smile up at her as she slowly begins grinding on you again, causing the overburdened chair to squeek along with her movements. Rocking above you imposingly, Clover gives you a sweet, loving smile. \"Leafeon!\" she barked reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning sunlight was almost radiating through her and you swear that you could see it bending and swirling as it had been when she first used Synthesis. While you knew that she would never do anything to hurt you, the though of an even bigger Clover made you nervous... Surely she won't grow <i>that</i> big, right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Do you speak it!?\u201d Matt stopped changing channels and decided to watch that. It was a lazy Saturday night, Matt had nothing to do but sit on the couch with his little pet sylveon, Rose of Sharon, who was sitting in his lap, curled up in her blanket. \u201cWhat\u2019s a motherfucker,\u201d Rose questioned. \u201cI\u2019ll explain at the commercials\u2026\u201d Matt replied absentmindedly, petting her softly.  Rose just smiled and watched along. She was glad she had someone as smart as Matt. As the commercials shilled crap that nobody cared about, Matt to the time to look down at his Pok\u00e9morph. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose of Sharon (or just Rose) was a very small sylveon Pok\u00e9morph. She barely stood 4\u20192\u201d with her ears up. She looked like any other sylveon, white fur with pink portions and large \u201cflesh bows\u201d just beneath her neck and in front of her left ear. She had a short muzzle with a pink button nose.  Her baby-blue eyes shined softly like pearls in the light. She was had soft skin and fur, with small breasts and a cute ass. While she couldn't be called sexy, there was something about her cuteness that vaguely turned Matt on. Her most identifying feature was on her head, a small tuft of fur on the front that she liked to pretend was hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMatt, what\u2019s a motherfucker?\u201d asked Rose, genuinely curious. Matt chuckled, \u201cSomeone Samuel L. Jackson hates, honey.\u201d Pleased at his answer, Rose giggled and snuggled up deeper into Matt\u2019s embrace, wrapping her head bows around him as best as she could. Rose loved Matt with all her heart, ever since the day they meet when she was very young. After that day, they were basically inseparable. She always wanted to see Matt happy and safe, something she felt she could only do with partial success.  She would cheer him up on good days and bad but she always felt she couldn't keep him safe. She was always too little, how she wished she could be bigger. Bigger than Matt, maybe even bigger than the apartment they lived in. As the movie rolled on, Rose looked outside of the window and saw a shooting star. Taking her chance, Rose wished with all her heart that she could be bigger. Opening her eyes, she saw\u2026that nothing happened. At all, nothing. Disappointed, Rose closed her eyes and quickly fell asleep while Matt repeated his favorite profanity ridden lines from the film. Looking down, Matt noticed that Rose had fell asleep, so gently carrying her he placed her in bed and when to finish the movie. After the end, Matt brushed his teeth and went to bed, saying goodnight to Rose before closing his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did they both know that by the power of love and magic (along with the fact that eevee DNA is basically the genetic equivalent silly-putty) Rose started to undergo a strange metamorphosis. Her wish was finally granted. But how will it play out? Will she be big now or will it be slow and subtle?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The stars from the night sky shown brilliantly through the window of his bedroom...so brilliantly, that he had trouble sleeping. Letting out a slight groan, he rolled his head over to his side to observe the sleeping form of Rose, as she cutely snored, her ribbons swaying around involuntarily in her sleep. Although they slept together, and in this world, it was perfectly within Matt's rights to go 'further' with her... they had never done it. Their relationship had stayed extremely platonic throughout their lives, and he wasn't sure he wanted to threaten the sanctity of the relationship they had with sex, not to mention how innocent-minded Rose was. He was going to do it some day, that much he knew. Depending on how things went over the course of the next morning, it could be even sooner then he'd realized possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, as he looked up towards the stars, watching as they sparkled magnificently in the moonlight, he began to doze off, finally the fatigue of the day beginning to set in. As his eyelids began to close, he briefly wondered if his mind was playing tricks on him, or Rose really did look larger then normal...he figured it was the lighting playing tricks on him, and fell asleep, dimly aware of the Sylveon's expanding body brushing up against him, her furry hide becoming more imposing large each second...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning glow of sunlight began to wash over Matt, blanketing his bare body with a lemony glow, the floating specks of dust becoming visible in the streak of sunlight. Opening his eyes, he let out a yawn, taking a moment to sort out his thoughts as he thought about what he was going to do for the day. First he'd shower, get dressed, cook breakfast for Rose before she wakes up, and-wait, what the hell? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was suddenly aware that he wasn't on his bed at all. Inf act, his body was angled an extra 90 degrees he wasn't used to as torso lay on the floor beside the bed, his legs bent upwards and hovering in the air. Blinking, he looks around, wiping the crust out of his eyes as he began to try to make sense of the situation. Had he fallen out of bed? That...hasn't happened before. Not unless he had alcohol the night before. Did he have alcohol the night before? No...he wouldn't do it with Rose around. Not normally, anyway. Struggling to right himself, he pushed his torso upwards with his arms, allowing the barely-still-on-him blanket to slide off his body as his legs settled to a more natural position, as he righted himself, getting to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't mentally prepared for the sight that stood before him. Or more accurately, lying before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he saw the tower of immaculate pinkish-white fur infront of him, and his immediate thought was <i>\"Where's Rose?!\"</i>. But as he walked towards his bed, nearly flattened by the weight of this giant mound of fur laying on it, threatening to destroy it, he heard a sound that he couldn't forget. The sound of Rose snoring cutely, as the strange sight before him rose and fell in line with the snore, and it suddenly hit him like a ton of bricks. This thing on his bed... <i>was</i> Rose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking up slightly, he finally began to register the sight before him, still surprised (as he reasonably should be). The white, pinkish mound of fur was the side of Rose's torso, standing nearly as long as he was tall! Her furry arms were now so large, it looked as if he could easily be grabbed in two hands, or even one! Her legs had broken through the wall into the living room, much to Matt's chagrin. Her paws were now as large as her hands, and were imposingly huge, so much so that Matt worried that he could either be smothered by them, or flattened into a pancake. As it stood, however, each paw rested on the now overturned couch, her feet much too big for the couch to contain them. As his eyes wandered over her body, he couldn't help himself as his eyes found her \"cute little ass\", looking just as cute, only much larger. Each cheek looked to threaten his safety just by their presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over towards where Rose's head was meant to lie, he merely saw Rose's pert little breasts, that if he didn't know any better, had actually grown several cups bigger as well as matched the increased size of the rest of her. Nearest to the wall where the head of the bed rested, he saw the lower end of Rose's neck ribbon, the now incredibly large tendrils swinging around, gently patting the walls and floor, only with a newfound strength that threatened any loose objects in the room, sending books and desk-objects to the ground. But where was her head? It couldn't... oh no... <i>it couldn't be... could it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Matt crawled over the Sylveon's prone arm, recoiling as it twitched due to his touch, but continuing to vault over it when it didn't react further. Having made it past that obstacle, Matt found himself avoiding the powerful whips of Rose's relentless ribbon-waving. Opening the balcony door, he stepped outside, just as a ribbon slammed into the ground where he was just standing; he knew that it wouldn't have hurt him, but the bookshelf that immediately fell over would've. Turning towards the now head-sized hole in the brick wall just confirmed his fears; Rose's head had actually burst out of the wall, and was limply hanging over the sidewalk in their third story apartment, the ribbons near her left ear dangling just low enough to tickle passerby's. Although it seemed like no pokemon were walking around at this hour. Lucky for him, because it'd be difficult to explain the sight of a 20...30, feet tall Sylveon? He wasn't too sure about the details. 30 feet seemed correct, although it could easily be more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking towards her sleeping face from his position on the thin, poorly-built balcony that came with each apartment, he noticed that the sight of her closed eyes, her cute muzzle, and her soft yawns were every bit as adorable as before, only now magnified significantly. As her head rolled around akwardly, settling as it began to face him, he realized just how powerful she was now as her soft yawns became significant bursts of wind that sent a shiver down his spine. She was so large now! And he...found that he didn't mind seeing her so large. But there's another time and another place for that. For now, though, he needed to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rose! Rose, wake up!\" he yelled, momentarily wondering if she'd be as easy to rouse as before, but as expected, her cute eyelashes began to flicker open, as a smile formed on her face the moment she saw Matt. \"Hi, Matt. Why are we on the balcony?\" she asked, not having fully realized that she was staring at the entirety of the balcony, a feat made impossible for anybody actually ON the balcony...likely due to her having just woken up, but still. \"Uh, Rose...you're not on the balcony. You're kinda... sticking out of our apartment right now.\" he said, looking towards her with concern in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose's eyes suddenly shot open, no longer looking glazed over with that morning grogginess one has when they wake up. Moving her head around rapidly, she was now accutely aware of many things. The open air brushing against her hair, her head-ribbons tapping the sides of the apartment...and the fact that Matt now looked startlingly small compared to her. How had this happened? It's not like she wished for this to happen-OH WAIT, she did. Her concerned look suddenly turned into a smile as she realized what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt, my wish came true!\" she said with a smile, only garnering more confusion out of Matt. \"You...what? You wished for this?!\" \"Yes! Last night, on a shooting star...I mean, I didn't expect it to come true, and I'm a little too big for the apartment now, but this is really cool! I'm so huge, Matt! Don't you like me at this size?\" she asked, a genuine giddiness filling her voice as she waited for Matt to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt thought about it. At this size, Sylveon was just as adorable as ever, that much was for sure. But there was also another element to the size that appealed to him that he didn't know how to label. His previously diminutive, cute friend, that he'd known all his life, was now outgrowing his apartment...and that excited him! And if he was correct, she was actually increasing in size proportionally as well, her curves seeming a little more pronounced to his untrained eye. He couldn't deny that this wasn't an unwelcome change, and a desire to have fun with Rose was suddenly stronger then ever before. Only, they had bigger things to worry about for now then play around. First things first. She has to get out of the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...uh, kind-of nice, Rose, but you need to get out of the apartment before you get any...bigger?\" he said, an air of uncertainty filling his voice. He wasn't sure if the growth would continue. I mean, if the wish was fulfilled, it surely has stopped now, hasn't it? It's at it's end...right?! \"Oh, right. I'll try and get out of here, but, uh...\" she said, her voice trailing off as she tried to adjust her paws to more adequately allow her to slide out, only to punch a hole in the roof and startle a charmander-woman watching a movie, who let out a shriek as the massive paw demolished half of her floor and sent her TV down with a mess of CLANGS and BANGS, the couch she was residing on dangerously close to the new hole. \"...it's going to take some...working...to get out of here. And there may be some collateral damage...\" she trailed off, looking at Matt nervously. He sighed. This was going to take some work.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rose started working her way out of Matt's apartment through the hole her head had created, inevitably widening it as she did. She was quite aware that her foot had plowed into the upstairs neighbor's apartment, but could only hope that the Charmander woman wouldn't be mad at her or Matt for what was entirely an accident. Being as innocent-minded as she was, it hadn't clicked with Rose that her 30 foot height would be enough to dissuade their neighbor's possible anger with fear of what she could do in retaliation. Matt went back inside and nudged each foot in the direction needed to clear the couch with hopefully the least amount of further collateral damage. Trusting him completely, Rose moved her legs a little at a time in the direction she felt him nudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked up through the hole Rose's foot had created a minute or so ago and his eyes met with the Charmander woman's looking down through the same hole. As admittedly pretty as she was, Matt had sworn to himself that he would never do anything to hurt Rose physically or emotionally and so just apologized meekly, \"Uh...sorry, ma'am. I'll pay for this...somehow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman shifted her gaze towards the huge pink feet and the long legs they were attached to and then replied nervously, \"Oh...n-no no, it's fine... Really! D-don't worry about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wishing to press it further, Matt went back to guiding Rose's legs through what she clearly couldn't see herself at the moment. Once she got her arms outside, Rose cautiously pushed against the outside wall until she was most of the way out. She bent downward, her abdomen coming perilously close to the side of the balcony, and slipped out the rest of the way. Finally, Rose gently brought her feet to the ground and stood up to her full height. \"I did it, Matt! I got out!\" she cheered giddily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt came out onto the balcony to see Rose, happy to have her out of their apartment with it intact...mostly. She looked down at herself curiously. While she couldn't get a good full view at the moment, she could tell that her curves had increased a bit. This excited Rose, as she always felt they were too small despite Matt's reassurance of his love and her cuteness. But she wanted to be more than <i>just</i> cute. She wanted to be <i>sexy</i>, and now in addition to being better able to keep Matt safe, her new height and size would hopefully make him <i>finally</i> want to have sex with her. While he feared what it would do to their relationship and innocent mind, Rose only saw it as completely natural and the ultimate expression of love. She was merely waiting for him to make the first move. She also knew how much he liked giant females which occasionally appeared, and now <i>she</i> was giant herself! However, she wasn't sure if she could wait much longer before she made the first move for him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Matt went inside to shower and get dressed. Once done, he fixed some breakfast for himself and Rose, silently praying to Arceus that she was a very merciful deity and his beloved Sylveon didn't need more than what she usually ate before today. There was simply no way he could afford that much food, and he certainly didn't want Rose to starve. He brought their breakfast out onto the balcony, and while she unsurprisingly devoured hers in one gulp, thankfully she gave her genuine cute sigh of satisfaction that meant she was full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after breakfast, Rose felt a little strange. Matt noticed this and was about to ask what was wrong when he found himself staring at her neck, then her collar bone. His fear (or perhaps...fantasy?) had been realized - Rose was growing again! As her breasts rose into view, he could clearly see them expanding even faster than the rest of her. And since she was naked, he could see her swelling nipples were as hard and erect as he was in his pants. Soon her growing tits were above his direct field of vision and he was looking at her taught abdomen before the sides flared out wonderfully into her rising hips. A thought came to him as her crotch became eye level with him on the balcony, and he asked, \"Er, Rose? Exactly how big did you wish to be again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose's baby blue eyes widened as she continued to grow, surpassing 50 feet. \"Uh...well, I...didn't think to wish for a definite size, just...um...bigger.\" she admitted nervously. She had thought about being maybe bigger than the apartment they lived in, but she was pretty sure she had only meant the unit itself and not the whole apartment building... Then again, she never did specify just how much bigger she wanted to be, so even Arceus may not know when the wish was finally fulfilled and she would stop growing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thought crossed her mind as her knees rose above Matt's view. While her most recent growth seemed to have stopped now, leaving her almost three times the size of the entire apartment building at 140 feet in height with big juicy F cup breasts that would make her sisters jealous in addition to her ass, it was possible that her wish had been granted - only, Rose might never <i>stop</i> growing bigger since she never said what size she wanted to be. As cool as being so huge was, (not to mention how hot it made her feel) how could she protect Matt if she wound up outgrowing the entire planet and more? For the moment, she bent down, bringing her massive face into Matt's view once more, and asked quietly, \"Do you still like me, even though I might have made a big mistake with my wish, Matt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stared into her huge baby-doll eyes, Matt didn't even have to think about his answer. \"How can I not? You're the cutest, sexiest 140 foot tall Sylveon I've ever laid eyes on! You're stuck with me since the day we met until the day I die, which I hope is for a very long time!\" This brought an enormous smile to Rose's gigantic face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt had already accepted the sight of Rose's huge, naked form standing before him, and yet his mind still desperately fought to decipher the sight before him. He could hardly process Rose as a single creature; each disturbingly quick movement on her cute, sexy body seemed like a separate entity, and yet the large creature before him was the same cute, 4 Foot 2 Sylveon that had fallen asleep in his lap the previous night. And this excited him, as Rose noted by looking at his pants and noticing his comparatively bulge. And the excitement was something Rose seemed to share, as Matt noted, looking at her pink, and <i>gigantic</i> nipples, noticing how erect they appeared. The air around them seemed to get a little thicker, in-part due to Rose's sheer size, and Rose desperately hungered for their first sexual interaction...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, she looked around. In this world where Pokegirls were aplenty and human men were incredibly rare, most of the Pokegirls were very...sexually open. And Rose blushed as she realized that she was being ogled by other Pokegirls. She never expected it to happen, given how diminutive and petite she'd been before today, but now, she was rapidly becoming a sex symbol for all...and a part of her liked it, even. However, she also came to realize that it would be wholly inappropriate for her and Matt to attempt to straddle each-other (or really, just her straddling him) in the street like this, not to mention how dangerous it is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, her feet nearly took up the whole width of the street, leaving only a small gap in between that she realized a car was wedged between, it having tried to drive through the gap, only to get wedged between. Carefully, she lifted up a single foot, and gently pushed the car away, before putting her feet back down. This display of power reminded her just how much damage she could cause, and how gigantic she now found herself to be...and growing even larger, she noted, as she shuddered and promptly became 150 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt, we...should probably go somewhere else.\" Rose said gently, looking down towards the growing crowd near her feet. She could hear the ever-growing murmurs of the crowd, as they all admired her, either in shock, awe, or possibly arousal, she realized. \"It's a little crowded here...we may need to go some place a little more...private.\" she said, ignoring the sounds of disappointment coming from the crowd. Looking out towards the gathering she created, Matt agreed. \"You're right, but I may need to bring some things with me, just in-case. Is there anything you need?\" he asked, not even considering the fact that there wasn't much she could possibly use, anymore. \"Some new clothes, maybe.\" she joked. \"I'll tell you if I find any. But I'm going to go pack up the essentials, and then we'll be able to go.\" Nodding, the Sylveon watched as her incredibly tiny friend (who she thinks is about to become her lover) heads inside the nearly dollhouse-sized apartment building, and she waits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she waited, she continued to look around, taking in the sights. Aside from all the pokegirls admiring her (which she realized wasn't just in her immediate area; she was probably creating a nice view throughout much of the city), the size of the buildings is what really hammered in her new size. They didn't even compare! The tallest buildings only came up to her upper torso, but she still towered above them, making them look like toys in comparison. But in reality, they were not toys, and they were full of even more people staring at her, which she realized she didn't mind. She knew that the attention would come with the size, so she just shrugged it off, taking it as a compliment more than anything. After all, who <i>wouldn't</i> want to be admired for being the tallest, sexiest thing for miles around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Matt walked back out onto the balcony, this time wearing a rather bulky backpack. \"What's it for? Going to explore Rose Mountain, Matt?\" she said with a grin. \"Soon enough, Rose, but I just packed the essentials. Sleeping bag, spare clothes, food... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">condoms...</font>\" he muttered, trailing off. Then, two things occurred to Matt: 1. The situation was so absurd that being embarrassed over packing condoms was incredibly silly in hindsight, and 2. Did he even need them? How would that sort-of thing work with a Sylveon 23 times his size, and still growing? But he just shrugged those thoughts off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a few moments of silence, and the crowd below even seemed to go silent in response, waiting for something to break the ice. Rose finally asked \"Do...do you care if I pick you up, Matt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt actually hadn't thought about that, but after a second or so of thought, said \"Of course not! I know you'd never hurt me, and who wouldn't want to be held by someone as big as cute as you?\" he said confidently, causing Rose's smile to grow ever wider. Rose adjusted into a kneeling position, being extra careful not to crush anybody beneath her (and the crowd seemed to back off in reaction, anyway) she reached out a furred hand, settling it at the edge of the balcony for Matt to step on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at her for a moment, and looking over the rail of the balcony, he climbed over the bars and landed with a soft impact on her palm, as his mind was once again reminded of the sheer size difference between them. As exciting as it was, it was also somewhat worrisome. But mostly exciting, he concluded, and with that, Rose began to walk (more like stride) down the street, creating minor quakes and craters as she did so. Looking up towards his gigantic girlfriend (a term he felt he might as well use to describe her, now) he watched her as she walked slowly and cautiously, careful not to hurt anybody as she walked down the street, weaving between buildings. Although everybody seemed to avoid her, so that was barely an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter relaxing in her furred palm for a few minutes, Matt finally spoke up. \"Where are we going, Rose?\" Having heard this, Rose looks back down at him with a smile,  and replies...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slowly, Matt was coming to a few realizations. The first was he really, <i>really</i> wanted to have fun with the gigantic Rose in a way he had been putting off for far too many years now. He could have 'done it' with dozens of more than eager female Pokemorphs by now. Not that he was exactly the best looking man around, more like he was one of only very few men around at all and male Pokemorphs were unheard of. Yet he hadn't, all for Rose, yet he couldn't bring up the nerve to do what was in his rights to do. Always putting it off to 'someday'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brought Matt to his other realization. If her growth continued, possibly indefinitely...his time to actually man up and have sex with Rose was limited. So it was decided: he would do it, and live with the consequences whatever they may be. If she was going to lose her innocence, she probably would have lost it by now with all the violence and sex in the movies and TV shows they've watched together. And if she hated him for making his move on her, he would accept that. If she wanted to squash him like a bug, then he would accept that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first, however. He needed to pack up what few possessions he needed and prepare to leave. While looking down from the balcony, he could see that the landlady Nidoqueen was busy ogling Rose outside...along with a small but growing crowd of Pokemorphs. \"Oh my... I-I've never drawn a crowd before...\" Rose commented as she followed your gaze to around her feet and stood back up to her current jaw dropping height. If Matt were on the ground with them, he wouldn't even come up to her ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be scared, Rose. I'll pack up and then we can head out of here. Er, once we settle things with Nadira about the...damages to her building.\" Matt replied and then went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose noted that she actually wasn't scared of the crowd she was drawing. In fact...a part of her enjoyed the attention. As she waited for Matt, she thought about how she just yesterday had been a diminutive, rather plain Pokemorph of 4'2\". And only with her long ears up! Now, she was like a gigantic, walking symbol of sexiness. But the power that came with her size meant she needed to be extremely careful with her surroundings so that they remained intact and she didn't accidentally hurt anyone. Her hand found itself encircling her pussy as she thought, though she blushed and pulled it away as soon as she realized what she was doing to the apparent disappointment of the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt finished packing, and was about to go ask Rose to pick up Nadira so they could talk, (he dared not go down to that crowd of desperate Pokemorphs at her feet) when he noticed the bedroom clock. The second hand wasn't moving, yet he swore he put in fresh batteries just a few days ago when Rose had mentioned it. Odd... He went out to the balcony just in time to see her almost masturbate. \"Rose! Could you bring the landlady up here please?\" he asked, pretending he didn't see her do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I don't think that will be necessary. At least, not just yet.\" a mysterious voice replied with a hint of amusement, causing both Matt and Rose to look around for its source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rose lurched forward and scooped Matt up from the balcony, a look of combined worry and terror on her face. \"I...I can't control my body...\" she muttered with fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, Rose of Sharon. Oh, I'm sorry, you prefer just Rose don't you?\" the voice laughed, though not in a malevolent manner as its owner clarified, \"I'm in control of it. And what a body it is that you've fashioned for yourself if I might add!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's of no surprise to either of them that this voice sounded as though it belonged to a female. However, Rose was genuinely puzzled as to how this voice knew her name and could control her every movement like a puppet on a string. \"S-show yourself, whoever you are!\" she demanded, trying to sound brave despite her terror. Matt was beginning to suspect just who the voice was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an almost blinding light. A huge silhouette descended from the heavens, complete with a large cross-like shape behind her back. The light faded, revealing a coat of white and grey through her face to behind her head. Her feet, fingertips, and cross on her back gleamed gold. Finally, her red eyes with green sclera opened. \"Do I know how to make an entrance or what? As I'm sure you've concluded, I'm Arceus.\" she announced, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt had certainly heard of Arceus. But didn't one need to play an Azure Flute to summon her? And no tale mentioned her beauty. 150 feet tall, slim, toned, and voluptuous. Her gown flowed as though comprised of light, and she wore a necklace holding her various Plates that would take him both hands just to lift even one. \"W-what do you mean by 'fashioned for myself'?\" Rose asked, unsure if she should be averting her gaze or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this not what you wished for? To be bigger?\" was Arceus' response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah, I did wish to be bigger, but I think I made a mistake in wishing it...\" Rose admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what would you know of Rose's wish, Arceus? Er, n-no offense...\" Matt questioned carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus giggled lightly and answered, \"<i>I</i> granted it, Matt. Most wishes go through me when they're made, but are rarely granted. I found Rose's wish to be an intriguing one, so I granted it to her.\" she then informed Rose, \"A mistake? Oh no, I'm well aware of what you meant when you were making the wish. But if it's intriguing enough to get me off ye olde galactic couch and grant it, why not go all the way with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you mean...my growth will never s-stop?\" Rose asked, mostly in fear yet also with a hint of arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug of her shoulders, Arceus responded, \"Only if you want... I meant I granted you the ability to change your size at will. As a bonus, your senses can be adjusted in the same manner. Including...<i>certain</i> ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the catch? Couldn't you just summon us to the Hall of Origin for this?\" Matt inquired, scarcely believing Arceus of all beings would appear before them personally without some sort of string attached.</span></div></div>",

Satisfying yourself on the pain and anguish of the innocents?\" the eevee said with a tone of disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should try sometime, it's so much easier than helping them, besides, they can make more of themselves pretty quick.\" the Vulpix smiled wickedly, her hand piercing a nearby building from pressing her fingers on the surface. she swept her arm down, causing the building to collapse inward, a cloud of dust up to their knee billowed outward into the street and throughout the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt watched from the top of the building the gargantuan Eevee had placed him. He was quite captivated with her sturdy hour-glass figure, her mane of hair covering the top of her torso in in all directions. Matt's eyes focused more on her closest feature, her small, solid behind, and her single bushy tail sweeping back and forth in anticipation for this fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you spend all your time endulging yourself, you'll get fat, and then people could walk to get away from you...fat ass.\" The Eevee said with a smug smile. The hairs on the Vulpix's tail quivered with rage. \"Eat this you Bitch!!!\" she reared her head back taking a deep breath then threw herself forward, letting loose a wave of fire that swept down the street, melting the face of the buildings along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's nearly shit himself as his all-consuming flaming death approached at an unavoidalbe speed. But the Eevee centered herself with the flames and flew forward, a wall of water forming around her as she hurtled through the flames, making mostly harmless steam. The Vulpix realized only too late what was going on and wasn't able to cancel her attack before getting cracked in the face by her much more experienced opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell?! You're not a Water-type!\" the Vulpix said indignently as she pulled herself out of the wreckage of some crushed skyscrapers. \"It's called Waterfall, It's just a rushing tackle with the added benefit of being a water attack.\" the Eevee replied, cracking her knuckles, \"So, you want some more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vulpix hesitated, then finally, admitting defeat, \"Fine, I'll leave, but I'll make you pay someday.\" she said, making a note of stomping every stepped, and walking right into buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eevee turned away.</span></div></div>",

You had earned quite a reputation as a trainer heading to the most remote and dangerous places looking for strong pokemon. Finally an old man told you about a place where the world's strongest fire types lived named flame valley and that within flame valley there was an ninetails that had apparently taken on the whole valley at once and won. Needless to say you convinced the old man to give you a map to the place. After 3 days of walking you came to a cliff face and looked down, you couldn't see the bottom of the cliff face. You pull out a rope and set up an anchor before starting to scale down it took you so long to lower yourself it was late afternoon by the time you saw what you presume is a bottom. You climb down the last hundred or feet and land on a patch of patch of grass unlike any you felt before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grass was beige colored and as you looked in one direction you saw 2 hills while in the other the grass seemed to just drop off. You walk toward the hills and the ground seemed to move as you stepped, up down up down, although you told yourself that you're just tired from the long trek down. You reach the 2 hills and notice that they're twice you're size so maybe 12 feet tall at max. You look around and seeing no better spot as this as it was protected from the wind except for the wind coming from right in front of you, you lay out you're sleeping bag in the furrow between the 2. You quickly get snuggled up in you're sleeping bag and fall asleep vowing to find and catch this undefeatable ninetails. You wake up very early and sit up, you were kind of confused as you still felt the same slight wind you felt last night. Paying it no heed you don't look behind (where her face is) and you quickly get packed up. Yoou walk forward and head right jumping off the field of beige grass you land on the ground a few feet below. The sudden change in geography confuses you and you run up a nearby hill to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god\" you say. Looking down you notice that the \"field\" you had been walking and sleeping on was the body of a gigantic anthro ninetails. \"This just got a lot harder\" you think, searching through you're backpack you find you're pokeballs but only a few were made to catch anthro pokemon and they weren't designed to catch something this big. You freeze as the ninetails in front of you yawns and stretches upwards, she turns over and stares directly at you and you're bag full of pokeballs.</span></div></div>",

All you had brought was you're strongest water-type, a vaporeon you nicknamed valerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Valerie\" you yell throwing the pokeball, Valerie appears in a flash of light and looks up at the giant anthro ninetails.

You call Valerie back as she closes her eyes and starts counting you look around and quickly figure out the best place to hide is on the ninetails herself since she didn't notice you before. You run forward and sit on the ninetail's massive furry foot, she doesn't even react as you grab on. She quickly starts searching after she counts to 10 not wanting to lose, she pushes trees over, she looks around the cliff and even dunks her head in a nearby lake.

She places you down in her palm and licks you once before nuzzling against you with the side of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what are you doing?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking care of my new trainer, all of the other trainers I met ran away when they saw me, I didn't even get to play. Not only did you play with me but you beat me, so i'll be you're pokemon\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way is it that easy, there's gotta be a catch\" you say wary since she was a fox pokemon. She looks past you into you're pack and asks, \"what's that ribbon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was gonna put it on the undefeated ninetails if it was a girl, I thought it would be cute\" you say blushing. She picks it up and instantly it starts growing, it grows to her size and she wraps it around her neck. \"Well how's it look?\" she asks lifting you close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks great, but how'd you do that\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can grow a few inanimate objects to my size a day, how do you think I eat?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah good point\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts you up and this time gives you a kiss covering you're whole body with her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh you're just so cute, i'm so glad I got you as a trainer\" she squeals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm glad you decided to be my pokemon\" you say, \"although how are we gonna get out of here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's very simple\" she says, she lowers her hand to between her breasts and holds it there, you feel her start climbing the cliff. After 20 minutes you feel her stop moving up and instead you feel her sitting down. She lays down on her back and lifts her hand checking on you, \"oh good you are ok\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing kind of shy you say \"um aren't you embarrased holding me that close?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I be embarrased, you're my trainer all you want to do is take care of me right?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, although a few things are gonna be a bit difficult\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh like what?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well housing and bathing, you'll probably say you're fine with sleeping outside and bathing in a river, but I take better care of my pokemon then that\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww you're sweet as well as cute\" she says snuggling against you. She stands up holding you in her palm and asks \"so which way is you're house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just head straight\" you reply. She starts walking and you say \"you sure are an affectionate ninetails\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i've been lonely for a while, most pokemon just want to fight me and as I told you all the trainers just run from me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm kind of glad no one tried to catch you before now since I got to meet you\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, hey you'll play with me when we get to you're house right?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try, the field behind my house isn't nearly as large as the valley\" you say. She walks for an hour or 2 you weren't sure of the time, you chatted the whole time. You learned that the whole cursed tail thing did affect her but she could allow individuals to touch them. You look ahead and see you're house, \"hey my house is right up ahead\" you say. She lowers her hand to the ground and bends over as you walk into the house, she peers in through a window and you smile. You grab a steak out of the fridge and throw it to onto her palm \"here I thought you'd be a little hungry\" you say. The steak grows to her size and she digs in, you admit you were kind of apprehensive seeing her bite into the steak and rip off parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i'm sorry did you want some?\" she asks, \"Nah i'm good, that steak is for you anyways\" you say. You were actually pretty suprised that no one had noticed the 2 of you enter the city limits, guess it had to be a slow day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you said you're name was Kitnia, mind if I shorten that to Kit or Nia?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go with Nia\" she says tearing into the steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Nia, you said you wanted to play, play what?\" you ask. She quickly finishes off the steak and she just smiles down at you, \"well I think we can start with pet the ninetails\" she says laying out. You walk over and climb onto her back starting to rub and pet her as best as you can. You really aren't sure you're doing anything when you hear her give a sigh and say \"thanks matt, that feels so good I haven't been petted in a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime Nia\" you reply, you move forward and you start scratching under her ears when she gives off a small moan that you just barely heard. \"Did you just moan?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not\" she says  You rub the same spot under her ears harder this time and you hear her breath catch. You slow the rubbing down and say \"Nia i'm gonna be able to do this as long as it takes, so just tell me if it feels good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets out an audible moan this time and says \"Matt that feels wonderful, it's like i'm in heaven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then i'll be sure to pay special attention there\" you say, you start rubbing the rest of her body which takes a whiel and stop when you're on her hind quarters. \"Um....am I allowed to touch there?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're gentle, of course you are\" she replies, you start gently rubbing her left cheek and she sighs, her tails wagging back and forth in a lazy motion. \"This feels so wonderful Matt\" she says, you hear her breathing start to pace itself out and you stop. You jump off her butt and run to her front and see that she had fallen asleep, \"Aww well aren't you just a big cutie\" you say. As if in response she reaches forward and wraps a paw around you and hugs you to her chest like a teddy bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad.....trainer....cutie\" you hear her mumble in her sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is as good a place as any to take a little nap\" you think laying back. You quickly fall asleep due to the warmth and comfort and wake up about half an hour later with her staring down at you. \"Have a good rest, I can't believe you stopped petting me\" she says kind of pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you fell asleep\" you reply, \"besides you just looked so cute while sleeping and you were the one who held me so that I couldn't move.\" You get up and head back to work finishing the pet/rub you were giving her in a half and hour and she sits up after you jump off and says \"thank you Matt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\" you reply, \"although we should probably introduce you to the town\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think we should let the whole town know through a ceremony, wait here\" you say. You run into the house and grab a bike, you ride into the city which takes 10 minutes and you dismount at the townhall. You run in and find the mayor sitting behind his desk, \"Oh Matt, you're back are you, what rare powerful pokemon do you have to show off this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have with me the undefeated ninetails of flame valley\" you reply, the mayor looks at you in shock which suprised you, \"you mean the one that the old man down at the tavern talks about?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one and only\" you reply, he picks up a phone and within minutes there was a camera crew at the mayor's office and a girl interviewing you. \"So can we see this undefeated ninetails?\" she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure i'll just go get her, forgot her at home in the excitement\" you say, \"have everyone wait in the town square\" you say riding off. You had everyone wait in the town square becuase you knew main street was one long straight line. You get back and Nia's standing there \"well?\" she asks as you ride up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's set up\" you say, \"try to hide behind some buildings till I whistle ok?\" you say, wanting to admittedly scare a few of the people who doubted you. You heard Nia following you the whole way but you knew she could use one of the larger buildings to hide behind, and that no one would really be paying attention to the end of main street. You ride into town square and there's a podium set up, you jump off you're bike and walk up to it. The mayor addresses everyone saying \"It seems that our resident extreme battler and trainer Matt has caught the ninetails of flame valley, looks like old man Johnson from the tavern isn't crazy after all.\" This gets a few chuckles and he turns to you and says \"so will you show us this ninetails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly\" you reply, you walk up to the mic and give off an ear-splitting whistle, people look around in shock and then in slight alarm as the ground starts shaking. A little girl yells \"look what's coming up main street.\" Everyone except you turns and stands in shock as Nia walks up main street giving off a small tremor with every step. She stops in front of the crowd smiling and you say \"Everyone I want you to meet the undeafted nintails of flame valley, her name's Nia.\" Nia bends over into a hunting pose and you admittedly were a little scared as you weren't sure how wild she really was, she leans over heading directly for a little girl in the crowd. The girl screams and you're about to yell \"NO\" when she licks the little girl with the very tip of her tongue. The little girl turns around and smiles and Nia licks her again this time with her whole tongue. \"Nia you have anything to say?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's preposterous pokemon can't talk\" the mayor yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says who\" Nia says sitting up, the crowd just stands there dumbfounded before you ask \"so does anyone have any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um she's not dangerous is she?\" one woman asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I really don't think so, probably if you try to hurt her or her trainer she will get dangerous though\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we supposed to feed something that big\" a man asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have that covered so don't worry about it\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we use her as a tourist attraction\" the mayor asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually that's what I was going to ask, it would probably take a lot of man-hours and she and I would help of course but I was thinking of building an appropriate sized gym near my house with an adjoining house of it's own and petitioning the pokemon league to have a special 9th badge created\" you say. \"Although if Nia doesn't want to do it then we won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine with helping in whatever way I can\" Nia says. The whole crowd cheers and preparations are started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 week later a long black car rolled up in front of you're house, out of the car walk 2 people one you recognized as the head of the pokemon league and the other as a highly respected pokemon proffessor. The head of the league a man with a really rugged look walks up and says \"I'm vincent, so where is this undefeated ninetails i've heard of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she's out back\" you say, you walk around the house and Vincent stops dead in his tracks as soon as he sees Nia. \"Nia you're challenger is here\" you yell, she turns and looks down.smiling at the man next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's get this started\" Vincent says, he throws out 6 pokeballs and to you're suprise calls out the 3 regis as well as a charizard, a slamence and a dragonite. However the battle wasn't even much to talk about even though Vincent's pokemon did have the will to fight all Nia needed to do was flick them and they'd go flying most of the time running into a tree or a rock and getting knocked out. You estimate the match lasted a little more then a minute and after the last pokemon had been returned to it's ball Vincent looks over at you and says \"kid I have no idea how you got that ninetails to listen to you but you have you're badge and funding.\" The pokemon professor walks up and studies Nia although she had been hit by a few very powerful hyperbeams and a few flamethrowers there seemed to be no damage to her what so ever. The proffessor is just about to touch her when you run up and grab his hand \"what are you doing?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm examining her\" he replies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not without asking her first you're not\" you reply. He looks at you like are you freaking insane it's a pokemon, but he turns and says \"Nia may I examine you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course just nowhere too private\" she replies. You laugh out loud at the face the professor had when he heard her talk and he begins to examine her finishing in a half an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well on behalf of the pokemon league committee, I just want to say congratulations, and that is one tough ninetails\" Vincent says before getting into the car and driving away. The next few weeks were pretty noisy as the day after Vincent showed up a whole team of workers and machamp showed up to start constructing the gym and house. Nia insisted that now that the field was too noisy she needed to be closer to you so she slept curled up around you're house. So you always woke up to the sight of a giant ninetails eye looking in the window and she always gave you a lick when you came out the door. You took \"walks\" through the town trying to get Nia used to being near people, you always biked right beside her and made sure she didn't hurt anybody or destroy anthing. Within time the residents started to get used to her, some of the neighborhood kids even stated idolizing you. One night you were going to sleep and Nia looks in and gives off a small whining sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" you ask looking out the window. She motions for you to come outside which you do and when you do you're knocked off you're feet by one of her tails and pulled closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm lonely, and I want you to sleep with me\" Nia says smiling as she pulls you closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have just told me\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this way's more fun\" she replies smiling. She wraps you up in her tails and smiles \"so Matt do you think i'm comfy?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you are, you're so soft and fluffy\" you reply snuggling into the tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey matt what will you do if I ever lose?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, you'll still be my pokemon and i'll still take care of you\" you say. \"Besides it's not like I wasn't extremely lucky to meet such a beautiful ninetails in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you sweet talker\" Nia replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nia, you know I love you right?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Matt\" she replies \"just like any other pokemon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I mean more than that\" you say hiding in her tails. She unwraps her tails and leans forward staring down at you, \"say that one more time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you and it's as more then just a pokemon and trainer\" you say. You're pushed back forcibly into her tails as she kisses you with all her might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Matt\" she says lifting her muzzle up a bit \"i've just been thinking that for a while and I wasn't sure if you felt the same way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I feel the same way\" you say getting up and giving her a kiss on her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now you're definitley sleeping with me tonight\" Nia says. Her tails wrap around you again softly yet snugly and she curls her whole body around her tails. You wriggle out of her tails and walk over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nia do you mind if I choose where to sleep?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, where do you want to sleep?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou point to between her breasts and say \"there, actually I slept there the first night I was in flame valley but I didn't know I was sleeping on you\" you say quickly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh getting a head start on me?\" she says playfully, \"of course you can sleep ther, but you owe me an ear scratch tomorrow\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal\" you say, she turns onto her stomach and snuggles you in between her breasts. Her tails droop over her body covering you and her like a blanket, \"good night Matt\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Nia\" you reply.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up slowly, it takes you a second to remember where you are and you just snuggle back into the fur underneath you when you do remember. You feel a warm breath wash over you and you look up and see Nia staring down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Matt, have a good sleep?\" Nia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful, the bed was very warm and comfy\" you reply smiling. You slowly start to get up saying \"well today's the day they said the gym would be finished might as well go check.\" You're pushed back down with one finger and Nia says \"well it's not like the house is going anywhere, you can stay with me a little longer can't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can\" you reply, you push her finger off and get up, she stares at you curious as you walk over her body, around her neck and climb up onto her head. You lay down and ask \"so which ear do you want scratched first right or left.\" You were pretty sure she was smiling and she said \"left,\" you get to work and she slowly turns over so she's laying on her stomach. You gauged how happy you're scratching was making her by the movement of her tails, when she was really happy they wagged side to side like a dog, it was pretty funny to watch. You scratch her left ear for 5 minutes then switch to her right, finally you stop and and sit down, not long after Nia starts making a whining noise and starts slowly turning from one side to the other. \"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you stop, that felt so good\" Nia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Nia, but if I don't stop i'll never be able to, besides I still need to go check on the gym\" you say starting to climb down. she turns over quickly knocking you up in the air and you land on you're ass on her left breast. \"You aren't going anywhere Matt, I still want to play a little\" Nia says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later\" you reply standing up, you jump off and say \"oh and can you never do that again really freaked me out\" you say. You grab you're bike and ride for the minute it took you to get to the gym, the place was absolutely gigantic since it had to be an ample battlefield for Nia to move around in, the battle floor was probably the size of most metroplolitan areas. The house standing next to the gym was a quite lavish 2-story hosue. The place was to say the least epic in size since everything was fit for Nia, you susptect the gym along with the house put the government back a lot thankfully the pokemon helped cover labour costs. The head foreman a man named Bill walked up to you as you dismounted the bike. \"Good morning, come to see the finished project have we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I have actually\" you say. You're given the grand tour and the place was nothing short of spectacular, the whole place was set up so that you and Nia could live there together. There were a bunch of ladders everywhere including on the arms of of the couch so that you could move around the place even without Nia's help. You were shown the main floor with it's modern kitchen, the living room with a couch and love seat and where they had somehow made a flatscreen fit for Nia's size and the main floor bathroom. As you're heading upstairs you ask Bill \"What's with the stove and other cooking utensils?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well ever since you told us about that whole grow thing we thought she might one day like to cook for you\" he replies. He leads you up the ladders attached to each step and you're on the top floor. You look around and there's only 2 doors, \"bathroom and master bedroom\" Bill says as if reading you're mind. He leads you into the bathroom where he leads you up another ladder and shows you the shower stall set up for you in one of the tiles on the wall, \"although you can take a shower with her if you want\" Bill says laughing. All you do is blush which causes him to laugh even harder and he leads you down the ladder. He leads you into the master bedroom and you were in awe just at the sheer size of the bed, he leads you up and shows you around even though there wasn't that much to see other then the bad and the collosal lamp on the equally sized night table. You follow him out of the hosue and he offers a hand saying \"it's been a pleasure doing buisness with you, you may not know it but you and that ninetails just pulled everyone out of an economic downturn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, it was that big\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this was the biggest project i've heard of in the history of well everything\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you have my thanks\" you say as the ground starts to shake \"and I think someone else is coming to say hi.\" You watch Bill turn around and the shock on his face as he sees Nia she bends over and asks \"Matt who's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Bill the head foreman, he made sure this place got built\" you reply, \"come on Bill say hi to you're client.\" He just stands there dumbstruck before babbling out \"um...hi\" Nia smiles and he blurts out \"don't eat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now I might be a carnivore but I don't eat people\" Nia says she leans over and licks Bill from head to toe \"although you do taste really good.\" she says. Bill turns deathly white and you say \"hey Nia he was nice enough to get the place built don't give him a heart attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Mr.foreman, thanks for building my house\" she says tapping Bill on the hard hat with one finger. \"Bill it's alright, she's very nice, I mean I wouldn't be here right now if she was capable of any real harm.\" you say trying to calm him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but I can't really trust something that big and dangerous\" Bill says backing up. Nia moves back and you can see that she's hurt by the comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bill take that back\" you say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way man\" Bill says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, hey Nia open up\" you say. She lowers her head to the ground and opens her mouth you proceed to walk inside and sit down on her tongue as she closes her mouth. She raises her head up and holts it there for a minute before she places it back on the ground letting you walk out. Bill just stands there stunned, before saying \"ok well maybe she isn't dangerous to you but to everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine go up and give her a pet, but make sure to ask first\" you say to Bill. He hesitantly walks forward and asks \"may I pet you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead\" Nia says laying down, Bill starts petting her and he quickly warms up to it. Soon the whole construction team was petting her and you had to sit on her muzzle and stare her in the face and remind her every so often not to move to keep her from moving and maybe hurting someone. Finally after an hour Bill moves and pulls out a whistle which he blows into signalling the end of the day. You tackle him as Nia's paw slashes through the air right where you were standing, you look up at her and say  \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt it's best if you get away right now\" she replies, and you can see something starting to happen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Bill asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take you're men and go, thanks for the work\" you reply still staring up at the giant ninetails. You hear engines start as the remaining workers quickly drive away and that's when you see the flash in Nia's eyes. She bends down staring at you but not like normal there's a primalness in her eyes, she moves forward until she's breathing on you but you just stand there staring her eye to eye. She leans forward and gives you a lick, seeming to like you're taste or something she licks you again, all the while you just stand there till she picks you up by you're shirt like a mother cat. She walks into the house on all fours, climbs upstairs and jumps onto the bed placing you down gently. She curls up around you and even pushes you to one of her breasts, she keeps pushing you against it like she wanted you to suck it or something so you finally grabbed it and rubbed it a bit which seemed to satisfy her. She then falls asleep, you just sit there till she wakes up an hour later and she bolts up in confusion, she looks around in panic not noticing you and her eyes start to fill with tears. She buries her head into her paws \"I killed him\" she starts crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Killed who? me? because i'm pretty sure i'm still alive\" you say. She looks down finally noticing you and a giant smile breaks over her face \"you're ok, you're\" she says hugging you firmly to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah why wouldn't I be?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whenever I hear high pitched noises like a whistle I go kind of feral\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feral, so is that why you treated me like a cub, you even tried to have me drink some milk\" you say. She flares red and hides her head in her tails, she turns away and gently pushes you away with one paw. You climb up her back and push her tails out of the way and lay down on her head, \"Nia it's not a big deal, yeah it's kind of embarassing but I won't hold it against you\" you say reaching over and giving her right ear a stroke. She leans forward and you fall off her head landing in her lap, you look up and she's.....</span></div></div>",

She slowly lifts herself up and says \"well you can start by giving my right breast a rub and go from there.\" You stand up and start rubbing the soft flesh causing Nia to give off a moan, she stifles herself as you rub harder and after a minute she pushes you to the side and collapses on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that felt amazing\" she says. She sits up and says \"Matt is there anything I can do to return the favour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this house has a kitchen made especially for you, so if you don't mind making dinner that would be nice\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure but I was gonna do that anyways, is there anything else I can do\" Nia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I can't think of anything, if you're happy then i'm happy Nia\" you say. She pulls you in front of her then leans over and kisses you trapping you between her and the bed. \"Well aren't you just a little gentleman\" she says before she lays out on top of you again. She lets her weight go, and her breasts compact around you making escape impossible. \"I do know a few things about what boys like\" she says smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Nia get off\" you say blushing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're stuck in my warmth, in fact I think i'll carry you in there from now on\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I mind, but why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's our first step to becoming lovers, it's easier to protect you when you're close like this, and you just look so cute snuggled in my chest\" Nia says giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nia let me out already or else\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else what, sorry Matt but you don't really have any leverage\" Nia replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" you say, you reach over and start rubbing as much of Nia's chest as you can reach. A blissful look spreads over her face and she lays her head down, \"ohhh that feels so wonderful Matt, don't stop.\" After she says this you stop and her head snaps up \"hey why'd you stop\" she asks looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the leverage I have\" you say starting to rub again, she lays out again and starts giving off a contented growling sound. \"Are you going to let me go now as long as I keep rubbing?\" you say, she slowly gets up and you stand up before she turns onto her back. You climb up and sit down and continue rubbing, \"so are you going to be a good girl and listen to me more?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you keep giving me pets and rubs like this of course\" Nia replies sighing in bliss. You rub for a few more minutes before stopping and she snuggles against you, before placing you behind her head, \"my ears feel a little neglected now\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course, geez I spoil you\" you say rubbing her ears for a good 10 minutes. Nia finally sits up and picks you up off her head, \"so ready for dinner?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i'm starving, taking care of you is hard work\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a delicate flower, so I need a lot of attention\" Nia replies. \"Sure whatever\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true\" Nia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nia I saw you get hit by hyperbeams that would topple buildings, sorry but a delicate flower you are not\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph well for that comment you can just walk yourself downstairs\" Nia says placing you down on the bed and getting up. She walks out the bedroom door and you start scrambling down the ladder. She had already reached the stairs by the time you got through the bedroom door and you ran after her. You get down the stairs in 5 minutes and you race into the kitchen finding her cooking a steak. You climb up onto the kitchen table and sit down at you're place, she places a plate in front of you as she places the steak down in front of her. She tears into the steak and removes a piece which she drops onto you're plate. You eat in silence as you're little exchange before coming down had left some tension. You both sit there eating before saying \"Nia, why'd you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said I wasn't a delicate flower\" Nia says pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not, you're a thousand foot tall ninetails that probably has maybe 1 or 2 equals in the whole world\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you could have said I was a delicate flower, girls like it when the ones they like compliment them\" Nia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Nia, you'll never be a delicate flower, in my eyes you're a great roaring flame, fiery and dangerous yes but at the same time warm and gentle\" you say. You see a smile spread across Nia's face and a single tear rolls down her cheek. She leans over and just stares at you for a second before scooping you up in her paw and cuddling you against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much Matt, I don't know how such a big dummy like me was lucky enough to meet you\" Nia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you're not a big dummy, you're my precious ninetails and I love you\" you say grinning. She places you back down and you quickly finish eating, you spend the next ten minutes just talking and joking although all Nia's jokes were about how small you were. Finally you get fed up and say \"yeah well you're so big when you shoot a flamethrower it's like a volcano's erupting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that's a low blow\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, Mrs joke about other people's size\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait did you just say Mrs?\" Nia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah why?\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shouldn't you be calling me Ms\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here and i'll show you why I called you that\" you say. You climb down the ladder and run out the door, you cycle home and you grab the box underneath you're bed. You carry it on you're back, back to Nia's house and run in. You find her standing in the entrance way waiting and she picks you up \"so what's in the box?\" she asks. \"It's for you so why don't you open it\" you say.  She opens it and takes out the small gold ring which just fit her as she slipped it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry it's not really flashy or has a stone this was the best I could afford\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it mean?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means 1 thing, I want you to be my partner, not only in battle but in life, Nia will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down at you shocked \"Really? you want me as you're wife, I mean once people know about me you can have any woman you want\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, I fell for you the moment you decided to become my pokemon\" you say.</span></div></div>",

She starts crying but just keeps staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nia are you ok?\" you ask concerned. She nods and walks outside she places you down on the grass before tilting her head back and letting loose a massive flamethrower. You duck as the flame was so hot you felt it where you were and she holds the flame for a good 30 seconds. She stops and smiles down at you, \"Ok seriously Nia are you ok? if the answers no you can just tell me\" you say. She leans over with a smile on her muzzle and licks you, you can feel the heat on her tongue and she opens her mouth again and you see flame collect at the back of her throat. \"Great she's gone insane and i'm gonna die\" you think as the flame shoots out around you, she moves around you using flamethrower and finally after a minute she stops. You look around confused, seeing nothing but scorched earth you look at her confused and admittedly a little scared. She lowers a hand and you grab on she stands up and you notice that the scorched earth you were standing on spelled a message. \"Matt i'll be you're bride now turn around\" the message says, you turn toward her and are pushed backwards as she kisses you with all she can muster. You kiss her back once you realize what's happening and she holds you like that for a good 5 minutes finally she gently releases the kiss and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you said yes but was all that really necesscary?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, look behind you\" Nia says. The whole town was standing there drawn by you assume the giant jet of flame and then the smell of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt, what's going on here?\" the mayor says walking forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....Is the church free over the weekend?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but what does that have to do with all this?\" the mayor asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I confessed to Nia and all that ruckus was her saying yes in a really roundabout way. So in short, you're all invited to our wedding on saturday\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone is quiet until Tom who was the town's pokemon professor walks forward and says while smiling \"about damn time you 2 got together.\" Instantly the crowd erupts into cheers, you look at Nia and she has the biggest smile possible plastered all over her face. You spend the next half hour shaking people's hands and having the guys congratulate you. The women of the town lead Nia away and the guys lead you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what's going on?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, the girls just need to learn what kind of dress Nia will want and we need to plan you're stag party\" Tom says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd really rather not have one actually, I don't want Nia getting mad at me now that she said yes\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry we won't plan anything too bad, it'll be on thursday that way you can get wasted with the guys and it won't affect you're wedding\" Tom says smiling. You believe him but little did you know what he had prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Thursday night<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the town's local bar and head for the room with the banner \"Matt's stag party\" over it. You open the door and gasp at what you saw, they had rented out the whole place so you knew there'd be a lot of people but there were a lot more people than you expected. Tim walks up and shakes you're hand \"welcome to you're stag man,\" \"the buffet and beer is over there\" he says indicating a table and the entertainment will arrive in a few minutes. You walk over to the refreshment table and grab a few things, not wanting to get drunk even though it was you're stag you grab a can of coca-cola instead of one of the probable 20 different kinds of alcohol. You sit on a chair and have most of the guys in town come up and shake you're hand and congratulate you. Strangely enough they were all grinning like they were in on some big joke, after 5 minutes the lights turn off and you hear tom's voice on a loudspeaker. \"Ok boys are you ready for the entertainment?\" You hear hooting and hollering from all around you and the lights turn back on. Standing on stage are 5 anthromorphic ninetails but they ranged from 20 to 50ft tall and the tallest was holding a microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi i'm Flame and these fine young ladies are my associates, we're here to turn you're night from cold and lonely, to hot and full of passion\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare angrily at tom, \"what the hell Tom, I told you nothing that could get me in trouble\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Matt, you've spent so long looking for the strongest pokemon can't you just live a little for once.\" Tom says putting his arm around you're shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I can't\" you say shrugging him off \"i'm heading home, everyone else can enjoy this but not me\" you say heading towards the door. You're grabbed by 2 men and Tom says \"Matt these girls aren't cheap, the least you could do is go and say hi\" he says. The rest of the guys encircle you and you're carried up to the stage \"hey this is Matt he's the one the party is for but he's kinda having cold feet\" Tom says to Flame. The 2 guys carrying you throw you up on stage \"take care Matt, you get Flame all to yourself\" he says as the stage actually starts to rotate. You find yourself in another room and Flame offers you a hand \"so is this you're first time?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I really should be going, don't worry i'll make sure they pay you\" you say taking her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but you haven't even tried me yet, besides I bet you're wife won't mind even if she's a pokemon\" Flame says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ever heard of flame valley? my wife's a ninetails from there\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was born there, maybe she's an acquiantance\" Flame says. You move back and say \"let me rephrase that, my wife is the ninetails of flame valley, you know 1,000 feet tall, undefeated, that ninetails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlame's fur goes from beige to white and she steps back \"Kitnia's my sister, I heard she left but you're the guy she met\" Flame says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're Nia's sister well then I definitley can't do this\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods but says \"But you're my first client, my boss will fire me if I don't do atleast something with you.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach into you're pocket and pull out you're house keys, you throw them to her and say \"here, i'll be living with Nia from now on so you can have my house, all the bills have been paid off for the rest of my life, heck I even get free groceries delivered to my door every week.\" Flame just stands there stunned \"you're giving me you're house?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but i'm gonna need like half the groceries when they show up\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you do that, even though i'm her sister I just tried to have sex with you\" Flame says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that doesn't matter, besides in a few days you'll be my sister in law, oh and you can invite those other girls to live with you too\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bows and says \"I'll never forget this, my name's Nadia by the way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to meet you Nadia, now if you'll excuse me\" you exit the room and pull out a cellphone. You call the phone in Nia's house and to you're suprise she picks up, you explain everything to her and close the phone before entering the room where the other guests are. You find the other guys had cornered the 4 ninetails and you were glad you called Nia. You walk up to Tom and say \"hey Tom thanks for the present,\" \"Oh no problem\" he replies before you punch him in the face knocking him out. \"Thanks for showing me how much of a bastard you are Tom\" you say. \"This party is over, everyone back away from the ninetails or else this gets violent\" you yell. Everyone does leave the ninetails alone but they form a semi-circle around you, \"What are you going to do about it\" one of the guys says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3,2,1\" you think, \"nothing she is\" you say pointing up as you hear the sound of beams cracking and Nia rips the top off the bar and looks in. \"Now as I was saying anyone who wants to try anything can go ahead\" you say smiling. The guys quickly scatter and you see the 4 ninetails run over to Nadia, Nia picks you up with 2 fingers and looks at you somewhat angrily but her expression quickly softens. She moves you closer to her muzzle and kisses you \"thank you Matt\" she says smiling, she looks down at the 5 ninetails and asks \"are you all ok?\" They nod and you smile, \"um extended family?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're my sisters\" Nia says smiling, \"you didn't think there was only one bigger then normal ninetails did you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes I did\" you reply, Nia lowers her hand to the 5 other ninetails and they climb on. She walks home and puts her hand on the ground and they along with you dismount, \"Matt I want you to meet my sisters Nadia, July, Janice, Elaine, and Nicole\" she says. Each ninetails bow in turn, Nia touches you're house and to you're amazment it starts growing right in front of you till it's a fit size for Nia's sisters. She reaches in and somehow is able to touch the bed, couch and fridge increasing them to ample proportions as well. She sits back and sighs \"phew that takes a lot out of a girl.\"</span></div></div>",

All 5 of them run up and hug a different part of Nia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww that's a nice family moment\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything we can do to show our appreciation Matt?\" Nadia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come to our wedding as my personal guests\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we couldn't we've already caused you enough trouble\" Janice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no trouble Sis, what's a wedding if none of my family is there\" Nia says. The 5 ninetails enter you're newly enlarged house you were sure to explore and get some rest and Nia picks you up and puts you down on her shoulder before heading to her house. You yawn and lay down on her shoulder, \"man we're gonna have a heck of a time tomorrow\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" Nia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not only do we need to get you're sisters dresses but I kind of knocked Tom out\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh why'd you do that?\" Nia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he was the one who set up the whole party, and even though he's a pokemon professor he wasn't really trying to stop any of the patrons who were trying to touch you're sisters\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good thing you were there then\" Nia says happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess so\" you reply. Nia enters her house and heads upstairs, she puts you down on the bed and lays down herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I so sleepy?\" you say getting up, you run around the bed for a bit trying to wake yourself up it wasn't even that late about 10:00pm and you've stayed up for 2 days straight and not felt tired while looking for pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe because you're eager to get into bed\" Nia says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe\" you say smiling, but you still try to stay up moving around the bed. You feel Nia's tails wrap around you and you're lifted off you're feet and she holds you in front of her face. \"Come on darling it's time to settle down and go to bed\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to settle down, this is honestly bugging me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well too bad becuase I want to sleep, so you're going to bed wether you like it or not\" Nia says. She gives you a kiss before putting you down and laying down over top of you trapping you underneath her chest, \"good night Matt\" Nia says as she lays her head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Nia\" you say. You fall asleep quickly as it was very warm and comfy where you were, you're sleep was peaceful, all you're dreams ended with you happily married with Nia. You wake up early and you look up to see Nia still sleeping. You're just able to slip out from between the squished hills surrounding you and you smile. \"She's so cute while sleeping\" you think happily. You climb up onto her head gently scratch her ear, \"get up Nia it's only one day till you're my wife\" you whisper into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, more more\" she says laying out so you could have full access to her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine you spoiled ninetails\" you say rubinng her ears with all you've got. You feel a slight breeze start up as her tails were wagging back and forth so quickly. You stop after a few minutes and Nia starts making a whining sound \"moorreee\" she whines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you need to get up already\" you say into her ear. You slide down her back as she lifts her head and yawns, jumping off just when she raises her back and stretches. She turns and looks at you for a second \"you're a big meanie Matt\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? how am I mean\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're beautiful wife asked something of you and you didn't do it\" Nia says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I kept scratching you're ears you would never have gotten out of bed\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but what's so bad with spending the whole day next to me\" Nia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, but I already spoil you enough\" you say. Nia kisses you pushing you back into the bed and then gently licks you for a few seconds \"and what's wrong with me being a bit spoiled\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing I just can't have you or me getting out of shape I mean i'll be a gym leader once the papers finally get through the dang mail system\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You worry too much\" Nia says moving so she's facing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess\" you say laying out. Nia gently picks you up and cuddles you against her cheek \"well come on trainer it's time to get up\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" you reply. Nia gets up and goes to the bathroom, she places you down on the counter, you undress and enter you're shower. You're just about to turn the water on when you hear a tapping sound, you stick you're head out and you see Nia smiling down at you. \"Yes?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um I was wondering if you'd like to joim me?\" Nia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" you say wrapping a towel around you're waits, Nia stares at you a bit suprised \"really?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah what kind trainer would I be if I didn't take care of my pokemon\" you say smiling. Nia picks you up and puts you down on her shoulder. She steps into her shower and turns it on, you have to hold onto her fur as the water almost knocked you right off. Nia steps out of the stream \"yeah I don't think that will work\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh but I want you to join me\" Nia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of you later\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine but you better do a really good job\" Nia says somewhat peeved. She puts you down on the counter and you enter you're own shower. You hear Nia start singing before you start the stream and you take the towel you were wearing off as it wasn't much use now. You're shower lasts only a few minutes and you dry yourself off and exit the shower. You sit down on a large brush as it was part of the counter that wasn't soaked. Nia reaches out of the shower and starts feeling around, you try to push the brush to her hand and she grabs it. You hear her sing a bit before she shuts off the shower. She moves the curtain \"eeek\" she screams and jumps back a bit as she sees you sitting there waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I a mouse?\" you ask trying to hold the laughter in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you just suprised me I thought you'd still be taking you're shower\" Nia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah that ended a while ago, you're pretty good at singing Nia\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you heard me\" Nia says blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's nothing to be ashamed of I mean you're not the best but I liked it\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Matt, can you help me towel off?\" Nia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should do that yourself, if I was to do it we'd probably be here for a few hours\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point, and then i'd get that wet dog smell and I hate that\" Nia says sticking her tongue out. She quickly towels off and picks you up before heading downstairs. She puts you down on the table. \"Bacon and eggs?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" you reply, you sit there and watch her as she grows the bacon and eggs to her size and then cooks in a pan using her own flamethrower. She places the scrambled eggs and slices of bacon on 2 plates and places them down before sitting down herself. There's not much talk for a bit as you both dig in but you finish before her and she eyes you're plate hungrily. \"Go ahead not like i'm gonna eat it\" you say. She grabs one piece of bacon flips it up and chomps down on it perfectly swallowing it whole, \"ok i'm really not sure if I should find that impressive or terrifying\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww do I unnerve you a bit\" Nia says smiling showing you her whole set of teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really but I can see why that foreman was a bit scared\" you say having complete trust in Nia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm glad\" Nia says as she lowers her muzzle and rubbing against you. You rub her cheek when you hear a knock at the door, Nia picks you up and opens it to find....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Standing there were all 5 of Nia's sisters. They smiled up at her and at you, Nia lowered you to the ground and you jumped onto the ground you smiled and ask\"hey, what are you all doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since you invited us to the wedding, we need dresses\" Nadia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you\" you say without looking back, \"alright well we actually still haven't gotten Nia a dress so let's go\" you say even though you hated clothes shopping. Nia picked you up as well as everyone else all though it was a bit cramped. She ran off towards town and as you entered the city limits you were suprised to hear a police siren. Nia stops and you turn to see deputy Ellie ride up with Tom in the sidecar. Nia lowers you to the ground and you walk up to the officer \"is there a problem?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes professor Tom here claims you beat him up, and you're ninetails damaged a bar\" Ellie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did hit proffesor Tom, but only once, and yes Nia did rip the roof off the bar, but that was to protect her sister's from getting raped\" you say as Nia lowers her sisters to the ground. Ellie stares at you and nod, \"alright why did you hit Proffesor Tom\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wasn't trying to stop the patrons from trying to rape Nia's sisters, so I knocked him out\" you say. Tom starts to protest but the deputy turns on him \"is this true?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes but...\"Tom trails off as Nia lowers her face and growls at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Ms. we'll take care of him, have a good day all\" Ellie says starting the bike and driving off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad that went well\" you say sighing. \"anyways let's get back to what we were doing\" you say. You run in front and Nia and her sisters follow, you enter Janet's boutique which was the only dress store you knew of that offered wedding dresses. You find Janet at the counter \"Hey Janet, can you get me some of you're tallest dresses as well as you're wedding dresses?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh still haven't gotten a dress?\" she asks heading for the back of the stores. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and now I need to get ones for all of Nia's sisters, do you mind if I take them out of the store?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the alternative Nia rips the roof off my store like she did the bar?\" Janet asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She only did that to protect her sisters\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet hands you a bunch of dresses, \"here try these, oh and don't worry I trust ya, you've never done the town wrong before\" Janet says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" you reply. You head out of the store and hand each ninetails a dress, Nadia a red one, July blue, Janice yellow, Elaine black, and Nicole yellow. Each girl starts putting on the dresses while you tentativley hold wedding dresses up and stare at each one then Nia. \"What are you doing?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Picking you're wedding dress\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a guy, you don't have any sense of fashion\" Nia replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but i'm the one who has to see you're beautiful butt in it and I want it to look good\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me those\" Nia says lowering her hand, you hand the dresses over and Nia eyes each one before picking up a more traditional wedding dress. She looks it over once more before handing the rest back to you, \"I pick this one\" Nia says. You turn to see all of Nia's sisters wearing their dresses and each fit mostly perfectly although some of Nia's sisters had more prominent chest areas then were designed for the dress but other then that they were good. You sigh and carry the other dresses into the store and you find Janet smiling \"I trust everyone liked their dresses. \"Yeah i'll take everything except what's in my hands\" you say, you pull out you're wallet and quickly have the dresses paid for. You leave the store as Janet yells \"i'll be in the front row at you're wedding.\" Everyone is waiting with their dresses off, \"so why'd you take me off?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're too restrictive\" Nadia says spinning and then stretching, Nia leans over and whispers \"don't worry Matt i've already made the necesscary adjustments, but do you want to see me in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah i'm fine for right now, besides it'd be kind of weird if you were walking through town in a wedding dress\" you whisper back. Nia blows over you knocking you over, \"hey why'd you do that?\" you ask sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand a girl's heart\" Nia says turning around and you sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine Nia, put it on\" you say and she gives off a small squeal of joy. Nia looks around and quickly finds the tallest building in the area the Sliph research building. Nia runs and hides behind the builing, you just sat there and Nadia walks up and asks \"so how'd you 2 meet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well I heard about her legend from an old man, i'm kind of a battle freak so I went looking for her, once I found her I beat her in a game of hide and seek and she agreed to be my pokemon and then to be mine\" you say a happy look spreading over you're face as you say the end comment. You feel a few vibrations and you all look up to see Nia standing there in the dress. She looked absolutely beautiful, the white billowing dress surrounded her legs and her 9 tails flared out behind her like a setting sun, you looked up to see she even added ear holes to the dress. She leans down and looks right at you \"well...how does it look?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Words can't describe how beautiful you look my precious ninetails\" you reply stunned. Nia blushes furiously before saying \"alright, well the dress is a go, let me go change and i'll take everyone home\" she says. All of Nia's sisters burst out laughing \"Bwahahaha, did you see her, she was so red, she looked like a charmander\" Nicole says. Nadia walks up as she was the only one not laughing she lowers herself to be face to face with you and she says in a very serious tone \"Matt I want you to make me a promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" you reply a bit unnerved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen my sister like that before, you're a very special person, so pleace watch over our sister\" Nadia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you don't need me to promise to do that\" you reply. You feel reverabations a minute later and you turn to see Nia standing there, she holds the dress in one hand and lifts you up to her shoulder with her free hand before grabbing her sisters. Nia walks back to you're house within a minute and drops her sisters off, \"take care of her\" they all shout before Nia turns toward her house and starts running. She reaches the door with you somehow still on her shoulder and she stops before putting you down, she looks down at you and says \"Matt this is the last chance, are you sure you want to marry me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, if I don't well then may Arceus strike me down here and now\" you say. You look around and as there were no lightning bolts hitting you, you smile. \"Nia stop doubting yourself, you're a beautiful ninetails who I love with all my heart\" you say walking up and stroking her. Nia smiles and snuggles you into her chest before entering the house and heading upstairs to put the dress away. You're both shocked when you find Tom standing on the bed, he smiled as and turned as you entered \"so you 2 are home, congratulations you're little goody-goody act cost me my position and a lot of grief, but thankfully I was able to buy my way out of jail\" he says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom what the hell\" you yell but stop as he pulls out a 9mm with a laser sight and lines it up with you're head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, i've been secretly going at it with anthro pokemon for years, even got me a buisness on the side that exploited it, but oh no mister goody two shoes pokemon adventurer had to come and fuck it all up\" Tom says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude since when were you this unstable\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Tom you know is a fasad, this is what I am, you're death\" he says pulling the trigger but you don't feel any pain instead you hear Nia give a yelp. Nia much to you're suprise not only blocks the bullet but lunges forward and you hear Tom gasp in suprise as Nia grabs him and squeezes a bit, he drops the gun and you jump down and stare at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tom you do know I could kill you right now\" you say and much to you're suprise you see Nia nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i'm not going to, that means sinking to you're level, oh and i'm gonna make sure you're jailed in an all anthro prison\" you say. Nia holds Tom while you call the authorities and he's soon hauled off in a squad car and the gun is taken as evidence. Nia looks down to you as you wait and she gives you a lick, \"you're a good man Matt\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I just can't bring myself to kill\" you reply. You look over Nia's palm and you remove the bullet with her whimpering the whole time while you tried to keep her calm..</span></div></div>",

Nia lays out and you sit in her palm, so Nia can I do anything for you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you just kind of saved my life is all\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing\" Nia replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nia come on, i'll do anything\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" she replies a smile forming on her face. \"Well then I want you to be my kit\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until tomorrow you will be my kit\" Nia says smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always wanted to be able to mother something as i'm a bit too big for normal conception, so what do you say?\" Nia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but only until tomorrow\" you say. Nia lifts you up \"aww I love you my little kit\" she says nuzzling against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too mom\" you reply. Nia giggles, \"hmm now what should me and you do, take a bath?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, I already told you when you take a bath you start smelling like wet dog afterward\" you reply. Nia sticks her tongue out at you, \"fine then it's feeding time\" she says. You were suprised as she sat up and moved you towards her breast \"come on little one drink up, there's plenty of milk\" she says gently pressing you against her breast. You knew this wasn't gonna work as she wasn't producing milk, that and her nipple was larger then you're head. You reach forward and slowly knead her breast, \"oh that's it little one drink up\" she says pressing you further against it. You tentativley gave a lick or 2 and Nia sighed before pulling you away. \"Are you full now?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mother\" you say lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now I know how about we play peekaboo\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not\" you reply flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, someone developing an attitude\" Nia says, you lower you're head, \"sorry\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok\" Nia replies lifting you up and cuddling you against her cheek. \"Let me show you my favorite game from back when I was a kit\" Nia says. Before you can answer all 9 of her tails wrapped around you overlapping each other and covering you completely. You didn't say anything as Nia actually started to heat up her body temperature rising till it was like you were surrounded by a giant furry electric blanket but before you got too comfy you were thrown into the air. You don't even scream but Nia easily catches you back in her tails, \"what the hell\" you yell sitting up. Nia doesn't answer instead she wraps you up, heats up and throws you again. She repeats this about 5 times and by the end you were well a bit peeved simply because she wasn't answering you. Nia on the final catch moves her tails forward and deposits you in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how was it?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck was that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old ninetails game, the mother threw the kit up to foster trust and the heat is to let the kit know everything is okay\" Nia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, yeah not really one for that game\" you say sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to play?\" Nia asks. You walk forward and climb up onto the top of her head \"what are you doing?\" she asks. You don't answer and you lay out over her head and start scratching her ears, Nia sighs and lays out over the couch, \"oooh more more\" she says. \"As you command\" you reply. You rubbed her ears for the next straight hour Nia sighing the whole time perfectly content to just lay on that couch and give off a small contented growl. Finally Nia lifts herself up which was a giant suprise to you and she pulls you off her head, \"mmm good little kit taking care of you're mother\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're happy\" you say hugging her cheek and Nia cuddles you gently, \"well little kit what should I do with you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea\" you reply shrugging, \"do you mind if we stop the whole kit, mom thing?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww but it's fun\" Nia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is, but i'm kinda feeling uncomfortable\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Nia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm feeling pretty....endeared to you right now, and calling you mom if we did something it'd be weird\" you say. Nia nods and smiles \"alright enough time of kit and mother, now it's time for lovers\" Nia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I more meant cuddling, then you know sex\" you say. Nia nods, \"I know Matt, it's what I want too\" she says cuddling you into her chest, \"oh yeah I said I was gonna carry you in there from now on, and look what happens when I don't\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nia that's not really necesscary\" you say but Nia shakes her head \"you almost died, because I wasn't watching you close enough, you don't leave my sight from now on love\" she says lowering her head and licking you with just the tip of her tongue. \"Fine, I guess I can deal with something like this\" you say pretending to be really irritated. Nia stands up and her mounds hold you in place, \"goody, now Matt it's time to go to bed, we have a big day tomorrow\" Nia says. She walks upstairs stopping in the bathroom for a minute to let you do you're buisness and brush you're teeth, she smiled at you and her canines gleamed. \"Matt do you ever find my smile scary?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, most beautiful smile i've ever seen\" you reply, she nuzzles you for a second \"geez you flatterer\" she says before picking you up and putting you back in her chest. She walks into the bedroom and carefully lies down in bed, she sighs and strokes you for a few seconds \"tomorrow we'll be married, and i'll be the happiest ninetails in the world\" Nia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft so i'll be the happiest guy in the world\" you reply. Nia giggles, \"hey Matt I never asked but why do humans not mind pokemon being naked?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well the male's part just goes in them so we don't even worry about them, same for the females you have this soft covering of fur\" you reply rubbing her chest to prove you're point \"that only disappears when you want it to, so it's no big deal to us\" you say. Nia gently pokes you, \"are you sure all you humans don't just like oggling us pokemon\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might have something to do with it, although no one better oggle you or i'm gonna send em flying\" you say. \"My hero\" Nia coos gently stroking you. You pulled yourself out of her chest and scampered down the bed to the little chest of drawers you had. It took you only a minute to change into pajamas and get snuggled back up with Nia. She yawned opening her cavernous mouth before laying her head down. \"Good night Matt\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Nia\" you reply. You laid there for 10...20...30 minutes but you couldn't get to sleep you were too awake, you decide to go for a little run to tire yourself out so you run from the bottom to the top of the bed a couple of times. Finally you were sure you were tired out enough to go straight to sleep. You walked back to Nia and right when you're about to lay down she rolls over onto her back, \"Matt I love you\" she mumbles in her sleep gently stroking where you were. You couldn't help but smile up at the giant fox above you, \"I love you too Nia, and from tomorrow on i'm all yours\" you whisper before laying down and falling straight asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were woken up slowly by soft shaking and a soft but incessant voice. \"Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up\" it repeated again and again. You stirred and turned over your head running into something. You slowly open your eyes and look up to see the rest of Nia's face. Her muzzle moves forward and she gently kisses your upper body \"good morning cutie\" she says. \"Good morning my beautiful fox\" you reply hugging the front of her muzzle. Nia lifts her head up with you on it and turns over so that you land safely on her stomach, she sits up causing you to tumble backwards into her lap. Nia giggles \"come on Matt if you can't even stand up on little ol me how are you supposed to guide me when a trainer comes\" Nia says smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think of something. but that's really not important, not today anyway\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia keeps smiling at you \"your right, I mean today is the day you get stuck with me forever\" she says picking you up and holding you to her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my line\" you reply kissing her cheek and getting a mouth full of fur for it. Nia giggles \"let's just say we're stuck with each other\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably for the best\" you reply smiling. Nia puts you down on the bed and starts rummaging around in her closet for the dress \"Matt I'm going to change downstairs, yell when your finished\" she says finally finding the dress and then leaving the room. You rummaged around in your chest of drawers finally finding your tuxedo hidden under all your other clothes, you pull it out and stare at it for a second smiling. It only took you a few minutes to put the thing on and that was only because you had to make sure that everything was on correctly because you didn't have a mirror. You just sit down on the bed and yell \"Nia I'm finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright well I'm still changing, give me a minute\" she yells back. You turn and look back at the clock 9:00am it read at you in big red numbers. You smiled \"half an hour till I get married\" you say to yourself. You were ecstatic, you had liked Nia ever since you first laid eyes on her. You heard the sound of paws on stairs and you turned just as Nia entered the doorway, she was standing there in the dress you had picked out but she was also carrying a small bouquet of flowers which she grew. She walks up and looks down at you \"Matt, Matt are you okay?\" she asks as you were staring at her pretty much open-mouthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your body \"fine, I'm fine, Nia you look gorgeous\" you say smiling like an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia suprisingly blushes and turns away for a second before turning back \"thank you Matt\" she says. She lowers a hand and you jump on and she lifts you up to her shoulder, you look back over at that clock and it now read 9:10am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we get going?\" you ask Nia. She nods and turns, \"so who do you think will catch the bouquet?\" she asks as she walks down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one, no offense but I really don't want you throwing that thing, I mean those flowers are bigger then me\" you say. Nia sighs \"so then what do I do with it?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it home and put the flowers in a vase?\" you reply really not sure yourself. She nods and walks out of the house, \"so do we need to pick up your sisters?\" you ask as Nia passes your old house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we'll meet them at the church\" Nia replies. You just sit there and suddenly a thought crosses your mind \"hey Nia, who'll be giving you away?\" you ask. \"Why my sisters of course\" she replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does that mean.....something happened to your parents?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No they just, lost touch with me\" she says stooping she looks down kind of forlorn. You gently stroke her neck \"don't be sad Nia today's supposed to be a happy day, I'll think of something\" you say. She nods and keeps walking, it took you around 5 minutes to get to the church and Nia sits down in front of it. Nia sets you down and then almost jumps giving off a small squeek, she turns and stares at something, you walk over and you see a male ninetales with a female standing right to him but they unlike Nia or her sisters were more normal sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" you ask walking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes where do the bride's family sit?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Left side\" you reply, you look up at Nia and she was just staring. \"Hey Nia, hey\" you shout up at her, she snaps out of the reverie she was in and quickly but gently lifts up and hugs the 2 ninetales. \"Mom. Dad, you came\" she says hugging the 2 tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't just let our daughter be married without us being there\" the female ninetales replies. Nia puts the 2 down and smiles at you \"Matt I'd like you to meet my mother Evelyn and my father Jonathon\" Nia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure\" you say sticking out a hand, you shake hands and Jonathon looks up at Nia hesitantly. \"Nia, is it alright if I....gave you away\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia gives off a squeak of joy \"of course you can, although it will have to be you and my sisters\" she says. Jonathon smiles and walks into the church to wait with your family. You just sit around till a car pulls up and a priest walks out of the vehicle. He smiles up at Nia and walks past the 2 of you into the church, you heard something and the guests started to file out of the church before Nia's sisters and her father came and stood next to her and your parents came and stood near you. The priest walks out all smiles and then the immediate family moves back and takes places like the other guests sitting on the grass. The priest stands in front of you and holds up a book \"ahem, we are gathered here to bind this man and Ninetales in matrimony, the bride and groom informed me that they would like to say their own vows, which they shall now read\" he says closing the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and look up at Nia \"Nia I've loved you ever since I met you back in the valley, you are my joy and my light, my warm flame at night and my closest companion, will you take me as your husband?\" you ask. Nia nods \"I will\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt you were wonderful ever since we met, even bringing a ribbon for little ol me\" she says which you realize was the ribbon holding the flowers together. \"You've taken care of me even when I went a little crazy and you deal with me even thought I must be such a bother, will you have me as your wife?\" she finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nia your not a bother at all, and I want no other but you\" you reply. The priest gives off a small cough \"now the bride and groom will exchange rings\" eh says. 3 people carried up a ring with a diamond the size of a fist on it, \"Nia when I said that was the best I could afford\" you say indicating her engagement ring \"I kind of lied a bit.\" Nia just stares at the ring and gently picks it up and puts it on \"oh Matt it's beautiful\" she says. She reaches around and somehow pulls a ring from her tails \"it wasn't easy to hide this\" she says, her ring was just a simple band of gold although engraved all around it were pictures of a happy ninetales and it's trainer playing, cuddling and even resting together. Nia lowers the ring over top of you and smiles, although she does have to remove it a few seconds later. The priest gives off another cough and the 2 of you turn \"by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife, you may now kiss the bride\" he says. Nia however takes the initiative and pushes you backwards into the grass, she lets up after a few seconds \"I love you matt\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too Nia\" you reply standing up and everyone erupted into cheers. </span></div></div>",

Not that you are trying to catch any pokemon or to travel another city, it's just like you enjoy walking in the forests. It makes you feel... relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, you feel a tickling sensation on your back. Like a giant finger is running down your spine. Shivering, you turn around to see... Nothing.<br>\r\n'Weird.' you think, before slowly resuming walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a noise makes you stop once again. It's not the rustling of the bushes nor the sound of a pokemon approaching. No, it seems more like a... like a giggle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeirded out, you resume walking, in a fast motion. Too fast. In fact, you end up bumping into something soft. Pulling back, you see you just ran into a massive wall of pink fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few steps back, your jaw drops. In front of you is standing the huge figure of giant Mew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can act, the pink pokemon reaches out for you. A stubby paw grabs you and brings you up to the Mew's face.<br>\r\n\"Hi there! I'm Mew!\" it exclaims, sounding female.<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you!\".<br>\r\n\"H-Hi...\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"So little guy, what's someone as small and cute like you doing in this forest?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Um, I was just walking around...\" you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean... You're not here to fight me and catch me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"No. I didn't even know about you until now. Now could you put me down, so I can go home?\" you ask hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew reluctantly puts you on the ground. You slowly walk off. After a few moments, you turn around. Mew is still there, still looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resume walking. You turn around again. Mew is still looking at you. Weirdly, it seems that you didn't get any far from her. It takes you a few moments to realize she's following you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew why are you following me?\" you ask.<br>\r\nShe blushes, before sighing.<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you, you're the first one that didn't come here to try and catch me... and I feel like I can trust you... Shortly, can you catch me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"What?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I don't have anyone to play with, so can I come with you?\"<br>\r\n\"... Sure... Why not?\" you reply, pulling out a pokeball. Cheering, Mew tabs the ball, disappearing into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even have time to wonder what the heck just happened when Mew pops out of the ball and hugs you.<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" she yells, before scooping you in her paw.<br>\r\n\"Now master,\" she giggles at this.<br>\r\n\"Wanna....</span></div></div>",

Yeah... and it was extremely awkward - seriously, ever tried eating someone when they're still alive?

Ehm... wouldn't people kinda freak out seeing me?</span>\" the giantess asks from behind you, her tail rising up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I live near the forest, I don't have any neighbors...\" you state, trying to fight off the huge sense of vertigo you're having at such height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew nods happily, her sapphire eyes sparkling with excitement.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Okay then! I don't usually get out of this forest... it'll be fun!</span>\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter three hours of lazily floating through the forest, chatting with Mew as your only source of entertainment, the giantess finally gets out of Mystery Jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the middle of the night, you also noted. A quick glance at your watch told you that it was 2 A.M.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Which way?</span>\" Mew asks, snapping you out of your thoughts, again rising her tail up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, she holds out a stubby paw to let you on it... only for you to fall on your butt, your legs having fallen asleep after three whole hours of hanging from Mew's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan.<br>\r\n\"That way...\" you say, pointing to North.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew nods a few times, before starting to float forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, soon enough, a house comes into view... your house. From this height, you note, it's like a mere dollhouse to Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There.\" you say, causing the giantess to halt and gently put you back down on the solid ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, you pull out your keys and stumble to the front door, unlocking it before entering the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into your kitchen and grab some meat and fruit. You walk back out of the house, discovering that Mew laid down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I brought you something... Hopefully it will fill you...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Tasty!</span>\" Mew chimed in satisfaction as she pats her giant stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... easier to eat meat when it isn't alive?\" you remark, causing Mew to go giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, before yawning.<br>\r\n\"Well... we ate. Let's hit the hay.\" you suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew looks at you, those sapphire eyes fixing straight on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Wait... can't we stay here some more? I'd like to talk to you...</span>\" she admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... About?\" you asked, yawning again and looking at your watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 A.M.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm usually sleeping by now...\" you remark as you look at the pink giantess, who slowly leans down, her gigantic muzzle landing inches from you, her face at least twenty times your whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Well... let's know each other better...</span>\" she suggests cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yawn again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are Matt, a pokemon trainer that is always traveling, searching for powerful and rare pokemon. Today you are walking through a well known forest, the Ilex forest, in the Johto region. You heard that there is an incredibly powerful grass pokemon that guards this forest. You are walking for a hours now and, weirdly enough, you didn't encounter any pokemon, not even a Weedle. The ground is unusually coloured dark green here. You just ignore it and keep going, thinking that it's just grass. Suddenly you stop, two hills in front of you. You stare at them confused, wondering how such things are here, in the middle of a forest. Suddenly the ground starts to raise. You almost lose your balance, but you manage to see the huge green face of a pokemon, that you recognize as Celebi. She's apparently asleep. Wait, so this means you are standing on the belly of an about 200 ft tall anthro Celebi, and it also means that the two hills you saw before are... her breasts. The \"ground\"  lowers again with her breath. You take the opportunity and jump off her body, but she feels the movement and her breath suddenly interrupts. She then opens her eyes and looks around, spotting you. Celebi then slowly gets up and looks at you for a second, before smiling \"Oh goody, a challenger. Are you here to try and take me on trainer?\" she asks. You nod slowly as she smiles again and gets in front of you. Her legs are like trees to you \"Ready when you are, throw out whatever you've got\" she says. You nod as you call your strongest fire pokemon, a Flareon named Flame. She emerges from her pokeball, just to run and hide behind you as soon she sees Celebi. The grass type pokemon pouts \"Awww, one pokemon, that's no fun\" she says. You recall Flame back as Celebi speaks again \"Since your pokemon doesn't seem up to fight, why don't you challenge me?\" she asks \"How do I do that?\"  \"Well, it's simple. If you can avoid me for a whole minute, you win, and I'll do something you want . If I manage to touch you, I win\" she explains \"What if I lose?\" \"You either become my slave or plaything. Your choice\" she says. You shiver at the thought as Celebi gets a few meters away from you \"Get ready, cause here I come!\" she says dashing, or rather flying at full speed, towards you. Luckily you manage it sidestep, but Celebi quickly turns in your direction and charges you again. You duck, and she flies past you, but she quickly turns around \"You're mine!\" she exclaims dashing towards you. You try to move, but you trip and fall tot the ground. Celebi's smile grows wider, but is soon replaced by an annoyed expression. You hear her groan and slowly get up \"What?\" you ask \"Time's up\" she says in a huff \"Looks like you won\". You smile as Celebi gets near you \"So? What do I have to do?\" she asks smiling a bit \"Well, telling you the truth, I came here to catch the powrful grass pokemon that guarded this forest...\" you reclutantly say \"Is that so?\" Celebi asks smiling \"Well yeah. You know what, forget about what I said, I'll leave and never come back\" you quickly say. In response Celebi gets really near you. You close your eyes, expecting for her to hurt you, but instead you feel yourself being picked up and pressed against a surface. You open your eyes to see Celebi hugging you \"What are you doing?\" you ask \"Just hugging my trainer. You know, we haven't introduced yet. I'm Celia\" she says \"W-wait, trainer? What do you mean?\" you ask shocked \"That I'll be your pokemon. And now, would you be so kind to tell me how have I to call my master?\" she asks smiling \"I'm Matt\" you reply. Celia smiles in response and then looks at you again \"Now, Matt, do you have any questions?\" she asks \"Well... for starters, how do you eat?\" you ask \"I eat nothing more than a normal pokemon. As long it isn't meat, I'm fine with everything\" she replies \"And where will you sleep?\" \"I'm fine with sleeping outside. It's not like someone will try to steal me, right?\" she says. You nod as she giggles \"Come on, show me where you live, so I'll get us there\" she says \"That direction\" you say, pointing to north. Celia nods as she starts flying in that direction, holding you in a soft hug. After ten minutes of flying she stops \"Matt, I see a town. Do you live there?\" she asks \"Yeah. I just wonder how can we get you enter...</span></div></div>",

I'll go warn the people\" you say. The gigantic Celebi looks at you \"Why?\" she asks in a somewhat annoyed tone \"Because what will they think if they see a titanic Celebi flying in the city? They would think of you as a monster. And we don't want that, right?\" you say. Celia takes a moment to realize what you just said, before nodding in approval. She then gently puts you on the ground. You start walking towards the city. You see a group of people talking \"What could have been that huge shadow?\"you hear one of them say. Obviously, Celia would never pass unseen due to her size. With a sigh, you approach the group \"Excuse me, but I think I have the answer\" you say. In a moment, everyone's gaze focus on you. A moment passes, before a man decides to speak up \"And that would be?\" he asks \"Well, I think that's my pokemon...\" you say \"Your pokemon? What did you catch, a legendary?\" someone else asks. Your silence is an enough answer \"What? You caught a legendary?\" they ask shocked. You nod \"Come on Celia, come here\" you call out. Instantly a huge shadow, that you recognize as Celia's, falls over you and the people. Celia flies behind you. The people stare at her with their mouths wide open; but it's just a moment before they freak out and start screaming \"She's gonna eat us!\" someone yells \"Calm down please!\" you say, trying to stop them.

Everyone freezes in place as you speak again \"Listen to me, Celia won't hurt anyone\" you say \"As for eating, she won't eat anyone\" \"That's true. I'm strictly vegetarian\" Celia confirms. The people start to calm down at your explanations \"And what will she eat?\" an old man asks \"I have that covered\" you reply \"We just wish to live in peace\" you end starting to leave, but Celia snatches you in her hand and looks at you \"Where's your house cutie?\" she asks \"There. You're lucky it's just in front of a hill, so you'll have all the space to sleep\" you say pointing to your house. Celia smiles as she flies towards it. She puts you in front of the frotn door \"Wait me here\" you say running in the house and getting some pokemon food. You then get out to find Celia still waiting for you \"Is that food?\" she asks eyeing the poke food in your hand \"Yes, dig in\" you say launching it in the air. Celia catches it with her mouth and swallows it whole \"Tasty!\" she says licking her lips satisfied. You smile as she lowers her head to you \"So Matt, now that you have me\" she says \"What are your plans?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt brushed a hand through his hair, knocking loose a stuck twig and wiping away some sweat. The forest around him was gradually growing thinner as he made his way to the great Northwind cliffs, but still dense enough that he couldn't get a good view of anything but trees and plants. The roaring thunder of the falls was growing ever louder as he approached, drawing him on, guiding him without need for a map.<br>\r\nFinally, he saw a hint of blue in the distance. Matt broke into a run, overjoyed that his journey would soon be over. As he rushed past the woods, the blue sky slipped through more and more openings in the foliage, until finally it dominated Matt's view. <br>\r\nMatt almost didn't manage to slow down in time, gasping in apprehension as he skidded to a halt less than a foot from the sudden dropoff. A handful of stones were kicked up by his arrival and bounced down to the lake waters nearly five hundred feet below. Matt watched the stones vanish into the distance, completely obscured by the deep mists of the falls, before letting his gaze rise upon the fruits of his travels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was truly an amazing sight. Down the cliff face, a great lake glistened in the midday sun, surrounded by an endless forest stretching into the horizon. Few had ever set foot in these forests, too afraid of the legends of it's incredible magical protector, but Matt was glad he had finally overcome his fears and ventured forth. He wasn't sure where he had found the courage to make the long trek through the woods, but even the tales of the Goddess-like guardian of the Northwind continent hadn't been enough to keep him away.<br>\r\n\"Wow...\"<br>\r\n\"Magnificent, isn't it, Matthew?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've never seen such a beauti<i><b>GYAH!!!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt grabbed the nearest solid object he could find (it happened to be a tree in this case) and held on for dear life, praying that he hadn't seen what he thought he had just seen.<br>\r\n\"PLEASE DON'T EAT ME!!!\"<br>\r\nMatt cowered against the tree, waiting for his life to flash before his eyes. Instead, he heard gentle laughter and a melodic voice no louder than his own.<br>\r\n\"Even if I <i>wished</i> to eat you, there would be no point. I doubt I could even taste your tiny body. Open your eyes, little one.\"<br>\r\n\"Do I have to?\"<br>\r\n\"I would prefer if you did.\"<br>\r\nMatt didn't want to, but he had to admit to himself that he was more concerned with what might happen if the owner of the voice grew displeased. Slowly, he opened his eyes and looked at the speaker again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was big. That was the first thing anyone seeing her would walk away with, no question. She was also blue. That part kind of jumped out as well. And she was big. Really big. In fact, it took several seconds of looking up and down the length of her massive body for Matt to get a good grasp on what it was he was addressing.<br>\r\nShe was an impossibly huge creature, and not human. Her skin was covered in a dense layer of silky blue fur decorated with white diamond shapes, and her body was clothed only in a pair of white ribbons loosely hung across her shoulders. She was sitting in the lake below- not standing, <i>sitting</i>. Her back leaned against the cliffside, positioned directly in the middle of the waterfall, diverting it's torrential flow. Her shoulders were above the ground, arms spread out and resting along the treetops. Even further into the sky, her tremendous face loomed in the air, smiling down with sparkling red eyes. Long, thick, wavy purple hair flowed from her head, vanishing with the rest of her body in the distant mists below. Atop her head, she wore a magnificent aquamarine crown, encrusted with thousands of flawless jewels larger than most people. In it's center, a hexagonal blue ring-shaped gem over a hundred feet long seemed to glow with a radiance rivaling the sun itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my forest, little one.\"<br>\r\n\"H-h-h-h-h-h-hi.\"<br>\r\n\"Why are you afraid? I have bestowed an unprecedented blessing upon you. Not only have I drawn you to this place, the grandest vista within all of my domain, I have even deemed you worthy to behold my radiant presence. Are you not honored?\"<br>\r\n\"Y-y-y-y-y-y-yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why do you hide behind a tree, as if displeased with what you gaze upon?\"<br>\r\n\"N-n-n-n-n-n-no reason.\"<br>\r\n\"Then please, little one, step forward.\"<br>\r\nThe tremendous Suicine woman held out a hand, placing it against the side of the cliff. Swallowing hard, Matt slowly crawled out from behind the tree and walked towards the open palm. He climbed onto a finger and was able to stand on it quite comfortably- he couldn't have seemed bigger than half an inch to the Goddess-like Pokemon relaxing against the towering falls.<br>\r\nMatt's stomach churned as she lifted her hand up to her face, hovering over her mountainous breasts. Lips taller than his body parted, revealing teeth he didn't even want to <i>think</i> about comparing to any part of his body.<br>\r\n\"Now then, little one, it is time for me to tell you why I have led you here...</span></div></div>",

You have been raised by pokemon and other anthro's and are accepting of our kind, and finnaly your staring proves that you are attracted to me\" she smiled as he averted his gaze from her breast<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"but all in good time, for now i shall take you back to my den, and you can decide tomorrow\" with those words she raised herself from the lake &amp; took many strides towards a mountain range, that on foot for Matt would have taken him many hours but she had reached the mountains in under 5 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nas she aproached the mountains she turned to look at Matt \"i'll have to carry you for this, or you will fall off\" with those words spoken she grasped Matt in her hands, and jumped clean over the seemingly inpenetrable mountains to land in a secluded glade where the trees were huge although to the Suicine they were waist height<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned Matt to her shoulder \"Is this were you live?\" asked Matt<br>\r\n\"of course here i can relax in solitude with out fear of human's, the mountains are inpenetrable for climbers and due to wind currents none of their flying machines can reach me. We are here, home sweet home!\" she sighed<br>\r\nMatt looked around but could see nothing that resembled a den \"umm were i dont see anything\"<br>\r\nshe smiled at him before reaching forward to pluck a berry of a tree, for her it was a grape, to Matt it was a Large mansion. She threw into her mouth and took a bite before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe affect was instant he immediately felt himself dropping closer to the ground, but was still safely perched on the Suicine woman's shoulder, he watched as they dropped closer to the ground at an alarming rate, she finnaly began to slow down the dramatic size change at around 40-50ft, she still towered over Matt but now he could sit on her shoulder without it looking like he was standing on a small hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now do you see, Matthew?\" she asked as she pointed towards the hills, in front of them was an opening just big enough for Suicine to enter at her new height if she crawled in. and she did just that she dropped to all fours slowly to allow Matt time for the change in were he would have to sit, as she prowled forward he couldnt help but notice with the ease in which she walked on all fours \"how can you walk so easily on all fours and yet still stand upright at will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hind legs are unique, at my tallest form they are simply that of a human but when i return to my smaller forms i gain the ability to shift my leg's and even my arms into what the original suicine would have possesed, it is extremely usefull for when a lower stature is necessary\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued in silence until they reached the rear den where it opened up enough for Suicine to stand upright again, there was a large bed of soft grass piled thicker than Matt's height. Suicine layed out on her back down apon the bed and placed Matt atop her breast \"do you have any question's matt?\"<br>\r\n\"umm, just two for now, first what is your name, i still dont yet know?\"<br>\r\nshe chuckled slightly \"oops sorry i thought i had introduced myself already, My name is Sylvia\"<br>\r\n\"ok nice to meet you Sylvia, and second when you said that we could become mates before.......how would that work?\"<br>\r\nshe blushed \"well i can eat another berry like i did before, which would bring me to roughly you height maybe a little larger still or I could merely place you into my......areas which if we do become mate's i still wish to try\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt imediately blushed he had been thinking of doing that with her the moment she mentioned becoming mate's, and to be honest he wanted to become Sylvia's mate. what should he say</span></div></div>",

She then proceeded to take off the ribbon that was over her shoulders, and then she took off her crown.

How come I should go inside you?\" Matt's face reddens as jirachi gives him a close up view of her swelling pussy and ass. \"These are looking hot and embarrassing. You want me to have more sex with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This big body is tired from your sudden wake up call to me. Trust me on this. We can have fun some more once you're inside with my secret.\" Giving your ok response, Jirachi uses her other fingers to open her vagina and she inserts you inside her fleshy pussy. Once she seals her vagina, she rests her body downwards on the ground and focuses some of her energy before closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside of Jirachi's massive vagina, the entirety of the passage is lit by blue crystals protruded around various positions of her pussy. Just as you are about to take a walk, Jirachi shows herself in her true original size nearly made out of psychic energy, metallic flesh, and bits of her vagina muscles. \"Hi Matty! Sorry to keep you waiting! You are only seeing a drop of my secret here. But you are not the first one to have sex with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Was it because of your cocoon not covering your body?\" Matt takes notice of the floor opening as an old classical train (think of the 1800s train) rises from under the vaginal flesh followed by the railroads ahead. Gesturing him to follow her, you two ride the train. You picked a room that has a bed and a lamp table. As the train goes forward, you notice another jirachi dressed as a waiter giving away water to both of you. After the drink, you set the cups on the table and lie on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we get to the heart of one of my inner cities, I need to give you another name Matt for I know another resident lives deep inside my womb. Just to make it easier for me. How about Arlos?\" the name she gives you is weird but it doesn't seem to be that bad. You nod to her name choice for knowing that there could be another person named Matt somewhere within her. Perhaps outside too it seems. Closing the door and curtains of the door and windows of the room of the train, two blue lights give vision of the seclusion you two have. \"You did well on pleasing me Arlos. Can you pleasure me here at my pussy again?\" rubbing her pussy on your pants, the sight of it gives you a boner for how hot it is going on. \"Call it a registration for yourself as a resident of my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how can I say no to that? I got something more than just being rich. Your pussy is rich and you are lovely. Let me mine you.\" Due to how primitive the train can be in terms of speed, Matt, now ,named Arlos, removes his pants and gets to work on Jirachi's pussy. You don't really mind as to how she's able to be with you within her own body as you have your back on the headrest watching her body slide up and down on your thick dick over and over again. The sight of her belly bulging from your dick with her blissful yelps only helps to boost your ego. After a while, you and Jirachi reach orgasm. Still tied together, Arlos asks, \"Are you ok Jirachi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. We ARE quite still distant from my womb. Feel like going another round of sex?\" A nod is all you give to Jirachi.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It has been a while on this train, and you stopped your love making a little while ago. You are now sitting on your room's bed, Jirachi sitting next to you. The wish maker smiles \"Well, as I told you before, you're not the first one to give me enough pleasure to make me grow. One day, long time ago, I had this harvesting idea to let people live inside my body. And, go answer your question, I can create things within me thanks to my psychic powers, just to make my body a livable place. But, tell you what, you're the first trainer whose wish was to be my MY trainer. Nobody has ever asked for that, that's why you took me by surprise. Everyone just asked for money, fame... sex... So, even with all the people here, you can consider yourself my special guest\" she replies, flying up and giving you a hug. As long as her short arms let her. You feel flattered by her words as you return the hug. Jirachi then pulls off and sits on your lap. Then, you feel the train stopping \"Oh, we're here\" she says lifting from your lap and grabbing your hand. She practically drags you out of the train. The first thing you see is a big green field. You then see a town. People are walking around, they all seem to be peaceful and relaxed here; the ceiling is fleshy. What surprises you is the large amount of light that lightens the whole city, even though you are in the depths of Jirachi's womb \"Welcome to my Womb Town Arlos. What do you think?\" the wish maker asks gleefully \"It's beautiful\" is all you manage to say \"Thank you, master\" Jirachi says with a giggle, obviously pleased that you like it \"Master?\" \"Either that or Arlos. It's really the same thing for me. Oh, and you can come out whenever you want, just tell me. Maybe after I wake I'll pull you out, I want to get to know you better. And maybe we can play after that\" Jirachi says, excitement in her voice \"But couldn't we do it as we are here? Wouldn't it be the same thing?\" you ask. Jirachi smirks \"Big the size, bigger the fun\" she replies, before grabbing your hand \"Come on, people have to know my  trainer now, let's go!\" she says, once again dragging you. You didn't think she is that strong.</span></div></div>",

Why don't I show you to the theater? We can haves some private fun there.\" After a whisper to your ears, you take a blush on your face once more. Arriving at the register of the theatre, \"Well well well! Mother Jirachi. Your sleepiness does come quick. Who is this fella you are with watching this new scene together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my trainer. I want a full private scene for two with a bed for me to have fun with my partner.\" Jirachi whispers to the ticket attendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My golly! Looks like you are one lucky trainer buddy for you will end up not just becoming acquainted to our mother here but for the rest of us children here. Follow me and enjoy the movie.\" As Arlos and Jirachi walk towards the private room, he can't help but get a surprising response about the 'people' living within your pok\u00e9mon. Upon entering the room, a set of lemonade hangs on the side of each seat. Now sitting on the private chairs, the movie you to get to watch is something you two neither expected. The first scene is a direct replay when Matt/Arlos thrusted his penis into Jirachi's vagina and colliding into her womb several times until he cums inside her womb while various messages are admirations or prayers of some sort telling about the very low population within the entirety of Jirachi's inner world for only people living at her womv are the long lasting survivors left. With nothing left to enhance and improve the inner well being of the rest of her body, Jirachi now merely acts and lives on her own accord for the people living inside Jirachi have the last remaining survivors of a forgotten civilization that had equal rights to both human and pok\u00e9mon relationships where other civilizations from the past outside world had banned them before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is \u2026 nice of my children, So master, want to eat something? Maybe have more fun with me here before I pull you out again? I have 2 more hours left before?\" Jirachi carefully leas you as you see more young and elderly people having many features that blend Jirachi and human bodies together with a few being actual Jirachis livin with her body. On your part, you can't help but wonder about more on the history of these people she claimed to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know. I'm having some second thoughts wanting to know something. Is there a library around your body?\" Arlos asks ehile looking around the green park lit up by the translucent yet fleshy roof that is called the walls of her uterus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes Master. I can bring you there if you want. Now, where did I place my library in my body?\" Jirachi ponders<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once again, you are literally dragged by Jirachi to Arceus knows where \"Jirachi, I can walk you know\" you say. Your pokemon giggles in response, completely ignoring you as she continues dragging you through the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Jirachi stops in front of a building. You could swear your shoes are completely ruined now. Groaning, you look up, to see a big 'Library' sign hanging from the entrance. You look to Jirachi, who motions you to enter. You nod as you make your way towards the building, the wish maker following close. It looks like a real library in the inside, huge and full of books. There's even a Jirachi with glasses on, behind a desk, reading a book. You assume it's the librarian. She rises her head and smiles briefly at you, before turning her attention to her book. You look around, people either looking for specific books or reading silently \"What are we looking for master?\" Jirachi suddenly whispers from behind you, snapping you out of your thoughts. Also, she scares the hell out of you \"Ahhhh!\" you yell, causing the librarian to look up, somewhat annoyed. Jirachi covers your mouth with both her hands \"Master, you don't have to yell here\" she whispers \"I know, but you scared me to death\" you whisper back, causing her to look sorrowful \"Sorry\". You smile, you knew each other for less of an hour, and you already can't bear her sad expression  \"It's okay\" you reply, wrapping a arm around her body and pulling her closer. This makes Jirachi smile \"Anyway, I was looking for a history book. Where can I find one?\" \"I know! Follow me\" she whispers, freeing herself from your hug and grabbing your hand. Seeing the death glare you are giving her, she lets go \"Maybe you can walk this time\" she says; you smirk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Jirachi through the library, when she finally stops \"The history books are here\" she points to some bookshelves. You nod as you look at the various book. Then a book catches your attention: Story of the Jirachis, it reads. Curious, you go sitting down to a desk, Jirachi sitting on your lap. You start to read the book:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Jirachis were an ancient population that lived in the confines of Forina, aka Jirachi's home, because they were banned from the other countries. It seems in fact that they approved Human - Pokemon relationships. They adored Jirachi like it was a godddess because of her ability to grant wishes. Once every thousand years, a group of the population would leave the country, in order to find Jirachi's cocoon. They had a time limit of a week. If they couldn't find Jirachi's cocoon before the Millennium Comet passed, that would return home, and there be killed for failing their mission. If they managed to find it, they would be treated like heroes. When Jirachi would wake up, all the people had to bow in front of her. The Jirachis would dye their hair blonde and light blue, they would color their skin white, paint blue eye drops under their eyes and wear yellow and blue robes in order to look like their goddess. They would set up big ceremonies for her, that usually lasted the whole week she is awake. Then, one day, they all mysteriously disappeared from the face of the world. It seems that they disappeared one night, when Jirachi was supposed to wake up from her slumber. Nothing else is known about this population.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read the book carefully, when you come to an end. You look at Jirachi, who is still sitting on your lap \"Jirachi?\" you call out. She doesn't answer \"Jirachi?\" your ry again, and again she doesn't answer. You look at her face, she has fallen asleep! \"Jirachi, wake up\" you say, gently shooking her. The wish maker opens her eyes \"Hi master\" she says \"Jirachi, how did you fall asleep right now?\" you ask \"Well, you were reading silently, so I leaned back and relaxed\" she says \"Whatever, Jirachi, I have to ask you something\" you say \"Ask then\" she replies \"I read that the population of the Jirachis mysteriously disappeared one night. and that's because...\" you say \"Oh, so you read about them? Well, you can answer yourself, I let them in my body\" she says with a smile. So your hypothesis were right, the people you met before were the Jirachis, an ancient population that is  believed extinct. \"Master?\" Jirachi calls out \"Mh?\" \"Master, I just woke up outside my body. Ready to come out?\" she asks \"Oh yeah, sure\" you reply.</span></div></div>",

For now, you leave the library and make your way to the station.<br>\r\n\"So you must be the new young boy who gets to have fun with our goddess.\" Next to you, you are now being followed by another Jirachi that seems to be slightly bigger than the Jirachi whom you just hanged out with the tags looking slightly wrinkled with the golden colors replaced by a dimmed topaz shade. \"Tell me young man. What is your name?\" you tell him your name and the name their goddess shares to you. \"Arlos. How is your trip inside our mother's vagina and womb? Looks like you encountered some of our people here looking like our mother, like me. Maybe you noticed some of them having qualities of both human and pok\u00e9mon along the way.\" The 300+ year old jirachi resident points to a small group of hybrid children with 3 girls and 3 boys having some of the descriptions you read on the book. In actuality, their hairs and the teardrops are officially part of their light pink skin due to the exposure of growing inside the legendary pokemon's inner body. Since one of them has an exposed belly, you take notice of the eyelid on their bellies but unsure if they are actual eyes or not. <br>\r\n\"Mister, I am interested to know more about your unique people.\" You tell the smiling pok\u00e9mon. Looking behind you, you see 2 giant holes that seems to lead to her ovaries.<br>\r\nUpon reaching the station, both you and the old grandpa natured jirachi ride in the train learning more about the hidden civilization. For the most part, it has been a quiet and content group of people enjoying what they currently have and share by their goddess. \"\u2026Lately, a hundred years ago, our population is declining. Too many old people with very few young ones to replace. Only a few hundred of us live in her right now. I'm not sure if our civilization can still live longer due to many of us males getting sterile and females unable to give birth.\" You take in the message slowly on the sad scenario happening. \"Do you like our goddess for what she is?\"<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I'm starting to like her. I never knew that my initial goal for money would be surpassed by the fact that your goddess is actually a huge one in size. Befriending a pok\u00e9mon that accepts a human and pok\u00e9mon relationship is extremely special where many of my kind are still unaccepting of that fact.\" You share to the old jirachi.<br>\r\n\"With a nice heart and view, you are definitely fitting to be close to our mother goddess. I pity your generation of people still affected by our opposing human ancestors. Arlos, would you be ok doing something for us?\" you follow with the question of what would it be the task give by this old follower. \"All of us residents here loved the love making scene you did with our goddess to wake her up from her slumber. Besides building a long lasting healthy relationship as future mates, would you be ok to have sex with her again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well \u2026 I love to. However, I'm not the best on long term sex. Maybe three times of orgasm could work. But \u2026 I can only last one good round.\" You blush at the lovely proposal you intend to do with your prized pokemon besides a loving relationship with a titan of a legendary pok\u00e9mon. You see the train nearing the end station.<br>\r\nUnderstanding your stamina issues, the old pok\u00e9mon gives you on what looks like a pink cupcake bread. \"You can eat that right now young Arlos. With she being a being of energy as well, I figure that this can boost your overall endurance and stamina. Maybe it can make you able to have 5-6 orgasms in one session. Perhaps more...\" as the train stops on the station, you thank the old Jirachi for the company before asking for his name, \"Marl. See you in her next invitation.\"<br>\r\nThe railroads and the train station with the train sinks down into the muscles of the wish maker's vagina. After eating the cupcake, you notice the lever there and push its direction forward. The crystal lights around her titanic pussy starts to dim out as the cervix solidifies where no light or some bacteria from the outside world goes in. \"Master, you are finally here! Get a look at this view from there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jirachi already awake, she stretches the lips of her vagina as wide as she can using all 6 fingers from both paws. As the morning air hits your entire body, you get a wonderful view of a nearby body of lake. After a while, one of her hands dig into her pussy for you to climb up. Once you are out, the happy face of your pok\u00e9mon appears. You intend to keep her promise on knowing more about each other. However, you keep in the back of your mind that having sex with Jirachi does more than getting and receiving carnal pleasure for each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arlos. Did you enjoy residing inside my body? How are the people there?\" sensing the extra boost of energy on your tiny body, Jirachi knows just how better your sexual relationship with her can become sooner. Since the cupcake Arlos ate responses on her infatuated and lusting emotions, deep in her mind, she telepathically thank the old jirachi inside her. Her breeding instinct is bound to come in any moment to repopulate her people using her trainer's seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are unaware of what she is thinking in her mind.</span></div></div>",

In his pleasant sight is his wish maker's waking face. \"That should be plenty master. Though, I need help on ... something below.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would that be?\" riding on the little star's paw, she blocks the excessive sunlight for him to see parts of the massive forest getting desolated with the snapped trees. \"Oh. But ... how come no one else saw you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made both of us invisible. But both of us are still alone in this isolated forest valley. So, we can fix it no problem.\" giving Arlos a smile, she lowers her paw to let you see her bulging belly. As it gets closer to the ground, she sets Arlos on the edge of trees that are still standing on the edge of these trees. \"Help me get the saplings and saps there I get the ones around this big pit we made.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgreeing to the conservation of the place, both human and pokemon gather what they can to start replanting the seeds and saplings.A few hours later with all of the seeds planted, Jirachi gives you a show as she uses her paws to open her vagina and flood the gaping forest pit with the excess cum stored in her belly. But with the flood of cum not even reaching you, you continue to watch as she sits on the ground with an open pussy. Just before you can walk, she lifts you up with her psychic powers and sets you on one of her paws. Giving you a light pet using one of her fingers reaching the size of a tall building, she then smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what is next Jirachi? I'm getting hungry.\" Arlos then ponders as to what he can give to his really big pokemon that can contest a Wailord's appetite. On her other paw, you see a huge load of berries that are still intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is getting late again. But here are some berries for us to eat. But ... can you feed me?\" her wide open eyes does not help the fact that she wants you to baby feed her in the riskiest way for your own safety<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuhhh. I can ... but it scares me that you might ... swallow me on accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arlos. Pleeease? I'll be gentle on you. In fact, the berries I get to eat, you can also eat. If you go to my little stomach city. Just like my Womb Town, every part of my body is safe and livable. So don't worry about any acids in my stomach. I have plenty of witnesses to convince you. Since I love you and trusted you to fuck me and give me more babies, you truly trust me, right master?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a moment, I thought that you are simply going insane with your idea. But since you let me willingly inside your body, you are quite cozy. So ... let Arlos feed you here. But ... I need some help.\" Shaky as your body may be from what you are about to do, you keep your faith to the pokemon you befriended and mated with. She places you on the paw where she holds the berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a moment.\" as Jirachi takes a deep breath, you can feel the gust of wind blowing behind you. Once she slowly exhales gently, they blow you down on her paw slipping to her palm. However, you are still safe and sound. \"Time for you and my children to feed me. Opening her mouth, she sets her paw that is holding her berries on her oral mouth. Just before you get to climb in, you get to see a few of the former human Forina citizens (hybrids of human and jiachi qualities that make them look like magi) with a few Jirachis in their true original size and form. As on now, your mate cannot verbally talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the female Forina citizens climbs out of her mouth and escorts you to her tongue and sets you on one of her cheeks. \"Mister Arlos, come here!

But as he turns around, Jirachi grows her breasts to the size of a hill nearly reaching the size of an average mountain. Lifting you up, she sets Arlos on top of one of her nipples. With the new height vantage that you have, you get to finally see a decent view of the outer rim of the forest. Yet you can't help but wonder if you can still see where your trip exactly started since you somewhat left a few things there. But you decide to set the thought aside and squeeze her nipple. \"Squeeze me there master.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOooaahhh. That is nice master. Can we play a bit of squeezing of my nipples?\" With her other hand on the other nipple squeezing it, you get to have your own white melon as you squeeze that flesh like meat that you can chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all of those are happening, Jirachi sets her unoccupied paw onto her pussy and starts masturbating as it slightly shakes her body along with the breast he occupies.

I want ... you to rut me again in my sleep ... ahhh .... deep inside Womb Town. After this play...\"watching her other paw dipping in and out of the vagina tunnel you traveled last night, you do the same act of chewing to her nipple. All of these heightened stimulation becomes enough to dissolve the psychic barrier below her. A few moments later, her orgasm adds more cum to the already cum filled ground. Just on her other breasts, bits oifmilk stained her other paw<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sleepy. Let me bring you back into my womb.\" both of her paws wrap around Arlos as she slowly concentrates her teleport. For Arlos, he licks one of her fingers coated with her milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a tasty milk girl. Maybe we can have that drink after this.\" Getting her approval, a silver and gold glow of light surround Arlos until he disappears underneath her paw. Moments later, he appears at the private movie theatre room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Jirachi, she makes herself invisible first followed by her actual giant body going to sleep. Seconds later, she comes out in her smaller form dressed in a bedtime set of clothes. </span></div></div>",

Denying her orgasm, he licks the outside of her lips and give his smiley face to a whining little jirachi. \"That is cute to see my mate. How come I do not get clothes like you do?

However, being the leader of something that fully obeys both of you may be a nice thing to have when needed. So far, he gets to treat her children more as friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you will be soon.\" with both of them arriving outside, a performer setting up its performing tools at the mechanical caravan is about to leave when it notices both Arlos and Jirachi arriving close to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?

There are plenty of places for us to have our own fun time and bonding time tonight. You choose a place for us to sleep together.

Once all of them are settled, the train moves forward along the rails. As their ride goes on, things get boring for both of them as sight of inner muscles and modified organs go on and on. There may be a few bizarre fauna growing inside Jirachi, seeing the sight of his long travel path a few hours ago after feeding his legendary mate gives him a different feeling alongside accomplishment. Something about encountering a macro pokemon housing a civilization and becoming a father to those people in a naive, innocent, and joyful way make him shed tears on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jirachi, she nudges her human mate for them to begin choosing Arlos's clothes from the roster of designed robes that they have. \"I'm not that good in fashion sense. Maybe you can choose for me Jirachi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" skimming through the three robes, she debates on giving Arlos between a clear white robe with yellow line patterns around the chest, perhaps the golden robe with blue crystal flake patterns, or this alluring red robe with red and blue roses on each side of the thighs. After some thinking, to match her body color, Jirachi selects the white robe. However, she senses bits of his thoughts faintly. <i>\"Why is he asking himself so many different things? Me? Could it be...? Please be a good one Arlos. But ... are you sad about something?\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to how quickly the train arrives at the destination, all around them is the sight of an aquamarine lake with a smooth hill carrying a small mansion in the center. As you two look around, the flow of the \"water\" around the place flows in a circular pattern. \"Is this ... your true eye?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the source of my energy. While my body can be very strong, this part of me is my soft spot. Importantly, my most sacred.\" Once the train stops next to the sanctuary, both of them settle in the middle of a water bed with Arlos below and Jirachi eing on top of his face presenting her pussy masturbating in front of his face..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arlos, just --aaahhh- how much do you love me right now?\" Jirachi caress her partner to coo him out of infatuation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far, I feel like it is very close. Yet I do not know if we are exactly two pieces of a puzzle. But, do you want to go at it again?\" for now, he human goes along her wishes again. He quickly drinks the few drops of fem cum she offers to him by licking her pussy briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand. Now Arlos, time for you to wear me on your penis and feast on the carnal and romantc pleasures.\" starting with a deep kiss on each other's lips, they let their hands explore their bodies with the human already inserting his fingers on her lower orfices while Jirachi squeezes on his dick. A couple rubs later triggers their orgasm dropping the corresponding male and female cum on the water bed. Sooner than later, Jirachi rides Arlos's dick while the huamn begins rutting her hard like a sex hungry pokemon she has been to his eyes so far along with the childish manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their marathon of fornication goes through the night, various things begin to grow and glow such as minerals sticking around her vagina,,chemical wastes from her liver start to reduce, milk from her breasts begin to multiply in liquid quantity, crops grown from her stomach begin to grow faster and have greater taste quality, solid wastes from her tail hole turn to composed soil for recycles used in gardening, her crystal brain enhances he light absorbing qualities of her star shaped head, and many more.

Please tell me what is going on?\" giving out a little childlike voice for impatient pouting, the little girl next to him shriveled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving out a sigh with a smile, \"Well, I had been bringing you along my choices instead of yours. Fine, I believe it is time for you to choose where you want and what you want for us and yourself to do after this. Will that be ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise me you keep your promise.\" Arlos agrees to his mate only because he has this young girl watching this little drama both of them are having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise.\" now stepping on a door installed on the floor, it opens wide enough for your mate's substitute body figure to sink inside. Then Arlos and the young jirachi girl take their seats on what looks like a sofa mixed with a roller coaster chair with a bunch of safety belts and harnesses further incentive both to wear those equipments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wait for this event to happen or end, he looks at the younger jirachi who has her eyes set on the massive panel of windows. Arlos still doesn't get about the girl's excitement. Curious, he pets the young jirachi on its blunted star head, \"Helo there young daughter. You look excited for what your great mother is about to do. Can you tell me what it is along with your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister Arlos. I am Cellien. Our great mother promised me to give me a special arcade ride. Plus something that I wished which she will help me fulfill it without using her wishes.\" what it would be meant something that Arlos couldn't even expect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his mate returns to her full body in proper control, Jirachi stretches her arms first with something to speak t herself subtly acting as an announcement to her children. \"Aaaahhh, what a wonderful day for a stretch under the sun.\" as her third eye opens again, most of her body slowly turns to a nearly translucent form where sunlight gets absorbed. Using her left paw despite being ambidextrous, she stretches her vagina wide open until her clit gets fully exposed to the open world. Whereas the view you had on her True Eye gave him that great sky view, now he and one of his children get a great view of the forest where her two fingers securing the sides of her stretched pussy. Once a radio box pops out of the upper ceiling, his mate's radio-like voice calls out, \" Brace yourselves my children! All of your chairs will keep you safe and covered for those that had not yet set up. Enjoy the bouncy ride.\" as circular plastic ball cages circle the chairs the two get to see another finger coming from his mate's right hand, it positions itself under her clit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ohh. Oh my this is hot .. and sexy.\"</i> just as Arlos ends his reaction, Jirachi starts to flick on her clit as her form of public masturbation. The ball of chairs now get to bounce around the fleshy room of her clit. Unknown to her 2 clients, deeper inside the depths of her clit are other Forinian children containing jirachi hybrids, forinian humans, and feral jirachis enjoying the same ride, just without the view of her fingers flickering her clit and a projection view of forest fields being treated like a pinball board. Back at Arlos's place in her window clit, they continue to play around her game as both of them play tag and car bump in the form of plastic balls. For Cellien, the moans coming from her mother turns her instinctive body slowly into a possible mating state as she gazes on the physical beauty of her father. In the goddess's case, what was supposed to be a 5 minute play on her goddess clit end up becoming a 20 minute masturbation involving pinching, pulling, flicking, rubbing, squeezing, and pushing her clit around her vagina with her fingers with an open view of the outside world until it triggers her orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone's fun time ends, the children return to their separate train and return to the spinal cord highway leading to the shoulders. In the case of Arlos and Cellien's case, the sight of his mate's gigantic lake of cum flowing out of her vagina made him erect. However, upon seeing  one of his children having her own heat and discovering her sexuality, \"Well ... great father. Great mother ... gave me an opportunity to see the fun and passion on discovering the fun of ... having sex. I ... had been curious and wanting to know and feel in practice what it is like. If ... you want, you can .. breed me if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he gets bombarded with he suddenness of the event, Jirachi removes her fingers from her girly parts followed by turning invisible very while slowly gliding around the sky above the forest. Focusing on her little skills, Jirachi returns to her substitute flesh form polished to have her texture like her original body. \"Welcome to the surprise my mate. You can have sex with us however you want. But you could also just look around inside my body and my many children. You have the choice now on what you want to do.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Want to get along the action my dear mate?\" looking at his actual Jirachi mate, she floats next to his throbbing dick just after loosening her mate's undergarment followed by giving it an oral blowjob just on the head while rubbing her tiny paws on the rest of his penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn need of giving his child a view of the action in a comfortable position, he lays on the floor on his back.

After a while, Jirach then begins on sucking in as much human dick as possible in her mouth to the point of constantly bumping in her throat. Even after licking the young girl's innards so much,  it comes from Arlos biting her outer vagina lips which triggers the young Jirachi's orgasm.

A black shadowy materialed bikini hid her private areas and chest, speaking of which,  Her arms were folded over her chest, squishing her massive cleavage.

Not a single noise can be heard here, except maybe the wind. You inhale deeply, the silence of the place bringing peace into your mind. This must be the perfect day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... At least, until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing a nearby plant rustling, you turn your head to see a Floatzel leaping out of the bushes, glaring at you. Then, without warning, it opens its mouth, shooting you with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are hit in your stomach and are sent backwards as the Floatzel attacks you once more, this time with its fangs. It bites your arm. You scream in pain as it's fangs sink into your arm. Gritting your teeth, you punch the Floatzel in the muzzle with your free arm, managing to pull off, a bite mark on your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Floatzel glares angrily at you. Why is it even doing this? You think as it charges again. It tackles you. Both of you end up falling into the lake behind. Bad thing. The Floatzel starts attacking repeatedly. You try surface, but the weasel simply won't let you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to lose consciousness.<br>\r\n\u2018I... I don't wanna die...\u2019 you think, desperately trying to fight back. And that's when something weird happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Have you got... the will to survive</i>?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a voice in your head. What was that?<br>\r\n\u2018I'm going to drown... I don't want to die...\u2019 you think again, the Floatzel not giving any sign of wanting to let you go. The voice is heard again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Very well. I shall aid you in this battle</i>...\u2019 it speaks. The last thing you notice before blacking out is a bright light coming from downwards. Then, you let darkness take you as you black out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up hours later. Your first though is<br>\r\n\u2018Am I... Am I dead?\u2019 you move from your laying position and bring a hand to your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better?\"  a soft, feminine voice suddenly asks. Your eyes slowly open. You take a look around, trying to spot whoever talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you notice is that you're in a cave. And slowly, your gaze falls on a golden creature, with a blue, star-shaped head; A red gem on its forehead and two tails lazily floating behind the creature, gems on them as well; Golden eyes are fixed on you. And, most of all, it's huge. At least 140 ft tall. You recognize it as the legendary pokemon Azelf. And a shiny one, too.<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you feeling better?\" the same, feminine voice you heard before, this time, you notice, is coming from Azelf, speaks again, making you assume it's a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes...\" you reply to her question.<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" you then ask. The pokemon gets closer to you. She picks you in her golden paw and brings you to eye level.<br>\r\n\"You were about to drown,\" she speaks calmly \" But I felt it. Your will to live. So I decided to help you. That Floatzel fled and I brought you here. I healed your wounds.\" you instinctively look at your arm, the one that Floatzel caught in its maw. The bite mark disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\" you thank her. Azelf smiles.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" her free paw comes to pat your head.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but... Where are we?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"We're in my cave, at the bottom of Lake Valor.\" she replies.<br>\r\n\"You mean... under the lake?!\" she nods.<br>\r\n\"Then... Could you bring me back up, so I can go home?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, she looks at you weirdly.<br>\r\n\"I've got something to tell you. I think we'll have to stay together... Master...\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Come again?\"<br>\r\n\"I have to stay with you. Your willpower was enough to wake me from my sleep, and I can see my master in you.\" she explains. The declaration takes you off guard. You stay silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Do you accept me as your pokemon?\" she asks you. You consider this. Azelf kindly saved you, why would you deny her request? So, you slowly nod. The willpower being smiles.<br>\r\n\"Well then. Welcome... home...\" she says, closing your body in a hug.<br>\r\n\"Wait, home? Aren't we going to my house?\" you ask. <br>\r\n\"Well... I doubt your house would... contain me, would it?\" Azelf replies, stifling a giggle. You can't really fight her logic, so you simply nod, willingly accepting to live with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" she says, starting to giggle.<br>\r\n\"Cute little master.\" she giggles, making you blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stay silent for a while, just staring at each other. You suddenly break the silence.<br>\r\n\"So... what now?\" Azelf cocks her head, seeming to be thinking.<br>\r\n\"Well...</span></div></div>",

Opening your eyes, you look around you being surrounded by bluish fur. <i>\"Bluish fur? What ... what is this place I am inside of?\"</i> gazing in a straight direction, it takes a moment for him to see this place rising up and sinking down along with constant rhythmic beats that vibrate around this blue world. Rubbing his hands on the floor being Uxie's chest, it felt warm as he feels connected to something, <i>\"Heartbeats? Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Is someone hugging me? How come this ... thing is big?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the cave with her sister arranging and setting the berries for their snack time, Uxie feels the human rubbing on her chest that happens to be close to one of her breasts where her heartbeat is closer. As she slowly opens her paws for the human to see her face, she focuses her mind to welcome her guest. <span class=\"cyellow\">\"Hello there young human. Are you feeling well already? The winter field almost got you frozen. Maybe you share your name with me.\"</span> it comes as no surprise to Uxie from seeing her rescued traveler gaze at her face and enormous size. \"Uhhh ...I am ... ok. Call me Mattison. Matt for short. Last I recall was travelling north heading to Snowpoint City so that I can tour the hidden places around it. So, who are you? Where am I? What pokemon are you? I haven't seen you before as a non-native to this region and its lore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"I am Uxie, the pokemon that helped human and pokemon discover and create knowledge.

Awww, your tiny human is awake. I'm Mesprit little human. You like her hugs?\"</span> the human nods to her answer. As her paw is about to grab the traveler, Uxie moves her paws away and keeping him safe from her ... enthusiastic clutches. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Uxie, I'm getting quite bored already and want to play soon! I'm certain that your urge is just now building up more and more. We have to be rid of it quickly, maybe have him involved too as your special guest. He looks like the kind of human that will enjoy what dates and couples do.\"</span> Though it is true that she called for her sister to help her with her developing sexual urges, just having the human she rescued get involved drastically shifts the flow of her 2 week schedule for her sexual heat began last midnight. However, the blizzard storm last night has messed up her lake that is in need of cleaning and maintenance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly getting further lost into the situation for the human to comprehend, he currently knows that this huge pokemon along with the other one rescued him from a freezing death. \"Uhhhh. Uxie. Mesprit. I'm not sure what is exactly going on here. I'm thankful for getting me out of the storm. I'm getting hungry. Perhaps after eating something, I can help you with something.\" Though he had encountered some gigantic pokemon before such as Steelixes, these two pokemon are 220 feet in size and who knows how heavy these girls are compared to you. A very fascinating encounter for Matt indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"Matt. I agree with your idea and start eating first. Then, if you want, I can telly you what is it that I need help with.\"</span> going with Matt's proposal, Uxie and Mesprit sat together and feast on the gigantic berries Mesprit brought. With a bit of convincing from the yellow head pixie, Mesprit gets the chance to have the human sit next to her right leg. Hearing their normal conversations to each other along with their title introductions to Matt, Mesprit sounds like a pokemon that has interacted with many humans due to how much she shares things about thin in the safe and not so safe topics for young listeners. Sitting next to the emotion pokemon's leg ends becoming an easy place for Matt to get a sniff of a wonderful fragrant smell to that of Yache Berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i><u>\"You smell that sweet fragrant?\"</u></i></span> he nods to Mesprit's gigantic figure upon hearing her telepathic voice in his head. <span class=\"chotpink\"><i><u>\"This was supposed to my play day. However, my sister called me last night to mend her sexual heat since she ... does it poorly. I'm not sure on what you can see in sex as a form of socialization and bonding. But I'm getting bored here because my play time is not happening today. I want all three of us to play together while helping with each other's current issues. If you allow me to have you play with us, maybe you can learn a few things from my sister on how a male and sexually please the female sex. Otherwise, you can just play with my female organs and explore it thoroughly. We promise that you will be fine wandering in our deepest private bodies. Pretty please? If not for me, it is simply to help my sister now so that she can stij with her boring activities.\"</u></i> </span> Matt is no stranger to the theme of sex discussions. With the slightly chilly atmosphere of the cave,  he is looking for a warmer place to get relaxed besides the warming hugs of Uxie or Mesprit. With a slight erection hat he got from smeling what Mesprit says as Uxie's heat, maybe going inside that one part you want to see may be something you get to do only once.</span></div></div>",

But for Matt, getting a campfire is still important in such a frigid place.

With parts of the field clear of snow turned to water, the human picks up the garden scraper and sweeps those leaves on the ground close to the pit hole while Uxie aids him briefly with its expansion. While he gets to see a few of the friendly resident pokemon eyeing him with curiosity, he continues sweeping the field from decayed leaves and a few fallen small and light branches into the pit hole.  As Matt hear the various pokespeeches happening, seeing them looking upwards meant that they are talking to Uxie. So he continues his work. Though you can still faintly smell the fragrant heat coming from her lower body as mentioned by her sibling Mesprit, he's got the feeling that he may have to do something about it eventually. Unknown to both of them, a small group of sneasels carry bundles of eggs with them. Sensing the opportunity for their own fun, they stole the baby eggs of Lake Acuity's pokemon residents hours ago and sneak their way to the back of the giantess knowledge pokemon where her pulsing vagina. Everytime she inhales, her vagina opens slightly as cold air travel inside. But for these weasels, her huge size opening is enough for them to slip through with their package in a few jumps. With their dark typing blocking all of Uxie's psychic detection, they continue their crawl until they reach the depth of her womb and set all of the eggs scattered inside her up to her ovaries. Finally, they wrap the eggs with dark type fur to prevent psychic moves from spotting it. Unfortunately for them, one of the eggs fell on the big pile of dead leaves during the transportation that just aligns on Uxie's heating vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both human and pokemon continue their chores with the addition of finding the missing eggs, Matt is the first one to finish his on-going job. As he heads to the pit hole with a new batch of fallen leaves to decompose, he finds the fallen egg. <i>\"What the? This is an egg. Is that...\"</i> just as he continues hearing Uxie's breathing job, a drop of her vagina cum falls a few steps away from his pile. <i>\"Oh. are you kidding me? Sneasels. I could get it for her right now. But... would she be ok with that? Maybe I ca finish those first. The get that problem out of the way.\"</i></span></div></div>",

Is that what you're trying to tell me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Vaporeon shakes her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her paw, she points first to herself, then to the lake, and in the end to Uxie again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a minute for your mind to put two and two together as you finally get the meaning of the Vaporeon's words.<br>\r\n\"Oh no, not again...\" you face palm.<br>\r\n\"Can this day get any weirder?\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\"> Why, may I ask?</span>\" a familiar voice talks from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head to see Mesprit staring down at you with a curious smile. Clearly, she has returned all the eggs to their respective places.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"chotpink\">Matt...</span></i>\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018Coming.\u2019 you mentally reply to Mesprit's telepathic voice. For the second time today, the Emotion pokemon is done pulling out pokemon from her sister. The Vaporeon had left when Mesprit started... 'working'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back to the lake, you notice Uxie with her paws on her eyes, a massive blush on her face, while Mesprit pats her back with a sympathetic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm...\" you try. Hearing you, Uxie raises her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\"> Mesprit, Matt, thanks for the help. I think I'll now go back into my cave and stay there until the season is over.</span>\" she says, disappearing in a flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward silence follows the next moments, when you look up at Mesprit.<br>\r\n\"Is she... always like this?\" you ask. The pink headed legendary gives a sigh.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Yes...</span>\" she says, before letting out a giggle.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You know, you've been a great help for Uxie... and for me as well. You're really a good person, Matt.</span>\" she with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush.<br>\r\n\"I did nothing...\" you say, looking elsewhere as a blush finds its place on your cheeks. Mesprit giggles again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Man, I'm sure Azelf would like you too...</span>\" she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Azelf?\" you ask<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\"> She's our third sister.</span>\" Mesprit explains, before  gently picking you in her paw.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Matt, it's just you and me now... why don't we play for a while?</span>\" she asks you, a noticeable, hopeful spark of hope in her golden eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really want to help Mesprit with her problem, but you also want to check on Uxie. She looked like she was about to cry before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a few moments of reflection, before deciding what to do...</span></div></div>",

What am I, 4 years old?\"</span> Mesprit she snickers while grinning down at you. You contemplate answering but decide not to; Age-related questions rarely have a good answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"No, here we play with emotions,\"</span> Mesprit continues as she lifts you off the ground with her psychic powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's n-nice,\" you stammer with the ground quickly receding underneath you, \"I, uh, take it you like causing fear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Please! I am the guardian of this lake, not some dual-typed hack-job!\"</span> Mesprit answers before putting her paw in front of her mouth with a sly expression, <span class=\"cpink\">\"I like evoking... Complex emotions.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picks you up in her other hand and holds you in front of her face. Her visage covers your view and you get the sinking feeling of what being a pesky insect must be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Do you think I'm big?\"</span> Mesprit asks coyly. Again you tamper with a question with no good answer, but you weren't going to shy away this time. The idea of a game intrigued you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you respond. Her smile widens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"And do you know why?\"</span> she continues with an inquisitive gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you answer honestly. The palm beneath you suddenly shifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Because... Of humans. Like you,\"</span> Mesprit speaks as her tone suddenly gets cold. This is accompanied by a force of pressure around you as her giant fist grabs a hold of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you didn't like fear!\" you shout out in terror and struggle to break free, your heart rattling your body as Mesprit lifts her arm a bit higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Look. What do you see?\"</span> Mesprit says before sighing and shaking her head, <span class=\"cpink\">\"You know what? Forget the question. You see a beautiful lake where only a decade ago was a smoking hole in the ground.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't notice. Instead you're looking around for Uxie, who should be truly impossible to miss but seems to have completely disappeared.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\"><br>\r\n\"Your kind beat us up and bombed this lake,\"</span> Mesprit continued while keeping her voice low enough as to not bring unwanted attention, <span class=\"cpink\">\"Why? To destroy the world. So yes, I know quite a bit about humans.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has nothing to do with me!\" you try to defend yourself, \"I'm strongly opposed to destroying the world! I live there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit lowered her hand and examined you for a moment. Her massive eyes, which had been charming not too long ago, now seemed rather imposing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"They hurt me. And my sisters, they were...\"</span> she spoke with a sullen voice as she closed her eyes and sighed,<span class=\"cpink\"> \"... Some guardian I turned out to be, huh...?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile completely gone, you can't help but feel a tinge of sadness for the floating giantess. Suddenly your feelings of fear were completely gone, as if whisked away by a mysterious force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What did they do?\" you ask with concern. Mesprit does not respond, but instead looks towards the sky.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\"><br>\r\n\"We entered a pact, my sisters and I,\"</span> Mesprit explained with a hint of appreciation, <span class=\"cpink\">\"That we would never let down this place again. That we would become powerful enough that nobody, not even Grovyle could best us ever again.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Ah!\" you exclaim with sudden realization, \"You made yourselves big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Exactly!\"</span> Mesprit chimed as her smile came back, <span class=\"cpink\">\"And so far, nobody's tried anything. It's almost kind of boring.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wind blew past you as Mesprit gently shifted her grip into an open palm, as you are awash with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Like REALLY boring,\"</span> she says with a smile, <span class=\"cpink\">\"Like I have to play games with people's emotions by pretending to be all vengeful and remorseful and stuff just to pass the time.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up, and then stand up. The ground is nice and squishy, but more importantly you feel the pressure of the grip as well as heavy emotions take their leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Did you experience some lovely emotions? Hehehe, I did,\"</span> Mesprit snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait, was that all bullshit?!\" you exclaim in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"No no, it was all true,\"</span> Mesprit admits with a nervous shrug, almost making you tumble off your perch, <span class=\"cpink\">\"The emotions were fabricated, of course. Why would I blame a cutie like you for doing anything but stealing my h-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't. Finish that sentence,\" you interrupt and rub your forehead again, \"Don't play with my emotions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"You consented!\"</span> Mesprit retorts as she begins to lower you down to the ground again, <span class=\"cpink\">\"Kind of?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to help...\" you mutter stubbornly and touch down on the tickling grass, noticing a few Pok\u00e9mon scurry off back to the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"And you have!\" </span>Mesprit exclaims as she sat down in front of you with her legs crossed and her tails hanging across her shoulders, <span class=\"cpink\">\"Being big and strong is my duty but it has a couple of shortcomings. You can never again eat your fill. Sleep under a nice, safe roof. And the pleasures of the flesh...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spends an inordinate amount of time staring you down after this last remark. You have suddenly discovered an extremely fascinating cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"You grow to 200ft and suddenly you're not attractive anymore!\" </span>she rants while throwing her hands up in the air, <span class=\"cpink\">\"But my sister, oh no - She just gets into the water and the guys are piling up inside her!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloud begins to take on the shape of a vagina. You dismiss it and begin to examine another, less lewdly formed cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"I'm literally plucking horny Pok\u00e9mon out of my sister's cooch and I think to myself, hey! Wouldn't it be nice to get something in return?\"</span> she recalls with annoyance as a noticeable blush begins to spread across her cheeks, <span class=\"cpink\">\"Maybe my sister would NOT HOG the only guy I've taken an interest in for the past decade?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis cloud too betrays your expectation and begins to show vision of ecstasy. Out of options, you look back at the titanic Pok\u00e9mon who has an expectant expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Sorry, I was busy not thinking about sex,\" you reply bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sighs. Inside her a fire is lit, and she knows only one thing can put it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Look. I need you,\" </span>she says bluntly as she suddenly leans forward, her enormous head casting a shadow over your puny form, <span class=\"cpink\">\"I... Desperately want you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh!\" you reply with all the finesse of a startled caveman, the ground shakes as Mesprit's body lays flat on it, her entire being pointing towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"My head's spinning...\"</span> she breathes with a sultry voice as she feels dizzy with lust, imagining all sorts of sexy scenarios with her little human,<span class=\"cpink\"> \"I want you to touch me, climb all over my body, reach inside of me and-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, delirium!\" you shout in an attempt to interrupt as you scramble to your feet, \"I hear it's really bad to make hasty decisions! Could be lethal... For someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words seem to be having no effect as her gigantic hand reaches towards you. It was more than just a hand though, it was a promise of a 'good time', a portal to a place where the wishes of this pink and blue titaness are law. You've always been proud of your spiriting capabilities however, and if you're fast you might make it to the lake, where you might be able to take a breather (figuratively) and collect your thoughts. It does seem like its inhabitants have a way of ending up where you're going regardless, but the decision is up to you.</span></div></div>",

After all, you don't quite know what awaits around that lake, and the only pokemon that could help you is currently dealing with her own sexual problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then again, what if Uxie tries to do things to you as well? Sure, she has proved herself able to resist to her urges, but you don't want to risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, before you even know it, you find yourself once again 'safely' enclosed in Mesprit's fist. She brings you to her looming face, her golden eyes sparkling with lust. Soon, you hear her talk:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I'm hungry, little guy,</span>\" she pants, no longer able to repress her urges.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\"> It's an hunger only you can satisfy right now.</span>\" the red shade on her cheeks becomes deeper - if she was any fire type, she would be steaming now. You really regret not dashing in direction of the lake when you still had time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to do anything, you just stare as the giantess moves to sit upright again, and all in a unnervingly slow pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the titaness finally manages to move to a sitting position, she stares at you once again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">At last...</span>\" you hear her whisper. A whisper full of lust.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I waited the whole day for this to happen. But Uxie just kept me from having you for the whole time. Over and over, keeping you busy with chores, and keeping me busy with the eggs. I even had to pull other pokemon out of her, just because she didn't want you to.</span>\" at this point she gives an exasperated sigh.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I even tried helping her with her own problems, but, since she doesn't want to have them solved, so be it! But now I'm going to solve mine, no matter what!</span>\" this last sentence, pronounced in a determined voice, makes your body freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit is willing to do anything to have her 'fun'. And she's pretty much terrorising you right now. What so far has been a nice, playful pokemon had left, leaving a lustful beast in her place, and you can't do nothing about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth is practically drooling at this point as she grins down at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Ready? Because I sure am! And I just know how to start...</span>\" she manages to bring out a cheerful tone as she lies down, placing you on the blue, furry surface of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Now, <i>my</i> little one, climb down. And remember,</span>\" her tone suddenly gets darker as she speaks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You're in no hurry.</span>\" the mischievous sparkle can once again be seen in her titanic eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">And please me as much as you can while you go.</span>\" she adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot daring to defy the request of the delirious pokemon, you start slowly walking downwards, occasionally stopping to rub the furry surface beneath your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit moans. Finally. She had awaited this for so long... At last, she finally got to play!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out another ear-breaking moan, she brings one of her paw to her already wet pubic area, starting to rub it as she feels you rubbing, squeezing or stroking through her bluish fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore moans join the first ones in their trip out of Mesprit's mouth as she continues her activity. Her eyes are closed, her mouth is drooling; her heart is galloping within her chest, her tails are swinging wildly, while her mind is coming up with new ways to continue this afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<span class=\"chotpink\">F-Finally... S-so gr-great...</span>\u2019 she mentally stammers, having fully surrendered to the intense pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, just as you take your first step on the titanic surface of her belly, she comes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that stops her liquids from rocketing out of her womanhood is her own paw, that gets stained with the stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that she has stopped, you look back at Mesprit's face, far away from you. She's resting her head on the snowy ground, breathing heavily. And, as a result, her belly rises up and falls down in an extremely fast rhythm, making you hang to the thick strands of blue fur in order to not fall off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">That... was... great!</span>\" you hear her pant after a while as her breath slows down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, her clean paw reaches out for you as she sits upright again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, before you can even talk, she brings you up to her face, shoving her lips into your upper body. You flush bright red as a burning sensation pervades you. Seriously, can this day get any weirder?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">That was fun!</span>\" Mesprit chimes as she pulls of, letting a sinister grin take place on her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">But it was only the beginning. The <b> serious</b></span> stuff comes now!</span>\" she declares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself gulping down in fear. Which Mesprit seems to detect. She looks at you with a smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">No need to be afraid, my little cutie. I would never hurt you... not after this...</span>\" she states, before assuming her mischievous expression once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">So... Ready for the real thing?</span>\" she asks, starting to lower you toward her dripping sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pointlessly try to break out of her grip, but the psychic type is determined, now more than ever. And so, you just surrender, once again regretting not running away when you could do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of her nether regions is now getting closer. Whatever she wishes to do now, you're pretty much sure you won't be liking it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</div></div>",

Even though one part of MATT really says that this is so drastic, a part of him is finally excited to finally get the chance to own a giant pokemon and breed them for all their worth. If she was originally smaller than the average human, it would be just as fun as her gigantic form. Now fully focus on inseminating her, some minutes later throughout the rumping, moaning, and screaming, Mesprit releases a bunch of orgasms which stains the snowy floor below as more of his cum gets controlled by mesprit's baby canal muscles to go deep in her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long for Mesprit to switch positions with Matt below as Mesprit is the one who rides Mat like a true poke cowgirl riding a shaky tauros. \"Aaaaaahhhh! MESPRIT! I GOTTA CUM MORE! TAKE IT! TAKE IT GIRL!\" to play along with her orgasm and sexual high, Matt uses both of his hands to squeeze her blue breasts and nipples as hard as possible. Mesprit ends up loving the pain of pleasure she is getting from the touch as her womb gets filled up more and more. And within 20 minutes, Matt passes out while Mesprit continues riding Matt's erect cock to milk his entire baggage to cum and feed it to her womb as an ointment from scratching her womb excessively. With her heat finally cured and her egg cells being fertilized with human cells and sperm, she rubs her belly with a smile. Add another ten minutes later, he stops cumming and returns to his original size pinned in her vagina lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"chotpink\">\"It's time for you to nap Mat.

But you weren't at Lake Verity, so I thought you'd be here.</span>\" she then briefly glances around.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\"> Where's Uxie?</span>\" she then asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit opens her paws to shrug. With gravity working against you, you fall down, letting out a startled scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf seems notice you. And so does Mesprit. Her paw quickly travels beneath you, stopping your fall as you land on it and lay still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Mesprit, who's this human? What is he doing with you?</span>\" the blue pokemon asks, pointing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit carefully choses her words.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Well... he's a friend. And we're not doing anything...<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">unfortunately...</font></span>\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit then shifts her gaze on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">My dear little one, in case you didn't get it, this is Azelf, my second sister.</span>\" she says you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering all of your courage, you look at the blue pokemon.<br>\r\n\"Uhm... I'm Matt... nice to meet you.\" you introduce yourself, trying to use a calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf looks at you perplexed. She blinks a few times, as if wanting to make sure you're real, before looking at Mesprit again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Mesprit, did you forget our deal? \u2018Don't trust humans, no matter what\u2019?</span>\" she asks, recalling what you assume is the deal Mesprit talked about earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emotion pokemon frowns.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Of course I didn't, sister. But he's not like the others,</span>\" she explains. Why do they keep talking like you're not there?<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">He's actually really nice. He has been helping Uxie with the lake. And he has been helping me with... things.</span>\" this last sentence makes you blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf's gaze travels back on you. She stares at you silently for a moment, before a small smile takes place on her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Well, this does change things. I'm Azelf, by the way,</span>\" she finally talks to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have offered your hand for her to shake, but you <br>\r\nare barely able to squirm in Mesprit's tight hug. So you just return the smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Say, Azelf,</span>\" you hear Mesprit speak as she places you back against her chest. She wipes her other paw clean on the ground, before it joins the other in her hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf looks at her sister.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You said you were looking for me?</span>\" Mesprit asks. The blue pixie nods slowly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Yes. When I didn't find you at Lake Verity, I thought you were visiting Uxie. So I came here.</span>\" she confirms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Alright. But why were you searching for me in the first place?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf blushes at the question. Her paw travels to the back of her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Well... you see... maybe it's not the case, but...</span></span></div></div>",

It's been a while we don't hear her, right Mesprit?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting aside her issues for a moment, Mesprit assumes a concerned expression.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You do have a point.</span>\" she admits.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Why? What happened to Uxie?</span>\" Azelf asks with sudden concern.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">It's a long story,</span>\" Mesprit seems to ponder something, before turning her attention to you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Little one, go find Uxie. I'll explain this to Azelf.</span>\" Mesprit says, settling you down on the snow-covered ground of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly nodding at her, you start walking away somewhat relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon hear Mesprit starting to talk, her voice muffled by the thick vegetation. You keep walking until her voice can't be heard anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way to the lake, soon having to stop in front of the surface of it. You observe your own reflection in the crystalline water, trying to figure out how to get to the cave where Uxie most probably is right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, the spirit of a certain yellow headed pixie is currently floating around. Uxie abruptly stops, having felt your presence.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You...</span>\" she whispers as she notices you starting right at her cavern. She quickly understands that you want to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Uxie's spirit floats its way back into her body, which is collocated inside of Acuity Cavern. True, there isn't enough space for for her to even sit upright...but there is plenty of space for her to at least lay down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly returning to her senses, Uxie moves slightly, before teleporting out of her cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep staring at the lake, trying to come up with a way to reach that cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, suddenly, a titanic shadow covers your whole form. Slowly, you look upwards. Just to discover Uxie looming over you, a small smile on her face.<br>\r\n\"Uxie!... How are you feeling?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on the giantess' face grows wider. Soon, you find her arms reaching down to pick you. Her paws gently wrap around your waist and lift you off ground, bringing you to the titaness' face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I feel much better, thank you.</span>\" she replies to your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm sorry Uxie.\" you quickly add. The smile fades from her face as she cocks her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">For what?</span>\" she asks with a soft voice.<br>\r\n\"I... none of that would have happened if I had noticed it earlier.\" you say, trying to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie remains completely silent for the few, following moments. You just keep staring at her, waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, instead, you feel yourself being pushed forward. Right into one of the giantess' cheeks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">That's sweet. But you don't have to blame yourself for something you didn't do. It simply happened, it's not your fault.</span>\" she speaks while she nuzzles you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken back by the sudden display of affection, you can't help but blush. The knowledge pokemon continues.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Speaking of, you did a really good job around here,</span>\" she pauses as she lets a giggle escape her mouth.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You've been a great help to me. You have my sincere thanks.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing.\" you say, awkwardly rubbing the back of your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can add anything else, you're pushed forward again. This time, though, not into the giantess' cheek, you're pushed into her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your body burning hot as her lips briefly connect with your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she pulls off, you try to find something to say, when something catches your attention.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Uxie,\" you call out.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Yes?</span>\"<br>\r\n\"Now that I think about it... why you always keep your eyes closed?\" you ask. Only to immediately regret asking. Maybe it's a too personal question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Oh... that...</span>\" you hear her mutter. She moves her head elsewhere for a moment, before turning your attention back on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'll tell you. Just... just promise me you won't freak out, alright?</span>\" you nod slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie sighs deeply before answering:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well... the thing is that I can actually wipe memories of those who look at me in the eyes away. Shortly,<br>\r\nif you look into my eyes, you'll forget everything.</span>\" she explains her own power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain silent, trying to process what she just said.<br>\r\n\u2018<span class=\"cyellow\">Damn! Why did you tell him? How are you supposed to keep friends if you keep scaring them?!</span>\u2019 Uxie mentally scolds herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... that's cool... I guess...\" you say after a bit.<br>\r\n\"Is that why those Sneasels looked so scared when you opened your eyes earlier?\" she nods slowly.<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you saw the looks on their faces, it was worth it.\" you try, effectively making the giantess giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie slightly floats forward, sitting down on the ground.<br>\r\n\"So... what now?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You know, there's still a lot of chores to do around the lake... but I think they can wait for a while.</span>\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Uxie,\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit told me why you three grew to 200 ft.\" what you assume is an interested expression takes place on the titaness' face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Did she tell you about the deal? About Azelf?</span>\" you nod at her.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, Azelf is actually here now.\" you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Azelf here?... What else did I miss?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Ehm... nothing...\" you say, deliberately skipping Mesprit's emotion game and the other 'game' that preceded Azelf's arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie seems to be thinking.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">May I ask you something?... Maybe... Do me a favor?</span>\" she then asks. You nod at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well, as I said, our chores can wait for a bit. But now... I... ehm... kind of... needed... ehm... some... 'help'...</span>\" she states, a pink shade appearing on her yellow cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing about her current state, you quickly understand what she means with 'help'. Sure, this might be the opportunity to get over with it once and for all, but you're still very reluctant about the idea. After all, you did get away from Mesprit and Azelf for a reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze upwards, noticing the giantess silently awaiting for your answer. Sure, you could also convince her to wait for a bit. You could convince her to catch up with her sister's first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, you choose to...</span></div></div>",

You're dripping with the giantess' juices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCertain that Mesprit and Azelf would be weirded out if they see you like this, you decide to take a small bath into the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you walk over the shore and hop into the water, that does its job in cleaning your form from Uxie's liquids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swim around for a couple of minutes, before getting out of the water, doing your best to dry yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you manage to dry yourself - and it wasn't easy to do so - you start thinking about what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf and Mesprit are most likely worried about you and Uxie - you figure out Mesprit is worried mostly about you - for not showing up yet.

Regarding what happened twice today, you are tempted to stick around to make sure it doesn't happen again.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to stick around. Even though she was satiated, Uxie still emanates that sweet smell and, if you leave, other horny pokemon could just slip up inside her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you really don't want Mesprit having to pull them out again, especially not after her earlier outburst, which was followed by a sudden declaration of devotion towards you. You're not quite sure if she was sincere or she was just delirious with lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off those memories, you sit down near Uxie's hip and lean back into her fur. The warmth her body carries, along the sounds coming from within her, is very soothing. You are almost tempted to take a nap right there and then. After all, all the struggling you did in order to pleasure Uxie was really tiring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, you can rest your eyes for a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first minute you feel drowsy. The second your eyelids are heavy. The third you catch yourself yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Aw! Aren't they just cute? I could just eat them up!...well, not sure about Uxie...</span>\" the last remark fully awakens you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes, finding two large paws snatching you up. You are pressed against a pink, fleshy surface and you are rubbed up and down against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you hear another voice talking.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Careful Mesprit. He's still asleep.</span>\" you recognize the voice as Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place a hand on Mesprit's cheek and roughly push yourself backwards, catching her attention.<br>\r\n\"I <i>was</i> asleep, Azelf,\" you say, looking right into Mesprit's eyes, not bothering to hide your irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess, which has a surprised look on her pink face, suddenly shows off her brightest smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Did I wake you up? Hehehe, sorry! You're just too cute while you sleep!</span>\" she giggles.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever.\" you reply, looking elsewhere as you blush faintly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Say, how come both you and Uxie were asleep?</span>\" Mesprit casually asks at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat at the question, but you feign confusion.<br>\r\n\"I don't follow. What do you mean?\" you ask back.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I mean, I asked you to find Uxie. Now, you obviously did, but you didn't come back afterwards. Me and Azelf decided to check if everything was alright, and we found you asleep. Why?</span>\" you don't know how to answer. You saw this coming, why didn't you do anything to prevent it?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just say silent, both giantesses eyeing you with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Wait... are you feeling alright?</span>\" your face must be burning hot with embarrassment and, surely enough, you are blushing. Drops of sweat start running down your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit continues:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I don't think you are. You're all red,</span>\" she places a paw on your forehead.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You're burning, too. I don't think the cold is doing any good to you, maybe-</span>\" she stops in mid sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething just caught her interest.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">What are you looking at, Mesprit?</span>\" Azelf, who has been quiet for the whole time, suddenly asks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">There.</span>\" Mesprit points to Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018There we go...\u2019 you sourly think as the giantess leans down, inspecting her sister. And her golden eyes widen with surprise as she spots a non indifferent puddle near the pixie's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Mesprit looks at you. Then at Uxie. Then at you again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she finally understands the reason of your weird behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Did you... did you two... In don't know... have fun?</span>\" she asks, no longer looking cheerful as she used to. Instead, she now looks dead serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat golden stare of hers holds you in place. You're like paralyzed. You timidly nod, answering her. Is it you, or she looks even more imposing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Without me?</span>\" she asks, mostly to herself. Before you can reply, she repeats her words.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Without me...</span>\" her eyes look void as she continues.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">So...she really did it... my only interest in the past ten years...</span>\" she whispers. Considering the situation, she's being surprisingly calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze fixes back on you. You look elsewhere, and notice Azelf staring at the scene with a mix of concern and curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit stares down at you for an incalculable amount of time. Feels like a lot of time passed when she talks again:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Well... if you both will excuse me, I've got something to do.</span>\" she says, gently lowering you to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, before you could talk, she turns around and floats into the forest again. At a rather fast pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to face Azelf, who stares back down at you without saying a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of absolute silence follow Mesprit's sudden 'disappearing'. You finally force yourself to break the silence.<br>\r\n\"What's up with her?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf eyes you with a weird look. She studies you for a few minutes before answering:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Don't you realize? Mesprit really likes you.</span>\" she says slowly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">You know the talk me and her had? She talked about Uxie for about two minutes,</span>\" the blue titaness gives a deep sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">\u2018Little guy here, little guy there...\u2019</span>\" she stops and briefly looks away, as if reluctant to end her phrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">\u2018I love the little human,\u2019</span>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one last remark makes your heart sink. So she wasn't delirious earlier... well, maybe she was, but she really had feelings for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf continues.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Look, you seem a nice human. Despite our pact, I don't blame you, you were just helping Uxie with her problem,</span>\" she says, showing that she isn't holding any hard feelings towards you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">But if you want an advice, you should apologize to Mesprit. I know, you did nothing bad, but she would feel better for sure if you did.</span>\" she says, going silent again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, she's expecting an answer.<br>\r\n\"Er... thanks Azelf. You know, we never had the chance to know each other better, but you seem a nice pokemon.\" you say. She smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">And now I know why Mesprit is acting that way. You're sweet. Who knows, maybe you can help me with my own problems later on.</span>\" she says, winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence returns between the two of you as you think about what to do. Apologizing to Mesprit seems a pretty good idea right now, but she looked rather upset when she left, though she hid that very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should wait for her to calm down a bit before finding her, but what comes next is up to you.</span></div></div>",

But the big, scary Mesprit doesn't get any attention. Why?... Well,<br>\r\nthere's still the little one. He can help me!\u2019.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! You felt betrayed!\" you exclaim with sudden realization. She nods down at you, looking somewhat dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush as an awkward silence falls between the two of you, interrupted just by the distant cries of the inhabitants of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit talks again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Look, I forgive you for it, alright? You only meant to help, you hadn't any bad intentions. But now,</span>\" you find her paw reaching out for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess roughly closes her fist around you and places you down in front of her with great strength. You end up sinking up to your ankles into the snow that covers the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shot Mesprit an inquisitive look, and you find her slowly spreading her legs. A pink shade covers your cheeks as her vertical lips come into view, the scent of her heat now even more strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her as you hear her voice.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">... but now, I want - I need! - you. I can't wait any longer, I don't want to wait any longer!</span>\" she shouts, all her desires, all her lust returning to her in a mere instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the titaness is terrorising you. But this time you aren't going to shy away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou free your feet from the frosty hug of the snow, and take a step forward. Mesprit grins.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Glad you're willing to do this. Come on!</span>\" she encourages you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, you walk towards her already wet sex, the scent of her heat growing stronger each step you take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop when you reach the entrance of her love tunnel. You gaze up at Mesprit, who nods down at you. You take a deep breath, filling your lungs with that wonderful scent.<br>\r\n\u2018Alright, here goes!\u2019 you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start slowly rubbing her sex, lacking ideas of how to start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour actions are greeted by a \u2018Oh!\u2019 coming from the giantess. But Mesprit soon finds pleasure in your touch on her sensible nether regions, and starts moaning blissfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you find her paw reaching you. You move aside, keeping rubbing, as her fingers slowly penetrate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit keeps howling in pleasure while she fingers herself. Soon, you start speeding up your rubbing, the surface growing wetter beneath your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also squeeze and stroke her pubic area, while the giantess starts speeding up as well, her paw now moving frenetically beside you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">F-Finally! I waited f-for so long!</span>\" Mesprit's voice comes from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, after a few more minutes, she lets out a sharp moan as she comes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leap backwards as a white, sticky liquid flows out of her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she removes her paw. And you take the moment.<br>\r\n\u2018Now or never.\u2019 you think to yourself as you make your way towards her lips again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you slip right up inside her slit. Once again today, you find yourself inside a dark, hot, sticky and fleshy cavern. The smell Mesprit emanates is so strong in here that it makes it hard for you to stand on your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"chotpink\">Little one?!</span></i>\u2019 she telepathically shouts.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Let's finish this up, Mesprit.</i>\u2019 you reply. A second of silence follows. You swear you can see that grin of hers painting itself on her face.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"chotpink\">Whatever you're up to... do it...</span></i>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod to nobody in particular, and start wiggling inside her, immediately backing her in pure bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start venturing deeper inside, squeezing the fleshy walls of the love tunnel as you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you walk right back to the entrance, sliding your whole body against your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep this up for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub the walls upwards, stroke them downwards, lick them upwards, scratch them downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle frenetically, worshipping the giantess' insides, like this all is a game of goddess and slave, with you playing the slave, pleasing the pink headed goddess as she demanded, willingly granting each and every of her whishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll while she keeps moaning blissfully, threatening to break both your eardrums each time she does.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Y-Yes... l-love! L-Love... t-this!</span>\" you didn't need telepathy to hear that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems forever, a second wave of white stuff erupts around you, washing you towards the entrance of her sex, and marking the end of this 'game' of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are literally spat out of Mesprit's body, and you are sent flying at short distance from her now stained sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to stand tall anymore, you collapse on your back. And so does Mesprit, the ground shook by a violent quake as she lays down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you just rest there, panting heavily. But it's not long before you find one of Mesprit's tails sliding beneath your form. It's wide enough to fit three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you are brought to the giantess' face. She rises one of her arms to get a hold of you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You... were... that was... lovely...</span>\" she breathes heavily as she uses her free paw to wipe you clean from her own juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she's done, she cuddles you to her face. And, suddenly, you start to feel dizzy. Your vision become blurry and you end up falling unconscious right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Wake up, cutie!</span>\" you moan out in your sleep, not wanting to leave the embrace of sleep just yet.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Wake up! It isn't nice to keep a girl waiting, is it?</span>\" the voice speaks again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your eyes, before opening them. And you're greeted back to reality by two very familiar twin, huge golden mirrors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that they belong to the pink face of a certain giantess who is currently holding you.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit?\" you call out.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Quite the sleeper you are! I was starting to think you weren't going to wake up anytime soon.</span>\" she says, bringing you to her cheek, nuzzling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push yourself back.<br>\r\n\"How much time did I sleep?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">More or less, two hours. You look so cute while you sleep~</span>\" she says. You blush, even though you're glad that her cheerful attitude is back. You prefer the cheerful Mesprit over the delirious and the mad one.<br>\r\n\"I take it I am fully forgiven?\" you ask with a hint of hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess nods with energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we, Mesprit?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Still in the forest. The sun settled, like, half an hour ago.</span>\" she replies.<br>\r\n\"Aren't your sisters worried about us?\" she gives a smirk.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">They can wait.</span>\" she replies, flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but what if they come searching for us and find out what we did... how are we going to explain this?\" you ask. Seriously, this day has been the weirdest of your life so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if Azelf and Uxie discover what you did? What would Uxie say? She seems like she could handle this kind of revelation, but what if she reacts like Mesprit? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Will you stop worrying so much, you?</span>\" Mesprit suddenly asks. You quickly recall that she can feel emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her huge head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You worry too much if you ask me. Maybe I can fix that,</span>\" <br>\r\n\"I'd prefer if you didn't.\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">... Why do you want to leave already? Don't you like my company?</span>\" she asks teasingly.<br>\r\n\"I already told you Mesprit.\" the giantess gives her signature giggle, before looking at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles sweetly, before talking again...</span></div></div>",

How long can a pokemon sleep? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the sun settling over the horizon. You figure that if you wait for too long, you may get lost in the woods. So you decide to go find the being of emotions now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...

You have no clue of where Mesprit went, but it should be pretty impossible for her to go anywhere unseen. She must be somewhere around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, in fact, after a few minutes of research, an odd sound catches your ears. It was like... a sob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the direction where it came from, you arrive to a small clearing. Though it is still large enough to contain the familiar huge body of a certain pink headed, golden eyed pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you expected that Mesprit was still around, but you couldn't possibly have anticipated what you're seeing: Mesprit, face down on the ground, crying. Although she's doing it very silently, the small puddle of tears around her head suggests she's been crying for quite a while. She didn't calm down at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight successfully breaks through your heart.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit.\" you sadly call out for her. She ignores you. But she definitively heard you, you judge as her sobs grow louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over her face, that is hidden in the two slim walls of fur that are her arms.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Mesprit.\" you say, patting one of her hands. Not exactly the place you intended to pat, but it's really the only part of her body you can reach with ease.<br>\r\n\"Come on, calm down. I'm... I'm really sorry for what I did...\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to make you cry... I just wanted to help... Please, forgive me...\" you literally beg, trying to get some kind of reaction from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink and blue titaness does not respond to your words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find nothing more to say to comfort her. You feel your eyes starting to get wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only wanted to help Uxie, I didn't realize you'd react like this. So maybe I should... maybe I should leave...\" you say, fighting back tears. Why in the world are you feeling so sad? Is she playing with your emotions again? Is she deliberately making you feel sad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Mesprit doesn't answer, and keeps crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop patting her.<br>\r\n\"So... er... bye...\" you say, starting to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as you take two steps, one huge, very familiar looking tail gently lands in front of you, halting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back Mesprit, but you find her hand approaching you. In a moment, you are brought to her face and you are pressed against it. As a result, you find yourself pinned between her paw and her cheek, her warm tears now freely pouring down on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a desperate attempt to calm her down, you hug her face.<br>\r\n\"Come on... stop crying... I'm sorry...\" you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness finally opens her eyes and looks down at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">\u2018I'm sorry\u2019 is not enough.

I-I...</span>\" she interrupts herself. You sigh deeply.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit, I apologize to you. What I did was unfair, alright? I admit it, I've been an idiot. I... I just hope you'll forgive me...\" you state, lowering your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go silent, expecting an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Mesprit bringing her other paw to her eyes, wiping her tears away.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">As mean that could have been... I can't hate you for it. And I can't fabricate emotions in myself.</span>\" she says, releasing you from her hug.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">If you... if you truly did it just to help my sister...</span>\"<br>\r\n\"No other reason.\" you assure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a deep breath before saying it:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">...

I forgive you alright, but we aren't even.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smile drops.<br>\r\n\"We aren't?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Nope. So, what are going to do about it?</span>\" you figure out that she wanted to bring you right here. But you really don't want to give up on your friendship... or whatever it is with her. She and Uxie saved you, so the least you can do is agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you hastily respond:<br>\r\n\"Anything.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swear you can see her eyes widening, a smirk appearing on her pink face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">... Anything you say?</span>\" you nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes silent, staring down at you for a few moments.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I think you know pretty well what I want.</span>\" she finally says. You can feel something in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to...?\" you ask. She nods her gigantic head. You just seem to notice the smell of her heat getting stronger.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">So, we're here, alone, and nobody to interrupt. There won't be a better moment, trust me. If you really want to make it up to me, here's your chance.</span>\" Mesprit says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then spreads her legs, revealing her pubic area. Which is already wet with anticipation.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Come on...</span>\" she encourages you with a sultry voice, her pink cheeks becoming red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what to do. Sure, you could help her with her... issue straightaway. After all, you already did it once, and you found it wasn't so lethal as you expected it to be. But the idea still comprehensibly scares you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then again, Mesprit is much more... wild than Uxie, what guarantees that you'll be still alive after it? Maybe you can convince her to wait still a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few moments to decide, before finally replying...</span></div></div>",

Are you really unable to breed with other species?\" She does not answer your question of curious intent should she refuse to let her have just one orgasm.

Meaning that she is done. You finally managed to fix her problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully, she isn't going to talk about sex to you for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spends the next twenty minutes recovering from such a violent orgasm. Her mouth opens and closes as she inhales air, greedily filling up her lungs. Her whole body shakes lightly, still taking pleasure from your presence inside her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a good amount of time, she pulls her paw - and you along - out of her still dripping slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are greeted back to the outside world by a nice, pale moonlight. And by the looming, pink, smiling face of a certain giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Hehehe, you should see yourself, cutie!</span>\" she snickers, while that familiar grin of hers takes its characteristic place on her visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as she instructed. And you notice that you're covered from head to toe in a thick layer of the white substance that came out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before you can actually reply, Mesprit brings you to her lips, smooching your face, which immediately starts burning bright with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You've been fantastic. Just fantastic.</span>\" she says with a smile, a she starts wiping your body clean with her free paw.<br>\r\n\"So...er... are we even now?\" you ask, making sure that she notices the hope in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile widens.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Of course! All forgotten!</span>\" she says, bringing you to her cheek, nuzzling you.<br>\r\n\"Anything to help...\" you whisper, unable to breath properly as you're being smothered between her paws and her cheek.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Aw! Some sweetie you are!</span>\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after several minutes, she pulls off, letting you breath again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Come on, you. Let's head back. My sisters are probably worried about us.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spends another minute cleaning off her crotch, before venturing into the now dark forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes her just a few minutes to get back to the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first things you see are the silhouettes of two familiar gigantic pokemon, that you immediately recognize as Mesprit's sisters, Azelf and Uxie, who apparently had woke up while you were with Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them turn their heads to face their sister.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">There you are, you two. I was starting to think we weren't going to see you both anytime soon.</span>\" Azelf says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mesprit ignores her, her gaze fixed on Uxie. Who looks somewhat ashamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow headed pixie is the first to break the silence.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'm sorry, Mesprit. I had no idea-</span>\" Mesprit interrupts her. You understand that Azelf told Uxie what happened after she fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to fear Mesprit's reaction. What if she isn't willing to forgive Uxie? The last thing you want is that they start to fight over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, against your expectations, Mesprit smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Don't you worry, sister! Everything's alright!</span>\" she chimes, grabbing Uxie in a hug. The pixie returns it with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have been a heartwarming scene, if it wasn't for the fact that you are in the middle of their hug. And, as a result, you're being crushed.<br>\r\n\"Girls... my lungs... can't breath...\" you whisper, trying to use the smallest amount of air to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the two seem to hear you and break the hug. You find yourself struggling for air on Uxie's open palm.<br>\r\n\"<b>Sorry!</b>\" both of them apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf smiles at the scene, glad that Mesprit didn't hold any hard feelings towards Uxie. She can't help but think that the reason of Mesprit's jealousy was a bit stupid - a common, little human. What had this guy to steal Mesprit's heart? She decides that she's going to find out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Say, Mesprit. You look much happier than this morning. May I ask you why?</span>\" Uxie asks. Mesprit looks at you sweetly, before looking back at her sister.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I'll let you guess~</span>\" she sings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes Uxie less than a second to realize.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You two...?</span>\" Mesprit eagerly nods. Uxie's smile shrinks a little.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well, looks like our problem is finally solved.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Yes. All thanks to this cutie here~</span>\" Mesprit chimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Azelf starts to feel cut out.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Hey, is anyone hungry? I'm starving!</span>\" she says. Mesprit and Uxie look at her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Now that you bring that up...</span>\" Uxie says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I'm pretty hungry too.</span>\" Mesprit adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner said than done, the three gather a large amount of berries, and settle them down. Uxie proceeds to set you down as well. You snatch a few berries for yourself and lean against the trunk of a tree, watching as the three giantesses hungrily consume their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pile of berries soon disappears, gulped down by the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, they yawn at unison.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well, we might as well get some sleep,</span>\" Uxie turns her head towards you at this one point, and smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Today was pretty tiring.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You're right. It was really tiring. But full of new emotions~</span>\" Mesprit's gaze also travels down to you. You notice Azelf shaking her head behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">So, ready to take a nice, long rest little guy?</span>\" Mesprit asks you, extending a paw for you to hop on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can do so, however, Uxie stops you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Wait, Mesprit,</span>\" she says, before turning her attention on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Little one, I'd like you to... uhm...</span>\" a blush spreads on her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't understand what she's trying to says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Er... I'd like if you... wanted to sleep with me tonight...</span>\" she admits shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush at the sudden request. But Mesprit frowns.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Uxie, he's mine.</span>\" she calmly says. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">No, Mesprit. He's not yours. And he's not mine. He's a free guy, completely capable to choose.</span>\" Uxie speaks. You discover Azelf staring at the scene with a curious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emotion pokemon cocks her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">But we...</span>\" Uxie interrupts.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I know, he fixed your problem. But he fixed mine as well,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess turns her head to look at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">And that's why I believe that it would be fair to let you choose.</span>\" she says. Mesprit stares at her sister for a few moments, as if taking in what she just said. Then, she nods slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot quite knowing what to do, you look at Azelf with a look that screams: \u2018Help me!\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue giantess just shrugs. You suddenly remember her words, \u2018I don't want to interfere\u2019, and you find that you agree with her. You wouldn't want to mess with two lovesick giantesses either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find Uxie and Mesprit staring down at you with expectant looks. You catch yourself sighing as you are facing yet another embarrassing situation. <br>\r\n\u2018Why me?\u2019 you think as your palm connects with your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, taking a deep breath, you finally make a choice...</span></div></div>",

You are washed by a white, sticky river, right towards Mesprit's sex. However, the giantess isn't done just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe keeps her paws pressed against her crotch, preventing her liquids - and you - from exiting.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit!\" you call out.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">N-Not yet... Still a bit... Please...</span>\" though her voice is muffled by the two paws sealing your only exit, you partially understand what she just said, and get that she's not satisfied yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inhale deeply, taking in that heavenly scent present in here.<br>\r\n\"Alright, here we go...\" you mutter to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like you did with Uxie, you start wiggling inside of Mesprit, almost instantly getting her to moan blissfully again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">That's w-wonderful! D-Don't stop!</span>\" she breathes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the world shake around you as you keep pleasuring her. Mesprit must be... 'aiding' with your task. Something you are pretty grateful for. As much as your erection is telling you that you're actually enjoying this, you just want to be over with it as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to do so, you start struggling with every energy you have left in yourself. You frenetically squirm around in darkness, crawl up and down in her, everything in order to satisfy this lustful giantess once and for all. You even resume scratching and rubbing your surroundings, the gleeful, muffled screams of pleasure of the pokemon telling you that you're effectively doing it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your whole body against the walls, getting the Mesprit to moan even louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, how come she isn't catching any attention?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seems forever, a second wave of cherry-smelling cum hits you, carrying you towards the exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the two large paws are removed from Mesprit's sex, and you are washed towards her vertical lips. Towards freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally breath in fresh air - as fresh as air can get near a pokemon nether regions - as you hit the snowy floor of the forest. Glancing at the sky, you take notice that the sun completely disappeared, and the moon is slowly rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time today, you're drenched in a pokemon's liquids. You back away from Mesprit's slit, and the ground shakes as she literally collapses.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit! Are you alright?\" you ask with sudden concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice her greedily filling her lungs with air. Her face is covered in sweat, a not so unnoticeable red shade on her cheeks; her tails flail weakly, suggesting that they've been swinging wildly while you were inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes are closed, her arms rest upon her chest. But she has a bright smile painted on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd only after several minutes of recovering she finds that she has enough air in her lungs to reply to your question:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Yes... I'm more than alright... all thanks to you... my... little... one...</span>\" she pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way towards the spot where her gigantic face rests.<br>\r\n\"Does that mean... you know...\" instead of replying, you find one of Mesprit's eyes opening as she looks straight at you; one of her arms parts from her chest and reaches out for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let her paw get a hold of you as the giantess, not caring that you're soaked in her love juices, brings you to her lips, loudly smooching your upper body.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Does that reply to your question?</span>\" she asks upon pulling off. You awkwardly nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles. The paw holding you moves back to her chest, bringing you along. She lays you down on the wide surface, and closes your dripping body in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after a while does she release you. Holding you in one hand, she slowly sits up, and then she starts floating, having recovered from her orgasm.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Now that's finally settled,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Let's go back. Azelf is probably worried. And Uxie -  she's probably still sleeping.</span>\" <br>\r\n\"W-Wait, I can't go back like this!\" you point out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looks at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Um... maybe you're right, you could use a bath...<br>\r\nand me as well. But the only place we could take one is the lake.</span>\" she says, bringing her free paw to her forehead.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Problem. How do we get past my sisters unnoticed?</span>\" she asks, mostly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she looks at you and smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Hey, do me a favor?</span>\" she asks. You nod.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Try to keep your last meal where it is.</span>\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't instantly get what she means, but you soon find out as she suddenly teleports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't even take a look at your new surroundings.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Hold your breath!</span>\" Mesprit chimes, closing you in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn instant later, you are completely submerged in water, that you assume is from Lake Acuity. Weird... it actually feels warmer than you remember...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit swims down to the bottom, pokemon swimming away as they take notice of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the giantess swims right back upwards, surfacing, and rising both herself and you up in the air. Before you can inhale air again, though, she shakes herself dry, splashing water everywhere and almost making you throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warn me before doing that again...\" you breath, making her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally get to take a look around, discovering that this isn't Lake Acuity. There is a forest around, alright, but it lacks of any snow. And, most of all, it lacks of two familiar giantesses that were supposed to be around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading your mind, Mesprit quickly says:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">My dear little one, the guardian of Lake Verity warmly welcomes you!</span>\" she giggles.<br>\r\n\"Lake Verity?\" you parrot back.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">This is my home. My lake.</span>\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I suppose Azelf also has her own lake?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Yep. Lake Valor. You know, back then, all three lakes were... let's not talk about it now.</span>\" she says, suddenly looking... sad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head, as if trying to shake off bad memories, before smiling again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Well... let's go back. Azelf and Uxie are probably worried.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can do anything else, though, you call out for her.<br>\r\n\"Wait, aren't we staying a bit more? I'd like to look around here.\" you say. Mesprit smiles.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, there'll be time for me to show you around later on. As for now, let's go back.\" she says sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod at her as she teleports again. This time right in front of her sisters. You notice Uxie has woke up and, along Azelf, is now... staring at you and Mesprit. She smiles gratefully at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf is the first to talk.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Finally, you two! I was getting worried!</span>\" she exclaims. Mesprit smiles sympathetically.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Want me to make you happy?</span>\" Azelf rolls her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie confusedly turns her head from Mesprit to Azelf. Then back to Mesprit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Ehm... something I don't know, you three?</span>\" she asks. Clearly, she is unaware of what happened after she fell asleep.<br>\r\n\"<b>Nothing!</b>\" you, Azelf and Mesprit say at one time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick dinner made out of berries - \u2018We also eat small fish pokemon\u2019 was the awkward answer when you asked what else they eat - the three of them decide that it's time to hit the hay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground is shaken by many thuds as the three giantesses lay down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Mesprit wouldn't let you sleep on the snow. So, before you can complain, you find yourself pinned against her chest, her paws keeping you still and her tails resting upon them.<br>\r\n\"I can sleep on the ground, you know.\" you say her. She giggles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Nonsense, silly. We wouldn't want you to catch something nasty, would we?</span>\" she says. She quickly adds:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Goodnight girls!</span>\" she cheers.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Goodnight. And goodnight to you, little one.</span>\" Uxie replies.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">See you in the morning, you three.</span>\" Azelf says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit turns her attention on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">And goodnight to you, my precious little one,</span>\" she places a peck on your forehead.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Thank you~</span>\" you shake your head at the last remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin ten minutes, you hear the three sisters snoring. You decide to catch some sleep as well. This day has been tiring as it has been weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you close your eyes, enjoying the warmth provided by Mesprit's smooth fur and the sweet lullaby sung by her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, drowsiness tugs you to sleep, sweetly carrying you to dreamland.</span></div></div>",

Do you know how much it sucks to be the guy who constantly has to tell your kind just how badly they've screwed up?\" Lucario replied without a hint of comedy to his voice. Something about his tone cleared the haze from your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what did I do?\" you ask curiously, looking around and seeing the many Pok\u00e9mon with a variety of expressions. Some appeared to be angry, others scared, and you are quite certain at least one of them winked at you. The Vaporeon looked really pissed and barked something at Lucario who sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did the nasty. With the legendaries,\" Lucario explains in a proper tone. Your jaw drops for a moment before a confident smirk appears on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were literally begging me,\" you gasp and enter a flabbergasted state, \"What, are they sacred or something? Am I going to get cursed? Wait, are you just jealous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me rephrase that,\" Lucario states bemused and moves a bit closer, \"You fucked the legendaries, and now they are going to fuck us. Tell me, did any of your actions actually 'cure' their heat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" you abruptly shout out in order to defend yourself, though remembering Mesprit had already had you twice already, \"I mean, sort of? Temporarily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you did was whet their appetite, and it always comes back stronger!\" Lucario continues with a hint of desperation, \"Why do you think none of us ever tried anything? The last time they just kept asking for more and more, finally turning crazed with lust and going on a rampage across Lake Acuity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it, yet at the same time something about all this seemed vaguely familiar. The Vaporeon walks around you, stands in your line of sight and looks at you with large puppy-dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think those three sisters are so enchanted by humans?\" Lucario growls, \"Because since they can't understand the local inhabitants, they're the only ones who don't fuck off when we tell them to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, it's not my fault!\" you shout back, \"Try blaming those perverted Sneasel who keep crawling into Uxie's vagina, not me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario stops for a moment and looks towards Vaporeon for consultation. They exchange a few confused words in a language that sounds remarkably like they were just repeating their own names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently Uxie's not the problem,\" he admits after a moment, \"Nobody can seem to remember her ever going on a rampage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color drains from your face as you hear what sounds like noises of relief from the crowd around you. Apparently nobody knows about Uxie's powers. Or perhaps they did know, once. How many times had Uxie gone on a rampage, only for it all to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is all crazy!\" you blurt out as nothing about this makes any sense to you, \"I've spent several hours with them already, they're the sweetest trio you'll ever meet! They would never do something like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ursa, diu,\" a Teddiursa suddenly speaks up from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't mean to, they can't control themselves during this season,\" Lucario translates as a Noctowl begins to hoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently it was always like this? But now they're really big, so things get very dangerous,\" Lucario continues slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaa-reon,\" the Vaporeon in front of you pleads, and you can tell that she's genuinely scared now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're scared,\" Lucario unnecessarily translates, \"And they don't want to break the trio's hearts by telling them about the things they did during that rampage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, fine,\" you mutter dejectedly and stand up, \"Why am I even arguing? I didn't want to get caught up in any of this. I was just trying to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Lucario says with a nod before pointing back at the cave where they had picked up the human, \"Now go back there, tell them this was all a mistake and we'll escort you to the nearest human settlement. Vapid here says she'll see to any sex you might miss out o-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue jackal is cut off as the Vaporeon jumps up and slaps him across the face with her large double-pronged tail. You're taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leaving!?\" you repeat in shock, \"Right now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow... Yeah, for your own sake,\" Lucario mumbles while rubbing his cheek, \"I can smell that you were with at least one of them not long ago at all. You don't know the state of mind those legendaries will be in once they wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"State of mind?!\" you repeat once more as the crowd of Pok\u00e9mon begin to disperse, \"Wait, what do you mean?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said they were begging you for help?\" Lucario grumbles as he turns around to leave, \"Well, the next time, you won't get a say in the matter. And after that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whispers something to the Vaporeon who whispers something back. Lucario suddenly seizes up and starts blushing like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not translating that,\" he says uncomfortably while waving his hand back, \"Just... Don't get eaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze up. EATEN? Sure, they said something about eating small fish Pok\u00e9mon, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon starts arguing louder as Lucario pulls his ears down to the side of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care how that Snover died! The human gets it without me spelling it out!\" Lucario said loudly while shaking his head, resulting in the Vaporeon once more tail-slapping him across his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! FINE!\" Lucario yells out exasperated before turning towards you, \"Your broken corpse will make a nice dildo. Have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Pok\u00e9mon disappear and leave you with two choices...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sit there on the cold snow for an imprecise amount of time. You can't believe it. Those three, sweet pokemon... true, they're incredibly big, but aside from that they aren't scary at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind travels back at the last words the Lucario said before disappearing. About what they would do with your corpse. Holy shit is it an horrible image to think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they wouldn't do that, not to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mind starts to doubt everything they've said you all day long, you get up. Whichever is the truth, you have to do something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel your brain screaming you to start running without looking back. It's screaming you to never come back in this place, to forget the three sisters and their lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you decide against it. You don't know where to go, and you might possibly get lost in a blizzard again. And no Uxie to save you then, since she is still asleep inside of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother question forms in your mind: did she really wipe away the memories of what she did from those pokemon's minds? Or she really didn't go on a rampage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in your thoughts, you unknowingly start to make your way back to the cave where the three guardians are currently sleeping. You want answers, and you want them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop as you get to the entrance of the cave. You can't believe this place is big enough to hold all the three sisters at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel observed. You turn around, noticing several pairs of eyes staring down at you from the nearby trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany pokemon are staring down at you with either scared or disapproving looks. A scared looking Hoothoot. A glaring Scyther. A worried Murkrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to do this.\" you whisper at them. Then, without saying anything else, you step inside the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk deeper inside, despite your brain yelling you to turn around right there and leave right there and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the three huge bodies of the sisters come into view. Mesprit sleeping in the middle, her arms still resting on her chest where you were sleeping yourself earlier, before your unexpected meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf and Uxie are fast asleep too, positioned beside Mesprit. Now that you think of it, how did those pokemon remove your body from Mesprit's grasp?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stand there dumbfounded, not knowing what to do. One big part of you wants to just run as far as you can. The other wants to start yelling to wake the three up and demand for answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that neither of the two options are valid, you decide instead to wake one of the three and - calmly - ask for answers, as you aren't quite sure of how confronting all three of them straightaway would end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which one of the three should you wake up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit, maybe? You've been pretty... close to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, what if she uses her powers and makes you unwilling to leave anymore? Heck, she could make you eager to have a third round in an instant. You shake your head. Mesprit is out of question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie? She turned out to be very shy, maybe you can convince her to answer to your questions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you shake your head. She could just open her eyes and force you to look into them, making your forget the reason of your awakening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat only leaves the third choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, you know pretty little about her, but for the little amount of time she's been around, she was nice to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou distinctly remember her words, \u2018Maybe you can help me with my own problems later on.\u2019 you sigh. That's just another point against the three of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you decide, maybe Azelf is the best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of how to wake a 200ft pokemon, you walk up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start poking one of her blue cheeks.<br>\r\n\"Azelf. Wake up. Azelf...\" you whisper. All you accomplish is a slight moan escaping her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice shifting position, moving her arms upwards and burying her face in them in her sleep.<br>\r\n\"Well, isn't that useful?\" you remark sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of good ideas, you walk upwards, where the red gem on her forehead rests. You start rubbing it. For a gem, it feels actually weird. For starters, it's warm. And it feels kinda... fleshy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf, come on wake up.\" you call her louder. Another moan comes out of her lips, though this one was louder. This gem must be a sensible spot, you decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf.\" you call out for the third time. This time, you notice the giantess removing her arms from her face and drowsily spots you near her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step back as she talks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Oh... you,</span>\" she says, pausing to yawn.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Any good reason to wake me up in the middle of the night? Or it's something you do usually?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore her last question.<br>\r\n\"Azelf, may I ask you something?\" you ask. You see those two golden eyes of hers sparkling with curiosity as she gives a nod. You feign a smile. To cover the fear you're feeling right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choose your words carefully.<br>\r\n\"Does... does the word 'rampage' suggest you anything?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gets her to raise her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">What do you mean?</span>\" she asks, seemingly taken back by the question.<br>\r\n\"I mean... it was only a doubt I had... did you or your sisters ever... lost control? Maybe in this particular period?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that she's now wide awake, her attention now fully on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">What kind of question is that?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only something I was wondering about.\" you lie.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Really? I don't think anyone would wake up in the middle of the night because of a simple doubt.</span>\" she flatly replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop your smile.<br>\r\n\"Azelf, I've heard something interesting about you three.\" you state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you with amusement. You continue.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, about something you do during this particular season.\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">And that would be...?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lose control. Go on a rampage around here. They're terrified, Azelf,\" you say bluntly, admitting everything you have been told. You notice her listening with eyes and mouth wide open.<br>\r\n\"And they gave me a pretty accurate idea of what you would do with my dead body.\" you recall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">\u2018They\u2019 who?</span>\" the titaness asks you.<br>\r\n\"Friends...\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment full of tension follows.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I don't know what to tell you... this is absurd. We would never do anything like that! Especially not around the Lakes!</span>\" she exclaims, keeping her voice low.<br>\r\n\"Really? Because that's what I heard, Azelf.\" you see the giantess staring at you intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she smirks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Well, I have no clue. Maybe 'they' are right. Or maybe not. But you know what? I'm wide awake now,</span>\" you notice her smirk growing wider.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">And I've got a certain 'itch' that needs to be scratched.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need no more answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any warning, you sprint away, towards the exit of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as you approach it, you abruptly stop. You didn't mean to. What happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Azelf talking again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Whoever filled your head with that stuff, ignore them. We would never do things like that.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're pretty sure she's lying. You try to tell her, but you find that you can't even open your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you find a large paw closing itself around you. The giantess brings you up to her smiling face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Sorry about your will. Had to prevent you from running somehow. You'll have it back now.</span>\" she says like it is no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill?! Is this her power, taking other's will away?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou discover that you can talk again.<br>\r\n\"Come on Azelf, don't do this! I thought you were nice!\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile widens.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Glad that you have such opinion of me.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Come on, I mean you no harm. Now, let's find a private place, shall we?</span>\" she asks, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're in cage. You're trapped in the giantess' grasp. And you're too far away from the floor, even if you manage to break free, you'll only meet a worse fate than this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only hope is to scream for help. Sure, your new 'friends' might not be able to help you, but you could at least try to wake Uxie or Mesprit. Sure, you fear them no less than Azelf now, but they're your only hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit did act jealous earlier after all. Maybe she will do so again! Everything depends on what you'll do now. You know there's only one thing you can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as you start regretting not running away in the first place, you do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to let out one single scream:<br>\r\n\"Help!\" you find Azelf's free paw pressing on your mouth.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Be quiet. Wouldn't want to wake my sisters, would we?</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeld in place by her fist, silenced by her paw, you can do nothing but watch what will happen next...</span></div></div>",

Luckily (for her) they didn't.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Good.</span>\" you hear her whisper as she floats out of the big cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCold air hits you as you are carried outside. You look at the trees around, only to discover that all pokemon are gone. Where could they be gone to? And why now that you need them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour questions remain unanswered as Azelf floats towards the thick, snowy forest, the tall trees doing a good job in hiding her form from eyesight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery once in awhile, she stops, maybe searching for the right place, and talks to you, telling you things like:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I'm sure you know how it works. I mean, you already did it a few times, right?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Don't worry, I'll try to make it as quick as possible.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Be gentle with me, alright?</span>\" your fear grows each time you hear her talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's acting like this all is a simple game. She doesn't seem to think that you could get seriously injured! That you could lose your own life! Again, images of three using you even after your demise cross your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go pale as death itself, and try to shake off these thoughts. This is quickly becoming too much for you to handle. You just hope that you'll find a chance to escape soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems forever, but was, in reality, twenty minutes, the giantess finally stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Well, that seems like a nice place,</span> \" she points to a small cave, which is well hidden by several bushes and trees. How did she even spot it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf quietly makes her way towards it. With a bit of difficulty, she manages to slip completely inside. It's spacious enough for her to sit upright, the tip of her star shaped head gently touching the ceiling.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Yup. Nice, warm, and secluded. Maybe a bit cramped, but I'm sure it'll do it.</span>\" Azelf talks again as she glances around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, her gaze shifts on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">So, ready?</span>\" she asks, spreading her legs in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost have an heart attack as her vagina comes into view. And, suddenly, you can smell that familiar scent of heat.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRather than stepping forward like the titaness expected, you actually back away.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Come on. I won't harm you, I promise! Just help me already!</span>\" she exclaims, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't move of an inch. Suddenly, an idea springs up in Azelf's mind.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Listen. Let's make a deal,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to both of you and Azelf, you were being watched by two familiar pokemon... well, familiar to you. A Lucario and a Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kept an eye out for you when they saw you returning to the cave and, when they noticed you coming out carried by the blue giantess, they decided to follow her. And now, the two are having a quite animated discussion in their own language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>See? What did I tell you? We warned him! And what is the first thing he does? He goes wake one of them up to have sex!</u>\" Lucario growls, frustrated.<br>\r\n\"<u>What if he didn't agree with it? What if she's forcing him? I saw his face, he was scared!</u>\" Vaporeon retorts.<br>\r\n\"<u>Yeah, right. A human male giving up on the chance to have sex? Humans are stupid, remember that!</u>\" Lucario talks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Maybe. But he looked terrified after what we told him.</u>\" Vaporeon says, before continuing:<br>\r\n\"<u>So, what do we do now? Do we just let it happen?</u>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"<u>What else would you want to do?</u>\" Lucario growls with a hint of resignation.<br>\r\n\"<u>We could try and rescue the human...</u>\" the quadruped water type suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario looks down at her with a shocked expression.<br>\r\n\"<u>What are you, crazy!? Me and you, against that legendary mountain that has the power to deprive you of willpower?</u>\"  he shouts.<br>\r\n\"<u>Maybe it could work. I distract her, you grab the human and then we flee.</u>\" Vaporeon reasons. Lucario's paw slams against his forehead.<br>\r\n\"<u>Do really think it would work? How would you distract her?</u>\" he asks. If it wasn't for this site situation, he'd be laughing at the suggestion.<br>\r\n\"<u>Wouldn't you be distracted if a blizzard hit you in the eyes?</u>\" the water asks with a hint of irony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Yeah, like it could work! She'll just mistake you for a pesky bug and she'll crush you fla-</u>\" for the third time tonight, Vaporeon leaps up and smacks him across the face with her tail.<br>\r\n\"<u>Are we doing it?</u>\" she asks. Lucario gives a defeated sigh as he rubs his cheek.<br>\r\n\"<u>If we die for that human, I will remember it.</u>\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the giantess with curiosity. A deal? What is she talking about? The only thing you want right now is to run as far and fast as you can!<br>\r\n\"What deal?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Glad that I got your attention. Now, if you - heh - play with me for a bit, I'm going to tell you what really happened during that... 'rampage', as you call it,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't agree with the terms of the deal.<br>\r\n\"What about this? I help you, and then you let me go?\" you ask. Azelf tilts her head and looks at you weirdly, as if she is amused by your question.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Even if I wanted to let you go afterwards, I couldn't do it. My sisters would make me pay as soon as they wake up and find out you're missing.</span>\" she says you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand your ground.<br>\r\n\"What if I refuse?\" you ask stubbornly. Azelf's smile disappears.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Do you like your own free will? Let's just say this,<br>\r\nI can take that and still have you,</span>\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pale at the perspective. She was talking to use you as a... as a living sex toy!<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Come on, I'm tired of waiting!... I'll try to make it enjoyable for you as well, alright? Just... let's just do it! I'm offering to do it without having to do anything nasty!</span>\" she literally shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill white as a sheet, with your heart galloping within your chest, you give a deep sigh. There is no way out of this. If you refuse, she'll simply take your will and use you for her own pleasure. Might as well do it when you can still move, you decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, reluctant, defeated and humiliated, you start walking towards the giantess...</span></div></div>",

But it'll be swift, I promise.</span>\" she says sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words have the only effect to make you feel worse. They just made you imagine your own body, deprived of life, laying on the hard, cold floor of the cave, completely drenched in white, sticky liquid while Azelf stares at the pitiful sight, unable to feel anything but lust...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake that image off your mind and sourly surrender to reality. No one with some common sense would ever try anything against Azelf. No one is going to save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that's what you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Lucario and Vaporeon discuss about their plan.<br>\r\n\"<u>Alright, let's repeat it one more time. You go in there, get her attention and attack - aiming to her eyes.</u>\" Lucario explains. Vaporeon nods.<br>\r\n\"<u>Then you come in as well, you grab the human, and then we flee. And we'll have just a few minutes to find a proper place to hide.</u>\" she finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario nods at her.<br>\r\n\"<u>Good luck, Vapid. You'll need it.</u>\" he says. Vaporeon gives him a smile, before taking a deep breath and heading to the cave where the human and the giantess currently are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Oh! K-Keep g-going!</span>\" Azelf stammers loudly, letting out a moan in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot quite knowing how to start, you commenced by rubbing her crotch, although you aren't willing to get inside of Azelf. The idea, which was kind of arousing earlier, now totally scares you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you stop as you hear a loud cry.<br>\r\n\"Vaap!\" you turn your head. And so does the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat as you notice as blue, quadruped pokemon with a a big, fin-like tail walking inside the cave. The Vaporeon from before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf is the first to talk.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">W-What are you doing in here?</span>\" she asks nervously, blushing wildly.<br>\r\n\"Vap! Oreon!\" Vaporeon cries in response.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">You're seeking a shelter for the night? Well, I'm sorry for you, but this cave is... occupied.</span>\" Azelf replies, briefly eyeing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaa.\" <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">What do you mean, \u2018That's not a problem\u2019?</span>\"  Azelf asks, momentarily forgetting about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon doesn't reply. Instead, the atmosphere in the cave suddenly gets freezing cold as Vaporeon shots blizzard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at the giantess' eyes, which get covered by a thin layer of ice. The titaness brings her paws to her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Why you little...!</span>\" <br>\r\n\"<u>Lucario, now!</u>\" as Vaporeon lets out this cry, you notice a familiar black and blue pokemon running inside, towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario grabs you by your arm and pulls you away from the screaming legendary.<br>\r\n\"Let's go human!\" he shouts. He doesn't have to tell you twice as you start running towards the entrance of the cave, followed closely by Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment, you three are out in the cold again, running towards no destination you can think of. Decisively, NOT towards the other cave, the one where the other two sisters are sleeping. Or, at least, you hope they are sleeping. Otherwise, they might hear Azelf screaming and go check what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you soon find that it isn't necessary.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Get back here!</span>\" roars the familiar voice of the guardian of Lake Valor. And she doesn't seem to be too far. Instead, she seems to be enraged. Shit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head, finding the blue mountain coming out from behind trees, flying straight towards you and your companions, shouting horrible words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, she is obviously faster, but you have the advantage of being smaller than her and, with the darkness around you, she has some problems in spotting you three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way!\" you hear Lucario shouting. You and your two companions keep running into the thick woods, zigzagging into different directions every two seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd your very soul seems to sigh in relief as you finally notice that the giantess isn't on your tracks anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Lucario and Vaporeon hide in a large bush.<br>\r\n\"That was close,\" you pant, sitting down.<br>\r\n\"I cannot thank you enough, you two.\" <br>\r\n\"Vaa.\" Vaporeon replies.<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" Lucario growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when you fully regain the ability to talk properly, you dare to ask:<br>\r\n\"So? What do we do now? We stay hidden until dawn?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"No. You and Vapid stay hidden until dawn, I'll go check on Azelf in the meantime. I'll see what she will do. I'll be back soon.\" Lucario replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, despite the protests of Vaporeon, he gets up and dashes away, soon disappearing into vegetation and darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario comes back half an hour later, looking scared.<br>\r\n\"She woke up her sisters! Now they're on our tracks!\" he breathes heavily, trying to catch his breath, suggesting that he had be doing a lot of running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask, now fearing the worst.<br>\r\n\"Azelf returned to the cave, and woke her sisters up. She told them everything of how \u2018I lost the human!\u2019. Mesprit looked angry, she said something like \u2018The closest thing to a mate I've ever had is now probably freezing! And it's your fault!\u2019. Uxie seemed worried, though angry as well.\" Lucario pants while you listen with your jaw almost touching the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it true? Mesprit and Uxie are really worried for you? Or are they only worried because they're probably not getting anymore pleasure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what did they do?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"They rushed out of the cave, and they spread in three different directions. They're searching for you.\" Lucario adds unnecessarily.<br>\r\n\"Surely enough, they're not searching for you. Or maybe Azelf is. Maybe she wants revenge on both of you,\" you say, looking both at him and at Vaporeon, who shivers at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the point is another. We're risking here. I say, let's wait until dawn comes. I'll run away then. Maybe you two can escort me, or not. You two can choose.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario nods slowly.<br>\r\n\"Haven't I had enough troubles already?\" he asks sarcastically. But Vaporeon climbs on your lap.<br>\r\n\"On!\" she cries.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean with \u2018I'll come with you\u2019?\" Lucario asks her.<br>\r\n\"Vap! Vap!\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Do as you want! But... don't get caught.\" Lucario says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Vaporeon.<br>\r\n\"You will accompany me?\" you ask. She nods. Why does she seem to like you so much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, then.\" you say, smiling gratefully. <br>\r\n\"Now, let's be quiet. Otherwise, one of the three might hear us. We'll just have to wait until dawn comes.\" you whisper, getting nods from the two pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passes, although you can't tell how much. You don't get any sleep at all, your drowsiness faded the moment when you were awakened by Lucario the first time. You envy Vaporeon, who is quietly napping on your lap, while Lucario looks very tired, but keeps peeking out of the bush in order to see if Azelf, Mesprit or Uxie get too close to your hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just keep quiet, occasionally petting Vaporeon. You just hope your plan will work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it does, you'll be safe and, hopefully, far from the three sisters and their lake. Otherwise... you don't want to think about what would happen if they find you before dawn...</span></div></div>",

But you know that isn't possible. You have to stay focused, ready to leave whenever dawn rises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, it doesn't take long for the sun to rise over the horizon, its first, warm rays enlightening the lower skies. Your vision blurry from drowsiness, you almost don't notice Lucario peeking out of the bush once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he looks back at you with a serious expression.<br>\r\n\"Human. It's time for you to leave.\" he says, proceeding to gently shake the Vaporeon on your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quadruped water type slowly opens her eyes and gives a yawn, followed by a curious cry.<br>\r\n\"<u>It's time to leave, Vapid.</u>\" Lucario grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon looks at him for a second, then she looks at you, quickly remembering the situation.<br>\r\n\"Vap.\" she cries, leaping off your lap and looking at you with an expectant expression that screams \u2018It's now or never!\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly walk out of the bush, followed by the water type.<br>\r\n\"Vaporeon?\" you ask, earning a curious look.<br>\r\n\"Before we leave, I need one last thing.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou patiently wait for the small water type to return. And you smile brightly as you notice her dragging something with her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, it currently lacks food - stole by those damned Sneasel - but the money you brought along is probably still there, so, you figure out, you might just have a decent breakfast once you are wherever Vaporeon will be taking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly get a hold of it, gently petting Vaporeon on her head.<br>\r\n\"Let's go then.\" you say, looking at Lucario, who gives a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon nods as well, starting to walk forward, followed by you. You glance backwards one more time, again looking at Lucario. He seems to be thinking. Maybe about something to say.<br>\r\n\"Good luck human. And good luck to you, Vapid.\" he says, using a soft voice for the first time since you met him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as her darts away, soon disappearing into the forest. <br>\r\n\"Vaap!\" cries Vaporeon, who seems eager to leave.<br>\r\n\"Coming.\" you say, hurrying to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of walking, you notice the forest finally ending as you get out. You decide that this must be where the path to Lake Acuity begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, for one last time, you turn around, getting Vaporeon to stop to throw you a curious glance.<br>\r\n\"Azelf, Mesprit, Uxie. I may be leaving now. It's really hard, but I must do it. But keep this in mind,\" you speak to yourself as there is nobody but Vaporeon listening to you.<br>\r\n\"I'll leave my heart here. And someday, when this heat season will be over, I'll come and get it back!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you turn around again, you find Vaporeon smiling at you. That speech of yours must have had an effect on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at you for a few moments, before turning around and starting to walk again. You swear you can hear her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daylight is beginning to fade when the lights of what seems a city come into view.<br>\r\n\"We made it, Vaporeon!\" you exclaim, relieved that you are finally safe.<br>\r\n\"Vaap!\" she cries, showing off a big smile as you both start running to what you remember is Snowpoint City. Sure, you came here before getting lost into that blizzard Uxie rescued you from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you get back to the small house you rented here before you met the three guardians. You used part of your money to buy a meal worth that name for yourself. You also bought some pokemon food for Vaporeon, who quietly waits for you to open the front door of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when you manage to gulp down some nice, warm soup you notice that sun is no longer there, fully replaced by the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also take notice that Vaporeon is done eating her own meal.<br>\r\n\"So, ehm... maybe you want to... go back to the lake?\" you casually ask her. Vaporeon rises her head, and looks at you, tilting her head in a curious manner.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I mean, Lucario is probably worried... don't you want to go back home?\" you ask again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your surprise, Vaporeon shakes her head. Her answer is clear, \u2018no\u2019.<br>\r\n\"You don't?\" again, she shakes her head, and stares at you.<br>\r\n\"... You want to stay with me?\" you ask. Surprising you again, Vaporeon nods.<br>\r\n\"Well... alright, I guess...\" you mutter, getting her to smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly leaps in your arms, nuzzling your chest. You laugh at her naive behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you walk towards the bedroom. It is a comfortable house, you notice. You hadn't the chance to take a better look at it. But all you desire now is a warm, soft bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd your wish is soon granted as you get to finally collapse on your bed, Vaporeon leaping beside you. Although it's not even remotely as warm and soft as Mesprit's fur, it is enough to spend a quiet night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide under the sheets, Vaporeon following you.<br>\r\n\"Good night, then.\" you say, closing your eyes.<br>\r\n\"Vaa.\" is your reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of yesterday, when you met the three giantesses, come to you. It shattered your heart to leave them, but you also really wanted to remain alive. But you made a promise. And you know it, you're going to keep  it. These are your past thoughts before the darkness comes. And you eagerly embrace it, greeting a night of nice, long sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo months passed since you met the three giantesses. Two months since you left them. Two months since Vaporeon chose to stay with you instead of going back. You have been living in Snowpoint City since the day you came back. You had enough money with you to afford whatever you needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone else would have just forgotten the three sisters and would have moved on at this point. But not you. You made a promise, that you were going to back to lake Acuity once their heat was over. And by now, you're sure it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd today is the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finally got dressed, you grab your jacket. The same jacket Uxie provided you <i>that day</i>. Memories coming back to your mind, you absentmindedly put it on and grab your bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon walks next to you. When she learned what you want to do, she seemed a little scared, but she was quickly reassured when you told her that the sisters' heat is most probably over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" you ask once you're fully ready to go. The water type nods. You give a smile as she walks forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lock the door behind you as you follow her out of the city and towards lake Acuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when sun is fully settled, you finally arrive to lake shore, the crystalline water reflecting the pale moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't contain yourself anymore.<br>\r\n\"Azelf! Mesprit! Uxie! It's me! I'm back!\" you shout out, imagining three giantesses instantly responding to your cry with a happy, warm \u2018Welcome back!\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, nobody answers to your call. You look at the island in the middle of the lake. The same island that leads to an underwater cave where Uxie resides. Or at least, where she should reside...<br>\r\n\"Is there anyone? Uxie?\" you call again, louder this time, quickly remembering that she is the actual guardian of this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you get no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a couple more cries, just to get the same response: absolute silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you decide to give and turn around, giving Vaporeon, who had been staring at the lake with amusement, a silent \u2018Let's go\u2019, you notice a gigantic shadow sliding over you, covering you completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon flees, and hides behind some plants. You told her to do so earlier. If Azelf is here and recognizes her, you're not sure of how she would react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your heart filled with hope, you turn around, eager to find out who the shadow belongs to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the first thing you notice is...</span></div></div>",

She doesn't give you any time to reply, though. She brings her paws to her head, shaking it slowly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">This... T-This can't be...

Maybe it's a hallucination... just my mind tricking me...</span>\" she whispers again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop your smile, but stay silent, not finding anything to say. The giantess continues.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">B-But... even if it is... who cares?</span>\" she smiles brightly at this last question.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Little one!</span>\" she then shouts, marking the end of her monologue by extending her paws towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can get a hold of you, though, you swiftly run forward and leap onto her already approaching paws, which she brings up to her chest, closing your whole being in a loving hug. You return it, hugging back as long as your arms can reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You're back! You're finally back! I...

Let me get you inside the cave!</span>\" she then says, not releasing you from her hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in a flash of yellow light, you find yourself in the cave where Uxie resides, Acuity Cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess uses a paw to wipe tears away.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You can't even imagine how worried I was! Not to mention... not to mention Azelf and Mesprit!</span>\" Uxie continues, using her paws to bring you upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then pushes you into her cheek, starting to nuzzle you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Azelf was really sorry. She thought that she was the cause of your escape. But Mesprit - we thought she was going to cry all the liquids she has in her!</span>\" the yellow headed giantess exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smile drops at the last remark. Uxie continues:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But now, tell me, where were you for the past two months? And most of all, why did you run from us? From me?</span>\" she then asks, concerned.<br>\r\n\"I was forced to, Uxie. Pokemon around here... they told me that you get crazy with lust when you're in heat. That you... that you may have hurt me! They told me you and your sisters went on a rampage around here!\" you say. Uxie's mouth opens wide once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, before leaving, I made a promise. I promised that I would have returned. And I kept that promise.\" you proudly state, smiling at your last remark.<br>\r\n\"And since that day, I've been living in Snowpoint City, a place not too far from here. I decided to stay there because I... I didn't want to get too far from you. I knew I was going to return here.\" you pause and take a deep breath, taking also notice that the giantess is looking at you with great interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was really hard to leave you, Azelf and Mesprit. But I had to. I didn't want to risk my own life. Don't misunderstand me, I would have gladly helped you again, but it was very dangerous. So dangerous, that I... that I had no other choice.\" you tell her the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie seems confused.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I don't know what to tell you... I'm speechless. Getting crazy with lust, I don't remember ever doing that. Neither I remember going on a rampage. Especially not around my Lake!</span>\" she exclaims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then goes silent, seemingly thinking.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But you know what? Let's forget all of this,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">The heat season is over anyway,</span>\" she places her paws on her mouth, seeming to be pondering something again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain silent as she finally speaks again:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You know, maybe I should call my sisters. They were really worried when you... 'disappeared' that night...</span>\" she says with a hint of sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. You have to admit, you really want to see Azelf and Mesprit again as well. Especially Mesprit. You really missed her and Uxie. You spent just one day with them, but you got incredibly close to the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie talks again, this time with a smile:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But, let's wait for a bit. I'll call them later,</span>\" she looks at you, smiling again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">For now, why don't you tell me what have you been doing during these two months?</span>\" she asks you. You smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well, you had a peaceful life, it appears,</span>\" Uxie says after you finish telling her your story. You didn't mention Vaporeon though.<br>\r\n\"Yes. It's been a pretty quiet-\" you pause to let a yawn come out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Are you tired?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It took all day to come back here.\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">All day? Well then, I guess you should rest now.</span>\" she says, unexpectedly pushing you to her chest, embracing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush.<br>\r\n\"Uxie... don't you think that it's a bit... early for this?\" you ask. You literally just met her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Uxie simply giggles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Don't be silly. Our relationship didn't change one bit. To me, you're still that tiny human I saved from a blizzard. That tiny human that helped me around Lake Acuity. That noticed those pokemon slipping up inside me,</span>\" she replies with a nostalgic voice.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">That tiny human that still has all my gratitude for his help with my problem.</span>\" she says, planting a small kiss on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush even more, but say nothing, touched by her words.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Now, get some sleep. In the meantime, I'll... you'll see.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Oh, and...</span>\" she nears her head to yours.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Don't you ever leave me again.</span>\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a tired smile, before leaning forward, laying your head against her fur, its softness and the warmth it carries, along with the sounds coming from within the giantess, are enough to send you straight to dreamland in a matter of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon noticing you asleep, Uxie's smile grows.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">This brings me back. \u2018Hello there, young human\u2019</span>\" she recalls the moment you woke up in her paws that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow headed pixie then calls upon her psychic powers to establish a psychic link with Azelf and Mesprit.<br>\r\n\u2018<span class=\"cyellow\"><i>Girls? Are you awake?</i></span>\" she telepathically asks.<br>\r\n\u2018<span class=\"clblue\"><i>I am.</i></span>\" Azelf replies from her own home at Lake Valor.<br>\r\n\u2018<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>Me too. What is it, Uxie?</i></span>\" Mesprit asks from Lake Verity. Uxie notices her pink headed sister replying with a broken voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit didn't handle the human's leaving very well. She left shortly after him. Uxie herself and Azelf didn't hear her for days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie pauses for a moment, letting a couple of tears pour down her cheeks.

Are you still there?</i></span>\" Azelf's voice brings her back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, the yellow headed pixie resumes, telling just two simple sentences:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<span class=\"cyellow\"><i>Girls, I've got a guest with me. You'll never guess who.</i></span>\u2019.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"<span class=\"chotpink\">So? You talked about a guest, Uxie. Who is it?</span>\" this voice fully wakes you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly return to reality as you rub your eyes and absentmindedly start to stretch.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Awake already, little one?</span>\" a sweet voice calls for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes, finding yourself staring at a wall of blue fur. Memories of the past few hours come to you.<br>\r\n\"Uxie?\" you reply to the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness opens her paws a little bit. She leans forward, pecking your head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I was going to wake you up later, but I guess that won't be necessary. Just in time, dear human. Mesprit and Azelf are here.</span>\" she whispers with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, Uxie opens up her paws, releasing you from her hug while presenting you to two other giantess, one with a pink head, the other with a cyan one, both sitting on the floor of the cave. Apparently, both were looking at their sister. But, the moment she revealed you, their gazes fixed on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf and Mesprit stare at you with curiosity. But then, their curiosity changes into disbelief as they notice that their sister is indeed holding onto a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giantesses stare at you with their eyes wide open for a while. You stare right back at them, smiling.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">A human...? I don't get it, Uxie... Is he the guest you told us about?</span>\" Azelf asks, confused. She seems to not have recognized you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mesprit surely did, you judge as you hear her exclaim one single word:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">C-Cutie!</span>\" Mesprit exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Azelf can process who you are, her sister floats forward at breakneck speed, paws pointing to you, ready to snatch you from Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the yellow headed pixie gracefully spins around, avoiding her sister, that ends up grasping the void.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Careful, Mesprit!</span>\" Uxie exclaims before turning her attention on you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat spin of hers left you completely nauseated and somewhat dizzy.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hehehe, whoops,</span>\" giggles the giantess, gently lowering her paws, letting you on the ground. A mix of incoherent syllables is the only reply she gets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your sense of orientation can come back, though, you discover two large, blue paws wrapping around you and scooping you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two paws manipulate you so that you can see that they actually belong to Azelf.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I-Is that... you're really here, aren't you? I'm not dreaming or something, right?</span>\" she asks, seemingly confused.<br>\r\n\"No, Azelf. I really came back.\" you assure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue giantess stares at you for a couple more seconds, before enclosing you in a soft, yet firm hug.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I-It's really you... I'm so sorry for what I've done that night... I don't know what happened to me...</span>\" she apologizes. Looking upwards, you discover something shining under her closed eyelids. Something like two forming tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf, I didn't run away because of you. It wasn't your fault, trust me.\" you say. The giantess opens her eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">It wasn't?</span>\" she asks. You shake your head. Azelf smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, you notice her moving you upwards. Towards her lips.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">May I?</span>\" she asks. She doesn't wait for an answer, though, as she presses her lips on your forehead, producing a loud smooching sound.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I'm so happy that you returned. We all missed you!</span>\" she says cheerfully after pulling off. She then proceeds to gently place you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile. Now an atmosphere of pure happiness reigns inside the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a certain pink headed pokemon is starting to get annoyed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Believe me, I more than anyone know that this is extremely heartwarming. But aren't you missing something? Or someone?</span>\" Mesprit asks, placing her paws on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver slightly as you hear her voice. You're not sure of how she would take it if you told her that you actually forgot that she was present in the cavern.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit...\" you can't say anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo slender, huge hands wrap solidly around your body, and snatch you up. Only to shove you into a furry surface of some sorts afterwards. It doesn't take long for you to understand that Mesprit is hugging you against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Y-You can't... you can't possibly know...</span>\" the giantess abruptly interrupts herself to stare at you, trying to find a way to express herself. But you speak for her:<br>\r\n\"I missed you.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment these words come out of your mouth, your whole being is roughly brought up and assaulted by a pair of large, pink lips. Mesprit kisses you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like you're on fire. Each and every inch of you burns as the giantess loudly smooches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after a good minute, she finally pulls leaving a dazed you laying on her cupped paws.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Don't you ever try to run from us again! I... we were so worried! I thought... I thought I wasn't going to see you ever again...</span>\" Mesprit suffocates the last remark so that only you can hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel very sorry. Right, Mesprit likes to play with other's emotions.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. But I had no other choice.\" you reply bluntly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Why? Were we scaring you? Did we do something wrong?... Did I do something wrong?</span>\" the giantess asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head.<br>\r\n\"None of these reasons,\" you glance at Azelf and Uxie. Already knowing your story, Uxie simply smiles at you and nods her head, silently telling you to tell Azelf and Mesprit the reasons of your escape.<br>\r\n\"Might as well sit down. It's a long story.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">That's... that's just...</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Absurd!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past hour, you have been explaining the real reasons that made you leave two months ago. Azelf and Mesprit carefully listened to every word that came out of your mouth, while Uxie sat apart, already knowing what you had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">So, are you saying that we actually lose control during the heat season? That we... hurt others?</span>\" Azelf asks. You nod.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">But, our heat ended a while ago, and we don't remember hurting anyone. I mean... we didn't hurt you back then... right?</span>\" Mesprit asks, concerned.<br>\r\n\"You didn't hurt me,\" you reassure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You know what? The heat season is over. I don't think It'll do any of us good if we worry about it now. I say, let's just forget it for now. And when the next season comes... we'll see... because, you're going to stay... right?</span>\" Mesprit asks you. You notice Uxie floating closer to the three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile.<br>\r\n\"As long as you three want me to be here-\" you don't get to finish. Two large paws, belonging to Uxie, get a hold of you and bring you upwards.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Of course we want. You're welcome here, little one,</span>\" Uxie says. You smile gratefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit snatches you from Uxie.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Hey, now that I think about it, it's actually been a lot of time since we last played together... why don't we make up for lost time?</span>\" she asks you, winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sentence startles you.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I thought the heat season was over!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">It is,</span>\" Mesprit says.<br>\r\n\"<b>Much to our relief.</b>\" both Azelf and Uxie add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit rolls her eyes, before gazing at you again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Who says we can't have some fun anyway? Not necessarily sex, you know,</span>\" she states.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">We could also play with emotions again~</span>\" she sings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively look at Uxie, who smiles at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Sorry to ruin your plans, Mesprit. But I've still got a few chores to do around here, maybe you can help me again?</span>\" Uxie asks, gently snatching you from her sister.<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure. I'll help!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is just perfect. Not only Uxie just saved you... again... but she also gave you the perfect excuse to go and search for Vaporeon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast time you saw her, she disappeared into the forest when you met Uxie again. You wonder what she's been doing for the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit huffs loudly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Fine.</span>\" she mutters dejectedly, crossing her legs and resting her tails on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Azelf, who simply smiles and gives a shrug.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Let's go then,</span>\" you hear Uxie's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, you find yourself outside of the cavern and into the warm sunlight. <br>\r\n\"How much time did I sleep?\" you causally ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">About five hours.</span>\" she replies, hovering above the lake and gently letting you down on its shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Say, are you ready to start?</span>\" Uxie asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate. Can you tell her your intentions? You decide against it. And then again, it's been a long time since you actually spent time with the giantess. Do you really have to go and search for Vaporeon straightaway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut another part of you is somewhat worried about the quadruped water type. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Anyone in there?</span>\" Uxie's voice brings you back to reality.<br>\r\n\"Mh?\" <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I said, let's get started. Is everything alright? You seem a bit off...</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I'm alright.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Then, why don't we start?</span>\" she asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few moments to take a decision, wether to help Uxie or go search for Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a deep sigh as you make your choice...</span></div></div>",

Now, wait for a moment,</span>\" she says, placing a paw over her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she does so, she happens to spread her legs. Just a little bit, but enough for you to spot her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing furiously, you suddenly think about something. Before you can express yourself, though, a pair of pruning shears materialises in your hands.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">There we go. Now-</span>\" you interrupt before she can continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Uxie. I just thought about something.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">What is it?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush again.<br>\r\n\"Well... remember what happened last time we did this?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's now her turn to blush.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I didn't want to think about that anymore.</span>\" she replies with her embarrassment.<br>\r\n\"But, what if it happens again?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow headed pixie smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">And that's why you're sticking close to me this time. What do you say? Will you be my little guardian for today?</span>\" she talks with a hint of affection. You find her paw approaching you, lightly petting your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure.\" you awkwardly reply. Uxie stifles a giggle.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well, then. Let's get to work. Now, like last time, I'll unfreeze the area and you cut the dead leaves.</span>\" she instructs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look around, and notice that the nearby vegetation is completely covered in snow.<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue and yellow titaness nods, before leaning down. And, exactly like the last time, she starts breathing on a few snow-covered bushes. The snow immediately melts away because of the sudden warmth, revealing verdant and brown leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to cut the dead leaves like you were instructed. Soon, a small pile forms at your feet. You then notice Uxie moving to the next set of plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing goes on for a while, with Uxie unfreezing the vegetation and you cutting off the dead leaves. With little help from the giantess, you also manage to 'aid' the trees around the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes both of you a not-so-little amount of time to unfreeze the whole area around Lake Acuity. The thing took at least two hours but, now, all the vegetation returned to its original green color, while a large amount of decayed leaves is scattered on the snow-covered grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Once again, we did a pretty great job, dear human.</span>\" Uxie says.<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then find her paw reaching out for you. Once Uxie gets a hold of you, she lifts you upwards.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Sadly, I've got nothing to reward you with,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Uxie, there's really no need to-\" <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hush. Just accept this,</span>\" she interrupts, leaning forward, pressing her lips on your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness pulls off after a minute.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Thank you.</span>\" she whispers. You smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">My, what a good job you two,</span>\" both you and Uxie turn around to see Mesprit and Azelf staring at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Oh, I wish I had someone to help me around my lake as well.</span>\" Azelf remarks, giving you a big wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush furiously. For how long have they been there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid they see...?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Uxie shares your embarrassment, as you find her blushing as well. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Weren't you two waiting inside?</span>\" she asks her sisters.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">It was getting pretty boring in there,</span>\" Mesprit replies.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">So we decided to check on you two. It seems you're doing fine.</span>\" Azelf explains with a causal shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie shakes her head, before turning to you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Let's continue, alright?</span>\" she asks you. You nod.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Alright then. Start digging up a hole while I gather the leaves.</span>\" she says, gently placing you down on the snowy floor around the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Hey, how about we help too?</span>\" Azelf suddenly speaks up. Then, without waiting for an answer, she continues:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I'll help you with the hole, human,</span>\" she says, floating closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie looks at her, then at Mesprit, who shrugs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Then I'll help you, sister.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, aided by the blue giantess, you start digging a hole. Obviously, her huge paws are much more efficient than your comparatively tiny hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Mesprit and Uxie use their psychic to gather all the leaves, that start to float towards them, forming a large pile in midair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the hole is dug up, they carefully move the dead leaves towards it, dropping them into it. At this point, Azelf covers the hole with snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Are we done?</span>\" Mesprit asks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">For the moment, yes.</span>\" Uxie replies. The three sisters proceed to sit down next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passes before Uxie talks to you again:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Little one? Would you like helping me again?</span>\" she asks with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can open up your mouth, Mesprit speaks up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Come on, Uxie, give the guy a break. After all,</span>\" you discover the giantess' tails wrapping around your waist, lifting you off ground and onto the open palms of her waiting paws.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I want a chance to catch up as well.</span>\" she says, mostly to you.</span></div></div>",

The same forest where you discovered about her powers for the first time. The same forest where she had her outburst. The same forest where she declared her devotion towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same forest where she had you for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Mesprit, are you going to play with my emotions again?\" you recall the memories of her games while she hovers through the woods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Maybe.

Mesprit's smile widens.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Hey, are you feeling alright? You look... weird,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I feel... dazed... as if...\" you try to find the right words.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">...As if you like what you see?</span>\" Mesprit asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yes...\" you reply in a whisper. Mesprit giggles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Can you feel it?</span>\" she asks you.<br>\r\n\"Feel it?\" you parrot back, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit pulls you closer to her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">The love. Can you feel the love?</span>\" she asks with a soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, you enjoy her company a lot, but can you really call this 'love'?<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" you risk, replying to her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink and blue giantess giggles, and moves you closer to her lips, placing a soft kiss on your face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Then I'll assume that you like this as well?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. Why are you enjoying this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Mesprit giggles, and again, she places another gentle kiss on your face. Then, she slowly pushes you into her cheek, proceeding to nuzzle you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">See? That's what love does. It shows the truth.<br>\r\nReveals the most hidden secrets.</span>\" she speaks while nuzzling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess then pulls off, and closes you in a hug. You don't even try to fight back.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Tell me, are you feeling happy?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" you whisper, with an almost dreamy voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all seems like a wonderful dream, one you wouldn't want to wake up from. For some reason, you feel... happy. Like you don't need nothing more than Mesprit's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness continues:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">But love... can be painful. Very, very painful,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you find yourself descending to the ground along with Mesprit's paws. She gently lets you down, and pushes you away with one of her tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel very sad. Like your heart was just torn apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't like this game anymore.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit! Stop it! It... it hurts!\" you cry out. The giantess blinks innocently.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Stop doing what?</span>\" she asks, choking back a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can reply, you find yourself floating off ground. You're brought onto Mesprit's paws.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">It still hurts?</span>\" she asks, hugging you against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll your internal pains cease in a instant.<br>\r\n\"Actually... no.\" you reply, making Mesprit giggle.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">See what I meant? Love makes you feel all warm and fuzzy, but it also makes you feel the greatest pain ever.</span>\" she says, placing another kiss on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the dreamy atmosphere around fades, replaced by hard reality. You notice Mesprit snickering.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Hehehe, did you enjoy our little game? Did you like the warm embrace of love?</span>\" she asks, while giggling hysterically.<br>\r\n\"I sure liked it better than the first game,\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Oh, really... human?</span>\" suddenly, Mesprit gazes at you sternly, her fist closes around you and you start to feel scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're released shortly after as the giantess drops her stern look and resumes laughing, while your fear suddenly disappears. You sigh.<br>\r\n\"And that's exactly why I like being around you and your sisters. You three sure are nice... except for that heat problem.\" you state.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You know, me and my sisters hatched from the same egg.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her, incredulous.<br>\r\n\"... Is that even possible?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Apparently. And that's why we're so close. I mean,<br>\r\nwe all got powers. We share a connection. And we... </span>\" Mesprit stops in mid sentence to look at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">And we have the same human as a mate...</span>\" she remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't like where this is going.<br>\r\n\"I'd like to say that Azelf didn't have me.\" you quickly say.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I know, cutie,</span>\" she replies.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Now, about our game, how about we take it a little... further?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Further?\" you ask. You pretty much know what she's up to. But maybe you're wrong. You <i>hope</i> you're wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Well, I taught you about love... so, what do you say if we do some practice?</span>\" the question confirms your theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is really asking you to have sex. Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you could, you would be surely running back to her sisters now. But Mesprit is holding you several feet above the ground. There's no running here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, again, the giantess isn't crazed in heat anymore, maybe you can talk your way out of this situation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the giantess moving you downwards unnervingly slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that soon you'll have no more choice. If Mesprit wants you to do it, she can easily make you. Surrendering to her desires sounds easy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, on the other hand, you can surely try to reason with her. After all, she isn't the lust-crazed beast she was back then, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thousand thoughts occupy your mind as you try to take a decision, but you must hurry - time is running out!</span></div></div>",

I can check if those three are nearby, you know.\" you mutter. But he shakes his head.<br>\r\n\"If they somehow find us, we'll have to run. I can't risk.\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in understanding and go silent again, waiting for the sun the appear over the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, it never does.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Little one? If you are around, come out, please!</span>\" a very familiar voice breaks the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go pale, and look at Lucario, who peeks out of the bush.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit,\" he mutters, scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose no time and gently rise Vaporeon from your lap. <br>\r\n\"Run.\" you instruct as you hand her to Lucario.<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n\"She can feel my emotions! She'll find us anyway!\" you suffocate your voice in order to not be heard by Mesprit.<br>\r\n\"She won't hurt me. Now go!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario nods. Without losing anymore time, he secures Vaporeon in his grasp and exits the bush, soon disappearing into plants and darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Little one? I can sense your fear. I won't hurt you,<br>\r\npromise.</span>\" Mesprit calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you step out of the bush as well, though in the opposite direction Lucario went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you stand up again, you find yourself staring at a mountain of blue fur. Looking upwards, you find, as expected, two golden eyes, belonging to a pink face, looking straight down at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Little one!</span>\" Mesprit exclaims, lowering her paws to get a hold of your body<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Oh, when Azelf told me you were gone... I thought-</span>\" she says, bringing you upwards. However, you interrupt her.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit. We need to talk.\" you say, deciding that running from your problems won't help you solving them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">So, here we are. What did have to tell us?</span>\" Uxie asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past ten minutes, Mesprit telepathically called her sisters, telling them she found you. Then, she returned to the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween hugs and sentences of how much worried they were, you gave a short explanation of what happened. There was no point in denying about Vaporeon since Azelf saw her, but you didn't mention Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, you're currently sitting in front of the three giantesses. Three pairs of identical tails are laying around the cave, while two pairs of golden eyes are fixed on you. Though Uxie's eyes are lidded, you can tell that she has her attention on you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Azelf told us that you talked about a few things that none of us seems to remember,</span>\" Mesprit says. You look at Azelf inquisitively.<br>\r\n\"But she made me a certain deal,\" you remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue giantess lowers her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I was lying. I have no clue about what you said, I just wanted... I just wanted you, alright?</span>\" she admits, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes. <br>\r\n\"Say, does the word 'rampage' tell you something?\" you repeat the same question you asked Azelf earlier. And, just like her, Mesprit and Uxie look confused.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">No.</span>\" Uxie replies after a moment of silence.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Why? Should it?</span>\" Mesprit asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod slowly.<br>\r\n\"Earlier, I woke up. Or rather, I was woken up.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">By?</span>\" Uxie asks.<br>\r\n\"For now, I'll keep that for me,\" you reply, not wanting to out the local pokemon in danger.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I was told something about you three.\" you say, trying to use a calm tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf already knows your story, so she stays silent. But her sisters can't hide their curiosity.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">What were you told?</span>\" Mesprit asks.<br>\r\n\"I learned that you three... in this particular period, not always...\" you say, suddenly reluctant to go on.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">What?</span>\" Uxie inquires.<br>\r\n\"Well, you... how can I say this?\" <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">We apparently lose control,</span>\" Azelf speaks for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sisters stare at her. Then, they look at you, mouths wide open. You nod timidly.<br>\r\n\"That's right. You can't control your urges. You get crazy with lust. They're scared, girls. So scared. You go on a rampage, do things that you would normally regret. But you seem to forget all of that,\" you say, the mouth of the trio opening more and more as you speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And speaking of forgetting, Uxie, they don't remember you ever doing that for a certain reason, I believe.\" you reply, looking at the yellow headed pixie.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">This can't... this can't be! I never open my eyes for a reason!</span>\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n\"Apparently, not during this season. And, if I got it right, other... friends died. Died, girls. They didn't want to break your hearts by telling you, but they wanted it to stop!\" you reply bluntly. For a moment, you imagine the silhouettes of Lucario and Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new concern comes to you. Are they alright?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">This... this can't be. We can't... we couldn't have...</span>\" Mesprit says, holding her head in her paws, like trying to wake up from a nightmare.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">You didn't tell me these things, little one. I can't believe this. Uxie would never... we would never have done something like that.</span>\" Azelf states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie stays silent, seemingly thinking.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">W-Wait. I remember something,</span>\" she then days, earning curious looks coming from you and her sisters.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I don't exactly remember when, but a few pokemon died around here. When I asked how to other pokemon, they told me nothing and left...</span>\" Uxie states, visibly incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">So...</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">It all was true...</span>\" Azelf and Mesprit say. You nod.<br>\r\n\"That's why I ran. They told me to do so, otherwise you would have lost control and you may have hurt me,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three giantesses exchange sorrowful looks, before looking back down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>We're sorry!</b>\" they exclaim at unison. Mesprit's paws rush down to grab you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself crushed in her grasp, while her sisters hug her - and you as well, only making it harder for you to breath. You notice tears pouring down their cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">H-How could we... how could I... what guardian am I, letting this all happen?!</span>\" Uxie shouts.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">What have we done? That's horrible!</span>\" Mesprit cries.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">We're supposed to protect other pokemon, not harm them!</span>\" Azelf screams. By now, anyone would have understood who your 'friends' are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing goes on for almost an hour. Just when you're about to pass out from the lack of oxygen, the three release you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">We are... we are truly sorry for all of this...</span>\" Uxie sniffles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">If you still... want to leave, we'll let you go. We can't blame you...</span>\" Azelf says, wiping tears away.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">But if you still... but if you still want to stay with us,<br>\r\nwe promise you...</span>\" the three once again look at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>We promise we are never going to hurt you.</b>\" they say at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComplete silence falls into the cave, as they stare down at you, eyes still wet from the tears that had been pouring from them not even a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't do anything but regard the pitiful sight of the three sorrowful sisters. Now you know why those pokemon didn't want to reveal the truth like you did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, they offered you a choice. If to leave - and you're tempted to do so - or if to stay with them, with the promise you're not going to be hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever choice you take, it will have its consequences. If you leave, you're sure that you're going to miss them. But, if you stay, they might just lose control and try to use you again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long and hard reflexion - it was hard, because the three sisters were staring at you for the whole time - you finally decide yourself...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Admittedly, a big part of you wants to just tell the sisters to put you down, let you grab your bag and leave, no strings attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the other part, a weaker, yet still very audible voice in your mind tells that you don't want that, it tells you to trust the three legendaries. It tells you that their tears were of sincere regret. And leaving would mean that the three are going to be not just sad. They would be heartbroken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you don't want that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance up, noticing them staring down at you intently, eagerly waiting for your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich they soon get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you... if you really will try to not lose control anymore...\" you start.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">We won't,</span>\" Mesprit, who is still holding you in front of herself and her sisters, speaks up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I don't want anymore problems around my lake. We'll try to keep ourselves under control, right Azelf?</span>\" Uxie asks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Absolutely.</span>\" Azelf replies, nodding her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue:<br>\r\n\"Then, if you really won't hurt me... I don't want to leave you girls.\" you admit. It felt like a boulder was lifted from your soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit and Uxie smile brightly. But Azelf looks perplexed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Glad to be hearing so, but...</span>\" she says. Her sisters look at her. And so do you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">... But we still have our... problems. Do you... do you still want to... fix us?</span>\" she timidly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile a little.<br>\r\n\"As long as my willpower, emotions and memories stay where they are. But... let's keep that under control, alright?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get no response but three big smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the next second, you are assaulted by three pairs of large lips; blue, pink and yellow is all you can see; their touch on you is all you can feel; the smooching they produce is all you can hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only other thing you can feel is the burning sensation growing each time their lips make contact with your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after a good amount of time they finally pull off, leaving a dizzy you almost unable to stand on your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit gently places you down.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">That's just sweet of you.</span>\" she says, smiling brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You know, since we took care of this little problem,<br>\r\nwhy don't we go back to sleep? It's still pretty early you know. I could use a few more hours of rest.</span>\" Uxie says, reaching her original spot and laying down, sending small shockwaves through the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">You're right, sister. Of course, I wouldn't have woken you if it wasn't for a good reason.</span>\" Azelf states as she lays down as well, soon followed by Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of what to do, you start laying down as well.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You may be cute, but you're stubborn. You're not sleeping on the ground.</span>\" you hear Mesprit saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd second later, you're pulled towards her by a strong psychic grasp. You try to resist it with all your mental strength, but you only manage to slow down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, you end up getting closed in a tight hug.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Hey Azelf, This little one has some willpower in him. He almost resisted!</span>\" Mesprit chimes. You can hear the Uxie and Azelf giggling from beside Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then feel a pair of lips pressing on your forehead, before the three relax, soon falling asleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit: you're not sure if this was the best choice. But you didn't want to leave the trio. Especially not after they started crying, sorrowful about their actions. You sigh. This relationship with them might be hard, but maybe you'll survive until the season is over. They did promise to not harm you, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes, wanting to rest after the events of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, human.\" it feels like very little time passed since you feel asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your vision blurry, you drowsily gaze at whoever woke you up. You discover that Mesprit rolled on her side in her sleep, but she's still holding you tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, your brain registers this a secondary information, because you quickly take notice of two familiar pokemon staring upwards from down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bit of an effort, you free your arms from Mesprit's hug, and you rub your eyes, before opening them.<br>\r\n\"Vaporeon? Lucario?\" you call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, you guessed right.<br>\r\n\"We need to talk. Again.\" comes Lucario's grumbly voice.<br>\r\n\"Vaa. On.\" cries the sweeter one belonging to Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, not quite wanting to leave the warm embrace of Mesprit again. But, regarding what you learned earlier, you decide that you might as well listen to them. It might be something worth your well-desired sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you slowly and silently free yourself from Mesprit's paws and slide down her body, landing right in front of the two waiting pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario slowly looks upwards, maybe checking if Mesprit woke up, before his gaze returns on you.<br>\r\n\"We heard everything, you know,\" he whispers.<br>\r\n\"You don't want to leave anymore.\" you mutter some incomprehensible words in response, annoyed by the fact that the two have been watching your reconciliation with the three. <br>\r\nEspecially the moment when they started kissing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Vaporeon staring up at you with an indecipherable expression. Something between fear and irritation. Sadness as well, maybe? You understand the first two emotions, but why would she be sad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They promised me that they'll try to control themselves.\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"But I don't think we should talk about this. Not here,\" you say, pointing to the entrance of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth pokemon look at each other, exchanging nods, before starting to walk towards the exit, you following close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take one step outside of the cave, noticing that your previous wish was granted: dawn finally came, weakly enlightening the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou abruptly stop walking, reluctant to leave. If by any chance one of the three wakes up and notices you're no longer in there with them? What would happen then? Would they believe that you lied to them and ran away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould they believe that you betrayed them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought is interrupted by yourself being pulled forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Lucario and Vaporeon pulling both your jacket and your pants, one with his paws, the other with her mouth.<br>\r\n\"Let's go human!\" Lucario grumbles, letting go of you as he noticed your comeback to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as you hurry to follow the two in direction of the forest...</span></div></div>",

I don't want those three to find that I'm missing again.\" you whisper to Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue, bipedal pokemon looks back at you briefly.

Weirdly, Vaporeon hasn't even made a noise since you reconciled with the three sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but wonder what's up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk in the middle of the cave and look straight at Lucario, digging your hands in the your pockets.<br>\r\n\"Well? What is so important to cost me my sleep?\" you ask defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario stares at you, that stern look not leaving his face.<br>\r\n\"You know it, human.\" he says after a few moments of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you know what he is talking about.<br>\r\n\"Lucario,\" you start.<br>\r\n\"I confronted Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie. If you were watching the scene, you most probably saw them crying. They were sorry, Lucario. Sorry about what they did.

Even if they were lucid for a moment, they're still in heat. They might go crazy at any moment, do you realize this?\" the blue jackal asks, exasperated by the events of the night.<br>\r\n\"They promised they won't hurt me... or anyone else.\" you retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario grins sinisterly.<br>\r\n\"Right. You just listen to whatever comes out of their mouths, don't you? You really think they won't become crazed with lust again? That they won't go on a rampage, ending innocent lives, yours included?\" he asks, now assuming a serious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... that's a chance...\" you admit.<br>\r\n\"Va-poreon.\" Vaporeon suddenly cries. You look at Lucario.<br>\r\n\"Vapid is still willing to escort you to safety while you still can,\" he translates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to get annoyed.<br>\r\n\"Didn't you hear me? I'm not leaving.\" you state firmly.<br>\r\n\"I trust those three sisters, alright?\" Lucario looks at Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth exchange incomprehensible cries.<br>\r\n\"You trust them? Really? Or maybe, since they... did it with you, you think you can get more?\" Lucario then asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flush red. How could these two think about something like that right now?<br>\r\n\"What - no! I didn't even want to do it in the first place!\" you try to defend yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth pokemon exchange more unknown words.<br>\r\n\"And a plead and a few tears were enough to convince you?\" Lucario then asks sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question of his means two things. One, he's using the sister's earlier actions against you; two... they've been spying on you after Vaporeon left!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's none of your business.\" you reply bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario starts walking around you slowly, seeming to be thinking. About what to say next.<br>\r\n\"Look, you don't understand. You <i>need</i> to leave. Not just for your own sake, but for ours as well.\" he says, trying to sound calm, but having little success in hiding the exasperation in his grumbly voice. He must be trying to reason with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Vaporeon, who nods her head, agreeing with the words of Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you stand your ground.<br>\r\n\"Lucario, it is you that don't understand,\" you say, trying to use a calm voice as well.<br>\r\n\"I have no intention of leaving. I trust them. You didn't want to shatter their hearts by telling them the truth, I don't want to shatter their hearts by leaving.\" Lucario's paw slams against his forehead as he cries his name frustratedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon repeats her name twice, her gaze locked on Lucario.<br>\r\n\"I know this is serious. This human is stubborn, I can't do anything about it. Go ahead, try to convince him.\" he replies as if you weren't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon walks towards you and stands on her hind legs, her forepaws leaning against your legs.<br>\r\n\"Vaa-on,\" she cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Lucario, obviously not understanding, but the bipedal pokemon turns his heads away. Sighing, you look back at the water type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cries her name twice, and points first to herself, then to you, before pointing to the entrance of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she briefly pulls back. Her tail supports her body as she closes her forepaws together, as if begging you.<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" you reply like a Slowpoke who just noticed that its tail was bitten by a Shellder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon repeats her moves a couple more time before you finally understand the meaning of her words.<br>\r\n\"... you're saying that we should just go, right now?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quadruped water type nods, returning on all fours, her tail springing back up. It's now your turn to face palm.<br>\r\n\"Look, I can't - and I don't want - to leave. I grew attached to those three sisters. And I believe they did as well,\" your explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Lucario decides to talk again.<br>\r\n\"They didn't! They're just crazed with lust! Will you ever understand that?\" he shouts, no longer containing himself.<br>\r\n\"And who are you to say that?\" you ask with a frosty voice, staring daggers at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lets a out a loud growl after hearing your words.<br>\r\n\"Look,\" he says, taking a step forward.<br>\r\n\"You.\" he takes another.<br>\r\n\"Need.\" he stops inches from you.<br>\r\n\"To leave.\" he finishes, threateningly leaning forward, his muzzle now close to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull yourself back.<br>\r\n\"And if I don't want to?\" you stubbornly ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at Vaporeon, and says something in poke-speech. Vaporeon suddenly seems alarmed, and cries her name while frenetically shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario shouts his name louder. The water type shakes her head, and backs away looking afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario looks back at you, now looking stressed. You suddenly understand why Vaporeon looks scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis crimson eyes locks on your form as he opens his mouth to speak again...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright, fine! I don't care anymore!\" Lucario shouts loudly, his voice echoing around inside the cavern.<br>\r\n\"Do whatever you wish! Go back to those sisters, stay with them! But don't you blame me when they'll start using you as a plaything!\" with this last remark, Lucario turns his back to you and hurries to the exit of the cave, soon disappearing outside, leaving a scared Vaporeon and a dumbfounded you behind, both staring at the point where the blue jackal was not even a minute ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Vaporeon looks at you with that pleading expression of hers. She seems to be saying: 'Please, listen to us'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you lower yourself to pick her up. She lets you.<br>\r\n\"I can't leave. I'm sorry, trust me, but I simply can't.\" you start petting her lightly.<br>\r\n\"Vap...\" she cries softly, assuming a resigned expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently let her back down.<br>\r\n\"I must be leaving now. If those three find that I'm missing again, they'll think I betrayed them. I need to get back to the cave.\" you mumble.<br>\r\n\"On!\" the water type exclaims, using her paw to point first to you, then to herself, and in the end to the exit.<br>\r\n\"You... want to escort me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, she nods. You figure it makes sense. After Lucario's outburst, it is highly probable that someone from the crowd of pokemon from earlier heard you out there. Maybe Vaporeon wants to help you avoid unwanted surprises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, slowly, you follow her to the cold outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon leads you through the forest. It was dawning when you left the cave for the second time; now, the sun rose some more. Most of the pokemon that occupied the trees and the bushes - probably keeping an eye out for you - are gone, while others, you notice, are just starting to stretch under the warm rays of the sun. All while a certain trio is still is still in the land of dreams, still inside the cave you're being led to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but think again about Lucario's words, but you quickly shake the thought off. Those three sisters swore that they will never hurt you. And you firmly believe that they wouldn't do something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the playful, loving Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the shy, sweet Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the nice, (mostly) gentle Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely lost in your thoughts, you soon get to the cave completely unharmed. Returning to reality with Vaporeon's cry, you look down at her, noticing that she's staring right back at you.<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you mutter, leaning forward to pet her head. The quadruped water type barks happily.<br>\r\n\"So, er... see you later.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon looks at you, somewhat dejectedly, before nodding her head, starting to trot off. Soon, she is concealed from your sight by the thick vegetation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a deep sigh. Which is followed by a loud yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't get too much sleep tonight. You really can't wait to shut your eyes close for a few hours at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out another couple of yawns, you enter the cave, soon finding the trio giantesses still sleeping there on the floor, three pairs of tails are laying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, you walk over Mesprit. Much to your luck, one of her arms is laying on the floor, while the other is still on her chest, right where you were earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you start climbing up her arm, managing to get to her ample chest only after twenty minutes. Tired out, you lay down on the furry surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit seems to feel you in her sleep, as she starts to moves her arms, then she closes both paws around you, embracing your whole being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, but you really can't deny that, as much as it is embarrassing, this is one comfy way to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes, and try to empty your mind from all the not-so-good adventures of tonight. And it seems to work, as you soon start to feel drowsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, in just a few minutes, darkness claims you, and you follow it without complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Wake up, cutie!</span>\" a loud, cheerful voice drags you back to reality from dreamland. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot quite willing to leave the embrace of sleep yet, you bury your head as deep as you can into your pillow.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Aw, isn't this just cute?</span>\" a second, but as well cheerful voice chimes, tugging you back to your senses again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBothered, your brain forces your eyelids to part as you take your first look around, discovering yourself staring at a wall of blue fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of yesterday come to you as you feel something gently poking your head a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing softly, you gaze up, discovering, as expected, two pairs of golden eyes, while a third pair is hidden by two yellow eyelids. You notice Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie with smiles on their faces. Although Azelf's seems... unconvinced for some reason. Plus, you also take notice that Mesprit is the one currently holding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" you mumble. Uxie is the first to talk:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">About the time you woke up, dear. Good morning.</span>\" she says politely. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Some sleepyhead you are!</span>\" Mesprit chimes, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile a little, and turn your head to Azelf. Her gaze locks with yours. A faint, red shade covers her cheeks as she quickly looks away, while starting to float towards the cave entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sisters don't seem to notice her weird behavior, though, as they follow her outside and into the warm sunlight. You notice that the sun fully rose up in the skies, enlightening Acuity Lake and the area surrounding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit gently lets you down on the grass.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Magnificent day, isn't it?</span>\" Uxie states, stretching.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hey, little one, would you like to help me around here again?</span>\" she then asks you, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't reply as, again, you notice Azelf acting weird, floating apart, keeping her back to you and her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined to find out what's wrong with her, you make your way towards the blue giantess, earning a curious look from Mesprit, and a concerned one from Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf?\" you call as you reach her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Hm?</span>\" she looks down at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Oh... ehm... you...</span>\" she mutters shyly, bringing her paw down in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hop on as she brings it, and you along, back up to her face.<br>\r\n\"Azelf, can we talk in private for a moment?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness looks at you curiously, before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"clblue\">Sure thing.</span></i>\u2019 you flinch as her voice suddenly sounds in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly recover yourself.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Alright, what's up with you? You're acting weird.</i>\u2019 you cut short.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"clblue\">Me? I'm fine.</span></i>\u2019 she replies.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Do not lie. I only want to help you,</i>\u2019 you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"clblue\">I can't... not after last night... you would never...</span></i>\u2019 she stops in mid sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind puts two and two together.<br>\r\n\"<i>Azelf... your heat...</i>\" you say. She gives a sad, heart-melting smile and nods her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally slap yourself. How? How could you forget about it after all the events of this night?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to reply, but Uxie suddenly hovers closer to her blue headed sister.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Are you alright, you two?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"<b>Yes.</b>\" both you and Azelf reply at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie offers a small sigh of relief, then a smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Then, would you like to help me again, human? I actually enjoyed having some company during this kind of things,</span>\" she says. All while Mesprit, you notice, watches the scene with an intrigued expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pay her no attention, and look first to Azelf, then to Uxie. If the yellow headed pixie just asked you to help her again, why refuse? After all, you enjoyed, and enjoy, her company as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut another, smaller part of you also wants to help Azelf out. In a way or another, you're going to spend more time with one sister than with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only difference is that Azelf has another conception of 'help' right now. You remember her words \u2018You would never...\u2019. <br>\r\nAccept? Agree? Does she think you were offended last night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at both sisters, discovering Azelf's cheeks red once again, and Uxie with an expectant expression. They clearly want you to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems an infinite amount of time, with a deep sigh, you make your decision...</span></div></div>",

He stares at you for a whole minute, negative feelings flowing between the two of you like electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, he gives an exasperated sigh.<br>\r\n\"You don't understand. You refuse to face the reality. Those three legendaries are a threat. They can't control themselves. Say, what do you think will happen once you're... out of use?\" he asks, his grumbly voice filled with ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't respond, not even wanting to think about such occurrence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario tells you anyway:<br>\r\n\"They'll just throw your dead body somewhere and they'll come get us!\" he grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder.<br>\r\n\u2018T-Those three are really a threat after all...?\u2019 you ask yourself. An internal conflict goes on inside you for a few minutes, before you shake your head while shouting out loud:<br>\r\n\"No, they're not!\" Lucario and Vaporeon flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to the two of them.<br>\r\n\"I will repeat myself, they're the sweetest creatures ever. Didn't you see them crying earlier? I honestly regret telling them what they did,\" you admit.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we saw them crying. And you fell for it. You humans are-\" <br>\r\n\"You're wrong!\" you interrupt.<br>\r\n\"They're not a threat. They're not! And for Arceus' sake, I will NOT leave!\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bipedal pokemon remains silent. You continue.<br>\r\n\"All you're doing is blabbering about how dangerous Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie are, and how stupid we humans are. But will you know what? I may be stupid, but those three sisters aren't dangerous! And, if you don't comprehend the sincerity of their tears, well, the only idiot here is you!\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, you look at him. You wish you hadn't. His fists are closed as well as his eyes, while his sharp teeth are gritted. A dark aura seems to surround him. And you need no Uxie or Mesprit to realize that he's getting angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" he asks, his voice even colder than before. You notice Vaporeon backing away, even more scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jackal's eyes open up again as he stares daggers into you. You, however, remain still.<br>\r\n\"Last warning human,\" he grumbles.<br>\r\n\"Leave, or you'll be forced to!\" he literally roars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Vaporeon runs in between you and Lucario, starting to bark at him.<br>\r\n\"There is no other choice! This human... must leave...!\" Lucario exclaims.<br>\r\n\"<u>You don't need to force him! The choice is up to him!</u>\" Vaporeon barks.<br>\r\n\"<u>No, it isn't! We can't risk!</u>\" Lucario howls in poke-speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the argument goes on between the two pokemon. Every once in awhile, they would turn to you, Lucario staring at you coldly, while Vaporeon throws quick, pleading looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>We can't force him to leave! Those three would hunt us down!</u>\" Vaporeon barks, starting to get pissed.<br>\r\n\"<u>And what do you think we should do? This human is stubborn! He just won't understand!</u>\" Lucario snaps back at her.<br>\r\n\"<u>But... maybe he's right. Maybe the legendaries were truly sorry.</u>\" Vaporeon tries to reason with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the jackal giving a deep sigh, growing more and more angry the more the argument continues. Even though you're not understanding a word, you definitively understood what the two are arguing about.<br>\r\n\"<u>We both know they weren't! It was only lust!</u>\" Lucario growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Urgh, the human was right. Why can't you simply accept this possibility? Give them a chance!</u>\" Vaporeon barks.<br>\r\n\"<u>Shut up!</u>\" her ears twitch with irritation at the last two words, pronounced in an imperative tone.<br>\r\n\"<u>Lucario, I don't want to beat sense into you, but I will if you keep this up,</u>\" Vaporeon says, wagging her tail for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the blue and black jackal closes his forepaws together, a blue sphere of energy forming in between them. Growling, Vaporeon opens her mouth, frosty air taking the shape of an azure ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch the scene with disbelief. They don't mean to start a fight right then and there, do they?!<br>\r\n\"Uhm, guys, le-let's calm down...\" you stammer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey completely ignore you, too busy staring daggers at each other.<br>\r\n\"Come on, weren't you friends?\" you try, attempting to convince them to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to your words, Lucario throws the aura sphere at Vaporeon, who releases her blizzard attack in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth attacks collide, creating a literal wall of smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Lucario sees his chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly, he runs up to Vaporeon, and places a paw on her head.<br>\r\n\"<u>I'm sorry.</u>\" he mumbles, before releasing a force palm attack. The effect is instantaneous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon falls flat on the ground, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario stares at her for a couple seconds, before turning to you.<br>\r\n\"This is... all your fault. None of this would've happened if you just agreed to leave.\" he growls at you.<br>\r\n\"My fault? You're the one trying to force me to leave! You're the one that started the fight! How is this my fault?\" since he's acting hosting towards you, you decide that you might as well stop being nice with words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is! Now,\" he crafts yet another aura sphere.<br>\r\n\"Are you going to leave by yourself? Or do I need to knock you out and drag you away?\" he asks sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step back, startled. You know about Lucario that they're formidable fighters. It wouldn't be a wise choice to try and fight him yourself. But, obviously, you're still unwilling to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour best option seems running back to the cave, back to the three sisters. Lucario wouldn't dare to mess with you around them, would he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, on the other hand, you don't want to worry them. And, especially, you don't want Uxie misunderstand the residents of her lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could also try to fight Lucario yourself. But something tells you that it wouldn't end too good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jackal keeps staring at you with that cold stare, and with his aura sphere still floating in between his paws. Whatever he will do now depends on what you decide to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd knowing that leaving isn't an option - at least, it no longer is - you're pretty sure that he will throw that sphere at you as soon as you run off or you try to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few minutes to decide yourself, but, in the end, you make your decision...</span></div></div>",

And, wasting no more time, you hurry to the cave exit and into the forest, which is enlightened by the sun's first rays, leaving back an unconscious Vaporeon and an angered Lucario, who, realizing what your plans are, emits a loud roar and quickly chases after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back here human!\" you hear him growl. Another explosion roars next to you, suggesting that another aura sphere just missed you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline pumping in your veins along with blood, you start running even faster. The jackal, however, keeps up and follows you, his mind continuosly reminding him of his purpose: you mustn't reach the legendaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, you slow down. You didn't mean to, but your own body is now reacting to your sudden run; first, you start panting. Then, sweat starts pouring down your face. And, in the end, you start slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly glance backwards. Lucario doesn't seem to be feeling your tiredness and, although visibly labored by his chase, he's still behind you. And he's catching up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, it happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble and fall down. Before you can even conceive of getting up, the pokemon is on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head is forced down by one of his knees, while your arms are held still by his paws. It's like he's a cop who just managed to catch a common thief.<br>\r\n\"Now,\" he grumbles.<br>\r\n\"You will be leaving, wether you want it or not.\" he removes his hind leg from your head and, placing back on the ground, he starts dragging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of remaining energy, you let him. It's over. He'll just drag you out of Lake Acuity and to the nearest city before leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, when you're about to fully give up, a thought crosses your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Them.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf, Mesprit and Uxie. Their faces briefly flash in your mind. They have tears in their eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA newfound strength, you start to struggle. Surprised by your sudden activity, Lucario softens his grip, and you break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as he tries to get a hold of you again, you grab him by the spike on his chest and you push him into a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving him time to recover, you start running again. In a matter of moments, you hear him growl as he, once again, starts to chase you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, you manage to catch a glimpse of a familiar cave. And your heart beats faster as you notice the silhouette of a blue giant pokemon. Or, more specifically, a giantess. With a cyan, star shaped head, golden eyes and a red gem on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf is standing - or rather floating - out of the cave. Apparently, she just woke up and maybe, not wanting to wake her sisters as well, she made her way out of the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf!\" you cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon giantess drowsily eyes you, having heard your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her drowsy stare shifts into a frown as she spots the blue jackal chasing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment, both her tails dart forward, separating you from your chaser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving him time to realize the situation, Azelf leans forward as she sternly apostrophes him:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Hey! No messing around!</span>\" she exclaims to a now scared looking Lucario.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">And especially, no messing with this human! Or-</span>\" he dashes backwards, soon concealed by the vegetation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf stares at the spot where he was for one more second, before turning to you with a smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Good morning, you.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Azelf,\" you thank her as she nuzzles you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">After what I did last night?

Not because someone took her will away like she did with you. But because a voice suddenly echoes inside the cave.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Urgh... what's the yelling about?</span>\" the voice, that you recognize as Mesprit's, talks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf turns around, noticing her sister rubbing her left eye with a paw. But the other, open eye fixes straight on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's gaze travels down on her chest, as she makes completely sure you aren't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removes her paw from her eye, opens it up and glares daggers at Azelf.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Azelf. Give. Him. Back.</span>\" she holds out a paw to empathize her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the situation, you can't help but smile. As you hoped, Mesprit is once again acting jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the blue giantess grasps you more tightly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Come on, Mesprit. Can't I have some fun as well? You more than anyone else should know how I'm feeling!</span>\" she whines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">That doesn't allow you to steal the little one from me while I sleep!</span>\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I didn't 'steal' him! He woke me up!</span>\" Azelf retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit shots her an inquisitive gaze. Azelf continues.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Yeah, and he told me a few interesting things. Right?</span>\" she asks, now looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's gaze also fixes on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">What... what did he talk about, sister?</span>\" Mesprit asks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Try asking him yourself.</span>\" is her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your relief, she sets you down on the rocky floor of the cave.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">What 'interesting things' is she talking about, little one? Why did you slip away from me?</span>\" Mesprit asks you with a somewhat annoyed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate. Can you really confront both of them?<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Come on, you. You can tell me if something is wrong.</span>\" she says, giving a sympathetic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh deeply.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit... I didn't leave you. I was awakened by... someone... they told me something about you three. That you lose control during the heat season. That you go on a rampage because of it,\" much like Azelf, Mesprit's mouth shuts open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They told me that...\" you voluntarily stop, not wanting to think about the three of them using your corpse for such purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">That's... ridiculous! Who did tell you all this li-</span>\" you frustratedly interrupt her.<br>\r\n\"Don't you lie to me, Mesprit! Azelf here just proved me that it was the truth!\" you shout.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Me? I did nothing!</span>\" she exclaims indignantly.<br>\r\n\"You just tried having me as well! Without my consent!\" you retort, quickly remembering Lucario's words, 'The next time, you won't get a say in the matter.\u2019 you realize that, again, he was being truthful...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shift your attention back on Mesprit, who is now visibly surprised.<br>\r\n\"Tell me the truth, Mesprit. Please!\" you plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess sighs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Alright, we may have crossed the line a little bit sometimes. But-</span>\" you interrupt again.<br>\r\n\"A little bit? A Snover died, Mesprit! Died! It ceased existing!\" you yell, anger mixing to fear. Emotions that Mesprit seems to detect as she looks even more surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf stares at the scene with an ashamed look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no game. I could seriously lose my own life here...\" you say, calming down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at both giantesses, who are staring at you in complete silence, clearly not finding anything to say. So, you choose to continue.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit, you said you really liked me, right?\" the pink headed titaness nods down at you.<br>\r\n\"Then, if you really do, just let me go. I don't want to risk and-\" she rises her paw, interrupting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I don't think that's possible. Not anymore.</span>\" she says slowly.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask. You look back at Azelf, who is eyeing her sister with a surprised expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I... we can't let you go. I... I... oh, what the...</span>\" you suddenly are lifted up by a strong psychic force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're brought up in the giantess' paws, and pushed into her lips right after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel your fave burning as you get what she was trying to say, \u2018I love you\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness pulls off.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Uxie feels the same way I do, I can feel it.</span>\" she says, closing you in a hug.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You aren't like the others. We really care about you.<br>\r\nWe sincerely love you. Trust me, trust us. We're not going to hurt you...</span>\" she speaks very softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to talk, but no sound comes out of your mouth as another thousands of doubts starts raging in your mind, like the blizzard Uxie rescued you from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she laying again? She seems to be pretty lucid right now... but maybe she's just saying it to convince you to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Azelf, trying to find some kind of confirm. She looks right back at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Trust us. We aren't going to let you get hurt. We won't let you die.</span>\" she says, floating closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, seeing as you don't say anything, Mesprit talks again:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Come on. Let's forget all of this. Let's... let's just return to sleep, alright? Let's sleep on it.</span>\" she says, looking straight down at you with that sickeningly cute smile of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you catch yourself reluctantly nodding. Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giantesses smile. Mesprit lays down again, keeping you still in her solid hug. Azelf takes her original place beside her sister. You can't believe Uxie didn't actually wake up from all the shouting you and the two have been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Sleep tight, little one,</span>\" Mesprit says, pecking your head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Sweet dreams.</span>\" Azelf adds. In the darkness, you can feel a second pair of lips smooching your left cheek. You sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, the two are asleep again. Good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can finally think now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how to feel. The two seemed sincere when they said they wouldn't hurt you, but you know to not trust the appearances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were maybe simply trying to trick you into staying. And they admitted that they really went on a rampage. That only raises your fear of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... what if they were being truthful? If they were, have your really got the courage to shatter their hearts by running away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body is now acting as a battlefield for two factions: your mind, that tells you to not trust them, to slip your way out of Mesprit's arms and run while they are asleep, and your heart, that tells that you might as well trust them after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'battle' inside of you goes on for a while, and you can't really take a decision. You're really tempted to give up and get sleeping, but you know you can't. Not before having taken a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels like hours when your internal conflict finally dies down. And you finally make your choice...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stand there, dumbfounded, for a while. You don't know what to think. Did Lucario speak the truth? Did Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie really go on a rampage? Or did they not? The whole story of them going on a rampage seems just unbelievable... and yet, those pokemon, their scared or angry expressions, Lucario's words... For some reason, you are tempted to believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other hand, your mind refuses to believe it. Those three sisters, they've been the nicest creatures you ever met so far. And plus, Mesprit and Uxie wanted you to 'fix' them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's where the apparently problem is. According to Lucario's words, once those three wake up, they won't ask for an opinion. They'll just use and abuse you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you try to deny it. But the more you think about it, the more your mind tells you that their problems will become <i>your</i> last problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you come to the point when you realize that just standing there won't solve this dire situation you've gotten into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, absentmindedly, you move a step. Then another. And another, until you start walking aimlessly through the woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep walking, only three questions currently occupying your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Leave or not leave?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Risk or not risk?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Trust those three or not?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel dazed, scared, sad; you really don't want to leave the trio, but you also really want to live. Lost in your mind, you suddenly notice that you've arrived to the lake shore, the limpid water reflecting the moonlight. In other circumstances, this would have been a magnificent sight. But in this situation, you can't care less about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, you ponder about the chance of getting discovered by one of the three sisters. But you quickly shake the thought off. The cave where they are - and where you were earlier - isn't too near the Lake. And then again, you're not doing anything bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at your own reflection into the Lake, still overthinking about your situation. By now, your thoughts are reduced to just two words: 'Stay' and 'Leave'. You keep mentally repeating these two words for a while, trying to make the best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, although you do really like Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie... in the end, your reason ends your internal conflict. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor your own sake, and for the sake of the Lake's inhabitants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, sticking to your decision, you turn your back to the waters of Lake Acuity and start walking away, into the depths of the forest, planning to get out of it and get to the nearest town by morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you abruptly halt as you remember about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour bag is still inside the cavern where the sleeping sisters are... at least, you hope they're asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you need your bag. True, your food was stolen by certain mischievous dark-ice types you don't want to think about. But it is also true that you have money in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as much as you want to leave, you know that you must sneak inside, grab your bag and leave. It actually sounds pretty easy. But you know far too well that things never are too easy. If by any chance one of the sisters wakes up, your chances of leaving are done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Made up your mind?\" a voice suddenly asks, startling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily turn back. Only to spot a familiar duo staring at you in darkness. A quadruped, blue pokemon with a fin-like tail and a bipedal, blue and black jackal with red eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario from earlier and the Vaporeon you saw twice already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lower your head, and take a deep breath before answering:<br>\r\n\"Yes. I'm going to leave,\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Vaa!\" the Vaporeon cries with a small smile, seemingly grateful. Grateful, maybe, for your choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, however, continue:<br>\r\n\"But, I need my bag first. I cannot leave without that.\" you state.<br>\r\n\"A bag? Why would you risk your life for a bag? You do know, right, that if the legendaries wake up...\" you unceremoniously interrupt him.<br>\r\n\"I know. But I need that bag. There's something important inside.\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario nods his head.<br>\r\n\"Alright. Go get it, but be quick. Me and Vapid will bring to the nearest... city, as you call it.\" he says. You nod in understanding, and start walking in direction of the cavern where the dreaded trio is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder as you take your first step inside of the cave. The snoring of the three sisters can be heard in distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you venture deeper inside until you finally come to a halt. In front of you are the gigantic silhouettes of Uxie, Azelf and Mesprit, laying beside each other, all three of them fast asleep, their tails occasionally shifting position as they sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, laying in the deepest and darkest corner of the cave, the object of your desires: your bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tiptoe towards it, holding your breath, afraid that even the slightest noise would awaken one of the three - or worse, all three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you walk over your bag, gently lift it up and put it on. Then, silently, you tiptoe backwards, back in front of the three sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then you stop for a moment, a couple tears forming in your eyes. You never were exactly the best with good-byes.<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, girls. Goodbye.\" you whisper, shedding your tears and walking to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, as you walk away, one of the gigantic, identical tails happens to move right in front of you. And, noticing it on the very last second, you end up stumbling, and as a consequence, falling face down on the wide surface of the tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back up and, not caring whose this tail is, you hurry towards the exit, unaware of two things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne, the tail your tripped over belongs to Uxie; two, when you fell on it, the yellow headed pixie actually felt it and woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the giantess turns her head in your direction. True, she never opens her eyes. But, thanks to her psychic powers, she can make out the position of things and living beings just as perfectly as if she had them open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, tired as she is, she doesn't exactly focus too much on you, halfway from the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question now is, does the giantess see you? Or do you manage to slip away in time?</span></div></div>",

The titaness speaks again:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Where are you going? In the middle of the night?</span>\" she asks, yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate to answer. How can you tell her you're leaving? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, just going for a walk. I kinda...\" you don't find any excuse that might cover you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Going for a walk?

Even if her eyes are closed as always, you can feel all the weight of her gaze, which seems to scan your very soul.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Good. Now, what were you actually doing?</span>\" the titaness asks again.<br>\r\n\"Me?... Uh, nothing?\" you try.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Please, do not lie to me. I only care for your well being, so I need you to answer truthfully,</span>\" she says with a concerned tone, before asking again:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">What were you doing?</span>\" you ponder answering, but you decide against it and remain silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence falls between the two of you, interrupted just by the regular snoring of Azelf and Mesprit. Until you notice Uxie moving as she slowly gets up, looming over your comparatively tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then moves a paw in front of you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I guess that me and you need to talk.</span>\" she states. You swallow, and reluctantly climb onto her paw, which she brings upwards as she silently hovers out of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">There. Now we can talk without bothering anyone,</span>\" Uxie speaks as she sits down in front of Lake Acuity, while holding you in front of her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Now, please, answer to my question. What were you exactly doing?</span>\" she speaks with a soft voice, as if preparing herself for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you hesitate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Uxie decides to try with a different approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find her retracting her paws, and you along, to her chest, pulling you in an embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain silent, taken aback by the sudden display of affection. Uxie smiles as she speaks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Listen, it's perfectly fine if you don't want to talk. But if something is tormenting you, I beg you to tell me. I just want to help you.</span>\" she says with a sickeningly sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer availability for you only makes you feel worse. She's asking you about your problems, without possibly knowing the <i>she</i> is the problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut have you got the heart to tell her that? No, you haven't. Just like the inhabitants of the Lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought is interrupted by the sound of Uxie's voice:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Come on... whatever you need to say, just tell me.<br>\r\nI promise it'll remain between us. I won't tell anybody.</span>\" she says, not releasing you from her hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uxie, I-I... I simply can't. Please...\" you plead. But the pixie doesn't let it go.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Yes you can. Just tell me what's up with you. You'll feel better if you talk about it. Look, there's no one but me and you. Nobody else will know what you'll say. And I promise that I won't be upset. So, please, speak up.</span>\" she demands, not dropping that somewhat reassuring smile of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a deep sigh, before opening your mouth to speak. But no sound comes out of it.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Come on.</span>\" Uxie encourages you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh again.<br>\r\n\"Uxie... I wasn't actually... I wasn't going for a walk,\" you admit. She smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I think I figured that out,</span>\" she places a paw over her mouth as she giggles. You flush red.<br>\r\n\"Anyway... I was...\" you stop, trying to say it.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You were...?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou force the words out of yourself:<br>\r\n\"... I was going... I was leaving...\" you say, imagining her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich almost matches your thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow headed giantess drops her smile, and frowns.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Leaving?</span>\" she parrots back, seemingly confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Why would the human want to leave?\u2019 is the only thought she can formulate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod timidly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">B-But... why?</span>\" Uxie stammers, breaking her hug and bringing you in front of her face once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder an answer, but you don't come up with any, aside from 'You're too dangerous'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Come on, now I need to know. Please, go on,</span>\" she says, suddenly saddened. And you can't really blame her as you were pretty saddened by your decision as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Because... Y-You...\" you stammer, but stop in mid sentence.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">What? Did we do something wrong?... Did <i>I</i> do something wrong?</span>\" she inquires.<br>\r\n\"What - no! No no no, not at all. You and your sisters have been the sweetest living beings I ever met. Just...\" again, you interrupt yourself.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">\u2018Just\u2019 what?</span>\" the titaness asks, before shyly adding:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Was I... unsatisfying?</span>\" she asks, her face going from yellow to bright red the instant those words leave her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush as well.<br>\r\n\"No, Uxie, it isn't about <i>that</i>... it's just...\" you say, earning curious look from the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath, trying to decide if to tell her what happened earlier - and most probably shatter her heart - or not say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, you take your decision...</span></div></div>",

That and the pokemon meeting you participated to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you don't listen to her words, and keep your eyes sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie just smiles seeing your resistance.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I won't lie, your stubbornness is kind of cute. But I need you to collaborate, dear,</span>\" she says, gently removing your arms from your face, pinning them to your sides with a simple movement of her paw. The one holding you suddenly closes into a fist, keeping your arms pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she only has to get through your eyelids, which you keep shut closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't right Uxie!\" you exclaim, trying to reason with her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I know it isn't, dearie,</span>\" she says, her now open eyes glowing blue, psychically opening up your eyelids.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But this is for us. We need you. I need you.</span>\" she says, lowering her head near her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're forced to look into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find her free paw finding its way to your head as she gently caresses you in the process. Meanwhile, you mentally struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You mustn't forget</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You mustn't forget</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You mustn't forget</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You mustn't forget... what</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's happening?\" you dizzily say. Uxie smiles, and closes her eyes back up.<br>\r\n\"Uxie? What are we doing here... in the middle of the night?\" you ask, looking at her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Nothing. You had a nightmare, I believe, so I brought you here. The air of the Lake is very clean, I thought it could have soothed you,</span>\" Uxie lies, mentally scolding herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she did wasn't right. But it was to keep the human from leaving, she had no other choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Sorry for waking you up, my dear,</span>\" she politely apologizes.<br>\r\n\"Uhm... don't worry. Can... can we just go back to sleep? I'm kinda tired.\" you reply with a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie's smile widens. Apparently, her human hasn't any memory left of whatever reason made him want to leave.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Of course. Let's go back.</span>\" she says, getting up, embracing you and starting to make her way back to the cave that is the shelter for the night for herself, her sisters and her little human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she happily carries you off, completely unaware that she's being watched by two not familiar pokemon. At least, not familiar anymore.<br>\r\n\"<u>Damn. She somehow wiped his memories away,</u>\" a frustrated Lucario cries, having seen and heard everything.<br>\r\n\"<u>Poor human. What do we do now?</u>\" a Vaporeon asks to her companion.<br>\r\n\"<u>I don't know. How are we going to explain ourselves again?</u>\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>I don't know, but we need to find a solution. Can't we just go get him and - again - explain the situation? Possibly without having me slapping you?</u>\" Vaporeon remarks.<br>\r\n\"<u>I'd appreciate that. It still hurts, you know,</u>\" Lucario growls, earning a giggle from the water type.<br>\r\n\"<u>Plus, Uxie knows about his previous intention to leave. She'll most probably keep a close eye on him now.</u>\" he adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth pokemon sigh, not knowing what to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Sleep tight, dear. See you in the morning.</span>\" Uxie leans forward, planting a peck on your forehead, while laying back beside Mesprit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">See you later, Uxie,</span>\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess hugs you to her chest again, and lays her head on the floor as she gets ready to sleep. You imitate her, and lay your head against her furry chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, just a few minutes later, you're tugged back to sleep, while Uxie remains awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can't help but wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder about why her little one wanted to leave her and her sisters. He said that they hadn't done anything wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, why would he have wanted to leave?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie shakes her head. She decides that she'll investigate your reasons later on. It's not the right moment and, right now, she'd like a few hours of rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she relaxes back and tries to empty her mind from the events of the night, successfully falling asleep again...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up, feeling like a Chesto Berry! Whatever problems that seemed to have bothered you in the past vanished as you were picked up and hugged by your favorite pink giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Mornin'DidYouSleepWellDoYouWannaPlay?!\"</span> Mesprit rambles in a hasty fashion. Clearly she had embraced the hyperactive, excited side of emotions this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' to you too,\" you yawn and try to rid yourself of nausea as you shake around in her grasp. It wasn't very hard, you were feeling great for some reason!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" you exclaim excitedly as you pull yourself out of her grasp adn jump on top of her closed fists, looking at her with glittering eyes, \"I'm ready for anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Mesprit's smiling face as she looks back at you. Her smile suddenly begins to wane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"... What...?\"</span> she mouths breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap, what did I say?\" you ask while crossing your arms before shaking your head, \"No, I'm not taking it back, I'm feeling great and I'm ready for anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Y-Your eyes!\"</span> Mesprit stammers in horror as she holds you up to her own humongous oculars. You can see your own reflection in their golden topaz hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look fine to me,\" you mention as you parade around, examining yourself, \"Looks a bit more yellow than I remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"... Wait, how can you see your own eyes?\"</span> Mesprit simply had to ask while trying to deal with many questions at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see my own reflection in your eyes! Get it? That's why everything looks yellow,\" you laugh as you look off to the side, noticing a yellow tint that wasn't there before, \"Hmm, actually, everything DOES look yellow. That's good, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit gazed upon you with shock, feeling her heart pounding and her head spinning. In desperation, she looked around. Uxie had already left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit?\" you ask. The simple action of the giant turning her head and almost knocked you off your precarious perch and led you to carefully slide your way back into her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"I...\" </span> Mesprit started as she looked at you, her precious little human. That's right - HER precious little human. Not her sister's. And she knew that. It was all just a misunderstanding. It wouldn't be the first time she had jumped to conclusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"I'm... I'm sure it was nothing,\"</span> she explains, but can't really shake the feeling of uncertainty. It was going to ruin her whole day if she didn't find out exactly what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this another one of your games?\" you continue trying to make sense out of the situation \"Because I'm down for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Goood... Shut uuuup...\"</span> a load moaning eminated from deeper inside the cave. You saw an azure mountain tumble over to the side, almost causing a cave-in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SORRY!\" you shout in a particularly loud fashion, causing the mountain to once more shift to her back and shoot you a frustrated gaze. Snickering to yourself, you look up at Mesprit to see if you had improved her mood to some degree. Alas, she wasn't looking at you anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"... Sorry, I just... I need a minute,\"</span> Mesprit says in a solemn voice as she moves over to Azelf and carefully puts you down on top of her belly, before turning around and flying out of the cave in a flash of lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you exclaim in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"What?\"</span> Azelf says in the same surprised manner, causing her stomach to shake and making you tumble over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Oh, sorry,\"</span> Azelf muttered before yawning, making the ground beneath you rise up, <span class=\"cpblue\">\"What happened? What did I miss?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I want to know!\" you shout with confusion. Running after Mesprit made about as much sense as chasing down a planet, so you sat down with your arms and legs crossed on the soft ground and tried to think back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you thought to yourself really, really hard, your body seemed to remember something bad happening recently. But what? Everything had been great ever since you ran into these legendaries. Had you done something to Mesprit last night? Why couldn't you remember?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit soared through the skies of Sinnoh, looking for her sister. Normally she would be easy to find, what with being a gaint and all, but they were all quite good at masking their presence and today she seemed to be eluding her. Was that a good sign or a bad sign? Mesprit felt an ache in her heart - When Uxie makes someone forget something, their eyes gleam yellow for a few hours afterwards. What had Uxie made her little human forget? What had Uxie made him do? No method on earth could return lost memories, so getting the answers from the source seemed like the only way to figure this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDejected, she returned to Lake Acuity and sat down by the lakebed. Regular Pok\u00e9mon fled at her sight, but she was used to it. Being a giant made her dangerous, no matter how kind her heart. It was the sacrifice they had given to be able to protect the three great lakes. Lake Verity was no different, the inhabitants were quite glad to have her protection, but less inclined to befriend her lest she rolled over in her sleep and smashed them into paste by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one that had shown no fear was the human. Of course, he had been afraid at first, but when given the choice he had chosen to stay with her. Any other person would have fled by now in the dead of night. And now Uxie had erased his memories? What was gone? What was still there? And why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's eyes began to tear up. She called herself a guardian, but she hadn't even been able to protect the human from her own sister. Had Uxie had her way with the human and forced him to forget so she wouldn't find out? Or did the human proclaim his disdain for her, and Uxie and made him forget to maintain the illusion of true love?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant tear fell towards the lake. And it was swept up in midair by a Vaporeon, leaping out of the water and firing a water gun straight at it. Mesprit looked up in confusion as a voice rang out from underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"86% of the inhabitants of Lake Acuity cannot survive in salt water,\" a Lucario said from the ground next where she was sitting, \"And you almost just killed them all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"One tear? I doubt it,\"</span> Mesprit huffed with annoyance, before feeling bad at her haughty behavior, <span class=\"cpink\">\"Sorry anyway.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry too. Sorry over what happened,\" Lucario said with an exasperated sigh, \"We should have warned you about your sister, but we figured you'd know her better than any of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"... What do you mean?\"</span> Mesprit asked with a sudden glare of both uncertainity and rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Uxie did to that poor human last night...\" Lucario continued with a hidden smirk and a glint in his eyes.</span></div></div>",

Or with a giantess, in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">From where you please, since I don't know any of it,</span>\" Mesprit huffs, taking notice of the Vaporeon leaping out of the water and sitting next to Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two exchange a few words of which she can't really get the meaning. She does however get a few words, 'Should', tell' 'that?', followed by a few grumbles and cries.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What? Tell me everything. And I do mean, EVERYTHING.</span>\" she demands, lowering her head towards the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two look up to her.<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" the Lucario says, mentally preparing to tell the tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night, the human woke up and got out of the cave in which you, your sisters and him were sleeping.\" he proceeds to tell the events of last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, with a few... modifications.

You never know what humans might do around here,\" he explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit gives a slight nod, remembering what humans did to her and her sisters. Although she trusts that <i>her</i> human would never mess around Lake Acuity - or any of the three lakes, homes of three sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... Go on,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"We saw him walking around the forest for no apparent reason. Maybe he just needed some air or something. He stopped before the lake, seeming saddened by something, though,\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Saddened? But... why?</span>\" Mesprit inquires, confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would the human be saddened? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe... Maybe it was true? Was her precious little one afraid of her? Was her heat problem too much for him to handle? Or was it because of that emotion game, followed by-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario shrugs.<br>\r\n\"We don't know. The human returned to the cave shortly after. Then, he came out again. This time, Uxie was with him. We saw her carrying him back to the Lake,\" Mesprit clenches her fists at this point, biting her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she calms down enough to talk, she speaks up:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... W-What did they do?! They didn't... make love, did they?!</span>\" she almost shouts, rage overwhelming curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiantess and normal-sized pokemon blush at her question. The Vaporeon shakes her head and speaks up:<br>\r\n\"<u>No no, not at all, we saw them talking,</u>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a pokemon herself, Mesprit has no language barrier keeping her from understanding the water type's words.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">About what?</span>\" she asks, calming down a bit.<br>\r\n\"We don't know. We didn't hear anything of what they said. Just...\" Lucario hesitates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... \u2018Just\u2019...? Don't stop now, go on!</span>\"<br>\r\n\"... We saw your sister hugging the human-\" again, Mesprit clenches her fists.<br>\r\n\"... They kept talking. Then, suddenly, Uxie seemed saddened by something, she was starting to cry,\" Lucario says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he hides the reason of why her sister was crying, aka the human's previous intention to leave. The fault of this situation would fall on him, and Lucario himself pities him enough to not blame him for this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, he had no idea about the legendaries' problems. The best thing is to keep the argument around Uxie, who, along with Azelf, is the only one that could handle Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Uxie seemed saddened? And what she did?</span>\" Mesprit asks.<br>\r\n\"... She...\" Lucario abruptly stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon speaks up:<br>\r\n\"<u>... She wiped the human's memories away, then went back to the cave.</u>\" she ends the tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looks at the duo for a few moments, taking in all their words, before reacting.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cover your ears.</span>\" she commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, a loud scream echoes through the whole Lake Acuity, many pokemon fleeing upon hearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even bothering to thank the two pokemon, Mesprit rockets upwards, questions forming in her mind, along with images of what she'd like to do to Uxie right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why did she erase his memories</i>?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What did they talk about</i>?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why both her and the human were sad</i>?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And where the heck is she</i>?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit hovers around in the woods around the Lake, not quite knowing what to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne big part of her wants to just find Uxie and give her a piece of her very angry mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the other wants to see the human, tell him the horrible thing her sister had done to him.

She doesn't want to ruin his day as well as hers by telling him what her sister did to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, still, the giantess is got a task to accomplish: find Uxie and demand answers from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the giantess once again hovers upwards and flies away in search of her yellow headed sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Mesprit soars the skies of Sinnoh, although using some of her psychic to conceal her presence to other's eyes. Some psychic types could detect her presence with their powers, though they would have to focus really, really hard to match hers. She isn't a legendary for nothing, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd having pokemon and humans freaking out upon seeing a giant pokemon flying through the sky - nearly obscuring the light of the sun itself - is the last thing she needs right now. She has other problems to think about right now. More important ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the first of them all is, where the heck is Uxie?! Why is she eluding her?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of searching Uxie, Mesprit stops in the area near a well known mountain of Sinnoh, Mount Coronet, whose top became quite popular because humans believed that Dialga and Palkia could be found there. Obviously, that wasn't the truth, but people kept believing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as a result, not many people climb up the mountain anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sighs a sigh of frustration. Her quest had little success: Uxie's location is still a mystery to her. What if she wasn't even in the region anymore? Then where could she be hiding? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit lets out a cry of annoyance as she feels tears once again starting to form in her eyes. It's like her sister just disappeared from existence itself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Maybe... Maybe I should forget about it... Maybe it was no big deal... Maybe I should just go back...</span>\" Mesprit sniffles, starting to fly away from the area, intending to give up on her objective and return to Lake Acuity. Return to her little human, forget the whole situation and - maybe - save the rest of her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat before it struck her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she's about to float off, she suddenly feels something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Concern</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough not hers. The being of emotions can in fact feel others' feelings as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right now, someone is feeling concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit turns around. Who is concerned about what? And why? Did some human somehow notice her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks around, not noticing any. She can instead feel more emotions following the first one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit gets closer to the huge mountain that is Mount Coronet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... The top. These hard emotions... they're coming from the Spear Pillar...</span>\" she mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking, Mesprit starts hovering upwards, towards the top of the mountain. As big as she could be, her height is still no match for the majestic mountain. And it still takes her several minutes to fly to the top, even at blazing speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the fairy-like pokemon reaches the top of the mountain, the Spear Pillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she immediately takes notice of the silhouette of a titanic creature with a yellow head, a blue body and two identical tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just found Uxie. And she currently has her back turned to Mesprit. In fact, she doesn't seem to have even noticed her yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's heart leaps in her chest. She just floats there for a few moments, not quite knowing what to do now, if letting her rage flow or if quietly asking for answers to Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head. She's no beast. So she decides to talk to Uxie first, discover her reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Ahem...</span>\" Uxie flinches, startled by the sudden sound of Mesprit's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow headed giantess turns around, noticing a not-so-happy Mesprit floating closer.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Oh... hi Mesprit...</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hi Uxie. Any reason to be hiding today?</span>\" Mesprit says bluntly, sounding more irritated than she meant to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie frowns. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'm not hiding.</span>\" she replies.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh yeah. That's exactly why you're all alone on the top of a mountain where nobody ever comes,</span>\" Mesprit ironically states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie flushes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I needed to think, alright?</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">About? Maybe about the reasons why you deleted the memories of a certain human of mine?</span>\" Mesprit glares at her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Okay, first, he's not yours.

Regardless, she continues:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">So, now, PLEASE, why did you do such thing?</span>\" she asks, although with a gentler voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie's eyes fix on the ground.

The yellow headed pixie rises her head to look at Mesprit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">...Why? Why did you wipe his memories away?

She replies instead:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Very well. Then, you'll be interested in the fact that 'your' little one wanted to leave for some reason.</span>\" she reveals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's reaction isn't exactly one would call good.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">WHAT?!</span>\" she asks, once again shock and rage taking over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tear falls from Uxie's eyes.</span></div></div>",

It doesn't look they had done much moving around since she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the only difference is that the human is now laying on her sister's belly while she pats his own stomach with a paw.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Don't worry, she's fine,</span>\" she catches Azelf saying, suggesting the subject of the human's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon noticing Mesprit coming back inside the cave, you spring back up and smile.<br>\r\n\"Hey Mesprit! Where have you been? Why that long face?\" you ask her, your smile fading the moment you notice the upset look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the giantess hovers closer to her sister, and picks you from her belly, examining you up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat yellow gleam is still present in her human's eyes, confirming that everything she has just apprehended wasn't just a nightmare. Uxie did really delete his memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Mesprit felt the need to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid her little one really admit that he didn't love her back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare up at the giantess, noticing her eyes growing damp, her lips shaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf notices too.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Mesprit? What happened...?</span>\" she asks, concerned about her sister's well being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's gaze shifts from you to her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Azelf...</span>\" is the only word she manages to say. Instead of replying, she just turns you around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the blue giantess slowly sits up, and then gets up, bringing her face close to yours, to the point that you can feel her breath on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice her golden eyes narrowing as she examines you, effectively taking notice of something odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human's eyes are glowing yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at you confused for a few moments, before finally understanding the situation. She rises her head to look at the giantess holding you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Mesprit...!?</span>\" she exclaims, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit just nods in response.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">But... why...?</span>\" <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I don't know!</span>\" Mesprit shouts, irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still don't have a clue of what's happening, and you make it clear to the two sisters:<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's going on?\" you ask, trying to not sound too annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is pretty much pointless since Mesprit can feel emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir attention shifts back on you. Azelf is the first to talk:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Human, we need you to answer to a few questions,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Did I do something wrong...?\" you inquire. What do this two know that you don't? Why are they looking like something bad happened to you? Aside from your concerns for Mesprit, you're sure you're completely fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">No no, don't worry. We just need to know... what do you remember about last night?</span>\" Mesprit asks you, looking unusually serious. Actually, both look really serious right now.<br>\r\n\"I... I remember going to sleep with you, Mesprit...\" you sincerely answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Just that?</span>\" she asks back.<br>\r\n\"Yes. I actually don't remember having any dream, but that's normal, right?\" you say.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Not in this case, dear.</span>\" Azelf replies bluntly, looking as concerned as her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoot her a curious gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd your confusion rises when Mesprit suddenly closes you in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is happening...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the two legendaries, your mouth wide open. At first, you were curious about these two sisters' concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you regret knowing them... well, at least you're relieved that you hadn't done anything wrong to Mesprit last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo started explaining what that yellow tint in your eyes is, then why it is there, and in the end Mesprit told you things that your being simply refuses to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I c-can't believe it... Uxie...\" you stammer incoherently.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">As much as unbelievable it may sound, trust us, it is all true,</span>\" Mesprit says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her.<br>\r\n\"H-How can you so be so sure, Mesprit?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">For starters, your eyes are still glowing yellow. Second, other pokemon saw Uxie making you look into her eyes. Third, she's avoiding me.</span>\" Mesprit explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could such a sweet pokemon like Uxie have done something like that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you try to find an answer to many questions, one in particular finds its way out of your mouth:<br>\r\n\"B-But what did she make me forget?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">That's the key of everything,</span>\" Azelf mutters.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And that's what we're trying to figure out. Now, try to think really, really hard. See if you remember anything, any apparently insignificant particular,</span>\" Mesprit says you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already tried that. I just remember something bad happening... but I don't know what...\" you reply, rubbing your head. This situation had given you an headache.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Well, something bad happened for sure,</span>\" Mesprit says flatly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">The only question is, why did it happen?</span>\" Azelf asks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And that's why we need to find Uxie. She's the only one who can give us answers right now.</span>\" Mesprit adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Problem. Where is she?\" you ask. You then notice Azelf with her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens them after a couple of minutes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">She cut off our psychic link,</span>\" she mutters.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What?</span>\" Azelf nods her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit inhales deeply.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Let's go find her.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie is maintaining a low profile today. First, she cut off the link she shares with her sisters. Then, she made sure to keep herself concealed in the underwater cavern of Lake Acuity, the same underwater cavern that serves her as a home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the one who created knowledge, along with her shyness, usually means one thing: a lot of time alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right now, some time alone it's what she needs. It helps her to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she's currently thinking about the events that occurred last night. She didn't want to confront the human and her sisters just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe <i>needs</i> answers if she wants to <i>give</i> answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErasing people's memories is something she hates doing, and now she wants to make she sure she had good reasons to wipe the human's ones away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, she's not going to forgive herself anytime soon. Neither are her sisters, who most probably already found out what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Okay,</span>\" she thinks aloud.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">All of sudden, the human wishes to leave for no apparent reason. He seemed heartbroken, but said that we didn't do anything wrong to him... B-But, I can't think of any other reason that could have made him want to leave!</span>\" Uxie exclaims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has to admit, this situation is quite complicated even for her, the being of knowledge. She lacks enough information to figure out the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie ends up regretting taking the hasty decision to erase to human's memories. She could have simply insisted a bit more to get answers from him. Not that she didn't regret it earlier, though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking and rethinking about the whole situation, she comes to a conclusion:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Me, Azelf and Mesprit must have done something.<br>\r\nMaybe not to him, or maybe indirectly, that scared him enough to make him want to leave. The only problem is: what could we have done?</span>\" she thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Uxie decides that she needs some air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe teleports out of her underwater cave and finds herself hovering above the surface of her Lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, she floats over the land, and sits down, dipping her tails into the water. She just needs to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlo-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>That wasn't very nice of you.</b>\" two voices ring from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives a deep sigh as she turns to face Azelf, Mesprit and the human, held by Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giantesses hovers close to their sister.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">We need to talk, Uxie,</span>\" Azelf states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of replying, Uxie moves her paw forward and snatches you from Mesprit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the pink headed pokemon can express her anger, she gently lets you on the ground.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Little one, go take a walk or something. I don't want you to hear this,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch yourself nodding and starting to walk away. As you do, though, a single phrase stops you:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'm sorry,</span>\" Uxie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at her, and open your mouth to tell something, but a single look at Azelf and Mesprit tells you that you'd better shut up and get lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, silently, you make your way through the forest, walking until you can't possibly see or hear the legendaries anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you lean against a tree, shaking your head as if trying to wake up from a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, the moment you lean back, two figures come out of the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bipedal, black and blue jackal and a quadruped blue pokemon with a long, fin-like tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Lucario and a Vaporeon that you don't recall having seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello human,\" the Lucario talks in perfect human language.<br>\r\nYou remain surprised for a few moments, in which the Lucario speaks again:<br>\r\n\"You and us need to talk,\" he says.</span></div></div>",

She would never do it, not to her sisters. She hates doing it anyway, and doing it to the human already broke her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, that leaves her with only one alternative...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Azelf, Mesprit,</span>\" she starts.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">The human... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">he wanted to leave...</font></span>\" Uxie whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>What?</b>\" Azelf and Mesprit asks at one time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">The human wanted to leave!</span>\" Uxie cries, bracing herself for her sisters' reaction.

They... we, everyone of us will tell you the same thing.\" he states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to Vaporeon, who didn't say anything while her friend spoke, be it because she can't communicate with you or because she didn't want to interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fixes her blue eyes on you. Said eyes shift into a look of fear as she nods her head slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're tempted to lower your head and cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that all true? The three sisters you befriended, the three sisters you've been so close to... Mesprit and Uxie, who you've been with... carnally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose three are a danger...?

Otherwise, you, us, and every pokemon of Lake Acuity will be in great danger.\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words have the effect of making you take a decision.<br>\r\n\"Alright.

You gaze in its direction, noticing Vaporeon, dragging something with her mouth... your bag!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water type lets it go as she stops before you, her tail wagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a grateful smile, you put the bag on.<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you say, before turning to Lucario.<br>\r\n\"Alright, now I think we can-\" a sudden noise catches your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRustling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, taking notice of a few trees shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to the pokemon duo.<br>\r\n\"Run.\" you instruct.

However, I thought I could get lost, and I've, uh, got a compass in here...\" you lie, mentally slapping yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven to you it sounded like a stupid excuse. Even if you got lost, one of the three sisters would have noticed and found you within five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Azelf is reasoning on the same line of thinking as her frown remains on her face. That golden glare holds you down like a pile of steel was on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Okay... what were you exactly doing again...?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to reply, when you notice the giantess' eyes glowing blue. And the answer is forced out of your mouth:<br>\r\n\"I was leaving!\" you blurt out, before covering your mouth with both your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't mean to tell that, what just happened? It's like your mouth spoke on its own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf's own mouth shuts open.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">L-Leaving...?</span>\" she asks. It's what Uxie was saying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at you confused for a while, not quite sure of how to react.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Looks like you, me and my sisters need to talk,</span>\" she says in the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find the blue mountain moving; her left arm extends as the giantess reaches out for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand tall for a moment, knowing that there's only one thing now to do now.</span></div></div>",

And she takes notice of Azelf, holding her little human in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's frown fades, making room for a smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie!</span> she exclaims, her voice going from venomous to honey-sweet in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Uxie here says that you wanted to leave! But you didn't want that, did you?</span>\" she exclaims, reaching out for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Azelf spins in place, avoiding her sister, and she places you down, her left tail gently keeping your will-less body from falling flat on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Too bad,</span>\" the pixie starts.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">That leaving was exactly what he was doing when I found him.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit and Uxie look at Azelf.<br>\r\n\"<b>What?</b>\" the exclaim in unison.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">B-But... I made him forget...</span>\" Uxie continues, incredulous.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">It isn't funny, Azelf!</span>\" Mesprit cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf frowns as she looks to Mesprit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">In fact, it isn't supposed to be. I'm serious! That's why I took his will!</span>\" she snaps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's tails twitch.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... You give that back now.</span>\" she says. Azelf nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail unwraps from your form as you find that you can move again. Regardless, you drop on your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to be lifted back on your feet by a psychic grasp. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Now, I think we deserve an explanation,</span>\" Azelf says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I agree,</span>\" Uxie says. You glance at her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Aw, I won't make you forget again.</span>\" she reassures.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But, now, give us an answer: why did you mean to leave? Again?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't respond, and keep your mouth sealed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Look, If you want an advice, I suggest you talk,</span>\" Azelf says, her voice sounding gentle, but firm.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">We know how to make you talk... I beg you, don't force us to make you talk.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in this moment, Mesprit decides to speak up:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Azelf, don't force him to talk; Uxie don't dig into his mind,</span>\" Mesprit says, scooping you up in her paws and holding you in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm handling this.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow as you notice Mesprit staring at you intently. You can literally see her emotions in her eyes: betrayal, confusion, sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all of that fades. The giantess fixes on you a calm stare as her mouth opens to let her speak:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Human... why do you want to leave us... why do you want to leave me?</span>\" she asks, her calm voice matching her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour silence is enough of an answer, \u2018I can't tell\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Please, tell us... We can talk about it afterwards...</span>\" Mesprit tries again. Still, you remain completely quiet and look backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf and Uxie are staring at the scene in complete silence, not wanting to interrupt. The sound of Mesprit inhaling deeply draws your attention as you shift your gaze back on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You don't wish to leave us, do you?</span>\" Mesprit asks.<br>\r\n\"...What makes you think that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Dearie, I feel your emotions: you're heartbroken. Regretful,</span>\" the giantess explains, maintaining the calm voice she's been using so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain silent.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Now, we only want to know... why were you trying to leave?</span>\" Mesprit inquires again. Only to receive the same response as before: silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm sorry for pressing on, but you need to answer me.<br>\r\nDo you wish us two to be alone to talk? I promise it'll remain a secret between me and you if you want.</span>\" she says, earning two glares from her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe responds by glaring right back to them, before fixing a comprehensive gaze on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Come on... you can tell me,</span>\" she repeats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit... I c-can't...\" you stammer.<br>\r\n\"It's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I don't want to lose you, human,</span> Mesprit interrupts you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Now, if you tell why you suddenly want to leave, it'd be easier to reason about it, don't you think?</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer logic makes sense. However...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't tell it.\" you stubbornly say.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And I can't let you go,</span>\" Mesprit bluntly replies.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">That means we're even.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to the guardian.<br>\r\n\"You mean... if I tell you, you'll let me go...?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Mesprit shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">That, I'm afraid, it's impossible for obvious reasons.</span>\" she says, giving a bit of a smile as she recalls that the person she's holding is the very one who stole her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Come on... whatever reason you have to leave, tell us... tell me... you do trust me, don't you? We won't be offended. And even if we will, we would never do anything to harm you,</span>\" the last statement makes her glance at both Azelf and Uxie.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Right?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Absolutely,</span>\" Uxie says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Absolutely.</span>\" Azelf repeats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Mesprit glances back at you. You lower your head, trying to make a choice. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Come on...</span>\" the giantess says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head perks back up. You crane your neck to fully look into the giantess' golden eyes as you make your decision clear...</span></div></div>",

This seemed to rattle up the legendaries for a moment, Azelf's confidence waning as Mesprit shivered from sensing your frustration. Uxie still had her eyes closed, but her mouth was hanging open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">A-And... What exactly did they...?</span>\" Azelf starts, but is interrupted by a large yellow paw on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Wait,</span>\" Uxie suddenly chimes in from behind as you try to regain your breath, \"<span class=\"cyellow\">Did someone tell you something? But you are the only human here, no?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow nervousley as the closed eyelids of the pixie seem to gaze down upon you. The notion that she could very easily open them and send you back to square one made you realize you had to pick your words very carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The... Pok\u00e9mon of this lake,\" you explain at length with you heart pounding in your chest, \"One of them could speak human, like you three.

Erased my memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">UXIE!</span>\" Mesprit suddenly shouts as she rose to her full height, which was quite impressive from your stature, \"<span class=\"cppink\">Have you been erasing memories of those around the lake!?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">No!</span>\" Uxie responded as she felt a lump in her throat, \"<span class=\"cyellow\">... Maybe once or twice? B-But only because it was really embarassing!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Are you serious!?</span>\" Azelf yells with indignation, eyes shot wide open, \"<span class=\"cpblue\">Sis, you're supposed to be PROTECTING the inhabitants of this lake, not use your powers to take advantage of...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf suddenly quiets down and starts to blush. Mesprit suddenly perks up, sensing an unmistakable emotion from her blue sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You too!?</span>\" Mesprit exclaims in surprise, making a hasty motion to shield you with her massive paw, \"<span class=\"cppink\">You've been... Abusing your powers to...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">No no no! Of course not!</span>\" Azelf shouts while waving her hands back and forth, finally covering her blushing face in her paws, \"<span class=\"cpblue\">How could you even think that!? No, it's just that everyone is so afraid, so sometimes it's nice to have someone to talk to, so if they don't feel like running we can chat for a while and get to know each other better...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Things just move on better if they don't remember,</span>\" Uxie admits bluntly, lowering her head in shame, \"<span class=\"cyellow\">Nobody wants anything to do with me after helping with my heat. And I... Help them along the way.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie exhales heavily and begins to shake. Mesprit slowly floats away from her sister, towards where you have been standing flabbergasted all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I... I thought that's why the human wanted to leave!</span>\" Uxie screams with tears rolling down her cheek, \"<span class=\"cyellow\">Because he helped me! And he couldn't stand to see me again! I ruined it for you, Mesprit, like I always do!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">H-How could you!?</span>\" Mesprit replies as she too begins to cry, her sister's emotions overwhelming her, \"<span class=\"cppink\">D-Don't you understand!? I can't remove memories or s-steal willpower, all I can do is s-sense my partner's overwhelming fear at being inside of me</span>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sisters slowly move away from each other, Azelf remaining in the middle and looking back and forth between them with a terrified expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" you speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">This human, he's the only one I've ever felt love from!</span>\" Mesprite continues her barrage, \"<span class=\"cppink\">And now you've scared him off because you raped him!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like that...\" you try to interject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I did no such thing!</span>\" Uxie snaps back instantly, \"<span class=\"cyellow\">He agreed to it, you stupid, emotional bitch! And I took his memories for your sake!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You two!</span>\" Azelf tries to step in as things begin to flare up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you say, but your words are drowned out by Mesprit's rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You took his mind against his will; That's mindrape!</span>\" Mesprit bellows as she moves closer to her sister who instinctively backed off, \"<span class=\"cppink\">I go to sleep for one night and you rape the love of my life, you worthless little-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn explosion sounds throughout the area as Mesprit tries to grab a chokehold on Uxie, but is intercepted by Uxie's own hands. The two remain locked, Uxie's eyes opening into two tiny slits and her mouth forming into an angry snarl. The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble and you feel your skin prickle form the clash of the two titanesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">ENOUGH!</span>\" Azelf shouts as Uxie and Mesprit both suddenly go slack-jawed, letting go of each other and looking a little dazed. Azelf knew she would catch a million hells for stealing tehir willpower later, but figured it was preferable to her two sisters destroying the entire lake in a fit of rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" you speak up, and at long last the three giantesses appear to notice, \"Listen to what I'm saying - I wasn't trying to leave because of Uxie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You...</span>\" Uxie mumbles, feeling her heart perk up yet not really having any ambitions to show it at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you, Uxie,\" you clarify as the legendary's eyes begin to close into its regular serene state, \"... I like all three of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Cutie...</span>\" Mesprit whispers, feeling like she wanted to hug you but also feeling like she didn't really want to do anything at them moment, \"<span class=\"cppink\">Sis... Stop... It's humiliating...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf happily lets go of her two siblings, who both take a deep breath and feel a lot calmer than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Thank you,</span>\" Mesprit says with a reluctant tone as she looks at Azelf, \"<span class=\"cppink\">But please. Just slap me the next time. Depriving a being of emotion of her willpowe-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Mesprit is embraced by Uxuie, who still has tears running down past her heavy eyelids. Mesprit is taken aback for a moment, but then returns the hug. You look up with relief at the two legendaries hugging in silence, like an astral body too large to fully comprehend. This was nice. A few minutes pass where nothing is said and all your problems seem to have washed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">So... Why did you want to leave, then?</span>\" Azelf asks you in a calm manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh-oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf...\" you whisper while looking up at the giantess with a pleading expression. You really have no choice but to tell them now, but the other two are in a pretty fragile state of mind. Indeed, throughout all of this, Azelf appeared to be the most rational and calm of the legendaries. Maybe it would be OK for you to tell just her?</span></div></div>",

That means that Azelf can freely talk to you for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the giantess' gaze travels back on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">So?</span>\" Azelf asks you.<br>\r\n\"Azelf...\" you whisper, earning a curious look from the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around. After, Lucario proved that you've been spied on yesterday. Who says that he and Vaporeon aren't spying on you again, right now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. There won't be a better time to tell what you learned. And, it's just Azelf after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head perks up. Your gaze locks with the golden one of Azelf, who is still waiting for you to speak. Slowly, you rise one hand, motioning for her to get closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the giantess looks at her sisters, before bending down, until her titanic blue face is standing inches from your body.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">There. Now we can talk.</span>\" she says in a whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to speak, but no sound comes out of it. Your jaw closes back up as you meekly look at the giantess without speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf patiently waits for you to speak. However, noticing your muteness, the giantess smiles in a sweet manner.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Don't be afraid to talk, human,</span>\" she says, closing her eyes as her reassuring smile grows on her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You're among friends here,</span>\" her eyes open back up as she looks at her two still hugging sisters.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Maybe even more.</span>\" she remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flush red.<br>\r\n\"I know, Azelf, I know,\" you say.<br>\r\n\"It's just... I don't know how to start...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">In any way you wish,</span>\" Azelf replies. You don't respond, trying to find the right words to express what you know. To express what made you so afraid of the three legendary sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you don't seem to find any good words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Azelf seems to comprehend before you even speak:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You mentioned the pokemon around this lake, right?</span>\" she recalls.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You mentioned that they talked to you, that one of them could speak your language like we do. What did he tell you, aside from the fact that Uxie...</span>\" Azelf stops in mid sentence, clearly not wanting to depress her sister even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They... they told me something. About you three.\" you start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf eyes you with curiosity, those huge, golden eyes of hers staring deep into your soul.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">...And? What did they tell you?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you remain silent. Can you tell her what Lucario told you earlier? That their heat makes her uncontrollable, dangerous, and possibly lethal for anybody around them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Look. I am not the guardian of this lake. Uxie is,</span>\" Azelf says, noticing that you're still reluctant to talk.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Even if you tell me what you know, I can't do anything about it. So, you can talk freely.</span>\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou timidly nod your head.<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" you reply, walking closer to her face. To ease your task, Azelf lays down, her arms crossing beneath her chin as they support her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne arm leaves the other as the giantess grabs you and sets you on her wrist.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Go ahead.</span>\" she says. You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm sorry, but I don't remember meeting you before,\" you spoke as the Lucario walked closer to you, the Vaporeon stopping beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.

All we do is protect the three lakes, so... how are we dangerous?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate. This is the moment of truth. Have you got the heart to tell it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Come on, don't stop now. You've come this far, tell all of it.</span>\" Azelf says. You sigh, non-verbally expressing your regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your heat.\" you reveal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue giantess gives a bit of a blush.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Our heat? What about it?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf, your heat makes you dangerous. Uncontrollable.\" you say. Azelf's eyes widen as you continue:<br>\r\n\"Y-You are initially satisfied, but then you gradually want more and more. More and more, until you-\" you abruptly stop, not sure you can tell it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Azelf is too shocked to let it slide.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... Until we...?</span>\" she parrots back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regretfully glance at her.<br>\r\n\"You go on a rampage.\" you close your eyes, turning your head elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere. You said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf looks at you, eyes wide open, like her mouth.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Tell me you are kidding.</span>\" she says after a while.<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I wish that. It's the truth Azelf. We both hate it, but...\" you say, only to be silenced by a giant paw being pressed on your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Please... don't go any further...</span>\" she says in a painful whisper, closing her eyes to prevent tears from falling. A futile attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I understand why you didn't want to tell it now. You little sweetie, you didn't want to make us sad, did you?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, though she can't see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess opens her damp eyes and looks at her sisters, who are still hugging silently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Azelf's gaze travels back on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Listen, I understand this. I understand why you wanted to leave,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">But I think I'm talking for my sisters too: we don't want you to leave.

Quietly, the giantess hovers over Azelf and picks you from her, closing you in a hug.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I still don't know what reason you had to leave,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But don't do it... for me... for us...</span>\" she pleads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glance at Uxie reveals that she too is staring at you, tears pouring from her closed eyelids. A silent acknowledgement, she agrees with her sisters: she doesn't want you to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there, squeezed in Mesprit's way-too-loving hug for a while as you try to decide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple tears start rolling down your cheeks too as you make your definitive choice...</span></div></div>",

Reluctantly - very reluctantly - Mesprit obeys and starts to lower herself, gently letting you down on the ground, before rising to her full height again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't want to this, girls,\" you say while looking at the three giantesses.<br>\r\n\"I really like you - all three of you,\" you continue.<br>\r\n\"You're the kindest, sweetest creatures I ever met...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow knowing what motivation made you want to leave, Azelf remains quiet, while her sisters open their mouths in surprise.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But then, if you like us, why do you want to leave?</span>\" Uxie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her and sigh.<br>\r\n\"I... I can't tell you, Uxie,\" you say, before looking at Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf...\" you tell, making the blue giantess look at you with a sad expression.<br>\r\n\"Azelf knows why I'm doing this,\" you reveal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, both Uxie and Mesprit look over their sibling, who looks at you, trying to figure out what is going on in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The choice to tell you my motivation, or not, is up to her,\" you continue.<br>\r\n\"And now-\" you sob.<br>\r\n\"All I ask you is... is to let me go...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore tears start to tall from the eyes of all three sisters as they watch you starting to walk away. You already have your bag, all you need to do is leaving...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Mesprit wasn't going to let it happen so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, a blue and pink mountain moves in front of you, blocking your path. You rise your gaze, looking at Mesprit questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">If... If you leave...</span>\" she says as she sniffles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Then... I'm coming with you.</span>\" she then says, trying to sound firm, although her shaky voice betrays her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statement makes you, Azelf and Uxie flinch.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">What?</span>\" Azelf asks.<br>\r\n\"B-But...\" you stammer.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Y-You can't...</span>\" Uxie finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I... I know,</span>\" she says, before looking at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But I can no longer stay without you, human. I... I love you far too much.</span>\" she sniffles while letting a couple more tears fall down her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, but you can't shake off the feeling of guilt. Mesprit really loves you, and you're voluntarily leaving her and her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know it's wrong, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Lake Verity, Mesprit? Who'll protect it if you come with me?\" you remark.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Sis, that's true. You can't leave your lake!</span>\" Azelf chimes in. Mesprit shrugs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I... we'll find a solution. But I'm still coming with you!</span>\" she says, clearly irremovable on her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Uxie decides to speak up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">If she comes with you, I'll come too,</span>\" she says. Your mouth opens wide.<br>\r\n\"Uxie... you too?\" you ask as the titaness hovers closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You're the first one who ever offered to help me without hating me afterwards... I'd be stupid if I didn't come too...</span>\" she shyly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few steps back. This situation has taken an unexpected twist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a horrible one too. What would people think if they saw you hanging around with two legendary pokemon who are 200 ft tall?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls... be reasonable. If someone saw us together, they'd freak out, don't you think?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Please! We know how to disappear from eyesight. You'd be the only one seeing us!</span>\" Mesprit retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\" you are interrupted as you notice Azelf, who had been quiet for the whole time, taking place in between her two siblings, her gaze fixed on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Human... If my sisters come with you, then...</span>\" she inhales deeply.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I'll come too.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart totally freezes at this point.<br>\r\n\"B-But... Azelf... I told you-\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I know what you told me,</span>\" the blue giantess slowly says, drawing the attention of her siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, she continues.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">But if I don't come too, these two might end up trying to kill each other again...</span>\" she bluntly says while glaring at Mesprit and Uxie, who respond at unison:<br>\r\n\"<b>Shut up, Azelf!</b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently watch as the three sisters start arguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore them, and try to make a choice instead. Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie are determined to come with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... what's the point of leaving then? You're leaving exactly because you need to get away from these three legendaries!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMight as well stay here to Lake Acuity if things go like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother part of your brain tells you that you should try to talk your way out of this situation, convince the sisters to let you go on your own... despite Mesprit's declaration of devotion towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, you could easily try to talk to them and make them renounce on their intent to follow you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, stay or try to leave alone, the decision is up to you.</span></div></div>",

All of sudden, your sadness wanes, and you remember why you love this one giantess back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, you glance at Azelf and Uxie.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucario growls lowly, irritated, as he decides to talk to the human later on. So, slowly, the blue jackal retreats back into the thickness of the forest, waiting for the moment the sun will set. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd whenever the human and the legendaries were gone to sleep, he would have had his occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf sighed in loud annoyance as she watched her sisters arguing yet again. Though this time the argument was a lot less vicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo distract herself, the blue giantess focuses her attention on you, who are still being held by Azelf herself. Mercifully, at a safe distance from the arguing Uxie and Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hey,</span>\" Azelf suddenly calls from above. You turn around and crane your neck to have a visual of the giantess' visage.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Thank you...</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... for what?\" you question. A sad expression appears on the giantess' face as she lowers her head in her paws, to the point where you are standing face to face with her gigantic eyes, two huge golden mirrors that make you feel like a pesky bug compared to this giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... For... you know... for telling me...</span>\" she slowly admits. You take a step back on her paw as your expression drops too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Azelf. I... didn't want to tell that... because I... and them too... didn't want to shatter your hearts...\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue giantess looks down glumly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Guess that was valid...</span>\" she sighs, still not quite able to believe that she and her sisters, the Guardians of the Lakes, whose purpose was to protect the three lakes... did the exact opposite and terrorized the inhabitants of the lakes by going on a rampage, fueled by lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a pretty bitter thought for a guardian...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new thought joins the others in the giantess' mind. That was the reason why the human wanted to get away from Lake Acuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to what he said, the pokemon around the lake told him about their problems. That meant, he needed a protector... they all needed a protector, in case that happened again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Azelf was more than just willing to fulfill such task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess rises her head up again as she looks at you on her paw. You've been staring at her in silence for the whole time, not quite knowing what to say to comfort the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Mesprit and Uxie are still arguing, and it doesn't seem like they're going to stop anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf opts to keep ignoring them. One wrong word, and she would be inevitably pulled into the argument with her two siblings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That</i> would be one good reason to leave for the human...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hey,</span>\" the titanesses suddenly says while glancing back at you. You perk up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Listen, I... I know you still want to leave, don't you?</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assume a surprised expression, which then turns into a blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, she was right. You've been hearing a voice in your mind that told you to wait for the night to fall, for the sisters to go to sleep. And then, you would have had to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to shake off the thought several times already, but the more you tried, the more it came back stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you respond.<br>\r\n\"K-Kind of...?\" you risk answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf closes her eyes and nods solemnly, before sighing deeply.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Very well... don't,</span>\" she bluntly says, before opening her eyes again and looking at you.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">I know what happened now. I know what will happen...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n\"Go on,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Well... If that happens again... I'll protect you,</span>\" she declares while giving a determined smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou however let out a sigh of exasperation.<br>\r\n\"Azelf,\" you say.<br>\r\n\"What if you too... what if you too go crazy with lust...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf's smile shrinks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Well... I did make willpower, no? I've got more self-control than...</span>\" she makes a motion for her still fighting siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all of sudden, the giantess' smile drops into a frown as she decides she's had enough.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Cut it out, will you?!</span>\" she screams, obtaining her sisters' attention.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I swear, all you do is arguing!</span>\" Azelf exclaims, irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looks at her. She ponders answering, but quickly decides against it, not wanting to find herself deprived of willpower again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, that sucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Uxie is reasoning on the same line of thinking as she exhales heavily.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Sorry...</span>\" she mumbles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit ignores her as she floats towards Azelf, and picks you from her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hmph!</span>\" she exclaims indignantly as she hugs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to catch a glimpse of the blue mountain from Mesprit's grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA truly impossible task, given how large the giantess is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, she turns around to face her siblings. And you notice Azelf looking at you, her lips moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA non-verbal message. You sigh in frustration. You were never good at lip-reading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf uselessly tries to make you understand her message, until she grows tired.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpblue\">Deal?</span></i>\u2019 her voice echoes in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou appear startled for a moment, before looking at her and nodding. She smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looks back and forth between you and her sister, before finally asking:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Just what are you two hiding?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf sighs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Nothing sis,</span>\" she responds.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Really nothing.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit nods, but can't really shake off the feeling that the human and Azelf are hiding something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at Uxie. Judging by her expression, she can easily make out one thing: Uxie is just as curious as Mesprit herself is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer human and her blue sister are hiding something for sure...</span></div></div>",

You then look over Azelf, discovering her smiling at you with a serene expression upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess' lips move. Somehow, this time, you are able to make out what she's saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Deal\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passes just as quickly as it started, and it went on like nothing happened. Eventually, the moon found its place in the sky while the sun had left it a while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are currently sitting in front of a small campfire - which required Uxie's permission, and it wasn't easy to obtain - while the giantesses sit aside, talking to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the fire intently, trying to forget all the bad events today had brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Uxie erased your memories. Then, you were told the motivation of such thing. Then, Mesprit and Uxie almost killed each other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Human?</span>\" Mesprit's voice claims you back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look away from the fire to glance up at the giantess. You notice her smiling down at you as she holds a arm out, a pile of berries being offered to you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hungry?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Not really,\" you reply as the giantess sets the berries down. Your stomach happens to growl in this exact moment, remembering you that you didn't eat anything the whole day long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit giggles as she leans down, laying flat on the ground, her gigantic head resting against your body.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Why are you so sad?</span>\" she asks cheerfully, although you detect a feeble hint of concern in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you are tempted to just tell her what you were told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel incredibly bad for not being honest to the giantess who openly declared her love towards you - and more than just once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you quickly shake your head to rid yourself from the temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was because of earlier,\" you lie.<br>\r\n\"Seeing you and Uxie fighting...\" you convincingly shiver at the memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Aw, that?</span>\" Mesprit asks as she begins nuzzling you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I know, it might have been scary for you, but it happens quite often between sisters,</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Especially between us,</span>\" Uxie suddenly chimes in as she moves a bit closer to both you and Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground beneath you shakes as she sits in front of you with her legs crossed, her heavy eyelids seemingly fixing onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Tell me about it,</span>\" Azelf says as she moves up beside you and sits down, all three sisters now encircling you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">These two literally do nothing but argue with each other. Trust me, what happened this morning was nothing out of the ordinary,</span>\" she remarks with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie huffs loudly while Mesprit glares daggers at Azelf, who starts to giggle in a calm manner.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">See?</span>\" she says while eyeing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when a voice resounds within the confines of your mind.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpblue\">Don't worry about that problem,</span></i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Azelf, noticing her smiling reassuringly.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpblue\">If it happens, I'll be there to protect you.</span></i>\u2019 she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile gratefully, slightly comforted by her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I think we all should go to sleep,</span>\" Uxie suddenly says after a while more of talking.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Today's quite been rough...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no denying that,\" you respond as you begin to get up, emulated by the three giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start heading to the cave, the three sisters silently following you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching your destination, you stop, letting the giantesses float inside, before stepping in yourself, completely unaware that you were being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden within the thick forest, Lucario noticed the human disappearing inside of the cavern with the legendaries. He decides to wait for a while, until them all were asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he'll have to slip inside, wake the human and talk to him.<br>\r\nThe jackal sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was his last chance to convince the human to leave. And, if he refused, Lucario himself, the human and the whole fauna of Lake Acuity would be doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon walking inside, you let Mesprit get a hold of you as she lifts you up and floats in a corner of the incredibly large cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground is shaken by many thuds as the three legendaries lay down, while you are brought up to Mesprit's chest and hugged tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Night!</span>\" the giantess exclaims, her voice echoing within the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets drowsy mutterings from her sisters, before she turns to you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Sleep tight, cutie,</span>\" she says while leaning down as she kisses you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush faintly.<br>\r\n\"Ah... you too,\" you respond as Mesprit snuggles up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything goes quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes pass, and all you can hear now is the snoring of Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie, along with the sounds coming from Mesprit's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relax as you try to forget this hell of a day. But you can't stop thinking about what would happen if the three legendaries really lose control because of their lust...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, emptying it from the bad thoughts. Azelf promised she'll protect you... right? She said she has more self-control than Uxie and Mesprit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yawn and decide to sleep on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head leans against Mesprit's chest as you eventually fall asleep, joining the three legendaries in the world of dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sleep is bothered by a sudden sound, \u2018Human\u2019. You ignore it as you move around in Mesprit's hug, trying to get comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human.\" the voice echoes again within the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou desperately try to cling to your slumber, to remain in dreamland. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your attempts are for naught: whatever dream you were having fades away, and you wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan loudly in annoyance as you open your eyes, your eyelids feeling heavy, almost as if they were protesting against you for waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed with sleepiness, you yawn as you rise your head to glance around, trying to spot whatever bothered your slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes eventually adjust to the darkness of the inside of the cavern, and you finally manage to spot the cause of your awakening...</span></div></div>",

For the inhabitants' sake. For the sake of the lake itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, the jackal made his first step within the cave. However, he soon noticed someone coming his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fast as he could, Lucario retreated back outside and dove in a bunch of bushes. Just then, Uxie came out of the cave, the moonlight enlightening her whole body, allowing Lucario to notice the giantess' tiny passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The human?\" Lucario whispers, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what was Uxie doing with the human in the middle of the night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last time this happened, she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" the jackal whispers with horror.

I can take your memories again... if you wish...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...?\" Lucario asks himself, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of offer was that?! The human couldn't possibly accept!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his hiding spot, Lucario watches the human taking a few steps back, just as dumfounded as Lucario himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...?\" you ask, not sure you heard good. Uxie nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I can take your memories again. Just... y'know, I'm not forcing you if you don't want...</span>\" she shyly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But...\" you stutter, feeling all the air leaving your lungs.<br>\r\n\"It isn't right...\" you breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie smiles as she readjusts her position.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Of course it is. You'd only forget about today, trust me. You would also forget the fight me and Mesprit had. That would restore our normal relationship,</span>\" she reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou however shake your head.<br>\r\n\"No no no!\" you shout, unable to believe this is happening again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a strong psychic force grips you as you are moved up into the giantess' open paws.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Relax, will you? I'll repeat, I'm not forcing you,</span>\" Uxie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally manage to calm down a bit.<br>\r\n\"B-But... what if Mesprit and Azelf find out again... what if I end up hating you because I can't remember that I consented...?\" you asks, dreading all the possible, disastrous scenarios that this might bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie smiles reassuringly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I will simply tell the truth: you consented... if you accept, that is.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her statement, time seems to stand still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe you're really considering the offer.

You can't be possibly considering it... but then, reality hits you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ARE considering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of silence pass, and the nocturnal breeze blows past you as you look up at Uxie again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Take all the time you need to think about it. I understand this is difficult,</span>\" she says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou however already took a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you soon decide to make it clear to Uxie.</span></div></div>",

If you can't remember that you wanted to leave, then you won't be thinking about leaving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, even with their heat problem, Azelf promised she'll protect you from it, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Lucario can always contact you again if things go wrong, no...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie looks surprised.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... Are you sure...?</span>\" she asks softly. You nod.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Okay... well then... come over here...</span>\" she says, extending her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step back as you think about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Uxie,\" you say, interrupting her, earning a curious stare from the giantess.<br>\r\n\"If I'm not mistaken, my eyes will glow for a bit...\" you recall. Uxie nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit will find out... That's unavoidable...\" you ponder something.<br>\r\n\"I'd like to do something... something to remind myself that I at least agreed to this...\" you say, scratching your head, deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie nods her head in understanding.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I understand. And I think it's a great idea. That might just avoid me another fight with Mesprit when she finds out about this...</span>\" she sighs in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... why does she even do that...? I mean... why didn't she believe that you didn't rape me?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie sighs again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Love is powerful. Really powerful. But so is jealousy,</span>\" she tells.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">And my sister is stubborn.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh a bit. Before an idea finds its way inside your mind.<br>\r\n\"Uxie - I know!\" you exclaim with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyelids remain closed, but you assume she's looking at you.<br>\r\n\"I know how to remember!\" you clarify, starting to run in direction of the cavern, taking Uxie by surprise.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">H-Hey! Wait for me!</span>\" she exclaims as she hastily gets up, starting to float behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly once both you and her left, a pokemon comes out of the nearby bushes, looking shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario sits down, thinking about what he just saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human accepted Uxie's offer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid human...\" he mutters to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here!\" you exclaim as you reach the cave, before making your way inside. As expected, Mesprit and Azelf are still asleep, a large amount of space left where Uxie once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly walk over your bag, grabbing something from it, before heading for the outside again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie is patiently waiting for you. You smile, and hold out what you grabbed in a triumphant manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">What's that...?</span>\" the giantess asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pen Uxie!\" you exclaim, before eagerly explaining your plan,<br>\r\n\"I'm going to leave a message to myself, somewhere I'll surely look at in the morning. And when I do, I'll-\" Uxie suddenly perks up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... recognize your calligraphy, which would be perfect, because even if I forced you to write, it wouldn't be so accurate!</span>\" she concludes, a smile brightening her face up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I take pleasure seeing a human with such intellect.</span>\" she compliments, causing you to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" you mumble in response, before thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere could you leave your message...? Somewhere where you'll surely look at...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place a hand on your forehead as you think. Only to instantly remove it as you gaze at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand... Perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it!\" you exclaim, stretching your hand. You place your pen on your palm as you start writing your message,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>If you're reading this,<br>\r\nIt means that Uxie erased your memories.<br>\r\n<u>You consented.</u></i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect...\" you mumble as you gaze up at the giantess, sliding your pen into your pocket.<br>\r\n\"I'm done, Uxie,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie nods, gently picking you up, lifting you up to her face, in front of those gigantic eyelids of hers.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Whenever you're ready,</span>\" she gently says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down, backing up a little.<br>\r\n\"Does it... Does it hurt?\" you ask. Uxie shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Not even a little. I've already done this to you once, and you were perfectly fine... right?</span>\" she asks, suddenly sounding concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, she left the cave pretty early in the morning. She didn't quite know what effects her actions had on the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head.<br>\r\n\"Yes... I felt fine... well, except for the fact I couldn't remember...\" you respond. Uxie smiles again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Are you ready?</span>\" she asks in a gentle manner. You nervously nod as you look at those gigantic eyelids, waiting for them to part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Uxie's eyelids begin to shake a bit before they slowly part, revealing once again a pair of big, golden eyes. You instinctively gaze elsewhere as you bite your lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Anything you want to say before... y'know...</span>\" she sheepishly says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'll keep it a secret if you want to, and I'll tell you again if I think it's necessary,</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down. Should you finally reveal what reason made you want to leave in the first place...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide against it.<br>\r\n\"No.\" you respond, shaking your head for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie nods as she smiles a little.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Okay then. Relax, now, just look into my eyes, I'll do the rest.</span>\" she instructs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze remains fixed on her paws. You're starting to have second thoughts about this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. It's too late for rethinking, you decide. You've came this far, might as well do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breath in deeply, before slowly gazing upwards, right into the eyes of the giantess. Uxie smiles reassuringly as she makes eye contact with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uxie... thanks...\" you say with a serene expression as all the memories of the past day are wiped away from your mind, leaving you dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes start glowing yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uxie...?\" you ask upon noticing the giantess holding you, her eyes closed as always.<br>\r\n\"W-What are we doing here... in the middle of the night...?\" you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess looks surprised.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">O-Oh... you woke up... damn...</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"... What are you doing...?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie giggles nervously.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You see, you were having a nightmare. I thought the clean air of the lake could help, but, it did the opposite and woke you up...</span>\" she sheepishly explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let her words sink in and nod, too tired to question Uxie. You yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You're still sleepy, aren't you?</span>\" the pixie asks, <br>\r\ngrabbing your arm in her paw, making sure you don't see the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n\"That's weird... I can't seem to remember what nightmare I was having...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie shrugs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'm sure it's better this way,</span>\" she responds.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Now, let's go back to sleep, what do you say?</span>\" she asks you, starting to float inside the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie moves over Mesprit, gently placing you down onto her chest, before laying beside her. Mesprit's paws find their way around you in less than a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Sleep tight, dear,</span>\" Uxie chimes.<br>\r\n\"Uh... thanks. You too.\" you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes and lay your head against Mesprit's chest, yawning drowsily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, soon enough, you drift off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

But then, your vision becomes less blurry, to the point you manage to see clearly one of the three legendary giantesses - your favourite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing your open eyes, the giantess giggles merrily.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Good morning, sweetie~</span>\" she says, pulling you in a hug.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Slept well?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your eyes.<br>\r\n\"Yes, actually,\" you respond, happily returning Mesprit's hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly - very, very slowly - Mesprit breaks the hug, letting you stand on her cupped palms as she holds you in front of her face... her smile fades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">...What?</span>\" she mutters as he notices your eyes.

Mesprit angrily moves over her, before rising her paws in the air and roughly slamming them onto Uxie's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">OW!</span>\" the yellow headed pixie cries in pain, waking up instantly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">What the hell do you want?!</span>\" she shouts, enraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Mesprit points to you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You did that again - why?!</span>\" she asks, while Uxie gets up, looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">...

And we'd love to know why...</span>\" Azelf continues, eyes fixed on Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Did... did you do something wrong, dear?</span>\" Mesprit asks you, although she's certain about the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know... I can't remember it...\" you state quite predictably, holding your arms up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Wait... what's on your hand...?</span>\" Azelf asks, noticing something scribbled on your right palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha...?\" you ask, confused, as you glance at your palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily read the message, feeling the air leaving your lungs.<br>\r\n\"What...\" you mutter breathlessly as re-read the message over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What's that...?</span>\" Mesprit asks concerned, your surprise detected by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I...\" you mutter.<br>\r\n\"I... agreed to... to Uxie erasing my memories...?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, Uxie starts nodding.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Yes. It was your idea. To remember that you consented,</span>\" she clarifies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit frowns.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Really?! Who assures you didn't force him to write that message?!</span>\" she asks, glaring at Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Mesprit,\" you interrupt.<br>\r\n\"This... This is my calligraphy... I don't think Uxie forced me... it's perfect...\" you mumble, unable to believe this all is happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looks at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie...? Are you sure?</span>\" she asks. You nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie starts giggling bitterly, her feelings not escaping Mesprit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Such a clever little human - he predicted that. It was his idea, he knew he would have recognized his calligraphy, as he knew he would have looked at his hand,</span>\" she compliments, gently patting your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">S-So... y-you really consented to it...?</span>\" Mesprit asks, gently picking you up, staring right at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But... why...?</span>\" she asks, before recalling that you can't remember it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze travels to Uxie.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Why, Uxie? Why did he agree?... Why did you want to erase his memories in the first place?</span>\" Mesprit asks dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie sighs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... Because only this way he could be truly happy around us, after he... y'know...</span>\" she says. You look at her curiously, wondering what does she mean. Though, you decide to keep quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit slowly nods her head in understanding.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie...</span>\" she says, but never gets to finish as Azelf suddenly floats forward, snatching you from her sister and pulling back, staring at you like you were crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Are you insane?!</span>\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You didn't have to forget what you told me!</span>\" Azelf exclaims while shaking you back and forth in her paws, almost as if trying to make you regain your lost memories by doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But... w-what did I tell you?\" you ask, feeling nauseous as well as scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yeah, sis, what are you talking about? What did the human tell you? And for Arceus' sake, give him back!</span>\" Mesprit exclaims, snatching you back in her paws, squeezing you in a protective hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf sighs as she calms down a little.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">The human. He told me something important... like REALLY important...</span>\" she reveals dejectedly after a moment of hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">And what's that...?</span>\" Uxie inquires. Azelf looks at her two siblings, then at you, pondering if she should reveal what you told her about, or if she should keep quiet about it.</span></div></div>",

Even though she's asleep, the giantess still has a good grip on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" you ask, annoyed by the lack of sleep. All you wished for was to sleep on the hellish day you had... and now, Lucario woke you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for obvious reasons, you believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get down, human,\" the jackal whispers from below, careful to not disturb the sisters' sleep.<br>\r\n\"You and I need to talk. Again.\" he adds in a somewhat annoyed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fix on him a tired gaze, before rolling on your side as you readjust, while closing your eyes again, opting to ignore him. Hopefully, Lucario will give up and will leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, you have no such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human!\" the fighting type indignantly hisses upon realizing that you're ignoring him.<br>\r\n\"This is serious!

He shoots you an even colder stare as he firmly points to you, then to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message is clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to avoid him waking the legendary sisters, you decide to do as he wishes. So, you slowly and carefully start to squirm and wiggle your way out of Mesprit's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finally manage to break free, you stand on top of Mesprit's bosom and look at her, checking if she felt any of your movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess' eyes remain sealed but, oddly enough, her arms begin to move as she sleeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's like she felt the sudden lack of you. Mesprit is indeed asleep, but she needs you back in her slumber. Her arms move around as she tries to detect you anywhere on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moan escapes her mouth,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Human... Don't leave... Please...</span>\" she mumbles, giving you a close idea of her dreams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, genuinely touched by the idea that you even occupy her dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneel, and gently start to pet the giantess' chest.<br>\r\n\"I'm not leaving, Mesprit,\" you reassure.<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't dream of it,\" you add with a chuckle, although perfectly knowing she can't hear you due her being still asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, your words seem to sink into the giantess as her arms begin to relax, clasping together to the point where you were laying before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give the giantess one last pat.<br>\r\n\"See you later,\" you whisper, before standing back up and looking back at Lucario, who is staring up at Mesprit, his arms crossed in an impatient manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you hurry up?\" he remarks, causing you to huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, you slide down Mesprit's side and land in front of the jackal, making eye contact with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nocturnal breeze blows past you as you make your first step out of the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretch as you yawn again, Lucario walking past you. You follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the bipedal pokemon walk into the forest, and keep going for a while. Not a noise can be heard, except the cries of the nocturnal pokemon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope we don't run into those perverted Sneasel,\" you suddenly break the silence, gaining a curious stare from Lucario.<br>\r\n\"I'm here from a day, and they've already left a quite bad first impression,\" you recall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario sneers.<br>\r\n\"You've already told something like that when we first met,\" he recalls, before his gaze returns serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, we're not here to talk about that.\" he says, suddenly stopping to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou halt as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you want to talk about?\" you rhetorically ask, already knowing what reason led him to enter the cave, disturb your sleep and almost wake the three sisters up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario huffs as he detects the sarcasm in your tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You changed your mind, human,\" he bluntly says.<br>\r\n\"Why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug.<br>\r\n\"They wanted to come along with me. I couldn't risk that...\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You know, right, that you could be leaving this exact moment, while they sleep?\" Lucario asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you respond.<br>\r\n\"Thing is - I don't want to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario flinches.<br>\r\n\"Come again?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head.<br>\r\n\"I've been thinking about it for the whole day...\" you admit, before sighing a bit.<br>\r\n\"The chance that they - the legendaries I mean - might get crazy scares me, alright... but, they like me... and I like them the other way around,\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black and blue pokemon sighs.<br>\r\n\"And does it sound like a good motivation?\" he asks, his arms crossing as he sets a stern gaze on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yes...?\" you risk replying, before shaking your head.<br>\r\n\"Look... I've told Azelf about it,\" you admit, ready to receive harsh words. Which you deserved, since you broke the blue giantess' heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Lucario gives a simple response,<br>\r\n\"I know,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at him questioningly, but decide to go on,<br>\r\n\"Well... She told me that she's going to protect me if... if that happens,\" you explain, before putting a finger over your mouth.<br>\r\n\"She also mentioned that she's got more self-control than her sisters do,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario flushes red.<br>\r\n\"Well... that's true. She wasn't as destructive as her sisters were during that rampage...\" he sheepishly admits.<br>\r\n\"... Still-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario abruptly interrupts himself as a noise is heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What's that?\" you ask as both you and the jackal look around to spot the source of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze lands upon a bush, which is shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lightly tap Lucario's shoulder, motioning for the bush. He eyes it with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" you call out, not bothering to hide your nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour call goes unanswered, and the bush keeps on shaking. Muffled sounds can be heard, and they're coming from this one bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show yourself!\" Lucario growls from beside you, his gaze locked on the bush, which abruptly stops shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step back, watching a something - or rather someone - comes out...</span></div></div>",

Don't leave me... I love you...</span>\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words make your heart skip a beat and your blood freeze up in your veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said it. The right words that successfully shattered your internal resistance.<br>\r\n\"You know what?\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Mesprit's heart stops as she senses your resolution. Is her human still irremovable on the decision of leaving...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly wiggle out of her grasp and leap onto the back of her hands. The three giantesses stare at you intently, eager to see your next action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's heart resumes its beating as, and her mouth lets out a joyful exclamation as she sees you take off your bag, throwing it aside on her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going anywhere.\" you reply, turning around and hugging the wall of fur that is the giantess' chest.<br>\r\n\"I'm here to stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment full of electricity follows your statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emotions of the three sisters begin to pile up, only to explode at the same moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sonic explosion roars through the whole Lake Acuity as the three legendaries let out three high-pitched cries of joy, causing your ears to ring for several minutes after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you don't have time to pay it any mind. Roughly, Mesprit grabs a hold of you again as she brings you up. You have your idea of where you are heading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find you were right as the giantess hastily pushes you against her lips and starts pressing them into you repeatedly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie! I knew! I knew you would have never left me!</span>\" Mesprit chimes, not quite realizing that you're running out of air, smothered by her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you are saved by Uxie, who suddenly snatches you from her sister's paws. Mesprit festive expression suddenly changed into a frown.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Uxie-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I need hug him too, sis,</span>\" she says with a smile, before turning to you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">And you, what do you say? Will you forgive me for what I've done to you...?</span>\" she asks, the hope in her voice ringing in your ears.<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure!\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"... As long as my memories stay where they are from now on.\" the pixie smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word, Uxie embraces you. The display of affection makes you laugh a bit as you hug back. All your problems seems to have vanished, replaced by the sheer happiness of the now reconciled sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Well, now I want a hug too.</span>\" Azelf suddenly chimes; roughly, you are picked by the pixie, who, ignoring Uxie's protests, hugs you too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike you did with the other two, you hug back. Then, you find the giantess leaning forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, you imagine that she wants to kiss you... instead, her lips stop inches from your left ear.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Keep quiet about it,</font></span>\" she whispers, causing you to look at her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">It'll be our secret. I'll handle it.</font></span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at her.<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Deal.</font>\" you reply. Azelf's eyes close again as she resumes hugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you and the legendary sisters, your earlier suppositions were right. For the whole time, you have been watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, it was to check if the human told who spoke to him about the problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the situation took a drastic change. The human changed his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is he thinking?!\" Lucario growls as he watches you, hidden by the vegetation around the lake.<br>\r\n\"He's committing suicide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Not necessarily,</u>\" Vaporeon remarks, sitting beside him.<br>\r\n\"<u> Should we talk to him again?</u>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see any other choice? If that human stays here, the sisters will be 'helped'; if the sisters are helped, they become dangerous. And once the human is disposed of, they'll come and get us...\" Lucario says, placing a paw on his forehead as he sighs exasperatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Lucario, I've been thinking,</u>\" Vaporeon says.<br>\r\n\"<u>What if the legendaries won't kill him? I mean, Mesprit seems to truly love him...</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Lucario distractedly responds as he steps back.<br>\r\n\"But they'll end up going crazy if he keeps 'helping'. Though Azelf still didn't have her fix.\" he points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of silence pass.<br>\r\n\"We'll talk to him again, make another attempt,\" Lucario mumbles as he starts to walk away.<br>\r\n\"And if he's so willing to stay...\" he glances behind himself one last time.<br>\r\n\"So be it.\" he says, starting to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon watches him leave, before shaking her head and walking in the opposite direction. Right towards the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water type notices the three legendaries still cheering about the human's decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his gaze suddenly travels on her, locking on her. Vaporeon stares back at him for a moment, before leaping into the water, disappearing from eyesight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">What are you looking at?</span>\" Uxie asks upon noticing you staring at the Lake. However, looking herself, she finds nothing wrong.<br>\r\n\"Uh? Nothing.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've seen the same Vaporeon you've apparently seen three times already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere you being spied on again...? Should you expected something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie shrugs, before smiling.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hey, look. It's already midday,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, currently being hugged by Mesprit, look at the sky. Surely enough, the agitation, the meeting with Lucario and Vaporeon, the violent argument between Uxie and Mesprit and in the end the cheering for your decision to stay... all of these took away half of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then, your stomach reminds you that you haven't been eating since you woke up this morning.<br>\r\n\"Heh... I totally forgot to eat...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf and Mesprit's stomachs choose this moment to act up too. Being pinned just above the belly of Mesprit, you experience what might be compared to an earthquake... or, several earthquakes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie chokes back a laugh.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Let's get something to eat.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You coming?</span>\" Mesprit asks you as she and her sisters hovers beneath the shade of a few trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating to fulfill your missed breakfast, the three opted to take a nap. It is nice to see them going along with eachother again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm not that tired,\" you respond.<br>\r\n\"I'll take a walk or something, I guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Suit yourself.</span>\" Mesprit says with a shrug and a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the three are asleep, you lean back against a tree and wait from anything to happen. Apparently, things travel fast around this lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, a figure suddenly emerges from said lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water type carefully checks if the legendaries are asleep before walking up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there.\" you say, giving her a light pat on the head. In response, Vaporeon nuzzles your hand, before looking at you.<br>\r\n\"Vap.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon remembers how you misunderstood her intentions just yesterday, so she hurries to point to you, then to herself. Then, the water type walks in place before motioning to the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to follow you?\" you ask. The quadruped pokemon nods her head.<br>\r\n\"You want to talk to me again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, she moves her head upside down, meaning that you're right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone wants to 'chat' with you again...</span></div></div>",

You walk behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly look back at the sleeping legendaries: they're still soundly asleep, meaning that you'll have plenty of time to finally put an end to the idea of leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon silently walks in front of you, leading you to a mysterious location. You imagine that she's bringing you to Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, you didn't like the fact that I don't want to leave anymore, did you?\" you suddenly break the silence. Vaporeon turns around, looking at you with those big blue eyes of hers. Her head makes a up-down movement.<br>\r\n\"Well, I really couldn't help but stay. The legendaries were so sad...\" you remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Vaporeon looks at you weirdly, before turning her head back as she keeps walking, silence falling in between the two of you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of walking, the small water type comes to a halt in a clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop beside her, taking notice that there's no one but you and her.<br>\r\n\"There is nobody...\" you point out, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier today, Lucario told you about a pokemon meeting, in which you apparently had a part. Now, while not expecting such thing as another meeting, you at least expected the human-speaking pokemon, who didn't show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention is drawn as Vaporeon rises her head, letting out a cry:<br>\r\n\"Vaaaa!\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can question about it, you notice the vegetation around you moving.<br>\r\n\"W-What...?\" you stutter as you notice a Glaceon coming out of a bush, a Buizel coming out from another, a few Starly and Staravia taking place on the branches of the trees around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the whole clearing is filled with pokemon, who form a circle around you and Vaporeon, who sits down beside you, looking at the crowd of pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, your attention is caught by one last pokemon showing up: Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he steps into the clearing, his crimson gaze finds its way to you.<br>\r\n\"Hello, human. We meet yet again,\" he says with his signature growly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" you respond as the gazes of all the pokemon land upon you. You glance around, looking at the variety of pokemon, trying to estimate how much there are. An impossibly hard task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also take notice of the expressions of these pokemon. Save for some who wore sympathetic looks, they didn't appear much friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was the same situation of last night. You already know why you are here, don't you?\" you shift your gaze on Lucario as he talks, while walking closer to you. You don't even think about it.<br>\r\n\"My decision.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jackal nods.<br>\r\n\"Yes. You don't want to leave anymore; you were supposed to.\" he says, causing the crowd to start murmuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, I don't.\" you flatly reply, digging your hands in your pockets in subtle defiance.<br>\r\n\"And why, may I ask?\" Lucario says, though he already knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Vaporeon, who is been quiet so far, starting to bark something at Lucario.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know, those three love him,\" he says, causing you to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gla! Gla!\" the Glaceon from before suddenly speaks from the crowd. <br>\r\n\"Didn't the idea of what those three could do to you convince you enough?\" Lucario translates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecalling what he said earlier, you shiver. The idea of what the giantesses could do with your dead-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to think about it, thank you,\" you state while trying to relegate the thought in the depths of your mind.<br>\r\n\"Yes, it initially scared me. But then, I just realized that those three are more harmless than you all think.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario huffs.<br>\r\n\"<i>Harmless?</i> Rampaging is harmless? Because they've done it several times already,\" he states, before looking at the crowd.<br>\r\n\"And that is another thing. We just discovered why no one can remember Uxie doing that: she apparently erased the memories of some of you,\" he speaks to the pokemon, getting several pokemon to let out cries of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was really embarrassing...\" you recall what the pixie told earlier, earning the indignation of her sisters.<br>\r\n\"That's no good reason,\" Lucario replies, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not telling it is. I'm just telling that, perhaps, their heat is not so bad... I mean, they didn't lose control yet, right?\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Keep 'helping' them, see if it's bad or not,\" Lucario tells.<br>\r\n\"But the point is: you still need to leave,\" this gets you to huff, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how many times I've heard that word today,\" you state.<br>\r\n\"Look. I don't mean to, alright? I have my reasons to believe that they'll keep themselves under control,\" you recall Azelf's promise, \u2018I'll handle it\u2019. However, you can't tell that. You would reveal to these pokemon that you actually broke the giantess' heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure of how would these pokemon react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, noticing them staring at you intently with expressions of fear and annoyance. Though some were even of comprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chu?\" a Pichu suddenly speaks up. Lucario briefly looks at it.<br>\r\n\"How can you tell?\" he translates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... have a... a feeling...?\" you hesitate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bui!\" a Buizel says.<br>\r\n\"That's not enough.\" Lucario says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jackal then crossed his arms.<br>\r\n\"Look. Do you see how many pokemon are there here now?\" he asks, annoyed.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you do know that you're putting all our lives, yours included, in danger, right?\" he asks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou casually look down as you notice Vaporeon staring up at you with a pleading expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in frustration, before turning to the crowd.<br>\r\n\"Listen, all of you,\" you tell, earning curious stares from every pokemon.<br>\r\n\"You said you didn't want to break the sisters' hearts, right? Think, what would happen if I left?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the pokemon start murmuring, Lucario and Vaporeon included.<br>\r\n\"That's... that's a good point...\" Lucario admits, his paw traveling to the back of his head as he rubs it in an exasperated manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk proudly, before speaking again.<br>\r\n\"Listen up. I say, just give me some time, alright? I'm sure that the legendaries won't lose control,\" you remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario perks up as a few pokemon speak.<br>\r\n\"And if they do?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at him with a dead serious look.<br>\r\n\"Then, I will leave.\" you state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the crowd of pokemon starts murmuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey keep it up for a while, before Lucario looks at you again.<br>\r\n\"Alright, human. Here's the deal: if those sisters won't lose control again, like you say, we won't bother you anymore,\" he says.<br>\r\n\"But if they do, you'll leave?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the murmuring quiets as you speak. Lucario nods.<br>\r\n\"Alright. Now go back to them. And keep your eyes open,\" he warns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" you reply as you turn around, starting to walk away.</span></div></div>",

You recognize the voices: Uxie and Mesprit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally slap yourself. You totally forgot they were asleep. Most probably, they woke up and, not seeing you around, they must have assumed that you left while they slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeaning, they're searching for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at Lucario.<br>\r\n\"I gotta go. Like now.\" you urgently tell, getting the jackal to nod his head.<br>\r\n\"Alright, go. But be careful,\" he warns.<br>\r\n\"Watch out for those three.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly nod.<br>\r\n\"I will,\" you say, starting to walk away from the clearing.<br>\r\n\"See you around!\" you exclaim as you enter the forest again, leaving Lucario, Vaporeon and the whole pokemon crowd behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run through the forest, in direction of the lake. You're afraid that if you don't find the legendaries soon, they'll jump to conclusions and they'll really start thinking that you left, while you only really took a walk to find Lucario and the other pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour run comes to a halt, though, as a blue titaness you recognize as Azelf comes out of nowhere. Your feet lift off the ground, and your heels stop your run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf notices you too late; the giantess manages to brake herself, but such rough stop causes her tails to dart forward, knocking you onto your back.<br>\r\n\"Ow...\" you cry in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Sorry... I didn't notice... you...</span>\" Azelf apologizes from above, before realizing who she hit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Human!</span>\" she suddenly chimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up, just in time to notice the giantess bending to grab a hold of you and scoop you up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Where were you? We thought you wanted to leave again!</span>\" Azelf scolds.<br>\r\n\"Azelf, relax! I wasn't trying to leave!\" you shout, rubbing your aching back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf's eyes narrow. You notice them glowing blue.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You weren't trying to leave...?</span>\" she asks again. Once again today, the answer is forced out of you:<br>\r\n\"No!\" you say. The giantess' stop glowing, and get lidded by her eyelids as she sighs in relief.<br>\r\n\"Stop playing with my willpower!\" you cry, irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Sorry. Just making sure.</span>\" Azelf apologizes, her eyes opening back up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">But we were worried! Me and Uxie woke up and found Mesprit screaming! She found that you weren't there anymore, and she thought you left while we were sleeping!</span>\" Azelf explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told I didn't have the intention to leave anymore; I meant it, Azelf,\" you firmly reply.<br>\r\n\"All I was doing was exploring around, nothing more!\" you lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I know, I know,</span>\" Azelf says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">But, remembering about earlier, it wasn't the first thing we thought...</span>\" she explains in an apologetic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, I guess...\" you sigh. Azelf smiles a little, before thinking about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hey, speaking of which, what you told me earlier... was it all true?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her.<br>\r\n\"Yes. All of it... at least I think...\" you reply, scratching your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess' head tilts.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You think...?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Yes... I was told it, so I'm not completely sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nods.<br>\r\n\"When will the season end?\" you question the blue giantess.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">More or less, two weeks,</span>\" she responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a lump forming in your throat. You forcefully swallow it as the color drains from your face.<br>\r\n\"T-Two weeks?!\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Yes. But don't worry; if those things really  happened... I'll make sure you will be safe... safe from us...</span>\" she assures.<br>\r\n\"What if you'll really lose control?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf shivers at the perspective.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Promise me something,</span>\" she says instead of replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her, confused.<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess looks at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">If my sisters, and I too, will lose control, get crazy with lust... promise me you won't run away.

The other soon joins in as Azelf hugs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, before hugging back. Azelf's smile widens. For some reason, the closeness to this human makes her feel... good. She usually distrusted humans, but this one little guy easily gained her and her sisters' trust, along with Mesprit's love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was so special about him...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while passes quietly, before Azelf pulls off, breaking the hug.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">We... we should go back now...</span>\" Azelf mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agree with her, but soon discover her staring right at you intently, not moving of an inch. You also notice that her blue cheeks are covered by a red shade.<br>\r\n\"Uh, Azelf?\" you call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Huh?</span>\" she says, startled, like she just broke out of some kind of trance.<br>\r\n\"Uh, aren't we supposed to be going back to your sisters?\" you ask, recalling what she just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess' cheeks grow even redder.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh... y-yeah, we sh-should go...</span>\" she replies.</span></div></div>",

The human already helped Uxie and Mesprit, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just has to ask you to help her with her problem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer problem... the one problem that caused so many others... but she needed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf shakes her head in an almost frenetic pace. She can't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AZELF!\" you suddenly shout while thrusting your hand in her fur.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">U-Uh?</span>\" the giantess asks as she opens her eyes to look straight at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on with you? Why do you look like you're in pain?\" you ask her. Azelf grits her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has only one chance to tell you. Can she tell it? Should she give in? After all... just for once...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I-I h-have...</span>\" she says, determined to reveal it. Right before thinking about Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister had openly declared her love towards the human... and more than just once. Azelf's mouth closes back up; Mesprit and Uxie are still wandering around the forest, unaware that their sister was the one that found the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Mesprit catches Azelf in the middle of her 'fix'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess swallows loudly, repelling the image of herself facing her sister's wrath. Then, Azelf looks back at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I-It's nothing... just a headache... you know, being a guardian, you've got that a lot...</span>\" she lies, justifying her weird behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slightly tilt your head.<br>\r\n\"Sure that you're alright? Can I do anything?\" you ask, still worried about the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf smiles. This little one was sure caring...<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Don't worry, I'm alright... It'll go away in a bit,</span>\" she replies, before her heat makes her grunt in pain again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that the won't be able to resist it for much longer, Azelf quickly ponders what to do.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Come on... let's go find my sisters now. They're still searching for you...</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head, silently agreeing as Azelf turns back, floating deeper into the forest in search of Uxie and Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Human! Where are you?!</span>\" Mesprit calls one more time, feeling her eyes starting to grow wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe it. Her human left her while she was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had woke up, and her precious little love wasn't there! Of course, with the events of the morning, it wasn't hard to figure out why. The being of emotion felt betrayed. Was that why the human refused to go to sleep with her when she offered him to? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe abused her trust, and he was gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mesprit could start crying, though, a noise got her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRustling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks around, spotting a few plants shaking, producing the sound.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Human?</span>\" the guardian asks, hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her hopes are shattered as a yellow headed pixie comes out.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Nope. It's just me, Uxie,</span>\" the newcomer tells, before assuming a sad expression.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'm sorry Mesprit... I-I couldn't find him...</span>\" Uxie then says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Mesprit leans forward, letting herself fall into the open paws of her sister, tears starting to run down her face. Saddened, Uxie embraces her sister, pulling her closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Azelf comes out of nowhere.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You'll never guess who I...</span>\" the blue giantess abruptly stops as she notices Mesprit crying in Uxie's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, nonetheless, she got her sisters' attention; Mesprit rises her head to look at Azelf, while Uxie points her closed eyelids on her blue sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, more specifically, on the tiny human held up by her blue sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit is the first to react.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie!</span>\" she screams, darting forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike she had been earlier, Azelf is now unable to avoid her pink headed sister, who grabs the human from her and closes him in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You were trying to leave again! Why?! Why were you-</span>\" Mesprit shouts, not sure whether should she feel happy or mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, however, interrupt.<br>\r\n\"I wasn't trying to leave again! What, can't I walk around anymore?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit releases her grip on you and glares down at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">We were worried! <i>I</i> was worried! I thought you wanted to leave me again!</span>\" she scolds.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well I didn't! In fact, here I am!\" you snap back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you and the giantess could further argue, you are stopped by Uxie, who floats closer.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Now, before you say or do something you might regret...</span>\" she says, picking you from Mesprit, holding you in front of her yellow face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Now, you weren't leaving again, were you?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Is it the truth?</span>\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">It is, Uxie,</span>\" Azelf suddenly perks up, earning her sisters' attention.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I made him talk - just making sure, Mesprit!</span>\" she quickly defends as she sees her sister's glare.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">...And he wasn't trying to get away again.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Just exploring around a bit,\" you lie with a convincingly serene voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment these words come out of your mouth, Mesprit roughly grabs you again, and hugs you tightly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh, cutie forgive me! I'm sorry for yelling at you, I was just really worried!</span>\" she says sorrowfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No problem...\" you breath, feeling your bones aching from the tight hug. You look at Azelf and Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Help...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day fades away quietly. Aside from Mesprit's way-too-heartfelt manner of apologizing, nothing much went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more questions were asked as the three sisters were content with your explanation, \u2018I was just exploring around\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, you felt observed. Naturally, with all of Mesprit's attention focused on you, it would be obvious to guess why, but you really felt weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your questions were answered when, at some point, you discovered Azelf staring at you intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue giantess was probably keeping an eye out on her sisters. They were helped, the heat won't act up for a few days now... but she had to make sure nothing bad happened to the human or to her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the moon takes the sun's place in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Did stealing willpower ever work to find a mate?</span>\" Mesprit casually asks as she swallows a mouthful of berries.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Uh...</span>\" Azelf blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation had been going on throughout the whole 'dinner'. You contended yourself staying aside and listening them talk, not really wishing to be the object of their speeches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut eventually, your and their meals finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie gives a satisfied sigh, which is followed by a yawn.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'm full. And I'm going to sleep.</span>\" she says as she gets up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Already?</span>\" Mesprit huffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie shrugs, before floating off.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Think I'm going too...</span>\" Azelf yawns, getting up and following Uxie.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You two are no fun!</span>\" Mesprit shouts as they leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, Mesprit looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, you look at each other, before a smile brightened Mesprit's face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie~</span>\" she says, reaching out for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You're not going too, are you? Would you like to keep me company for a while?</span>\" she asks, lifting you up to chest level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why? What are you up to?\" you ask. Mesprit snickers.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Nothing special~</span>\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratch your head.<br>\r\n\"Uh... well...</span></div></div>",

Her lips press into your whole being as she kisses you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fear suddenly fades, but it's replaced by embarrassment as your cheeks flash bright red. Mesprit pulls off and snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you say, sounding much like a Slowpoke who found that a Shellder just bit its tail. Mesprit giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So, what are you up to?\" you opt to repeat your previous question, not quite knowing what to say.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Well, I just wanted to do something together, you know,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground below quakes lightly, and your world shakes as the giantess lays down on her back, her large paws keeping your far up in the air.<br>\r\n\"Okay...?

Why not?\" you respond, making her smile brightly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Good.</span>\" Mesprit says, gently lowering you, setting you down on her chest, rising her head to better see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile fades as she begins her tale, bad memories filling her head. You sit down on the smooth ground, your arms wrapping around your knees as you listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">As I already told you, me and my sisters were beaten, the Lakes were reduced to nothing,</span>\" she starts.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I remember it like it was yesterday. Humans attacked us. They... they hurt us,</span>\" she says with a glare, her voice contorting into one of hatred. Hatred for the people who hurt her and her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, starting to feel concerned.<br>\r\n\"Go on,\" you say, signaling that you're listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Do you know what I remember?</span>\" Mesprit asks instead. You tilt your head, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I remember opening my eyes. I could feel pain in my whole body. It hurt so much...</span>\" she closes her eyes. You start to pity the three sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yeah...</span>\" Mesprit continues, clearly feeling your pity.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">It hurt. But, at least, humans didn't catch me or my sisters. I... I think that wasn't their intention. But, nonetheless, my body was in pain, I felt broken. Me and my sisters, we guardians weren't able to protect the Lakes. That's pretty bitter, you know,</span>\" she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine it,\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I remember getting up. Azelf was still fainted. But Uxie - Uxie. She was sitting in front of Lake Acuity, crying as she watched her destroyed Lake!</span>\" Mesprit says with a voice your can't decipher. Sadness for sure, pity as well... but you can't really understand what else is present in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What happened then?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You already know,</span>\" Mesprit responds, gazing at the starry sky.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">That day, me, Uxie and Azelf made a deal: protect the Lakes at every cost. And never, ever trust humans,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, her facial expression shifts into a serene one as the giantess gazes at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And then, like ten years later, my sister brought home one little human who managed to steal my heart,</span>\" she says, making you blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, her expression changes again, into a sad one.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And then, my sister had him help her, she erased his memories and I found that he wanted to leave me,</span>\" she adds. You suddenly understand what the tone she used earlier was: jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the last remark, she goes quiet for a while. You do as well, not finding anything good to reply with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, suddenly, Mesprit speaks again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Funny thing,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">When Uxie took your memories, she didn't even know she was being watched.</span>\" she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze up.<br>\r\n\"... What do you mean?\" you ask, feeling a crushing weight on your heart.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You know, this morning, I was thinking about what Uxie did to you, when a Lucario and a Vaporeon come out. They told me everything that Uxie did to you la-</span>\" Mesprit abruptly stops upon sensing your surprise, along with sudden fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess looks at you, those golden disks that are her eyes staring deep into your soul.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... You already know about this, don't you...?</span>\" Mesprit asks, realization hitting her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">The pokemon you mentioned. Were they the Lucario and Vaporeon?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow nervously, but don't reply. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Did those two tell you what Uxie did around here? Is that why you wanted to leave?</span>\" Mesprit asks with both curiosity and concern, her earlier doubts coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that...\" you timidly respond. In response, Mesprit tilts her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Then... why? Why did you want to leave? Will you tell me at last?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're in cage. Mesprit wants to know again. Sure, she's in a better state of mind than she was earlier today, but you're not sure if she'll believe you or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, for what you know, she could think Lucario just mistrusted you, and came up with an excuse to make you leave.

Since when I'm empathic?\"  you ask yourself, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's gaze shifts into a curious one. And you feel her curiosity too.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Empathy?... How can this be?</span>\" she asks, just as confused as you are.<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit thinks for a moment. Before a smile spreads wide on her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You and me - we've been so close that... I must have accidentally transferred some of my power to you!</span>\" she exclaims. This gets you to look up at her, flabbergasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">That makes sense. Now you should be able to feel others' emotions!</span>\" she exclaims, before looking at you weirdly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I wonder...</span>\" she then says, her previous conversation with you completely gone from her mind, replaced by this new discovery.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Focus. What do you feel from me?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focus.<br>\r\n\"... Excitement?\" you say. Mesprit nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Good. Now, try to modify that.</span>\" she instructs.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask, even more confused.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, \u2018modify\u2019?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yeah, try to change the excitement into sadness.</span>\" she repeats.<br>\r\n\"...And... How do I do that?\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Focus on my excitement and try to change that.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and focus on the emotion emanated from the giantess. Not quite sure of what to do, you imagine it was sadness and look up at Mesprit again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even blink, she's still looking at you expectantly. But, not feeling any alteration in her emotions, the giantess huffs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Nope, I think you can't modify emotions... yet. Maybe, with a bit of training...</span>\" she ponders with a hint of delusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both go quiet after her last remark. She thinks about the possibility that you might even be able to manipulate emotions, while you're still trying to process what happened within the past hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with Mesprit, who wanted to know why you wanted to leave and now you're suddenly empathic. Really weird how life can change in a matter of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Truly amusing,</span>\" your train of thought is stopped as your attention is drawn by Mesprit's voice.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">It's... Simply wonderful that you've got my power... at least some of it now. It makes us even closer!</span>\" she suddenly exclaims, embracing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you feel love emanating from the pink headed guardian. Not quite sure of what to think, you hug back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe embrace lasts for a while, before your attention is yet again drawn by the giantess as she...</span></div></div>",

And, soon enough, your consciousness fades out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness claims your mind, and you follow it without opposing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sleep is bothered, and you wake up, feeling like a really short time passed since you fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes open up and they are greeted by the darkness of the cavern. That, and two golden eyes that stare straight at you from above.<br>\r\n\"Wh-Wha...?\" you drowsily stutter as you yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when your eyes adjust to the darkness, enough to let you see a blue face belonging to Azelf, who notices that you woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hey,</span>\" she calmly whispers.<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you respond.<br>\r\n\"Couldn't sleep?\" you then ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">At all.</span>\" she replies. But you pay her no mind, too focused on the fact that Azelf is currently keeping a paw on your body, apparently having the intention to scoop you up.<br>\r\n\"Azelf? What are you doing?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the giantess pulls off her paw.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">M-Me? ...Nothing?</span>\" she meekly tries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't buy it.<br>\r\n\"Az-\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I need you!</span>\" she suddenly exclaims, before covering her mouth with her paws. Your eyes widen.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask, a bit concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess sighs as she removes her paws from her mouth.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Let's go talk outside,</span>\" she says, grabbing a hold of you, then placing you on the floor.<br>\r\n\"Uh, fine?\" you ask, not quite sure of what to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf smiles a little as you start walking towards the exit of the cave, the giantess following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, what do you need me for?\" you question as you turn back to the legendary following you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">W-Well... something...</span>\" she says, clearly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I think I figured that out,\" you slowly say.<br>\r\n\"But what do you want me to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Azelf sighs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">First, promise me you won't be scared,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe request is a bit awkward.<br>\r\n\"Okay...? But... why?\" you ask.

I lied,</span>\" she slowly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can ask why, though, she continues:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">It's something far more painful,</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind takes a moment to put two and two together.<br>\r\n\"Y-Your heat!\" you cry out.

And I know why you're reluctant to help now,</span>\" she says in an almost apologetic manner. Almost as if she's sorry about even asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks suddenly grow redder.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">But I can't bear this anymore!</span>\" she shouts, her voice echoing throughout the forest, causing you to take a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">It hurts,</span>\" the giantess continues, closing her eyes and clenching her fists.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">It hurts so much...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain silent, not finding anything good to answer with.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You're the only one that ever volunteered, even if it was with my sisters...</span>\" Azelf says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Because I didn't know about your problem,\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"Or better, I didn't know what your problem makes you three do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this last remark of yours, both of you go quiet, staring at each other intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Azelf suddenly grabs her head in her paws.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Stupid, cursed heat,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I'm feeling dizzy.</span>\" she adds, her head lowering and her arms hanging as the giantess imagines the nice things that her and you, the human, could be doing now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're pretty sure about what is going on in her mind, though you're also pretty sure that you don't want to know any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf rises her head again, shooting you a pleading, lustful gaze as she makes one last, feeble attempt:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Please...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

You groan as you ponder your answer, \u2018no\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, you quickly remember that Azelf can easily steal your willpower and use you if you refuse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe perspective makes you go pale. Can you risk replying by refusing to help?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her as she sultrily looks at you, lust making her golden eyes glazed as she stares at you pleadingly, awaiting your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, in order to avoid her doing something she would later regret, you make your choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you say, taking a step forward.<br>\r\n\"I'll help you, Azelf.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess smiles as you meditate on your choice. Is this the right thing to do? After all, one time won't make her lose control, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can further rethink your decision, you are grabbed by two large, strong paws that roughly lift you off ground, bring you up in the air and push you against a soft, warm wall.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Thank you! Thank you!</span>\" Azelf chimes as she hugs you, making you blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess then releases you from her grasp and stares at you gratefully, before gently lowering you back on the ground, which quakes softly as the giantess sits down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniff the air, taking notice of a sweet scent alluring your nostrils. By now, you know what this smell is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping her gaze locked on you, Azelf begins to spread her legs. Soon, a pair of large, pink, vertical lips come into eyesight.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Whe-Whenever you're ready...</span>\" she says, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly nod your head in agreement and start walking towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step past her legs and finally reach the giant sex of Azelf, the scent assaulting your nose even more now. You take a moment to glance at her one last time.<br>\r\n\"Are you really sure about this, Azelf?\" you ask her. She nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">It's okay. I trust you.</span>\" she replies with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven her approval, you lower your head again, your gaze landing on the organ in front of you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breath in deeply, before suddenly extending both your arms, pushing your hands against Azelf's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback by the sudden touch, the giantess lets out a cry of genuine surprise, mixed with a wave of pleasure that starts to spread within her as you begin rubbing her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands slide along the length of Azelf's sex, the giantess moaning in pleasure as she feels your touch on the most sensible area of her body.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">K-K-Keep going!</span>\" you hear her shouting from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start speeding up and, to give the giantess more pleasure, you thrust your hands inside of her, making her moan even louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting that you're doing something right, you decide to spice things up and slip your wrists, then your whole arms inside of her, starting to rub the hot flesh within the giant organ, feeling your hands starting to grow wet inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like this?\" you ask the giantess.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Ye-Yes!</span>\" she cries in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo speed things up, you push your whole body against the organ and start rubbing your whole being against the giantess' nethers, while your arms keep working on the inside of her .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to risk and start even licking Azelf's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess moans louder as the human pleasures her greatly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Ngh... I... I think... ah...</span>\" she incoherently says. You, however, understand what she meant as a river of white, sticky 'water' suddenly flows out of Azelf, hitting you full force and sending you on laying flat on your back on the cold ,hard ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Ah... Ahh...</span>\" Azelf moans, struggling to regain her breath.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">W-Wonderf-ful...</span>\" she stammers in appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand back up, cleaning your view from the sticky stuff that came out of the giantess.<br>\r\n\"So? Satisfied?\" you ask, looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Uh... ehm...</span>\"<br>\r\n\"No.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Maybe... If you could... Still a bit...</span>\" she mutters incoherently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, knowing exactly what you need to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that is the exact same thing you've done to her sisters: she was pleasured... from the outside. Now, it was time to work on the <i>inside</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the giantess is reasoning on the same line of thinking: her paws reach her nethers, and she uses them to part her vaginal lips, presenting you the moist, dark inside of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding again, you start walking towards the open vagina, sliding into it. All lights fade out as Azelf removes her paws, sealing you in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as you start 'working'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Ah!</span>\" Azelf shouts as, again, she comes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting to regain her breath, the giantess looks down, noticing that the human wasn't ejected from her insides. Instead, Azelf feels something struggling within her dark depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks flush even redder as she realizes where you are.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh... I'm sorry...</span>\" she apologizes as she holds out a paw, focusing on the struggling in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, you appear on her paw. Only to fall flat on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong paw pulls you back on your feet.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You were great!</span>\" Azelf chimes with a smile.<br>\r\n'\"<span class=\"cpblue\">The heat won't bother me for days now!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a satisfied smile while Azelf wipes you clean with her free paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she shoves your whole being into her lips as she smooches you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Thanks!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" you humbly reply.<br>\r\n\"But now, let's go back. It's still nighttime... I could use a few more hours of sleep...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf happily nods, embraces you again and starts floating towards the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely unaware that she and the human were being watched...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it...\" Lucario growls from his hiding spot.<br>\r\n\"He shouldn't have done it again...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Here we are again,</span>\" Azelf whispers as she floats back where Mesprit and Uxie are still sleeping, at the very end of the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your perch, you take notice that Mesprit's arms left her chest where you were before.<br>\r\n\"Eh... could you put me back...?\" you ask Azelf, not quite liking the idea of having to climb Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, sleeping on the floor under the same roof with three giantesses wouldn't be safe for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Azelf shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Ehm... no.</span>\" she responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No?\" you parrot back, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">No, tonight we're sleeping together... if you don't mind, of course...</span>\" she says, somewhat embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"... Alright?\" you risk replying, causing Azelf to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess lays down beside Uxie and rolls on her side.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Well... night...</span>\" she shyly says, pulling you in a hug.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Thanks again.</span>\" she adds, pecking your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile in response as you lay your head against her chest fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the events of the night left you more tired than you thought: you fall asleep in a matter of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing you sleeping, Azelf snuggles you deeper as she closes her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she too joins you, and her sisters as she falls asleep.</span></div></div>",

You get the message.<br>\r\n\"... I'm sorry, but I will not leave. I changed my mind,\" you firmly say, starting to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon follows you as you move to the sleeping Mesprit. She looks reluctant to get any closer as she watches you sitting down, leaning back against the giantess' furry side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou motion for her to come closer with a move your hand. Vaporeon reluctantly moves a step as she gets closer to you, sitting a few inches from you.<br>\r\n\"Come on, they're completely harmless,\" you say with a reassuring smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo prove your point, you start petting the wall of fur behind you, making Mesprit moans softly above.<br>\r\n\"See?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon looks unsure for a moment more, before walking closer to you, leaping on your lap. Her forepaws push against your stomach as the quadruped pokemon stands on her hind legs, again giving you that pleading look of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You still want me to go, don't you?\" you ask.

I simply can't do it. I... like these three too much for that. And they like me back,\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon tilts her head.

She must be curious about your line of thinking. Which you soon make clear to her:<br>\r\n\"Well, thing is: if I leave Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie, their hearts will be broken anyway. Now, do you want that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon lowers her head.<br>\r\n\"<u>No...</u>\" she says, though you can't understand her. However you pretty much get the response.<br>\r\n\"See? You do agree with me...\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I already broke one heart today,\" you look at Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess rolls onto her side, facing you, almost like she sensed that you're talking about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon looks at you, a confused glint in her big, blue eyes.<br>\r\n\"<u>You told her?</u>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"I told her what you told me.\" you reply, inadvertently giving the correct answer to her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon's ears droop at your statement.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she was pretty sad when I told it.\" you remark as Vaporeon falls on all fours on your lap and glumly sits down, her head hanging from your left leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start petting her slick body with a hand, getting her to moan softly.<br>\r\n\"These three aren't dangerous,\" you whisper.<br>\r\n\"Or, at least, not as dangerous as you believe. Did you see them crying earlier?\" you then ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot moving, Vaporeon nods her head.<br>\r\n\"Yep. They were sad because I wanted to leave. Do you understand why I don't want to anymore?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon looks at you, meekly nodding again.<br>\r\n\"<u> Because Mesprit loves you.</u>\" she replies. Not quite understanding, you don't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passes as you just stay like this, leaning back against Mesprit while petting Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the water type suddenly leaps off of you and points to herself, then to the forest.<br>\r\n\"You still want me to follow you?\" you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the movement of her head is right-to-left.<br>\r\n\"Wait... you need to go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves her head upside down, nodding.<br>\r\n\"Well, do me a favor then?\" you question. Vaporeon looks at you inquisitively.<br>\r\n\"Stop spying on me. It's annoying,\" the remark makes her blush slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, she nods again as she starts to walk away.

Apparently, Mesprit has a restless sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and take a few steps back, watching as the giantess moves in her sleep. You briefly wonder what would happen if she unintentionally rolls on you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit wakes up, and rubs her eyes, before opening them, revealing her huge, golden disks to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess then glances around, trying to find her beloved human.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie?</span>\" she calls, before remembering what happened earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid her little one leave while she was asleep? Did he betray her trust?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down here!\" you shout up to her. Mesprit's gaze shifts on her side, on you. Spotting her human, an impossibly big smile spreads on her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie!</span>\" she exclaims, reaching out for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer giant paw grabs a hold of you as she brings you up, squeezing you in a loving hug.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh, sweetie, forgive me! You had me worried for a moment! I knew I should have trusted you, and yet I doubted you! Please, forgive me!</span>\" she cries.<br>\r\n\"F-For what?\" you breath as you desperately try to inhale air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I thought you left the while I was sleeping! But now I know that I can trust you! You're truthful and loyal like just few humans are!</span>\" Mesprit compliments as she finally releases you, letting you lay still on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inhale and exhale deeply as you resume breathing properly. It still takes a while for you to be able to speak again though:<br>\r\n\"Don't do that again.\" you say, making Mesprit giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit, I told that I didn't want to leave anymore. I was honest about it.\" you remark. Mesprit's gaze becomes a comprehensive one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I know,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But now, will you at last tell me why did you want to leave?</span>\" she questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm afraid not. I'll still keep that for myself.

I'll trust you have your reasons to keep... well, your reasons a secret. Just know that I'm glad...</span>\" she says, her paw getting a hold of you again as the giantess literally drags you up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">To have you alongside me.</span>\" she says sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush.<br>\r\n\"Don't even say-\" a loud groan interrupts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Shut iiiit...</span>\" Azelf moans, waving her paw around in the void, like she was trying to get rid of a pesky bug. Her paw then drops on the ground as her snoring resumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at Mesprit, finding her shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Human sweetie~</span>\" Mesprit chimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou joined Uxie and Azelf a while ago; you had been snoozing for a while, enjoying the great bed that Mesprit's body makes, and now the same Mesprit just woke you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask, annoyed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm bored!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do something then.\" you bluntly reply.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But I want to play!</span>\" she whines.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Don't you want to play with me?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Pretty please?</span>\" she asks. Only to get the same response as before:<br>\r\n\"No,\" you repeat.<br>\r\n\"I'm not in the mood to play.\" you then say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Aw!</span>\" Mesprit cries as she pretends to tear up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Don't you love me anymore?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh.<br>\r\n\"If I didn't love you anymore, I would have left while you slept, don't you think?\" you remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sighs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Good point,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But I still want to play!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can reply, and before she can further complain, your eyes catch movement on your side. Your gaze shifts to the side as you notice Azelf starting to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Why did I come here in the first place?</span>\" she asks, opening her eyes to fix an annoyed gaze on Mesprit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I could sleep back home.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit giggles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Stop being like that sis!</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And you stop being noisy.</span>\" Azelf snaps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit huffs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You're no fun, did you know that?</span>\" <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Whatever.</span>\" Azelf replies as she gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the giantess' gaze fixes on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout second thinking, Azelf leans forward and grabs you. Mesprit's teasing expression initially turns into a surprised one, then into a glare.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Azelf!</span>\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf shoots an annoyed gaze.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Relax! I just want to talk to him, Mesprit!</span>\" she exclaims. Just then, Uxie starts to move in her sleep as she wakes up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving Mesprit any time to reply, Azelf hovers away, bringing you along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie looks around, noticing Azelf and the human missing, while Mesprit has a both confused and irritated look.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Okay, what did I miss?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What did you want to talk about?\" you ask Azelf as she stops after a few minutes of hovering aimlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">What you told me earlier. Was it all true?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, your expression dropping. Azelf's head lowers in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">We guardians swore that we would have protected the three Lakes from dangers. And now it turns out that WE are the danger,</span>\" she mumbles dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look at the bright side. You didn't lose control yet.\" you say, trying to comfort her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Yet...</span>\" she parrots back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she feels it. She feels her heat rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks burn red, while her lower body starts to bother her. With all the agitation of the morning, she totally forgot the reason of why she came here in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heat. The stupid, bothering heat that apparently caused so many troubles around the Lakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness looks at you. Maybe the human could lend her a hand...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could she think about that after what the learned? How could she even consider it after the fight her sisters had earlier?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being of willpower couldn't keep herself under control!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she ever does something to Mesprit's human... Azelf swallows. She had to steal her sisters' willpower to avoid the imminent conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she couldn't do that to herself, meaning that Mesprit would give her a quite the fight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf!\" you cry, louder. This fully gets the giantess' attention.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Huh?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Are you alright? You're acting weird!\" you point out.</span></div></div>",

Sadly, her problem can be cured in only one way. Even more sadly, that method isn't available. If Mesprit found out, she would hate her and/or attempt to kill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her last, lucid thought fades away as she hears your voice again:<br>\r\n\"Azelf! Come on, what's wrong?\" you ask, now openly worried for the blue giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoots you a pleading gaze.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I... I need help...</span>\" she breaths heavily, her cheeks growing redder as her carnal desires grow stronger.<br>\r\n\"Help...?\" you repeat, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to notice that the giantess is acting just like Mesprit when she first-<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" is all you manage to say as your own cheeks assume the color of a red pepper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare into each other's eyes for an incalculable amount of time, before you break the silence:<br>\r\n\"A-Azelf, we c-can't... y-you...\" you go quiet, sure that she already got the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich she apparently did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I know,</span>\" she says, closing her eyes and exhaling heavily.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">But I n-need this... I-It's making me... oh!</span>\" she groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou however take a step back on her paw. The perspective that she might lose control while you're inside of her, along with the thought of where you might end up is she does, is enough to scare you into refusing. <br>\r\n\"Azelf... I can't do it...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess opens her eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Please...</span>\" she pleads, eyeing you with a glazed eyes that speak louder than all her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a small cry of frustration.<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" you then shout.<br>\r\n\"I'll help!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Thank you...</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Though we'll need a more private place...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can open your mouth to ask what she means by that, Azelf teleports away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou materialize again, managing to stand tall. By now, you're pretty used to the feeling that teleporting brings. You glance around, noticing that you both are by the shore of... not Lake Acuity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're at a lake alright, but it lacks any snow, suggesting that this is not the Lake where you met the three sisters.<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" you question.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Lake Valor,</span>\" Azelf replies. The name isn't unfamiliar to you.<br>\r\n\"Ah! Your home!\" you exclaim, recalling what Mesprit told you yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Precisely.</span>\" the giantess says as she lowers you down. Your feet touch the grass, and you take a few steps back.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">No one is going to bother us here. Though we need to be quick. Otherwise, my sisters will find out we're missing and they'll come searching for us...</span>\" she adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the ground quakes as the titaness sits down, spreading her legs info front of you.<br>\r\n\"Ahem...\" she says as she reveals a large pair of pink, vertical lips you've got all too familiar with over the past day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Whe-Whenever you're ready...</span>\" she says, clasping her hands together as she waits for your to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, still highly doubtful that this'll be of any good for you, you make your way to the giantess' sex, deciding to start in the most classical way: rubbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop by the giant lips and, without even bothering to look up, you place your hands on the warm flesh, starting to slide them along the length of the organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf immediately lets out a pleased moan, feeling your touch on the most sensitive area of her body. The first moan is joined by several other as you keep rubbing the giantess' crotch with your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that this won't be enough to satisfy the giantess, you slide your hands inside of her, starting to rub the squishy, hot flesh.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Yes! Keep going!</span>\" Azelf shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your hands starting to get wet within the giantess. This is a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull one hand out and place it back on the exterior of Azelf's crotch as you start rubbing both the inside and the outside, stroking the blue fur outside, scratching the slick flesh inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf feels ecstatic as her heat starts to loose its grip on her. The human is doing one good job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie above moans in loud surprise as you suddenly hop on her crotch, starting to rub its middle section.<br>\r\n\"Do. You. Like. This?\" you pant, your arms starting to get sore and your being starting to feel quite tired.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Yes!</span>\" the giantess cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep going, until the soft ground beneath you shakes. And, before you can even pull yourself out, you are struck by a river of love juices that make you fall from your perch and onto the cold hard ground.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Whew...</span>\" the giantess pants, her cheeks burning red as she looks at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Are you fine?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly.\" you reply, spitting out the liquid that didn't find its way down your throat.<br>\r\n\"You, on the other hand, are you satisfied now?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf blushes more, looks down and nervously taps her fingertips. You groan. The answer is clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish.\" you say, getting up and walking towards the giantess again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can even question what you're up to, you leap right into the dark abyss of her insides. All lights are blocked out by the giant lips as you make your way deeper within the giantess, backing her into a state of bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start doing the exact same thing you were doing before and rub the sex from within, causing Azelf to moan loudly. But then, you decide to spice things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop on your knees, your hands pressing into the hot flesh as you start crawling, big drops of 'nectar' falling all over your body as you crawl upwards and downwards, rubbing, stroking, scratching, licking, worshipping the vaginal walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf's pleasure builds up more and more as you even pummel your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the giantess can't hold it in anymore, and she releases yet again a powerful, tidal wave of her juice, which overwhelms you, soaks you to the bone and washes you out of Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are ungracefully thrown out of the giantess. You land on your back again, the ground shaking beneath you. You realize that Azelf must have collapsed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Satisfied?\" you question.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Want a honest answer?</span>\" she says. You grit your teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFu-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I've never felt better!</span>\" Azelf chimes. You breath in relief as you stand up again, walking up to her face, noticing the giantess smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now-\" you're interrupted as Azelf's face darts forward, her lips briefly making contact with your upper body.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And that's what you get for your assistance~</span>\" the giantess merrily says, winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to ignore the comment and focus on yourself instead: you're dripping with cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze instinctively travels on the lake.<br>\r\n\"Hey, can I take a bath?\" you ask the guardian.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Go ahead.</span>\" she approves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over the lake and leap into the water. You swim around for about five minutes, before getting out of the water, noticing Azelf wiping her nether regions clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she's done with her task, the giantess looks at you with a smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I'll never thank you enough,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Please, don't. I've done nothing,\" you humbly reply.<br>\r\n\"But now, shouldn't we go back to Lake Acuity?\" you say, absentmindedly looking at the sky; when you first came here, it was around 5 PM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look at your watch, hoping to find it still working. Luckily, it does: 6:30 PM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze shifts on Azelf again. You discover her thinking about something.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You're right. We should go back,</span>\" she says, holding out a paw, motioning for you to hop on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leap onto the soft palm of her hand as the giantess prepares to take flight.</span></div></div>",

You remain silent throughout the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Okay, here we go,</span>\" the giantess says, giving a slight smile as she hovers upwards. Once she's at several feet above the ground, she glances at her lake one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You don't mind flying instead of teleporting, do you?</span>\" she distractedly asks while contemplating the lake below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecalling the feeling of nausea you felt whenever you were teleported within the past day, you quickly nod.<br>\r\n\"Absolutely.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf's gaze finally shifts elsewhere. The blue mountain looks at you, smiles and proceeds to fly in direction of Lake Acuity, leaving Lake Valor behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both keep quiet for the whole trip back to Uxie's lake. For some reason, Azelf is flying really slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the air gets colder, suggesting that you're almost there.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hey,</span>\" Azelf suddenly calls. You turn back, discovering her staring at you with a smile.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Thanks again for... you know...</span>\" she says, blushing. You blush as well as a vague smile appears on your face.<br>\r\n\"Don't even say that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf's smile fades.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Please... not a word about it...</span>\" she mutters pleadingly. You nod your head.<br>\r\n\"It'll be a secret, trust me.\" you tell, making the giantess smile again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Azelf hovers above a noticeable lake. Even from this height, you can see two large heads, one pink and the other yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf flies down. Apparently, her sisters noticed her: the two heads suddenly turn in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Okay, where the actual <i>hell</i> were you?!</span>\" Mesprit verbally assaults Azelf as she fully descends to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink headed giantess searched for her sister and the human in the whole Lake Acuity. However, it was like they vanished! And Mesprit had her suspects of what the two of them could have been doing behind her back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Relax, sis. Just flying around. I needed to talk to the human,</span>\" Azelf calmly replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit gazes at you. Soon enough, you find her paws reaching out for you as the giantess grabs a tight hold on you and picks you from her blue sister, grabbing you in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Now you've gotta tell me: what did you do?</span>\" Mesprit asks you. You look up, straight into the golden eyes of the giantess.<br>\r\n\"Nothing, Mesprit. Really nothing. We just talked.\" you answer untruthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But-</span>\" Uxie starts to feel cut out. She places a paw on Mesprit's shoulder as she speaks up:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Come on Mesprit, they didn't do anything,</span>\" she reassured, before pointing her closed eyelids at Azelf.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Right?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Of course.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit finally lets herself smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Alright!</span>\" she says cheerfully, her quick change of mood surprising you. The giantess gazes at you sweetly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Truthful and loyal.</span>\" she remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel bad. Luckily, Mesprit doesn't seem to detect your negative emotions as she hugs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun completely sets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing much went on after your return to Lake Acuity. Just Mesprit's usual displays of love and what you assume are the usual speeches of the three legendaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you take notice that Azelf doesn't mention what you told her at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have decided to wait for a better moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick dinner (if fish pokemon for the three sisters and a bar of chocolate you luckily found in your bag can be called that) the three decide to hit the hay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You coming?</span>\"  Mesprit calls as she enters the cave after Uxie and Azelf.<br>\r\n\"Coming,\" you reply as you look back, at the dark depths of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into the thickness of it, you swear you see a pair of crimson eyes staring at you... you blink several times, and the eyes disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMust have been your mind tricking you, you guess as you walk into the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit picks and hugs you against her chest.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Night, girls!</span>\" she exclaims, getting drowsy, incoherent mutterings in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess turns to you, and presses her lips on your head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You sleep tight.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"You too.\" you reply, stroking the giantess' fur with hand, making her emit pleased sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you both go quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, Mesprit is asleep. Shortly after, you fall asleep too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then, no longer hearing noises, a figure rises and hovers beside Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I don't like playing with other's minds,</span>\" Azelf whispers as she floats closer to you, who are being held in place by Mesprit's paws. The serene expression on both your and Mesprit's face makes her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">But it'll be impossible for you to leave once you've met the real Lake Trio.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes glow blue as she looks at you intently, your own eyes briefly glowing of the same color underneath your eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent with her actions, Azelf returns to her original spot beside Uxie and lays back down, closing her eyes as sleep finally claims her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nYour eyes open. You sit up, then stand up as you take a look around, noticing that you're standing before Lake Acuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember going to sleep inside of the cavern...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood freezes within your veins as you remember about Lucario. He told that you participated to a pokemon meeting. However, he didn't mention that you actually agreed to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere you taken away from the three sisters again...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention is drawn by a noise you don't recognize at first. But then, it gets stronger as the bushes around start to shake.<br>\r\n\"W-Who's there?\" you ask, fearing, as you finally make out what the noise is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, trying to find where it's coming from, when suddenly you are grabbed by your neck from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, you look back, finding yourself face to face with... Mesprit?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Mesprit alright, but something's wrong... she's one foot tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hi cutie!</span>\" she chimes as she rubs her head against yours.<br>\r\n\"M-Mesprit...?\" you stammer, incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink headed guardian giggles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yep. Not just me though,</span>\" she says, pointing at something behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look backwards, and air leaves your lungs, like you were just punched in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating there are Azelf and Uxie, one saluting you with both paws in a cheerful manner, the other quietly smiling at you, paws clasped behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay. What is happening?\" you ask as calmly as you can.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Well, we figured that our sizes might be a little scary for you,</span>\" Azelf says, floating closer to you, emulated by Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But with our original sizes, you are the giant! Look at you!</span>\" Mesprit chimes as she grabs a hold of your neck again, pushing her head against yours, lovingly rubbing it against your left cheek.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">We figured that like this...</span>\" Uxie speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit releases you as the three float in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>It'd be easier to play!</b>\" they exclaim at unison.<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

Almost as if they're doing some kind of hypnotic, joyful dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering from your initial surprise, you stare at the three and laugh a bit. Who could have guessed that the three giantesses were in reality one foot tall each?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit is the first to stop as she floats over you, taking place in your arms, her hands gripping your shoulders as she places her head underneath yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Mhh...</span>\" the guardian moans, while Azelf and Uxie hover closer to you, their cheeks red.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Do you know...</span>\" Azelf starts.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">...What happens now?</span>\" Uxie continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou back up, noticing the seductive hint in their voices. However, Mesprit keeps a good grip on you.<br>\r\n\"Uh, what?\" you question, still trying to free yourself from the pink headed guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Mesprit looks up and grins, before all three sisters hover into you, pushing you onto your rear.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Something really nice~</span>\" she chimes as the three float over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice their... nether regions dripping wet.<br>\r\n\"Uh oh...\" is all you manage to tell as the three literally pounce on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Time...</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">For some...</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Fun!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there, feeling extremely tired. Azelf lays before your face, white liquid still pouring out of her slit and near your lips;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sits on your lap, her own sex still dripping onto your crotch;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie rests on your chest, her crotch dripping onto your already soaked skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been with all three sisters before alright... but not at the same time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... uh... something I don't want to repeat...\" you pant.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh, hush, you loved it, I can feel it.</span>\" Mesprit retorts, making you blush while making her sisters giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go quiet, trying to figure out what'll happen now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill the three stay this size now? Or will they grow back into giantesses?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to question about it. However, no sound comes out of your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you watch with horror as Lake Acuity, the vegetation around and the three sisters starts to fade, before even you fade away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up, taking notice that you're not laying on the smooth, warm fur of Mesprit anymore. Instead, you're laying on the hard, cold stone ground of the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel quite dazed, and your mind clings to the last remains of your previous dream about the sisters. You flush red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it just a lucid dream...? The sisters didn't really shrink, did they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up, rubbing your eyes, before opening them and glancing around. Around you, two titanesses called Azelf and Uxie are still sleeping soundly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Mesprit is nowhere to be seen, a large space where once was her body is left in her place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, it was just one big, lucid dream... or nightmare...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, still dazed with sleepiness, you feel your stomach growling softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost feeling like you don't want to do anything, you stumble to your backpack, take a hold of it and start dragging it out of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blinding sunshine hits you, making you close your eyes. Doing so, you don't notice a familiar, pink headed giantess shifting her gaze on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Good morning, lovey!</span>\" Mesprit greets you with a smile. Before you even know it, she had already grabbed you in a hug. You feel her gigantic lips landing right on top of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin'...\" you say with a yawn.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Looks like you really can't stay without me! I've left the cave only five minutes ago!</span>\" she says cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore the comment and yawn again, before freeing your arms from her grasp and opening your bag, searching for something edible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out an irritated sigh as you take notice that your food is running short, thanks to those cursed dark type weasels who stole most of it when you first came here to Lake Acuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing your irritation, Mesprit perks up, looking down at you with concern.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What's wrong, dearie?</span>\" she asks, releasing you and letting you stand on her open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess suddenly wears a worried expression.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You're not planning to leave again, are you?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Nooo...\" you say, adding a third yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Then, what's up with you?</span>\" she asks again.<br>\r\n\"I'm running out of food,\" you bluntly reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's face brightens up again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">That's it? Well, let's go get some then!</span>\" she says cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" you reply, surprising the giantess.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What? You just told me you're running out of food...</span>\" she repeats your words.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I don't want to go fetch it,\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"Actually, for some reason, I feel like I don't want to do pretty much anything right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's smile fades away as she tilts her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You don't want to do anything?</span>\" she questions.<br>\r\n\"Anything at all. Must be still tired...\" you mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit doesn't respond. Once again, she can feel her heart pounding the walls of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess gently puts you down and watches as you sit down and lean back against the stone wall of the cave, closing your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Just a minute, dear,</span>\" she says as she floats inside the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit hovers in the depths of the cave where her sisters are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human felt like he didn't want to do anything... because his will was altered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost probably, Azelf had the human do something. As a result, his willpower had a change. The effects would wear off after a while .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Mesprit finds herself seeking answers for the second time in just two days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy her love and her sisters can't just get along without the two of them using their powers on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit hovers at the end of the cave... only to discover that Azelf isn't there. Only a still snoring Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit feels her heart leaping. She woke up first, Azelf didn't get out of the cave. Meaning... she must have woke up and overheard the conversation between Mesprit herself and the human, and she must have teleported away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDejected, the giantess turns back and heads for the entrance of the cavern. Willpower had nothing to do with memories, meaning the if something happened, the human knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit suddenly returns, looking worried.<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looks at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Listen, you've got to tell me: what happened last night?</span>\" she asks worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to remember.<br>\r\n\"Last night...?\" you repeat.<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Nothing at all...\" you say, before going pale.<br>\r\n\"Did Uxie erase my memories again...?\" you question, starting to grow worried too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Mesprit shakes her head back and forth.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">No no. It's just... you're acting weird. I'd like to know why.</span>\" she partially lies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug.<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know. Nothing happened last night. I just went to sleep...\" you reply, before remembering about your dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flush red again. And your embarrassment strikes Mesprit's senses.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Alright, you are embarrassed. Why?</span>\" she bluntly asks, before floating back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf... did she make the human want to help her with her own heat? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit clenches her fists as she feels her ire rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, however, are unaware of this as you recall the weird dream you had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you tell Mesprit what you dreamed about? Would she be offended by it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing you growing flustered, Mesprit lowers herself.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Whatever happened. Tell me.</span>\" she says in an imperative voice, startling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

You hug back, before feeling a foreign weight dropping onto your right shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to the side, you notice that it's Azelf, who hugs your head, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can react, a third body hugs your torso.

You rub your eyes as you try to recall the weird dream you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat just happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in the memories of that dream, you barely register a voice calling out a single word:<br>\r\n\"Human.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis voice is very low, but you still detect the growly tone in it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes open up fully. The first thing you notice is that you're still held in place by Mesprit's paws; second, the legendaries are still asleep; third, the voice keeps calling out for you:<br>\r\n\"Human... Human...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly and carefully wiggle your way out of Mesprit's embrace and stand onto the wide surface of her bosom. The effect is immediate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing the lack of you in her sleep, Mesprit starts flailing her arms around, mumbling incomprehensible, incoherent sounds as she tries to find you anywhere on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne decently-articulated sentence gives you an idea of her dreams:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie... don't go... don't leave...</span>\" she cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis causes you to smile as you decide to help the giantess deal with her nightmares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling, you place your hand on her fur and start stroking her.<br>\r\n\"Not going anywhere, promise,\" you whisper. Your words, paired with your petting, seem to have an effect: Mesprit's arms slowly relax back into their original place on her chest, her mouth closes back up, shifting into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, you turn your attention to the side. You walk to the end of her chest and look down, spotting a very annoyed-looking Lucario staring up at you with his arms crossed.<br>\r\n\"Will it take anymore time?\" he grumbles, before adding:<br>\r\n\"...Are you afraid of coming down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff as you slide down Mesprit's side, landing before the jackal.<br>\r\n\"Hello again,\" he growls.<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" you respond, looking back at the sisters.<br>\r\n\"Should we go for a walk? This place doesn't seem... appropriate.\" you remark sarcastically as you start walking towards the beginning of the cave, Lucario following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the moonlight and a pleasant breeze greet you into the quietness of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to talk, human. Again.\" Lucario says as he catches up with you.<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You changed your mind. Why?\" he asks, getting straight to the point.<br>\r\n\"Easy. I never really wanted to leave,\" you admit.<br>\r\n\"Your tale scared me alright, but then... I simply decided to trust them, alright?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario huffs.<br>\r\n\"Do you know what results your decision will bring?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, them losing control, going crazy and going on a rampage,\" you recall, stopping to face the jackal, who stops as well.<br>\r\n\"But, who guarantees that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario smirks.<br>\r\n\"Everyone around here.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Good point,\" you admit.<br>\r\n\"But you know what? I told Azelf.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario looks confused.<br>\r\n\"You told Az-\" his eyes shut wide open.<br>\r\n\"You told Azelf about what the heat makes them do?!\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. The black and blue pokemon face palms.<br>\r\n\"You knew we pokemon didn't want to do that! You broke her heart!\" he says, pointing an accusatory finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Yes I did. But she listened, understood and believed me,\" you retort.<br>\r\n\"And she assured that she's going to handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What if she's the first to lose control?\" Lucario remarks.<br>\r\n\"Well, she controls willpower, no? She should be able to keep herself under control.\" you reply. Right before remembering how she couldn't earlier today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario is seemingly reading your mind.<br>\r\n\"Well, too bad she isn't,\" he says.<br>\r\n\"And that brings us to the point. You should really leave. For your sake, for us pokemon's sake, and for this whole lake's sake.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, however, shake your head.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I can't,\" you say in a convincingly sorrowful voice.<br>\r\n\"You told me the you didn't want to break their hearts, right?\" you recall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario nods.<br>\r\n\"You did...\" he points out.<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you huff.<br>\r\n\"But, have you thought about what would happen if I left?\" you reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario doesn't even blink.<br>\r\n\"I know what you're saying,\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Sure, they'll be heartbroken... until this cursed season is over, and they'll be back to normal. They'll probably won't be so loving like they're now then. <b>If</b> you manage to survive until the season is over,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that,\" you snap back.<br>\r\n\"I trust them, alright? Now, I've gotta go back if you don't mind,\" you tell, starting to turn around.<br>\r\n\"See you around,\" you remark with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario watches you leaving for a moment.</span></div></div>",

You're pretty sure why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" you salute despite his clearly unfriendly glare.<br>\r\n\"Hello, human,\" he responds as her walks closer to where you are sitting.<br>\r\n\"We meet again.\" he adds, making you smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't really figure why...\" you joke. However, the stern gaze Lucario gives you tells you that he isn't in the mood for jokes.<br>\r\n\"Cut the sarcasm, will you? This is serious!\" he cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you glare at him and turn your head to the side, gazing at the giant wall that is Mesprit's side to check if she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, she didn't and your gaze returns to Lucario.<br>\r\n\"Keep your voice low.\" you say, earning a nod from the jackal, who inhales deeply. You begin to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario patiently waits for you to get back on your feet before speaking:<br>\r\n\"We need to talk again, human,\" he says.<br>\r\n\"I figured that out...\" you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to leave anymore, human,\" he begins, quite predictably.<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, no.\" you bluntly reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you may realize: it's a problem,\" the jackal remarks as he starts walking around you.<br>\r\n\"Ever considered that, maybe, it won't be so bad?\" you answer, looking at the sleeping mountain that is Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recall the promise she made, \u2018I'll handle it\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention is drawn by Lucario again.<br>\r\n\"It won't be so bad? Human, you are risking. <b>We</b> are risking,\" he says, putting particular emphasis on the word \u2018we\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for Lucario to calm down a bit. The black and blue pokemon sighs, before continuing:<br>\r\n\"We all are risking. You, me and every other pokemon around this lake!\" he exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you glare at him and look at the three sleeping giantesses.<br>\r\n\"Quiet!\" you hiss, turning your head to face him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario lowers his head and starts inhaling and exhaling heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, his crimson gaze rises up again as he looks at you.<br>\r\n\"Why, human?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you want to leave anymore? You're in danger. Those three - they can't control themselves, you know it. So why... Why risk your own life?... As a matter of fact, why do are you even attracted to those three? They're pokemon, you're human...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look like I care? Mesprit openly declared her love towards me. Who am I to judge love?\" you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's lust, human. The heat made her talk.\" Lucario replies. Your start to grow tired of this argument.<br>\r\n\"Yeah? The heat made her also try to kill her own sister?\" you remark out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cover your mouth with your hands, and you lower your head, intently staring at the floor, avoiding Lucario's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait to calm down before speaking again:<br>\r\n\"Lucario,\" you start in a serious voice.<br>\r\n\"Would you ever leave the only one creature that called you \u2018the love of my life\u2019 so far?\" you ask, before looking at Mesprit.<br>\r\n\"Even if it was while she was... um... trying to eliminate her sister...\" you add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I knew my mate could be a threat to me, I WOULD leave her...\" he says with a smirk.<br>\r\n\"It's the heat season for me too, you know. And I'm losing my time here with you instead of actually finding a mate.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"And that's the point: you need to leave. Preferably, right now, while those three sleep...\" he points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sternly gaze at him.<br>\r\n\"I won't be doing so.\" you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario drops his smirk.<br>\r\n\"You need to.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"No, I don't.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're putting yourself in danger. And us as well.\" <br>\r\n\"Trust me, I'm not.\" you snap back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the jackal goes quiet, and stares at you coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?\" Lucario suddenly asks, sounding exasperated.<br>\r\n\"Do as you wish!\" he then shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie moans in her sleep. Alerted, you look at the giantess, then at the jackal, glaring at him for the third time while pressing your index finger on your lips, non-verbally expressing yourself, \u2018Shut up!\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario's mouth closes as he looks at you coldly again, before turning around and starting to walk away.<br>\r\n\"When those three lose all control,\" you hear him whispering.<br>\r\n\"Don't say we didn't warn you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he disappears into the forest, engulfed by darkness and vegetation. You give a triumphant smirk as you walk up to Mesprit again and lean back against her body, letting yourself slide back into your previous sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cross your arms behind your head and your eyes close as you breath in fresh air, enjoying the afternoon breeze that blows around the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you relax, you start thinking. Now that you've dealt with Lucario, pokemon around here should leave you alone... right? After, the jackal said \u2018Do as you wish\u2019...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure of what to expect now, though. If Lucario is right, Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie will lose control someday, and they'll starts using you like a common toy, a common toy whose only purpose would be to sexually please the three giantesses until you break...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image is a horrible one to think of. However... Azelf assured that she'll handle it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Hopefully, she will... Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long passes after Lucario's leaving.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your attention is caught by a sudden stretch of a massive pair of arms suddenly rising, along with a loud noise that you register as a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that it might be Mesprit waking up, you quickly get up and walk away, fearing that she might roll over and crush you into dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your fear turns out to be for naught as you notice that Mesprit is still very asleep; the gigantic arms fall back down on, and you notice they actually belong to Azelf. The giantess places her paws on the ground as she helps herself sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue headed pixie blinks a few times after waking up and drowsily glances around, spotting you staring up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hey,</span>\" Azelf says.<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you reply as she yawns again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness then fixes her gaze on you as she stares at you in silence for a couple of moments.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Come over here,</span>\" she then says, patting a patch of grass beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, you nod and walk up to her, where her massive paw rests on the ground. You sit on the back of her giant hand. And then immediately regret doing so as the giantess rises it up in the air, bringing you in front of her monolithic eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Can we talk for a while?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink a few times, confused, before quietly nodding your head.<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you respond.<br>\r\n\"About what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the giantess lets herself fall back down on the ground, which quakes softly, while her paw shakes making you fall off your perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a cry of surprise as you hit something soft. Startled, you get back on your feet, realizing that you fell onto the giantess' chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer paw lowers and her head rises as she gives a small smile.<br>\r\n\"S-So?\" you stutter, still startled.<br>\r\n\"What did you want to talk about?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf's smile wanes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">The things you've told earlier...</span>\" she says, effectively getting you to listen.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Was it all true?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down on the soft ground and nervously bite your tongue as you look elsewhere, while nodding your head. Azelf's gaze travels up to the sky, her facial expression shifts into one of sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And we call ourselves guardians...</span>\" she bitterly mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks at the statement.<br>\r\n\"Look at the bright side,\" you say, trying to cheer the giantess up.<br>\r\n\"At least, it didn't happen yet... so, now that you know it, you can keep yourself under control, no?\" you tell<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I suppose...</span>\" Azelf responds.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I mean, if my sisters try anything, I can steal their willpower. But...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But...?\" you ask, curious about her line of thinking.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">But, what will happen if I too lose control? If I end up going crazy? Who will keep you safe then...?</span>\" Azelf asks, mostly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you tell them too?\" you ask. Azelf shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">No. I know them, they'd be heartbroken for Arceus knows how long...</span>\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go quiet, not finding anything to reply with. The giantess quiets down as well, her gaze avoiding yours. An awkward silence falls between the two of you, interrupted only by the snoring of Uxie and Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Azelf suddenly perks up and looks at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Do you think... can... can I hug you?</span>\" the giantess asks, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question makes you blush too.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't get the chance to repeat your question, though, as the giant paws of Azelf rise up and fall down upon your body, pushing you against her chest. The sudden display of affection makes you flush red. And you notice Azelf's lips curling into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I feel better,</span>\" you hear her whispering as she gazes down at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Thanks.</span>\" she adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... No problem?\" you ask, taking notice of the paws on your back starting to move, dragging you up to the giantess' cyan face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" the question never leaves your lips as Azelf's suddenly move, pressing themselves into your face. It's just for a moment, before the giant pair leaves your face, revealing a blushing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for...?\" you ask, embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Just a small sign of my appreciation. For telling me the truth.</span>\" she says, placing you back down on her chest and releasing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up, and try to physically shake the blush off your face, before looking at the smiling giantess again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's it like?\" you casually asks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">What?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Being so big... What's it like?\" you repeat, trying to change topic to rid Azelf's mind of its previous line of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf's smile fades as she looks at you intently, wondering the meaning of such question.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">It sucks.</span>\" she bluntly responds after a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're taken aback by such bluntness.<br>\r\n\"A-And... why, may I ask?\" you question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf closes her eyes and sighs heavily.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Simple really. This size might be useful for protection, but what did we trade for it? The chance of making any friends. The possibility of keeping a mate. And, last but not least, it turns out we're dangerous to our lakes during this cursed season...</span>\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally slap yourself. Why did you have to ask a question worse that made Azelf even more depressed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You know, you're a really good listener,</span>\" she compliments with a bit of a smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Quite cute, too...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last remark causes you to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You know, it's comforting to know that me and my sisters can still make friends with someone... because, we're friends, right?</span>\" she suddenly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile.<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\" you reply, making the giantess smile again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Good.</span>\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Yep. We're really good friends...</span>\" Azelf repeats. Though, this time you detect something within her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething somewhat familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">REALLY good friends...</span>\" Azelf repeats for the third time. Your smile fades, and your heart pounds your chest as you notice what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly recall that Azelf wasn't 'fixed' yet. And, if she's anywhere similar to Mesprit, you know that she's going to be delirious without carnal satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, recent discoveries left you unwilling to 'help' again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, that's right. We're really good friends. Now, could you let me down, please?\" you ask, while desperately looking over her still sleeping sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf looks at you and blinks innocently.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Why? Going somewhere?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"N-No... just need to drink...\" you lie, cursing your not-so-firm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf grins at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh, then I'll come with you. I need something too...</span>\" she says seductively while winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow.<br>\r\n\"Az-\" you are interrupted by a large finger covering your mouth.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Shh... You know what I need, don't you?</span>\" she asks rhetorically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou back up onto the giantess' body, her paw falling onto her chest.<br>\r\n\"Azelf, you're just delirious!\" you shout, trying to make her snap back to her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Probably...</span>\" she says with the last remains of her lucidity.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... But I need this so much...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need no further confirm: Azelf is really delirious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you do the only thing you can think of in this situation: your turn back and run across her gigantic body. Jumping down isn't an option, so you opt to run to the side of Azelf and try to slide down. Hopefully, the giantess will have a hard time in catching someone so minuscule on her monolithic body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all your plans are shattered as you suddenly stop and fall down, your body deprived of willpower.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Heh, you clever little one, you caught me by surprise,</span>\" the giantess says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you feel her gigantic hand wrapping around your immobile body.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">But now, I'm not in the mood for games. I need help,</span>\" she says, starting to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze at Uxie and Mesprit. Still asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf, stop this! You told me you weren't going to lose control, remember?!\" you purposely cry at top of your lungs for two reasons: one, to wake the two sleeping sisters; two, it might actually work to make Azelf snap back to reality...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, while your shout only made Mesprit moan in slight annoyance, it definitely started something in Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess'movements cease as she looks at you, looking dazed. You soon realize that it's her soon-to-fade lucidity, which is trying to fight back her lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You told me you'd protect me, don't you remember?!\" you press on, watching as the giantess grabs her head in her free paw, letting out a cry of pain.</span></div></div>",

I remember that we were talking, but then?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, could you give me back my willpower?\" you say with a not-so-subtle hint of annoyance.

It happened to you as well...\" you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess blinks, perplexed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">What happened to me...?</span>\" she asks, before hastily formulating an explanation by herself.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Uxie didn't erase my memories too, did she!?</span>\" she suddenly asks, looking back at her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Mesprit and Uxie are still sleeping, happily unaware of whatever happened in the past minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her yellow headed sister still snoring with her eyes closed as usual, Azelf calms down, breathing in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Azelf,\" you speak.<br>\r\n\"<i><b>That</b></i> happened to you...\" you mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the giantess' gaze shifts on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">\u2018That\u2019...?</span>\" she repeats, getting more confused by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat before hard reality struck her. Like a whole mountain fell upon her. Her eyes shut open and her mouth trembles as she tries to formulate a sentence.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I-I d-didn't... m-my...</span>\" she places her paw over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, she's just jumping to conclusions. So, she patiently waits for the human to tell her what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silenced giantess looks at you expectantly. You sadly nod your head.<br>\r\n\"Azelf... you just tried to use me...\" you admit, mentally slapping yourself for your brutal honesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess blushes deeply.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">How did that happen?!</span>\" she suddenly exclaims.<br>\r\n\"I don't know! We were talking, and then you suddenly changed!\" you respond, before remembering something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the exact same thing that happened with Mesprit,\" you recall.<br>\r\n\"She was normal one moment, and the other she was delirious! So... that means that the effects of your heat are... unpredictable...\" you conclude.<br>\r\n\"Plus, once you return to normal, you have no memory of it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf stares at you flabbergasted, her mouth hanging open. How could she protect the human, or even her Lake, if she could change in any moment without even knowing it?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf looks at you in silence, feeling broken inside. She feels tears starting to grow in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I... I'm sorry...</span>\" she sniffles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I-I n-need to go now...</span>\" the giantess says, placing you down on the ground and turning around, before starting to ascend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What - no! Azelf!\" you cry, trying to get her to stop. However, Azelf doesn't listen. Your ears catch a feeble sob coming from the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou desperately look around, noticing her tails lifting off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking, you dash towards one of the giant twins and hop onto it, hanging on for dear life as Azelf takes her leave from Lake Acuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Mesprit and Uxie stop snoring as they start to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" you exclaim as you cling to Azelf's right tail, while the giantess soars the skies at a dangerously high speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue the high speed, your cry goes completely unheard as the giantess keeps flying to an unknown destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Azelf, she keeps flying aimlessly. She just needed to get as far as she could from the human, not knowing that the same human is currently risking his life while clinging to her tail at like 2000 feet above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, while you bless your good grip, Azelf feels the need to cry. Hard. Most probably, the human couldn't stand the sight of her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse, if he tells her sisters... Mesprit is going to kill her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral tears fall as the titaness keeps floating in a random direction, before opening her eyes to see where is she going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight below, she spots a random mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue headed pixie starts to descend. And, at the bottom of her tail, you sigh in sheer relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the flight came to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf sits down behind the mountain, her tails moving out of the way as she sits. Immediately, the giantess places her paws over eyes and starts crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, down below, her tails land. And your feet touch the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting the urge to throw up, you stagger forward, not quite feeling your legs after clinging to Azelf soaring the skies at supersonic speed for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're also pretty grateful for the fact that you didn't become a red stain underneath Azelf's butt right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recover a bit and look up at the giantess, noticing her crying. You approach her.<br>\r\n\"Azelf...\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before a giant tear falls right in your direction. You dive out of the way, the tear splashing behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back on your feet and take a few steps back, breathing in relief, before looking at the titaness again. You fear that any further attempt to get her attention might just end up with you drowning in one of her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, seeing her cry is truly a heart-shattering sight... the giantess could really use some comforting now... She must be thinking that you hate her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe, she's thinking about what Mesprit would do to her is she ever finds out what she attempted to do with you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver at the thought, and quickly make a mental note to keep your mouth shut about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention shifts back on the crying giantess as you try to decide what to do, whether should you risk and get her attention or wait for her to calm down and then make your presence clear to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend a few more moments deciding, before finally making your choice.</span></div></div>",

But Mesprit is searching for something in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, for someone in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot spotting her little human anywhere, Mesprit frowns.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie...?</span>\" she calls out for you. Her call goes unanswered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as worry starts to seep into Mesprit's heart, she feels something tapping her shoulder.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Sis...</span>\" Uxie suddenly says. Mesprit turns around, noting that Azelf was missing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's heart pounds her chest from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid her little human try to leave again? Was Azelf trying to find him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">They must be together,</span>\" Uxie says, making Mesprit sigh in relief. Right before a new fear entered the pink headed legendary's heart.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Sis... do you think they...?</span>\" Mesprit asks, feeling her own rage rising just at the mere thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie seems to understand her sister's line of thinking. She swallows as she carefully picks her words.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well... it's a chance...</span>\" she says, before quickly adding:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">B-But, let's not be hasty, okay?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sighs as she calms down a bit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You're right - like always. I don't have to jump to conclusions,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But, for some reason, I feel really bad...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, for some reason, the pink headed giantess sensed a hint of sadness coming from somewhere. She's not sure of its source, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling she senses is very feeble. Someone was feeling very sad, she could tell, but it was very far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Mesprit wonders who it might be, before shrugging and shaking off the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You alright?</span>\" Uxie asks, noticing her sister's uneasiness.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yeah. Just worried for him...</span>\" Mesprit responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did the being of emotion know that the sadness she sensed was coming right from her missing sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand in front of the crying giantess, deciding to get her attention and try to comfort her.<br>\r\n\"Azelf!\" you call out for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your voice is drowned out by the giantess' tears, which keep falling like two waterfalls from her eyes, streaming across her cheeks and splashing on the ground below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf!\" you cry out, louder, though still unable to get her to hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Some guardian I am! I can't even control myself!</span>\" she says, her voice filled with shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AZELF!\" you shout at top of your lungs as you stare up at the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you note, she opens her eyes, and glances at you. Those huge golden disks widen at the sight of you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Y-You?! H-How did you get here?</span>\" Azelf stutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I think that a better question would be \u2018How did you get here alive\u2019...\" you recall the rough ride you had.<br>\r\n\"However, it doesn't...\" you don't get to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo large, strong paws get a hold of you, and they lift you up as the titaness suddenly hugs you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I-I'm sorry! I'm so so-sorry!</span>\" she sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain silent for a moment, before hugging back.<br>\r\n\"Shh... it's not your fault, Azelf. You can't control yourself,\" you say in a comforting voice.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Y-You don't h-hate me?</span>\" she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch question makes you indignant.<br>\r\n\"<i>Are you kidding?</i>\" you hiss.<br>\r\n\"Azelf, I would never hate you for something you don't have any control over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess sniffles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Yes... b-but... we h-hurt. We hurt pokemon and people... this stupid heat...</span>\" she stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up, giving a warm smile.<br>\r\n\"You know, Azelf, I believe that whoever proves to be truly sorry deserves a second chance, no matter what they did,\" you say.<br>\r\n\"And plus, you did not hurt me, did you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Well, no... but we could have! And t-that's why you were leaving!</span>\" she cries.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">If only I had known... I would have let you go when I found you leaving...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown.<br>\r\n\"I was making a mistake!\" you shout, taking Azelf by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh.<br>\r\n\"Look, I already told it: I like you and your sisters, Azelf. You three are the best things that happened to me so far. Trying to leave was a mistake.\" you state, before smiling again, pressing your head into her soft chest.<br>\r\n\"And I have to thank you for stopping me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your last sentence, the giantess spends an incalculable amount of time staring down at you, tears running down her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, unbeknownst to you, these ones were of happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the giant pixie gives you a smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I-I... I feel better...</span>\" she sniffles, removing one of her paws from your back. It travels up to her eyes as she wipes her tears away.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Thank you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile.<br>\r\n\"You're we-\" the phrase never leaves your lips as Azelf brings you up and moves you to her lips, which pucker up and press into your whole upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds the kiss for a whole minute, before pulling off, leaving a blushing you. Azelf blushes as well.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Those were truly kind words. I really felt at peace,</span>\" she remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... you're welcome...\" you respond as, once again, she hugs you, the human she unknowingly started to fall for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">They still didn't return...</span>\" Mesprit says as she gazes at the sky. Wherever her human was, she missed him. She woke up, wanting to play with him to help herself forget the rough day she, her sisters and him had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, such scheme wasn't realisable since her playmate was missing. That highly disappointed the giantess. She doesn't have a clue of where you are... for what she knows, you could be even trying to leave her again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Give them time, Mesprit,</span>\" Uxie says from behind her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">We don't even know if they're actually together...</span>\" she adds, before deciding that it was a stupid thing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a matter of fact, Mesprit lowers her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">The human didn't leave... did he...?</span>\" she asks, trying to convince herself that it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">He's one nice human among other like him. I don't think I he would have double-crossed us.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit remains silent.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I... I'm sorry...</span>\" she then says, her smile dropping. Mesprit perks up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">For what?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">For taking his memories. I was so shocked that I didn't even think twice,</span>\" Uxie admits.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You had a good reason, I guess,</span>\" Mesprit responds as she turns around to face Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I... I'm sorry too, Uxie. I'm sorry for saying that you raped him... and for... you know... trying to hurt you...</span>\" she says, ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie doesn't reply, but she floats forward, grabbing her sister in a hug. Mesprit closes her eyes as she returns it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... Don't know what I would have told Mesprit if you fell off...</span>\" Azelf says upon hearing how you actually got here.<br>\r\n\"Yup. It's been one rough ride...\" you respond, shivering at the mere thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf giggles, before casually looking at the sky, noticing that the sun is close to setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hey, it's quite late,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I think we should go back to the lake...</span>\" she adds, before looking at you with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">What do you say?</span>\" <br>\r\n\"After all that happened today, resting sounds great,\" you say as you wiggle a bit in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... Yeah... I'm sorry you had to see my sisters fighting...</span>\" she says. You shiver at the memory.<br>\r\n\"It was scary to see Mesprit and Uxie like that,\" you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Well, come on, let's go,</span>\" she says, before smiling as she notices you adjusting in her hug.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And I think you'd be fine traveling like that.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh.<br>\r\n\"How'd you guess?\" you joke. Azelf giggles as she starts hovering in midair, before starting to float upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she turns around and starts flying.</span></div></div>",

You take a few steps back, and watch as it splashes on the ground, forming a small puddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis inevitably leads you to take a decision: you've got to wait for her to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least for a little bit. Otherwise, you're going to drown in one of her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you move up beside her and sit down next to her, trying to ignore the sobs and the cries coming from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess keeps crying for quite a while, before you finally hear her stopping. Your gaze travels upwards, and you notice Azelf removing her paws from her eyes, which she then opens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat: her once golden eyes are now completely red, glazed with tears that keep falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf sniffles a couple time.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Some guardian you are!</span>\" she cries, unaware of your presence.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">How can I even think of returning to Lake Valor now!? I should be protecting it, and instead... I-I...</span>\" she bitterly cries, not even able to finish her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour expression drops into a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And the human,</span>\" you perk up, hearing her talking about you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">The human probably hates me now!</span>\" she exclaims, her own phrase backing her into sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have heard enough, you decide. You get back on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">How am I going to explain this to Mesprit and-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AZELF!\" you shout at top of your lungs, interrupting her monologue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the titaness heard you even though her sobs. Her paws leave her eyes, which open up as her gaze moves onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Y-You?!</span>\" she cries in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Me,\" you respond, walking up in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">H-How did you g-get here?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter,\" you reply, shivering at the memory of you hanging to her tail at like 2000 feet above the solid ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze back at the titaness.<br>\r\n\"Azelf, <i>I do not</i> hate you!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n\"And I can't even imagine how can you think such thing,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess blinks perplexed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Y-You d-don't?</span>\" she stutters, her massive paw wiping a few tears from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and shake your head.<br>\r\n\"Look, I know it's something you can't control, how could I blame you for it?\" you rhetorically ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only response you get is another blink of her reddened eyes. But then, Azelf suddenly moves, and leans forward, her paws reaching out for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand still and let her large blue paws slide underneath your arms, before clasping behind your back and lifting you up. The giant pixie moves you upwards, and hugs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I-I'm so-sorry! I-I'm sorry!</span>\" the giantess shouts, more tears streaming down her cheeks like two miniature waterfalls.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You're just the nicest little creature ever and... and I-I-</span>\" you interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are part of the sweetest trio I've ever met!\" you shout. Out of ideas to comfort her, you spread your arms, grabbing as much as you can of her chest in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf sniffles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I-I... I c-could have hurt you...</span>\"<br>\r\n\"Look. I-I understand it, alright? You can't control yourself because of your heat. But I don't hate you for it... as a matter of fact, nobody does!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf tilts her head, curious.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the pokemon who spoke to me didn't want to tell you that because they didn't want to break your and your sisters' hearts!\" you mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then go quiet and push your head against the giantess' chest, a comprehensive smile taking place on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the pixie hugs you even tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf keeps crying for a good while more, before her paws start to loose their grip on you. The giantess' left hand then closes in a fist around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Azelf brings you up to her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I-I'm truly sorry... pl-please, f-forgive m-me...</span>\" she stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf,\" you say, opting for a risky move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, much to the giantess' surprise, you lean forward, pressing your lips against her huge cheek. The smooth blue surface suddenly grows red underneath your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so do your own cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold the kiss for about thirty seconds, before pulling off, blushing wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and the giantess stare at each other in silence for a while, you too embarrassed to talk, Azelf still trying to process what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour palm slams against your forehead as you realize just how dumb this was.<br>\r\n\"Azelf, I'm-\" you have no time to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess suddenly looks at you and, seemingly snapped out of her trance, she leans forward, pushing her lips into your comparatively tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful sucking overwhelms your body as the giantess smooches you for a whole, eternal minute, before removing her face from you, her lips almost pulling your skin off along with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blush widens.<br>\r\n\"Ehm...\" you say, but are cut off by the titaness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I feel... at peace...</span>\" she says with a serene look on her still blushing face. The stream of tears running down her cheeks starts to subside.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Thank you.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... you're welcome...\" you dizzily mutter, making the giantess giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her temporary smile drops back into a frown.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I... I'm really sorry about before...</span>\" she apologizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head to rid your face of the red shade.<br>\r\n\"Don't be,\" you respond with a smile.<br>\r\n\"You don't have to be sorry. It's not your fault. It's simply something you can't control...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Y-Yeah... but, I-I could have u-used you and I wouldn't have even known about it...</span>\" she replies.<br>\r\n\"But you didn't. That means, you still have a little bit of lucidity whenever your heat acts up...\" you reason.<br>\r\n\"That's good to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I guess that now... that now you want to leave again...</span>\" she bitterly says, lowering her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And I cannot blame-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" you interrupt. Azelf perks up. You smile.<br>\r\n\"I'm not leaving,\" you continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf stares at you for a whole minute, trying to decide if you're lying or not. But then, she sighs in relief, and smiles at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Thank you. Mesprit would have killed me.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... Please, not a word of this with my sisters,</span>\" she adds, dreading Mesprit's reaction if you ever told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" you respond. Azelf smiles, her eyes starting to return to their characteristic golden color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back. But your smile soon fades as you notice...</span></div></div>",

We're here.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mh?\" you open your eyes to look down, noticing indeed Lake Acuity below. Azelf starts to descend.

You know, just flying around,</span>\" Azelf lies, giving a bit of a blush as she remembers what happened between you and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>That</i></b> is not something Mesprit must know. However, Azelf's pink headed sister senses her embarrassment and gives her a weird look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before anything else can be said, a yellow headed pixie floats out of the thick vegetation around the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie briefly stops as she spots Azelf and the human in Mesprit's paws.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Oh... you've returned...</span>\" she quietly says, flying closer to her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Where were you?</span>\" she then asks while giving a smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">By the way, glad you're still here,</span>\" she adds while pointing her eyelids on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back.<br>\r\n\"Why? Did you doubt me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Not even a moment.</span>\" Mesprit says as she kisses your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie stifles a giggle.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Yeah, that's exactly how she acted when she found you nowhere in sight,</span>\" she says, unable to keep herself from laughing. Mesprit blushes as she rises her head, glaring at Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow headed guardian looks at Azelf.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But, sis, where were you anyway?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf blushes again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Just flying around...</span>\" she repeats her lie. Again, Mesprit's senses detect her sister's embarrassment. And, with nobody to interrupt her, she asks:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Why are you feeling... embarrassed?</span>\" she asks while floating closer to Azelf, drawing both her and Uxie's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">What?</span>\" Uxie asks as Azelf's eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>That's it. We're dead. It was nice meeting you, Azelf.</i>\u2019 you think as you gaze at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a frown appears in Mesprit's face as she remembers that you - HER human - were with Azelf.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Sis?</span>\" Mesprit asks, while her grip on your becomes tighter.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">WHAT did you do with him?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf glares.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I did nothing to the human!</span>\" she screams.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Stop jumping to conclusions, you stupid wh-</span>\" the pixie giantess is interrupted as Uxie floats in between her and Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">That's enough,</span>\" Uxie says, before looking at Azelf.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">If you did nothing to the human, then you can tell whatever is embarrassing you, sis,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did nothing to me, honest,\" you chime in. Azelf looks at you smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie looks at you as she tries to determine whether you are lying or not. Her closed eyelids pointed on you make you feel uncomfortable, knowing that she could open them and make you forget things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie nods as she looks back at the blushing Azelf.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">If that's true, then you can tell us whatever is embarrassing you,</span>\" she says, her face contorting into a serious look as she remembers about what Mesprit tried to do to her earlier today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">After all, nothing could be worse than that...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

Azelf has barely the time to rise her head as she notices a pink and blue blur coming down at light speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same speed, you are rudely snatched from Azelf and are shoved into a smooth, warm wall. Startled, you look up. Your fear fades, and you give out a sigh of relief as you notice Mesprit hugging you, while gazing down at you with a smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hi cutie! Did you miss me? I know I missed you!</span>\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back, noticing Azelf staring at the scene confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, suddenly, a second giantess comes down. Only at a much slower pace.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">When we sensed that you two were here, she hit the ground running...</span>\" Uxie explains with a sigh as she hovers down, looking first at you, then at Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Speaking of, why are you here?</span>\" the yellow headed giantess then asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question causes Mesprit to loosen up her hug and look back at her blue sister.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">We thought that the human wanted to leave again, and that you were searching for him...</span>\" she says, before gazing down at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie, were you trying to leave again?</span>\" she asks, dreading your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you have a chance to speak, Azelf speaks for you:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">No no no, nothing like that,</span>\" she says. Mesprit gazes back at her sister, ready to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the words die down in her throat as she notices something: Azelf's eyes are red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">...Have you been crying?</span>\" Mesprit asks, before checking Azelf's emotions and assuming a confused expression.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But you're... you're joyous!</span>\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nervously laughs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Heh, you see, I... I kind of had a problem,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And the human hel-</span>\" Azelf is interrupted by Mesprit, who suddenly wears a frown upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Are you saying that MY human helped you with your heat?!</span>\" she shouts. Azelf flushes red.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">No!</span>\" she cries in response.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I...</span>\" she quickly remembers that, even if she wasn't actually helped, she tried to have the human anyway while she was unable to control herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue giantess stops to look down. Mesprit senses her embarrassment as well as her shame.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">No?! Then, why are you ashamed?</span>\" Mesprit asks again, self-convincing that Azelf really had the human help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new thought, worse than the first, penetrates Mesprit's mind.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... Have you... have you used your power to force him to help you?!</span>\" she shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing another imminent fight between sisters, you, who have been staring at the two quarreling giantesses in silence, try to interrupt:<br>\r\n\"She did not-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Of course not! I didn't do anything to him!</span>\" Azelf snaps back, interrupting you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Girls!</span>\" Uxie tries to interrupt the argument, but she poorly fails to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yeah? Why were you crying then!?</span>\" Mesprit asks again, her anger rising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything made sense: Azelf needed help, so she asked the human to fix her. The human most likely refused, and Azelf forced him to help her. As a result, she felt guilty about it and starte crying. However, she was also joyous because her heat was soothed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I... I had a problem. So I came here to think alone for a while. But the human somehow managed to follow me. All he did was try to comfort me! Guess what, he did it!</span>\" Azelf cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit growls at her sister. She nearly forgets about you in her paws, and is about to try to hit Azelf, when Uxie suddenly places herself in between her two siblings, turning to face Mesprit while spreading her arms wide in front of Azelf.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Sis, don't do anything you might regret. Remember this morning?</span>\" she asks, shivering at the memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uxie is right, Mesprit!\" you chime in.<br>\r\n\"And so is Azelf: she's telling the truth!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's gaze shifts on your who are still standing on top of her large palm. Her anger seems to wane in a matter of seconds.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... Did it really go like this...?</span>\" she asks you in a much calmer voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head.<br>\r\n\"Yes! Azelf didn't try anything funny! She-\" you look at the blue titaness, remembering how she suddenly lost control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't her fault, and you haven't got the heart to blame her for it.<br>\r\n\"... She seemed sad about something we both know,\" you risk saying, earning a curious stare from Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, what you had told Azelf must remain a secret between you and her, but you don't see anything bad in saying that you and the giantess share a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Mesprit and Uxie were now curious.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... What thing?</span>\" Uxie asks as her arms fall back in place, and she hovers closer to her pink headed sister, who is currently holding you while gazing at you with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I can't tell it,\" you say, shaking your head, immediately regretting telling that information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Why? What did <i>she</i> do?!</span>\" Mesprit asks, making a not-so-subtle motion for Azelf, who glares daggers at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't do anything!\" you cry, exasperated. Seriously, this day couldn't go any worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Alright. Then, why was she sad? Why did you have to comfort her?</span>\" Uxie chimes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain silent, and look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit stares at you for a couple of seconds, before looking at Azelf.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Sis?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What is the human talking about? Why were you sad? And what do you know that we don't?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue giantess gets up, and gazes at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling those golden eyes of hers staring at you, you return her gaze, understanding that Azelf is silently asking what should she do, whether to reveal the secret you and her share, or keep quiet about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

Got the answer, the giantess inhales deeply, before exhaling as deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Alright. I'll tell you,</span>\" she says, floating over Mesprit, picking you from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the pink headed guardian can complain, Azelf speaks to you:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I...

Us three?</span>\" Uxie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nods meekly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Yes. A-Apparently... w-we...</span>\" she stammers, before stopping in mid sentence. You find her paw gripping you tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a certain problem,\" you clarify as the pressure around you begins to loosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit and Uxie look at you curiously.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">...

Let me guess,</span>\" Uxie chimes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">This problem is the one the pokemon of Lake Acuity told you about?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow. Telling the truth would mean putting the inhabitants of the lake in danger... or not?

And I assume that's your motivation for wanting to leave us,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Okay, I'm glad we're getting somewhere,</span>\" Mesprit chimes in.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But the point is: this thing you and Azelf know and that we don't.

Maybe... you're scared of helping? Or... did we hurt you while you were...</span>\" she stops, a not-so-subtle shade of red taking place upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sentence causes both you and Mesprit to blush as well. What Uxie meant was: \u2018While you were inside of us?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, not that...\" you hastily respond.<br>\r\n\"It's-\" you feel a lump in your throat. You forcefully try to swallow it and talk, but it simply won't go down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Azelf doesn't seem to be having such problem. The giantess looks at Uxie.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">The heat, Uxie. It makes us lose control, sis,</span>\" she bluntly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis causes both her siblings to gasp.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">W-What are you saying, sis...?</span>\" Mesprit stutters, feeling dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf closes her eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I'm saying that we become uncontrollable. Crazy with lust. We...</span>\"<br>\r\n\"... Start wanting more. And more. It's effects are unpredictable,\" you continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And when we really lose it...</span>\" a moment of silence follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit and Uxie stare at you and Azelf with two hanging mouths, waiting for you to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich soon escapes your mouth, leaving like a boulder on your conscience:<br>\r\n\"... Y-You... You go on a rampage. Around the lakes.\" you finish, closing your eyes and turning your head elsewhere, dreading the giantesses' response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf's free paw places itself in front of you as the giantess attempts to shield you against her sisters' incoming reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is nowhere close to what the blue giantess imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit blinks a few times. It was like a whole mountain was thrown at her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">We... w-what...</span>\" she mutters, dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">B-But... H-How can you tell...?</span>\" Uxie asks, suddenly feeling shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf sighs, somehow managing to control the storm of emotions raging within her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">It happened,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Twice already,\" you chime in from behind her paw. Azelf slightly smacks you with it, causing you to fall on your behind onto her massive paw.<br>\r\n\"Ow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf looks back at her siblings.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Apparently, one minute we are normal, and the other we lose control and...</span>\"<br>\r\n\"... Try to fuc-\" Azelf's paw moves menacingly closer to you.<br>\r\n\"... Ehm, I mean, mate with the first living being you see...\" you clarify.<br>\r\n\"And that'd be me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit and Uxie stare at you and Azelf, mouths wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Mesprit suddenly thinks about something.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">W-Wait... so you really tried...</span>\" she says to Azelf, who nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Yes. I tried... having the human. But he managed to talk sense into me. That's why I came here... that's why I was crying...</span>\" Azelf says, before exhaling and looking down at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... I'm sorry...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at her and smile sympathetically, before looking at Mesprit, who stares at Azelf, not sure of what to think.<br>\r\n\"The same happened to you, Mesprit,\" you say, obtaining her attention.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">M-Me?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your tongue and nod.<br>\r\n\"You were normal one moment, and the other you... tried using me. Azelf's arrival stopped you.\" you recall<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Mesprit's can't hear anything more.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I-I... can't believe...</span>\" she says, floating back, away from you, grabbing her face in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie too seems to be on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">T-The lakes...</span>\" she mumbles, before turning her head in your direction.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">The human too...</span>\" she turns around, placing a paw over her already closed eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the sobs of the two titanesses are the only thing that can be heard.<br>\r\n\"Uxie... Mesprit...\" you mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a large paw moves in front of you. It belongs to Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness looks at you dejectedly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Give them a moment...</span>\" she suggests. You swallow, before looking back at the two sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you truly understand why the inhabitants of Lake Acuity didn't want to talk to them about their problem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I-I-I'm s-so-sorry!</span>\" Mesprit suddenly cries, flying forward and snatching you from Azelf.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I don't w-want t-to hurt you! I-I didn't want to s-scare you!</span>\" she then shouts as tears river out of her eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I-I l-love you...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink headed giantess grabs you in a tight embrace.<br>\r\n\"I know. And it's alright, really,\" you partially lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this whole situation is all but alright, you are somewhat relieved to have told them. Now, they should be able to find a solution...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I-I... I t-thank you for telling the truth...</span>\" Uxie suddenly says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">B-But now... you want to leave again, don't you?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sniffles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie...</span>\" she says, causing you to look up at her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I-If you still want to... to go...</span>\" she says, sniffling again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">If you want to go again... we will let you...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile.<br>\r\n\"No. I don't.\" you say, taking both Mesprit and Uxie by surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">N-No?</span>\" Uxie parrots back. You nod your head.<br>\r\n\"But,\" you continue with a serious expression.<br>\r\n\"We'll need a solution. Otherwise...\" you don't finish your sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing your intention to stay, Mesprit wipes a few tears, before lightly kissing your head, silently thanking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, silence falls between you and the three sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking past Mesprit, you catch a glimpse of Uxie.

And I might just lose control at any moment...</span>\" she says, while eyeing you in Mesprit's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich start to tighten their grip on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Then hurry up and find a partner,</span>\" Mesprit says, before fixing a stern gaze on Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message is clear, \u2018He's mine!\u2019.

You leap off her massive paw, your feet making contact with the grass around Lake Acuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What now?\" you ask as you turn to face the three titanesses, their bodies casting huge shadows as they stare down at you.<br>\r\n\"Do we try to find a solution? Or...?\" you ask, rubbing the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well, of course we need one. But-</span>\" Uxie is interrupted by a loud growl of her own stomach. The pixie blushes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I don't know about you, but I can reason better with a full stomach,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour own belly chooses this moment to growl, reminding you that you haven't been eating since this morning, and that you've actually ate just once. As a result, your own stomach now loudly asks to be filled with its remaining daily meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush too, looking up at Uxie.<br>\r\n\"Point taken.\" you remark, sending the three sisters into giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean back against the trunk of a large tree, holding some berries that come from the large pile that Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie collected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscarding a few tamato berries from your hands, you lazily bring a casual berry to your mouth and bite it while you watch the three sisters talking to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what your ears manage to catch of their speeches, you get that they're talking about what they've learned from you. They're talking about their problem, maybe trying to find a solution...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... Why are you all by yourself?</span>\" Uxie suddenly perks up, causing Mesprit and Azelf to look back as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Me?\" you ask. The pixie nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">This problem involves you too, right? Why don't you come here, so we can talk about it together?</span>\" she suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the expectant looks upon the sisters' faces, you slowly nod, before walking up to them. You silently sit beside Mesprit, who smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Much better!</span>\" she chimes, playfully patting your back with one of her tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Now, anyone with a good idea?</span>\" Azelf says, swallowing a few berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" you timidly speak up, drawing the attention of the giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you tried to... uh...\" you don't know how to say it. Azelf blushes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Yeah, I tried having my way with you,</span>\" she bluntly says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">What about it?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou too flush red.<br>\r\n\"Well, when I talked to you. You seemed to understand me, you fought your heat and you snapped back to reality...\" you recall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit glares at Azelf, who ignores her and focuses on you instead.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You're saying that if you could manage to make us normal again by simply talking?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"It's a hypothesis...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Uxie shaking her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">What you did might have been just luck,</span>\" she bluntly says, a hint of sorrow in her voice.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">If it doesn't work, we could easily... use you...</span>\" she adds, blushing while feeling ashamed of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a possibility...\" you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pile of berries disappeared a while ago, and you still can't find a logical conclusion to this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">There ought to be a solution...</span>\" Azelf mutters.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You're right,</span>\" Uxie says, before giving a yawn.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But you know what? We can find one in the morning. I'm tired.</span>\" she says, getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Are you three coming?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Sure thing,</span>\" Azelf yawns.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">All I want now is to hit the hay and sleep on it.</span>\" she adds, before looking at you and Mesprit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Are you...?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can respond, Mesprit's paw slams against your mouth, silencing you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... You can go without us,</span>\" she says with a sly smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie frowns.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Arceus, don't tell me you are losing control!</span>\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit laughs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Aw come on! I'm lucid! I just want a moment with this cutie here,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf and Uxie look at each other, before shrugging and starting to float off, in direction of the cave. Mesprit's smirk widens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer paw leaves your mouth.<br>\r\n\"So...?\" you ask, causing Mesprit to giggle.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">We're not going in the cave, cutie,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Tonight we're sleeping out here,</span>\" Mesprit continues as she starts laying down.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">So nobody will try anything. And I dare anyone to take you away from me,</span>\" she adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, her paws wrap around you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Look at the sky,</span>\" you hear the giantess saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing as instructed, you look up, noticing the sky enlightened by billions of stars and, of course, by the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh.<br>\r\n\"Great. Now we're laying together under the moonlight: huge romance clich\u00e9 incoming,\" you sarcastically remark, causing Mesprit to giggle loudly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You can say that!</span>\" she says, before both of you go quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit then gives a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie... don't ever leave my side...</span>\" Mesprit drowsily says as she snuggles up to you.<br>\r\n\"Won't do that.\" you reply as you hug the giantess. Mesprit smiles brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd soon, you find her upper body moving as she leans forward, placing a kiss on your face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Sleep tight dear...</span>\" she mutters as she lays back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too,\" you respond, starting to pet her.<br>\r\n\"Gentle giant.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guardian giggles again, before relaxing. Soon, her breath slows down, her chest starts to rise up and fall back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit just fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you lay your head against her soft chest, enjoying the warmth, the smoothness and the beats of her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even know it, you fall asleep too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sleep is bothered by something as you are rudely awoken, feeling like a really short time passed since you fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes open as you drowsily look around, trying to spot whatever disturbed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, in the darkness of the night, you notice...</span></div></div>",

Silly me.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Sorry sweetie.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright...\" you reply, taking notice that you're still firmly grasped by her.<br>\r\n\"... Why are you awake anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Couldn't sleep. So I was watching you sleep instead - you're so incredibly cute while you sleep~</span>\" she says with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flush red.<br>\r\n\"Uhm... okay?\" you respond, unsure of how to feel about this.<br>\r\n\"That's kinda... uhm... cute. Weird for sure, but cute in a sense.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit appears pleased with your answer as she smiles brightly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie...</span>\" she says while her paws start moving upwards, dragging you along with them up to the giantess' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can react, Mesprit leans down, her lips making contact with your forehead as she briefly smooches you, before pulling off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, but smile at the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You have no idea of how much I love you~</span>\" she chimes, while happily nuzzling you. You smirk.<br>\r\n\"I think I have a pretty close idea. I mean you... ehm...\" you pause, your smile fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mesprit just giggles.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">Tried to eliminate Uxie?</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"U-Uh... yeah...\" you say, cringing at the thought. You can still feel your skin prickling as you remember that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit smiles as she senses your emotions.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">In my defence, love cannot be without jealousy.</span>\" she states while shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah... try to avoid that in the future...\" you say, making the giantess giggle again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">No promises~</span>\" she responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both go quiet after her last remark. The giantess starts to caress you gently. You caress back, all your remaining wishes to leave suddenly waning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you start to feel like you're getting even closer to this pink headed guardian, who's only shown you love since you met her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit senses your emotions and smiles brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before feeling something... like her body suddenly caught fire... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh no...</span>\" she mumbles, closing her eyes and gritting her teeth. It couldn't be... after what her human told, she couldn't allow it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... \u2018Oh no\u2019 what...?\" you ask her while looking at her face, noticing her with gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Mesprit's expression relaxes. A red shade spreads across her face as she opens up her eyes, looking at you again while wearing a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... Oh nothing~</span>\" she chimes while bringing you up again and starting to nuzzle you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hmm... Sweetie...</span>\" she says quietly as she rubs you against her face, smothering you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you tell as you try to push yourself back, failing in doing so and having to submit to the display of affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a while, the giantess pulls you back, staring at you seductively... more seductively than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's gotten into you?\" you ask as you try to regain your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit giggles, gently lowering her paws to let you on the ground. Then, the ground shakes as she rolls on her side, her gigantic face standing in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Well... there's something I need cutie...</span>\" she responds while eyeing you intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What...?\" you ask, before realizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pained expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red shade on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer even-more-seductive attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shrink. Mesprit just went into heat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" is all you manage to mumble. Behind you, two faces suddenly peek out of a bush...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There she goes again...\" Lucario mutters while looking at Mesprit.<br>\r\n\"<u>What do we do? Do we take him away?</u>\" Vaporeon asks concerned about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... While Mesprit is awake? It would be the equivalent of suicide.\" Lucario responds.<br>\r\n\"I say, let's wait and see how things go...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mesprit... we can't...\" you hastily respond while stepping back.<br>\r\n\"... Remember what I told you before...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess huffs lustfully.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yes. I know - rampage and all...</span>\" she responds.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But I need this... I need you so much...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step away from the lustful giantess, who eyes you like a Mightyena while breathing heavily, her face growing even more red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first thought is about running right into the cave and wake Azelf up. She said she'd protect you, no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... then again, running would cause Mesprit to chase you... it could be easier to just help her and get this over with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever should you do, it's up to you.</span></div></div>",

Mesprit blinks a few times, bemused, before giving a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh~ I see~</span>\" you hear her voice as you run away. The giantess gets up, starting to hover in midair as she looks in the direction you went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I love this game~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you hear the rustling of a few plants and assume that Mesprit started chasing you as you predicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pay her no mind as you keep running towards your objective: the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cave where Azelf and Uxie went to sleep. Your only chance was to wake Azelf up - she was to one who could stop Mesprit until she calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough though, the plants around you start shaking as Mesprit gets closer. Without thinking, you dive into the first bush you see, your heart pounding the walls of your chest and your brain screaming for you to do something - anything that might pull you out of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you peer out of the bush, noticing an unmoving, hovering mountain of blue and pink looking around to spot you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Mesprit had the power to sense emotions, she was having a hard time at finding her little human. It was too dark, and she couldn't see his little body anywhere. Although, she could sense his emotions and could tell that he was pretty close to her location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh, cutie~</span>\" she calls seductively.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm having fun! But now, show yourself so we can play some more~ I know you're close~ I'll find you~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow, hastily trying to formulate a plan just as Mesprit starts searching in the bushes, her giant paws digging into the vegetation as she tries to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you come up with a decent plan... maybe a quite predictable one, but it could still save you if it works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneel down and start crawling from bush to bush, trying to not produce any sound as you try to find a rock on the ground. Mesprit perks up, hearing the bushes shaking behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles as she approaches the bunch of bushes you're hiding in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, your hands get a hold of a small rock. You firmly grasp it as you look out of the bush, noticing Mesprit searching right in the bush before the one that serves as your precarious hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot finding you, the giantess stops, moving her paws to the next bush...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, you throw the rock out of the bush with all the strength you could muster. Due to the darkness and the giantess' size, it goes completely unnoticed, but it is enough to produce a rustling sound when it lands across the vegetation behind Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess turns around, having heard the sound. She giggles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Comin'~</span>\" she chimes as she hovers away from your hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly once you hear no more sounds and assume the area is clear you dare to sigh in relief as you get out, starting to run again, intent to reach the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you make it to the cavern without Mesprit finding you. Panting, you get inside. At least, now you're safe from the lustful gaze of the pink headed giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, you had to wake Azelf up. Mesprit was still out there searching for you, and she wouldn't stop until she got her satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, you move deeper into the cave, soon coming across two sleeping giantesses. Uxie and... Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly move towards her, walking up to her face.<br>\r\n\"Azelf...\" you call out to the snoring giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf.\" you call, a little louder this time. The only response you achieve is an incomprehensible muttering from the blue giantess, before she resumes her snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf!\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess' eyes shot open as she woke up, hastily looking around.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Wha...?</span>\" she drowsily muttered as her gaze landed upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyelids relax a bit as they partially cover Azelf's eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You...</span>\" she quietly says, before yawning, hot air blowing from her mouth right into your small body, menacing to blow you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">What's the big deal...?</span>\" Azelf asks, annoyed because you rudely woke her up. You pay it no mind as you nervously fidget around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Mesprit!

You do trust me, right?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh again.<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" you mumble as the giantess starts moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hears a few cries coming from the forest and decides to follow them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Sis...</span>\" you hear her mumbling every now and then as she heads deep into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit still hadn't given up on finding her human. He was still hiding from her - she needed to find him soon, her desires were uncontrollable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie...? Come on out wherever you are! I need you!</span>\" she called lustfully, a fire burning within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess turned back and started floating away... right before she bumped into something moving. Something moving and solid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Ow!</b>\" both she and whoever she ran into cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess rubs her head, before opening her eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Watch where-</span>\" she notices Azelf rubbing her head too, before she opens her eyes as well, fixing them on Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Sis?</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Sis.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's gaze travels down to her sister's paw as she notices her holding something. And there, she spots the same one person she was searching for all along a - her human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pale, clinging to Azelf's paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou physically shake - the impact had almost thrown you off your precarious perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly looked at Mesprit, finding her smiling at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie! There you are!</span>\" she chimed while moving forward.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Now we can finally-</span>\" Azelf closed you in her fist and spun in place, avoiding Mesprit while making you dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Sis, what are you reduced to?</span>\" she asks in a lecturing tone.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You already forgot what he told you... us? You can't allow your heat to make you lose control! None of us can!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit huffed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm fine - just give him here and go back to sleep!</span>\" she responded, reaching out to snatch you from Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue giantess floated back.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Won't do that.</span>\" she stated defiantly while glaring at Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink headed guardian growled as she got ready to tackle her sister... before finding that she couldn't move. At all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Azelf...</span>\" she cried upon realizing that Azelf just stole her willpower. Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Sorry sis... it's to keep you from doing any harm to the human... or to Uxie's lake...</span>\" Azelf said, earning a glare from her unmoving sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit - please...\" you chimed in from your perch on Azelf's paw.<br>\r\n\"You're in a delicate state of mind now, you need to stop this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit huffed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I am fine! It's just this cursed heat - help me get rid of it!</span>\" she said you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You are not fine!\" you responded with exasperation as your eyed the giantess intently.<br>\r\n\"And you're frightening me... this is not the Mesprit I know... this is not the Mesprit I love...\" you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's eyes widened at the statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Aw, that's adorable!</span>\" Azelf chimed as she eyed you with a smile. You blushed, but looked over Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, a few eternal moments, she looks extremely dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe... your words had managed to have an effect on her?</span></div></div>",

And she looked pretty dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf and Mesprit slowly gazed at their yellow headed sibling, who yawned and rubbed her closed eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">What's the yelling about...? I was trying to sleep, y'know...</span>\" she said, not bothering to hide her annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf frowns.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Good. Keep doing that. Keep on sleeping while Mesprit rampages around your lake!</span>\" she says, eliciting a glare from the pink headed guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I did no such thing...</span>\" she retorts, desperately trying to move but also not wanting to actually move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the eyelids, Uxie's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Rampage...?</span>\" she drowsily asks, before remembering.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... Oh goodness...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nods with a serious gaze fixed on her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">The human came to me... told me that she was chasing him...</span>\" she made a motion for Mesprit, who would have shrugged if she could have moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sighs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Look... I simply... I needed help... I need help... I can't bear this...</span>\" she whines.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And sis - lemme go...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf shook her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Not until you're stable again.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as the two siblings started to quarrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you discover that you don't have much time to think about, because the ground suddenly recedes beneath your feet. You try to turn around, but you find that you're being held in place by a strong psychic force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough though, you land on something soft and the psychic grip fades, allowing you to turn around to see that you're standing on top of Uxie's paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess' visage is in front of you, an immense mass of yellow. Her eyes are dangerously close to you. One quick opening, and you'd forget everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, those eyes remain perfectly still, you note. Instead, Uxie's lips part as she speaks,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... I... am truly sorry... about what my sister attempted to do... please... forgive her...</span>\" she says dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... No problem... I'm fine anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">See? He's fine - I would never dream of harming my human! Sis, let me go!</span>\" Mesprit chimed as she glared at Azelf, who smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Nope. You're unstable... and can't really do anything about can you?</span>\" she said mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit growled... before she too got a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Azelf suddenly moved back, looking dazed. She blinked a few times.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">If I could still feel emotions, I would be angry.</span>\" she says in a neutral voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind you, Uxie sighed heavily.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Please stop being brainless idiots.</span>\" she said to her siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You're the one talking, smarty-pants.</span>\" Mesprit retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie sighed, and gently put you down on the ground before floating closer to her siblings.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">This is serious... we need a solution to this problem, and we need it now! So, you two stop fighting!</span>\" she said imperatively, turning her head to Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\"><i>You</i> give Azelf her emotions!</span>\" she hisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit bites her lip; Azelf, who was being quiet, suddenly perks up, able to feel emotions again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie turns her head to her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">And <i>you</i>... don't give Mesprit her willpower yet because her mind is still unstable.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">HEY!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie sat down, emulated by Azelf. The yellow headed titaness turned around to look at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Please... come over here...</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, and reluctantly walk up to the three sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie...</span>\" you hear Mesprit mumbling as you approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looked at Azelf.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Sis... lemme go... I want to hug him...</span>\" she told dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf smiled, and happily let go of her now calm sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit finds that she can move again and she looks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, the giantess bends to pick you up. You fight the urge to cower and let her pick you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word, Mesprit hugs you to her chest, her gigantic head resting against your upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm sorry... I tried... I couldn't control myself...</span>\" she apologizes. You blush, but hug back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Aw!</span>\" Azelf chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie was smiling, but then sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Look, it's all very touching, but we should really try to find a solution to our... \u2018heat problem\u2019...</span>\" she says, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... Right.</span>\" Mesprit says, sitting down as well, not letting go of you though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyello\">Human... when Mesprit went into heat... did you try talking to her?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou timidly nod.<br>\r\n\"Yes... but it... It didn't actually work this time... guess that means that you were right, Uxie...\" you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie nods, before looking at her siblings.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Think. Hard. We have to find a solution.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence falls among the four of you as the three sisters and you try to think of a solution... there ought to be one, a solution that might help these three giantesses...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou perk up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiantesses... they are dangerous, because they are giantesses... however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three grew yourself, right?\" you casually ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Yeah... why?</span>\" Azelf asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie perks up. She understood your kind of thinking.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... Because, the other way around, we could <i>shrink</i> ourselves so that we aren't dangerous anymore! </span>\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf and Mesprit react simultaneously,<br>\r\n\"<b>What?!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">We... We can't...</span>\" Mesprit says, looking at you intently. Giving up on her size would mean not being able to cuddle her precious little human anymore... and she enjoyed that. A lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf is reasoning on another line of thinking.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Sis, we need to be big... how are we going to protect the lakes if she shrink?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Like we always did before growing.</span>\" Uxie seemed firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... So that-</span>\" she made a nervous gesture for you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... can beat us up again? Ruin the lakes again?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">We'll be ready. It's the only way... like this, we are far more dangerous than humans are.</span>\" Uxie replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">B-But... what about us...?</span>\" Mesprit asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Me and you... I kinda like you comparatively tiny...</span>\" she awkwardly admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Sis, that's dumb.</span>\" Uxie tells. Mesprit huffs and hugs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... Unless... he could shrink with us...</span>\" Azelf ponders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pale.<br>\r\n\"But... that way, we'd be back to square one!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hmm...</span>\" Mesprit mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way out of this. And yet, this was the only solution...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither the three shrunk - with or without you - or remained big in order to protect their lakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three legendaries take a good while to think to themselves. Then, after an incalculable amount of time, Uxie suddenly picked you from Mesprit, placing you on the ground, before gripping her two siblings and pulling them closer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear them whispering. You listen, desperately trying to hear what they decided, but you can only make out single, senseless words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, much to your relief, the legendaries soon split up to make their decision clear to you.</span></div></div>",

Let's just do it.</span>\" Mesprit says, closing her eyes as the blush spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Mesprit was emulated by her sisters as a strong psychic force filled the area around Lake Acuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three start glowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few steps back, your eyes glued to the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, soon, the three legendary sisters start shrinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they reached the size of small hills. Then, they shrank to the height of trees. Then, they matched your height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, at last, they ultimately shrank to <i>one</i> foot tall, to the point where they didn't even reach your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch, shocked. Such giantesses were in reality that small?... It made sense, you guessed - they were all pixies after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit was the first one to open her eyes. She glanced around, noticing that it worked - she and her sisters weren't towering above the vegetation anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, her gaze landed on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile brightened her face as she flew over you. Even at such small size, Mesprit was still quite strong, you notice when a pink and blue blur tackles you to the ground. A pair of arms wrapped around your neck as you find the hyperactive pixie hugging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie! You're the giant now!</span>\" she said happily as she fidgeted on your motionless body, her head lovingly rubbing against yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh a bit... despite the fact that Mesprit is kinda choking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly sit upright, the pixie clinging to your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move a hand on her head as you pet her, eliciting a pleased moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf and Uxie get closer to you smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Ten years... we've been living with that size for ten years...</span>\" Azelf mumbles as she looks around, admiring her now huge surroundings. She was used to tower over things... seeing the world from this perspective again was quite weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You can't believe this all is happening, huh?</span>\" Uxie chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">This size's got some advantages~</span>\" Mesprit says, crawling up to your shoulder and pushing her head against your chin, not letting go of your neck though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled... before yawning.<br>\r\n\"So...?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"What now? Do we just go back in the cave... possibly catch some sleep?\" you ask, hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to you, Mesprit giggles mischievously... that giggle was something you learned to fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Not yet, I'm afraid... although you do have a point...</span>\" Azelf said, yawning.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Y'See, we shrunk... but we're not done yet...</span>\" Uxie giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the three, confused... before remembering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpblue\">Unless... he could shrink with us...</span></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color drains from your face.<br>\r\n\"No...

I mean, the lake is safe... but I wouldn't exactly be...\" you say with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh, sure you will, we'll make you small enough so that we can still see, hear - feel~ - you...come on!</span>\" Mesprit said, leaving you and joining her sisters in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh deeply before a psychic force surrounds you. You look down, noticing the ground getting closer as the legendaries drain your size with their psychic powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">A few inches... we need to be able to see and hear him...</span>\" Uxie mumbles to her sisters, who nod, careful to not overdo the shrinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrink, to the point where you're matching the height of the pixies, the even smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, blades of grass start towering above you. Just then, the shrinking comes to an end. You looked at yourself, noting that you couldn't be bigger than the tips of the sisters' tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you're picked up by a pair of large paws belonging to Mesprit, who smiled down at you, emulated by Uxie and Azelf.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And here's my cutie~</span>\" the pink headed pokemon chimed, pecking your cheek, making you blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And now that's settled...</span>\" Azelf said, one of her tails coiling around your torso.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Let's go back to sleep.</span>\" she chimed, floating away in direction of the cavern, dragging you along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hey!</span>\" Mesprit yelled as she and Uxie chased their blue sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly once the area was cleared, two pokemon came out of their hiding spot behind a few bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey quietly walked towards the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this...\" Lucario said with a smirk.<br>\r\n\"We're all safe... after all those years\u060c it's finally over...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaa...\" Vaporeon told with a dejected expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What do you mean, \u2018he isn't safe\u2019?... Are you talking about the human?\" Lucario asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaa-on...\" the blue pokemon says, nodding her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, they'll still lose control... but they can't harm us or the lake anymore...\" Lucario said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On...\" Vaporeon retorted, causing Lucario to sigh.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they can still harm he human... and? He chose that by himself... and, perhaps, they won't actually hurt him...\" he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaa!\" the blue quadruped cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... He can't take the risk...?\" Vaporeon nodded.<br>\r\n\"On! Vap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario looked at her intently after the last remark.<br>\r\n\"... How are we supposed to rescue him? You'd risk fighting three legendaries over a tiny human who consented... kind of?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaporeon!\" was Vaporeon's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if they're not giant, they could still crush us to paste! No no, count me out.\" Lucario said, starting to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon sighed.<br>\r\n\"Vaa...\" she mumbled dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I'm doing it somehow.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Wow... this place looks gigantic like this! Don't you agree?</span>\" Azelf asked you, her tail rising up to her smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep... especially from my point of view...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, your world shakes as you're gripped from behind and roughly pulled back by Mesprit, who hugs you while glaring daggers at Azelf, who snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looks at you with a much softer expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Bedtime, cutie~</span>\" she says sweetly as she laid down, emulated by her siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">This place looks so empty...</span>\" Uxie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">We'll have to get used to it... I mean, we've been big for ten years...</span>\" Mesprit said, her paws wrapping around your small form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, great, why did you shrink me as well?\" you casually ask, drawing the attention of the giantesses... to you anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf smiled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Because we're used to you being small... and also because that size makes you kinda cute.</span>\" she said, causing Mesprit to sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">...

Earlier tonight, there wouldn't have been much space to move around; now, this place was immense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the awakened pixie for a couple moments. She looked deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Azelf?\" you called, causing her gaze to fall on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, she smiled, happy to have someone to talk to, before she placed a paw over her mouth, silently telling you to be quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue giantess approached her sister whose body was your bedding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, Azelf moved Mesprit's paws out of the way and picked you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn perfect silence, she fluttered out of the cave with you in her grip. Moonlight showered you and her as she sat down, leaning back against the stone wall of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself being manipulated as Azelf turned you around in her grip, before you were pushed against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled back a bit and relaxed, looking up at the blue titaness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't sleep?\" you questioned sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I could ask you the same thing.</span>\" she replied with a bit of a smirk on her face,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Nightmares?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could ask you the same thing,\" you parroted back,<br>\r\n\"And no... you woke me up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... Sorry.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Why couldn't you sleep?\" you asked again. The pixie sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">There's... a bit too much in my mind.</span>\" she revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several moments, Azelf didn't respond, and gazed away from you. The paws resting on your back started petting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the giantess looked back at you. She was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I don't think you want to hear the boring musings of a guardian... just go back to sleep, I'm sure you're dying to catch some.</span>\" she bluntly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a bit too much in my head too, Azelf,\" you replied,<br>\r\n\"In case you haven't noticed, I'm, like, one inch tall. And I don't even know why.\" you lectured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue guardian giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You do. Mesprit told you why.</span>\" she recalled her sister's insistence on shrinking you too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't explain why you and Uxie agreed,\" you chimed.<br>\r\n\"Heck, you were the one suggesting this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I told you,</span>\" Azelf instantly responded,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">That size makes you kind of cute.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said that with a smile and a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm... there's a pokemon that seemingly likes me a lot sleeping in the cave behind you...\" you reminded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf titled her head, and your world shook as she adjusted her position on the hard ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... \u2018Seemingly\u2019?</span>\" she repeated,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">She nearly killed Uxie for you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't bring that up... it was so...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Scary?</span>\" Azelf finished, before giving off a sigh too,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Tell me about it - I've been with those two for my whole life, you have no idea of how much times I had to stop them before they did something the would have regretted.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and the giantess went quiet, and the paws holding you resumed petting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA peaceful silence fell between the two of you, like a barrier that separated you and Azelf from the rest of the world; a barrier that was only penetrated by the sound of the wind and your breathing mixed with Azelf's; a barrier that could be shattered at any moment with just the slightest word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after a while, Azelf finally broke the silence with a deep sigh. You, who had almost fallen asleep, sprang back to a very awake state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">It's... It's this all.</span>\" the giantess mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" you asked. Azelf sighed again as a light breeze blew past her and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Nevermind... you wouldn't understand.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to.\" you calmly reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">It's... I can't sleep because of this all,</span>\" the guardian admitted,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I mean, one hour ago I was incredibly big and now I'm one foot tall; I liked to think I was more calm than those two in there-</span>\" she made a motion for the cave behind her,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... And I lost control - sorry about that...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved a hand dismissively, showing that you didn't hold any hard feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And then there's this stupid heat, it's slowly killing me from the inside!</span>\" she yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh!\" you hastily placed a hand over your mouth to avoid Azelf waking one - or worse, both - of her sisters waking up, noticing you and her talking about such subject alone, late at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... But you're normal again now, no? Can't you... I dunno, find a real mate?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue guardian sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">See? You don't understand. No one does...</span>\" she sourly said, looking down for a moment.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">My sisters and I, we're all legendaries. You humans want to capture us, thinking that our power is a blessing...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't.\" you justified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... You're all are wrong. It's a curse.</span>\" Azelf stated, her paws gripping you a bit more tightly in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">We use our power to protect the lakes and the pokemon, but what comes of it? No one wants to have nothing to do with you. They're all scared, even when we're not big. And when someone finally finds the guts to even talk to us... they run off after the first time.</span>\" she bitterly revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" you said, blushing, while feeling sorry for the blue pokemon. You recalled that Azelf was the only sister you didn't help though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great giantess loosened her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">That's right... it sucks to be a legendary. You can ask anyone.</span>\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, silence fell between you and her, but it wasn't the same pleasing silence of before, no, it was an awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Azelf perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Human.</span>\" she said,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You helped my sisters... why weren't you afraid?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question took you aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" you started, feeling embarrassed,<br>\r\n\"I was at first but... I mean, Mesprit basically forced me, but then I willingly helped Uxie and then... I helped Mesprit willingly too, before I was told what I told you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nodded, but she seemed a bit off. She was staring at you intently, and was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... D'you think... could you help me too?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the pixie, wondering why you didn't understand where this was going sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf... we can't... remember what happened before?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Sure I do... but back then, the risk was me going on a rampage around the lake, no? Can I do it now?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a point, yet you didn't feel comfortable with the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What about me? It could still kill me, y'know...\" you mused, gulping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh, hush, I'll be gentle.</span>\" she reassured, before her smile faded, replaced by a pleading expression.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Please... I need you...</span>\" she begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huffed, sick of all these giantesses seeking only one thing from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Azelf had a point... what could you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'll help you,\" you said, deciding that her point was valid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess smiled; your world shook as she suddenly got up and started fluttering away from the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, she floated to the lake and sat by the water, releasing you from her grip. Soon, you found yourself being shoved down her body by her paw. You didn't oppose as you were pushed past Azelf's belly and right before her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed heavily: from your perspective, it looked like an endless abyss of pink flesh. If Mesprit caught you like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Whenever you're ready...</span>\" Azelf's voice came like a sultry wind. You looked back at her: she was blushing too, eyeing you expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and turned back, noting that you were definitely smaller than her vagina. To be smaller than such thing... you weren't sure if it was humiliating or exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of ideas, you decided to start by rubbing it: you placed both your hands onto the vagina, feeling the hot flesh pulsing under your palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started rubbing slowly, your hands gently sliding on the soft, pink spot on the endless sea of blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegarding that you did this with Azelf's siblings already, you expected her to start moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, she produced no sound. Maybe she was more quiet than her sisters?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fingers gripped the flesh as you decided to scratch the giant sex, but that as well seemed to have no effect at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou even put your mouth on it, biting gently and licking softly, but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Azelf...\" you said, turning around: the giantess was staring at you with a blush, but with a definitely disappointed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you... isn't it working?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Want a honest answer?</span>\" she replied as she uncomfortably looked down, her finger-tips clasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth gaped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Yeah... I don't know why, but I'm not feeling anything of what you're doing... I think you're too small. You could pleasure us before because you had your full size, but now...</span>\" she sounded sexually frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">B-But, i-it's me too... y'see, you forget how it feels like when your last experience is, like, a year ago,</span>\" she quickly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you DID have a partner...\" you chimed. Azelf blushed, though it wasn't embarrassment: it was shame.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Um... yeah. He didn't agree at first, but he... changed his mind.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went silent. You remembered that, as a giantess, Azelf used her powers to \u2018get to know better\u2019 her partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie looked up, giving you a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">But, don't worry. I appreciate the effort...</span>\" she said, consolatory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The effort ain't gonna help you, Azelf...\" you sourly said, looking down at the large pair of vertical lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flesh pulsed quietly beneath your feet, almost as if inviting you to get to work. But what could you do...? You were as big as Azelf's paw alone! Her paw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you masturbate?\" you suddenly blurted out, causing the giantess to flush bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">W-Wha...?</span>\" she mumbled, before looking at you dejectedly,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You were supposed to help me... are you quitting already?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, it finally became clear, what you had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I'm gonna help indeed,\" you said, climbing up onto Azelf's stomach, where both her paws were resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't waste any time as you sat down on the back of her paw, smiling up at the giantess, who suddenly comprehended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paw you were sitting on left her belly as it traveled up to Azelf's blushing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">A-Are you sure?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Go ahead.\" you said, grinning confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf smiled a little and nodded, before her paw started to descend. It traveled past its previous perch as it reached the place where you were before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you were plunged into a dark, tight and wet place as Azelf's entire paw sank into the squishy depths of her insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, a sharp moan resonated through the fleshy walls, making you cling to the paw as your whole body was coated in thick slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world traveled forward and backward , Azelf's fingers rubbed her the vaginal walls, causing a wave of pleasure to spread throughout her body, making her shake like she was being hit by an electric shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe constant moving of the paw made it hard for you to hang on, but it wasn't your intention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly let go of the large paw, landing on the slick, fleshy floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh!</span>\" she moaned. You were quite sure that she was blushing wildly. A sudden quake shook the hot cavern, and you suddenly discovered that you were standing on a vertical floor; the giantess must have fallen onto her back, you deduced as you fell down, deeper into Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large paw above kept rubbing, while you landed onto the very edge of the vagina, onto the hole that led to Azelf's womb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got back on your feet and started doing the exact same thing you did with both Mesprit and Uxie: wiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began moving back and forth into the slick cave, which grew wetter and wetter by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands slid onto the dark pink wall, you started massaging, then pummeling, doing everything in your power to satisfy the giantess for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">K-Kee-Keep go-go-going!</span>\" she screamed,her voice booming inside of her as your whole world - and hers too - kept shaking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Azelf was feeling ecstatic: her tails were swinging, her heart was pounding her chest, her crotch was pulsing and her mind racing; her nethers dripping, her legs flailing, her free paw gripping the ground she was laying on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white wave erupted around you, overwhelming you as you were dragged along your fleshy surroundings and eventually ejected from the body of the blue guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body made a short flight as it was invested with the cold air of the night, before you were caught in mid-air by psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hovered above the place you were just thrown out of, cum still dripping from Azelf's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the blue pokemon, she panted for quite a while, before she finally raised her head to look at you: her cheeks were completely red, her eyes glazed with lust, her tongue hanging from her mouth; her tails fidgeted weakly, her arms rested on top of her rising-'n'-falling chest, her breath was irregular. You swore you could hear her heart beating like a drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but smirk, proud of your work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Satisfied now?\" </span></div></div>",

As your lungs were filled with the sickeningly sweet scent, you sped up, rubbing the walls with more energy while starting to walk, your hands sliding up and down the hot flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll while Azelf kept masturbating feverishly, shouting as her body was shook by pleasure, rocking your world. More than just once, you fell in your behind and had to get up in order to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly wondered what would have happened if Mesprit ever found out about this: she'd be angry for sure, would she try to kill Azelf as well? That'd be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour musings were brutally interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vaginal walls suddenly clenched and collided, squeezing you in the middle of a crushing hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot flesh was squeezing pretty hard, causing you pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf! Slow down!\" you shouted, now openly afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour call went totally unheard, Azelf was far too lost in her perverted game to notice your voice. But you heard her loud and clear,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">H-Human!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls <i>kissed</i>, and a searing pain spread throughout your whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHH!\" you cried as the two fleshy walls kept squeezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world was rocked once more as Azelf finally came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour surroundings shook, you felt something approaching... and then, the walls squeezed harder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely registered one last, extremely strong wave of pain, a sticky liquid overwhelming you, the sound of something snapping and the pressure loosening as you traveled towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonlight showered you, but you were rapidly losing consciousness, which was squeezed from your mind by the crushing sex of Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were already unconscious when a white river came out of the blue guardian, carrying your tiny body out of the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, she caught you with psychic as she sat upright, blushing furiously, panting heavily but smiling brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I-It w-was fantastic!</span>\" she chimed, breaking the quiet of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Thank you!</span>\" Azelf tried again, unaware of your current predicament. To be honest, you were too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Human?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was lifted up to Azelf's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich immediately contorted into a look of horror as the giantess felt all the air leaving her lungs and her mouth in the form of a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Human!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes opened slowly, your vision blurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh, thank goodness!</span>\" someone shouted. You felt extremely weak, you couldn't even rub your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no need though, your vision cleared quite rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of you, an extremely worried-looking Azelf, glancing at you nervously. It was still nighttime, and you were sitting in the palm of the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Are you... feeling fine?</span>\" she asked, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smacked your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit sore... you squeezed me pretty hard.\" you replied in a whisper, before taking notice that the left side of you was hurting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Also, I don't feel my arm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf looked horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">That's... understandable...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shot open as the words of Lucario echoed inside your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" you looked to your side.<br>\r\n\"GOD!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach was hit by an invisible fist, which made the air leave you: your left arm was twisted in a horrible way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to move it; nothing happened, except from a wave of pain immediately assaulting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn desperation, you looked back at Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL?!\" you screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe psychic-type was breathing fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Okay, calm down...</span>\" she mumbled under her breath, but loud enough for you to hear,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down?! My arm is broken!\" you shouted, physically shaking with anger and fear.<br>\r\n\"I knew this was a bad idea, why did I agree?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">If it makes you feel any better, it felt wonderful.</span>\" Azelf chimed, smiling for the briefest moment, before mentally scolding herself. Did she really bring that up while you were suffering?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, that's totally going to fix my arm Azelf!\" you sarcastically replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I know, I know...</span>\" Azelf muttered dejectedly as you kept screaming incoherently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could she do now? Mesprit was going to murder her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Please don't scream... I need to focus, I-I'll figure out a way to fix you...</span>\" Azelf continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as she asked and quieted down, looking at her palm intently. You remembered about Lucario and Vaporeon: they told you something like this would have happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt exhausted, sick. Luckily, your arm didn't hurt too much, unless you tried to move it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back up at the sorrowful golden eyes of the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please...\" you begged, your whole being shook by fear as you collapsed on your knees, white as death, which, you were sure, was going to claim you if Azelf didn't think of something real smart real quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to conceive any other way to comfort you, Azelf started caressing you with her free paw, while her mind raced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she wished she had at least one healing skill. Sadly, her moveset was composed mainly of attacks...<br>\r\nUxie's was composed of defenses...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf knew for sure her sister knew Healing Wish. That would fix the problem... and would more importantly fix the human's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess hesitated. But if Mesprit found out about what happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf shook her head - healing the human was a priority, she couldn't think about these things, not right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, Healing Wish had a side effect and would have Mesprit knocked out for several hours...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Are you gonna do something or not?!\" you impatiently broke the silence, waving your unbroken arm in the air to her the giantess' attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to perk up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Yeah...</span>\" she said,</span></div></div>",

Then, you look again, managing to make out the silhouette of a familiar Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You again...?\" you whisper, remembering that you're currently being held by a sleeping Mesprit. If she woke up, things would end bad... like REALLY bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vaporeon in front of you slowly nods her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What do you want...? In the dead of night...?\" you drowsily ask as you yawn, trying to sit upright on Mesprit's chest... only to find her paws keeping you perfectly still. The only thing you could do was raise your head to look at the now giant blue pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quadruped pokemon looked at you, before her left paw raised as she pointed to you, then to herself, before her paw ultimately fell in direction of the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink at few times, your brain trying to process what she just said... or tried to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You... You want me to come with you...?\" you ask, trying to lift Mesprit's paws a bit... but failing poorly in doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon nodded as her muzzle leaned closer, her mouth opening as she got a grip your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait...!\" you exclaim, before looking back at Mesprit, who luckily remains asleep.<br>\r\n\"I don't know if you noticed, but I'm kinda the size of a bug and unable to move...\" you say, causing the Vaporeon to release your feet and look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, before your world shook as the titaness you're resting on tumbles over her side, her grip loosening slightly... nonetheless, Mesprit held you quite tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, too many things were happening too fast for you to process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, the sisters are titanesses that threaten to kill you and destroy the lake while in heat, then Uxie erases your memories, then the legendaries shrink down, only to shrink you too to a few inches...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Seriously, just tell me what you want and let me return to sleep... please...\" you tell Vaporeon, who moves in between Azelf and Mesprit to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeen like this, the legendary sisters looked so innocent... no one could ever guess what they've done in the past... and, still, they had enough power to wipe away the entire lake if they just wanted to, let alone a tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he had to do was wait for the next time they went into heat - they would \u2018insert\u2019 him, only for him to came out as a crushed corpse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon couldn't allow that - the human had willingly helped Uxie when she told him about the pokemon that crawled inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe earned her trust, and she wanted to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vap...\" the water type said, making you stare at her perplexed.<br>\r\n\"Uh... can't understand ya...\" you say, obviously unable to understand Vaporeon and far too tired to want to decipher what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quadruped pokemon pointed at the three sisters, before her gaze fell on you and she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Uh... I mustn't... I mustn't stay with Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie...? Is that what you're saying?\" you ask, causing the Vaporeon to nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly look back at the three sleeping sisters... they had solved their problem by shrinking themselves, what else could Vaporeon want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why? I think that their heat won't cause anymore trouble...\" you say, before yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon nodded... before pointing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn annoyed groan echoed in the cave as Azelf started to fidget in her sleep, before her eyes suddenly open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue giantess turns her head to glance at you. She blinks a few times.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Keep it down...</span>\" she murmurs as she rolls over her side and resumes snoring, apparently not having noticed Vaporeon, who sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the water type points at you, then to the legendaries, then to you again, before... her face became red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you finally understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You're trying to say that these three aren't a threat to the lake or you inhabitants anymore, but they're still a threat to ME?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters shrunk down to their original sizes... but shrunk you too, and you were currently the size of an ant to them. They could still hurt you really bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake of the thought... they would never do something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look... I can't come with you, Vaporeon... despite what it looks like, these three are harmless! They would never hurt me... on purpose...\" you frankly say.<br>\r\n\"And plus, I'm a bug right now. If I leave them, who'd take care of me? I can't exactly do on my own right now...\" you add, bitterly thinking that, if you leave, you wouldn't even make it out of the lake alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, Vaporeon smiled, her tail rising and wagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You'd do it?\" you ask, and she nodded, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed too as you thought to yourself. The perspective was just crazy! You couldn't leave the three sisters... or could you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon was half right, they could still hurt you, possibly kill you... but you were (almost) sure that they won't... still, they could...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as you thought long and hard, before making your choice, which you communicate to Vaporeon...</span></div></div>",

And your feet, which were left out of Mesprit's hug, were plunged into a wet place as Vaporeon snatches them in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the water type starts pulling gently.<br>\r\n\"Hey... stop that...\" you say as your urgently realize that she's pulling you our of Mesprit's embrace. The arms of the giantess offer a feeble resistance as she tries to keep her grip on you in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon looked terrorized as the pixie started fidgeting. You thought that this would have gotten Vaporeon to stop... but instead, she starts pulling with even greater strength. For a moment, you feel yourself being dragged across the body of the giantess holding you and then... your body hangs upside down from the lips of the gigantic water type, who glances at Mesprit worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your absence in her sleep, Mesprit starts flailing her arms in an attempt to find you on her, while Vaporeon turns around and starts to walk away in a hasty fashion. Dangling from the lips of the quadruped pokemon, you shoot Mesprit one last glance as her arms finally relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's fallen back asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Lemme go!\" you cry as the Vaporeon exits the cave the sisters sleep in, you hanging from her lips. Knowing the type, you were sure she wasn't going to hurt you... but you weren't quite sure of what would have happened if you tried to flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess gives no response as she simply keeps walking towards an unknown destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm talking to you! Let me go!... I'm feeling sick...\" you say as you swing back and forth, feeling nauseous. This was definitely NOT the best way to travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, your brain registers these as secondary facts due the more important nature of your current problem: you were kidnapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, Vaporeon mercifully stops around Lake Acuity and lowers her head as she gently lets you down on the grass. Her giant blue eyes were placed right in front of yours as she looked at you up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that Vaporeon wasn't going to hurt you; she was trying to rescue you from the legendaries, and you appreciated the gesture... but you can't deny how such usually adorable pokemon looked absolutely terrifying from your perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you were, at the mercy of a giant pokemon who you barely knew... sure, maybe you had known her better on the past, but you forgot about her after Uxie erased your memories, so you couldn't possibly entrust your life in the paws of this giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Will you explain, please, why you did that?\" you finally break the silence as you sit upright while Vaporeon raises her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vap.\" she responded, her voice menacing to break both your eardrums. That only contributed to give you an accurate idea of how small and helpless you really were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't understand ya...\" you remind her as she gives a disappointed sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaporeon...\" she said, wearing a confused look upon her face. That look made quite the statement, \u2018I've already told you.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff as you cross your legs.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I get it - you wanted to save me,\" you say, pausing to inhale deeply.<br>\r\n\"Thing is: there was no need to. I am safe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, was this going to be your life now? Carried around like a doll, giving off awkward explanation? If Mesprit woke up without finding you, she'd do nothing but freak out and search for you... until she found you with another girl pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Then</i> you would have to give one heck of an explanation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at Vaporeon, noticing her staring down at you. The water type gently shook her head. You sigh, trying to recall the last statement you made before getting carried by your train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm not safe?\" you say, finally managing to remember what you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the blue giantess nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Where's Lucario?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess sighed as she shook her head.<br>\r\n\"He's not here?\" you inquired, and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaa-on...\" she said with a somewhat indignant expression. You blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... He didn't want to come with you?\" you guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Vaporeon nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why did you come alone?... Why did you take me away?\" you inquired again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water type smiled... and you soon found her huge blue head lowering on your whole being, her slick cheek nuzzling you into the hard ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled a little.<br>\r\n\"Guess you must really like me, huh?\" she gave an happy cry in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n\"Look. I understand that you want to protect me, and I'm grateful for it. But, seriously, the legendaries aren't going to hurt me, I'm sure.\" you say, trying to convince Vaporeon. It'd be easy, you figure, you've got pretty valid arguments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon remained silent as she slowly raised her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, for starters, what if I needed my size back? We would have to go to them again, no? And I don't think they'd be pleased to see me with you...\" you say, desperately hoping she'd reason with your first attempt. Unfortunately, Vaporeon merely tilted her head, signaling you to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Okay, two, I don't think I'd be safe with you either... It think that most of your friends there...\" you pointed to the forest.<br>\r\n\"... would like to have me as a snack... or for...\" you paused to blush.<br>\r\n\"... For... ehm... 'other purposes'... just see what happened with Uxie...\" you recall, and the blue quadruped blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. It was full of wild pokemon out there... well, that wasn't totally accurate. It was full of wild, <i>horny</i>, <i>hungry</i> pokemon... meaning that the human risked being eaten... in more than just one way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Vaporeon shook her head and offered a determined smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd protect me, huh?\" you say as you awkwardly scratch your head... before you got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say... would you protect me from Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie too?\" you asked, causing Vaporeon to look down at you confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep... when those three wake up and find me missing, don't you think they'll just... I dunno... search around the lake to find me? What if they find you? What would you do then?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis fully got the pokemon's attention. Now she looked doubtful, she knew you were right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would she face the wrath of the legendary guardians...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue titan looked back down at you, offering a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" you asked.</span></div></div>",

No no no, bad, bad idea... those three will kill when they find you!\" you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gigantic blue pokemon wanted to keep you with her, protect you... but she couldn't protect you against three legendaries, one of which had deep feelings for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon stared at you, a sly smile appearing on her face,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Vap...</span>\" she chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed the back of your head, uncomfortable.<br>\r\n\"They won't find ya, huh?\" you asked, and she nodded, suggesting that what you said was exactly what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, wondering how you ended in such predicament... why didn't Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie shrink you after shrinking themselves? Why did this Vaporeon want to \u2018rescue\u2019 you from them? They weren't a danger anymore, no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll your thoughts were interrupted as you noted the Vaporeon's large head coming down again, mouth wide open, her dark, fleshy insides exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even think of something to say, she had bitten the back of your shirt and lifted you far up in the air as her head rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, your body shook as each step Vaporeon took made her slender body vibrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, before your hazy mind was assaulted with more important preoccupations, you wondered where she was headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, the many water-types Lake Acuity housed lived in the lake... but with a human \u2018guest\u2019, Vaporeon necessarily had to find someplace else for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hard task since she only knew two places in the forest, both of them out of the question; one was the cavern where the three sisters currently slept, the other was the cave that served Lucario as a den... and he made it clear that he didn't approve the idea of helping the human. If she asked him, she was sure that he was going to throw her out because he didn't want to have anything to do with the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon finally stopped, her gaze falling upon the small entrance of a cave she never saw before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Vaa...</span>\" came from the corner of the water-type pokemon, assaulting your poor ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered slightly as the giantess started walking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon carefully made her way inside the cavern and found that there wasn't no one inside... aside from a few Zubat that were hanging upside down from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, trying to shake off the horrible image of one of those pokemon, whose faces were entirely occupied by the large fang-filled mouth, feasting on your blood before swallowing your now extremely small body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mental image made you shiver, but Vaporeon didn't seem to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she appeared to be... blushing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Vap...</span>\" she said you, gently lowering her head until your feet touched the ground again. Only then you noticed that she was flushing red, but smiling reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you're in heat too, aren't y-\" the blue pokemon started to shake her head frenetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she started to move in circles around you, her body and elongated tail coiled around your whole being, trapping you as the giantess laid down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was in front of you, you noted by her gigantic blue eyes that were fixed on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">On...</span>\" Vaporeon said happily, giving you a few playful licks, causing you to wonder whether you should laugh or sigh in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, your choice fell on the second option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" you said dejectedly.<br>\r\n\"They're going to find us... the legendaries I mean... bring me back to the cave, or they'll harm you...\" you repeated, wanting to get out of this situation - and wanting to avoid this kind pokemon getting hurt, but mostly because you wanted to get out of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the water-type simply smiled again, determined, before closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head fell on a side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, Vaporeon was asleep, you could judge by her breath slowing down. It was an almost imperceptible sound, but your shrunken ears could catch even the most inaudible sound now... even the occasional, frightening cry from the Zubat above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, realization hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Vaporeon fell asleep... you'd have a chance to flee, get back to the three legendary siblings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, your brain discarded the idea - you wouldn't last long in this state out in the middle of a forest... and you were sure, whenever Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie woke up in the morning and noticed you missing, they'd hunt you down... especially Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink-headed guardian was probably going to crush Vaporeon for technically kidnapping you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the idea of getting free and running away penetrated your thoughts, tempting you... you'd be back with the sisters and Vaporeon would be unharmed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, your mind had some problems getting rid of the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too dangerous, you told yourself, you couldn't possibly risk your life like that. Sticking with this Vaporeon was your only chance now... she wasn't even asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... But still, the idea lingered in your mind.</span></div></div>",

I managed to run...\" you say shakily, and Uxie nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud groan emitted from behind you and echoed inside the cavern, sending shivers down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit was recovering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink headed giantess placed her hands on the damaged stone wall and pulled back, rubbing her head while glaring at Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You... YOU...!</span>\" she cried, angered, as she flew towards Uxie with a murderous glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the pixie intercepted her attack with her paws and roughly slammed Mesprit into another wall of the cave, which shook again at the impact... seriously, this place was going to be destroyed by the two titans if they didn't stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Uxie held a struggling Mesprit against the wall and leaned in closer.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'm warning you, Mesprit. Stop this, or I'll knock sense into you.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit snarled in response as she freed one of her arms from Uxie's grip; Mesprit's paw lingered in midair for a moment, before slamming into Uxie's head as her sibling slapped her across the face, the slap resounding inside the dark cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie cried in pain as she pulled back, freeing Mesprit. She placed a paw on the cheek Mesprit had slapped... before she snarled, her eyelids suddenly parting as she gave Mesprit a death glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurried to cover your eyes, while Azelf meekly closed hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, an explosion roared inside the cave, then the sound of rocks hitting the ground and distant, angry cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't need to watch two guess what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes slowly open as you look to the side, wearing a terrified look: one side of the cave was completely destroyed, rocks falling from a large hole that was caused from the impact of the two giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly walk over the hole, noticing the two siblings fighting on the ground, Mesprit on top of Uxie as they repeatedly hit each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two remained locked, Uxie rolled on top of Mesprit and hovered in the air, trying to punch her opponent, who dodged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie's arm hit the ground... you swore you felt it shaking beneath your feet even at such distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit grabbed Uxie's arm, and threw her. The yellow headed pixie was sent flying into the forest, many pokemon evacuating it in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Mesprit flew towards her sibling... before they completely disappeared from your sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there, dumbfounded... they were going to destroy the lake if they kept this up! The inhabitants feared the sisters' heat, but this was much worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God...\" you whispered, dreading the catastrophic consequences that this insensate fight will bring to the lake, to the life around it and possibly to the whole Sinnoh region...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hey...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around, Azelf was staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly walk over her, noting that she was still wearing an emotionless look upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Your sisters are going to kill each other, aren't you going to do something?\" you say as calmly as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf looked at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I don't care... I mean, I can't care... Mesprit stole my emotions... God this is so weird, it's horrible and I can't feel bad about it...</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. They're going to annihilate the lake. Just great.\" you said, feeling sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I... I can't do anything... But you... It's up to you to stop them...</span>\" the giantess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou perk up. How was she expecting you to do that?!<br>\r\n\"M-Me?! How can I stop them?!\" you cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf looked at the ceiling.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I'm sure you'll come up with something... hurry...</span>\" she quietly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to explain how you are just a bit bigger than a ant to them, when a loud scream assaults your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap...\" you mumble to yourself as you turn around and start running.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Be careful...</span>\" you heard Azelf say as you exited from the giant hole Uxie and Mesprit made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around, picking up the screams of the two siblings and you ran in the direction they came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes are greeted with a terrifying... yet pitiful sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit and Uxie, covered in bruises and scratches while they kept fighting around the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around, finding many pokemon staring at the fighting sisters in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze returns to the Mesprit and Uxie; the second was on the ground, but suddenly sat up, grabbing Mesprit's head with both paws and slamming her face into the ground repeatedly, Mesprit growling in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had seen enough, you decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs seem to move on their own as you run up to the two as they grab each other again, starting to roll again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!\" you shout as Uxie was about to roll on top of Mesprit... and Mesprit was about to roll on top of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth sisters' eyes widened as they heard your voice, but it was too late...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes waiting for the giantesses to roll on you, reducing you to a flattened mess on the ground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie move!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes, noticing Uxie and Mesprit holding each other in place with their psychic powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Move!... Quick!</span>\" Uxie repeated, struggling to hold Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, thanking whatever higher saved you as you silently walked back, putting a good distance between you and the two sisters, who finally let each other go and fall on the ground, causing it to shake from the doubled weight due Uxie being on top of Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow headed giantess raised her head and looked around her lake... she felt sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmashed trees, destroyed vegetation, terrorized pokemon... the human almost killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie looked at Mesprit... who avoided her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">WHAT HAVE WE DONE?!</span>\" Uxie shouted, her eyes closing. Her head slid on Mesprit's chest as she started crying loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looked at her, before her head turned as she looked back at the startled you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit too felt tears welling in her eyes... she had almost killed her precious little human... and Lake Acuity, but more importantly her little human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm... I'm... I'm s-sorry!</span>\" she stuttered, looking away as she too started crying, her lament becoming one with Uxie's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm...\" you say, relieved that they finally stop fighting... but frankly quite confused about how this ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really thought they were going to start fighting again after you were safe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the two crying sisters and ponder your next move.</span></div></div>",

You couldn't risk getting too close to comfort them - one tear was enough to drown you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd trying to comfort them from a... safety distance seemed quite stupid...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou casually look back at the forest, noting that the pokemon that were watching before were all gone... probably back into the forest or lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit and Uxie were done fighting each other, so there wasn't no more danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario and Vaporeon warned you about their heat, but you never actually considered the chance of the titanesses trying to hurt each other. Sure, they had tried in the past, but Azelf had stopped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, without Azelf's intervention, Mesprit and Uxie went wild... and destroyed a good percentage of the lake, scared the hell out of its inhabitants and almost killed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as your gaze returns to the two giantesses, who were still crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to do something, you had to try to comfort them somehow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs seem to move on their own as you take a step, then another, and another as you slowly make your way to the crying pixies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop by the giant body of Mesprit and place a hand on her giant hip, slowly rubbing the smooth surface in an attempt to both get her attention and comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your touch, Mesprit opens her eyes to look down at you... you are assaulted by a strong fit of sadness: her eyes were completely red, tears running down her cheeks as she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's lament was lessened as she moved her massive paw in your direction and grabbed you. You find yourself getting lifted high in the air, before Mesprit unceremoniously pushed Uxie off her chest to hug you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow headed giantess sat upright, tears running past her closed eyelids and her mouth repeatedly letting out sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">H-Human...</span>\" she managed to stammer, before grabbing her face in her paws, caught in another fit of regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit too sat up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... We-We're sorry...</span>\" she said, remorseful, your sadness and pity making her cry harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I know.\" you simply respond, hugging Mesprit back the best you could and smiling bitterly.<br>\r\n\"But... stop crying, please... you're guardians, don't cry in front of others.\" you tell, even though there was no one but you and the two siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though their tears, Uxie and Mesprit blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">H-H-How can we call ourselves guardians? W-We are dangerous t-to our lakes... to everyone a-and e-everything...</span>\" Uxie stutters as she sniffles, once again observing the catastrophic results that the fight caused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">...

Her paw darted forward, snatched you from Mesprit's grasp and gently lowered to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf moved closer to her pink headed sister.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">How many lives out there are gone? Just because you couldn't control yourself?</span>\" she asked, pointing to the destroyed part of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Ehm...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">The pokemon are all fine... Startled, but unharmed.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the eyes shifted on Uxie, who entered the cave through the hole and sighed dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">The lake though... there's at least 23% of damage...</span>\" she said, before looking at the hole.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... 23.2%...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf stares at two, paws on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie and Mesprit looked away in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">This is all your fault.</span>\" Azelf said calmly, looking at Mesprit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You let your heat make you lose control!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looked back at her blue sibling.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... Mine?

We can't be helped - we lose control you idiot!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit glared at Uxie, who gritted her teeth... before Azelf floated in between them and separated them.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">If we all start fighting, this lake is doomed.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You're right.</span>\" she said, and the three legendaries quieted down to look at the floor intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at them for a few moments, before breaking the silence,<br>\r\n\"... So? What are we going to do now?\" you asked, causing their gazes to shift on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie shook her head and turned to her sisters.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You two... go back to your lakes... I'm already dangerous enough to mine, and I need to restore Lake Acuity now.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf quietly nodded, and so did Mesprit... but you're left confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What about me?\" you ask, again drawing attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looked at you confused.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What do you mean? You're coming home with me...</span>\" she responded, before narrowing her eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Why are you... afraid?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I dunno... because you chased him down, stole my emotions in front of him, almost destroyed a lake while you were out of control?</span>\" Azelf remarked sarcastically, and Mesprit sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Thanks for sugarcoating it sis...</span>\" she said, before looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... So? Don't you want to come along?</span>\" she asked, seemingly depressed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... I can't be helped. I can't call myself a guardian. You're literally the last thing of my life...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Though I understand if you don't want to come... but - hey, are you planning to leave again?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What - no!\" you respond, rubbing your head to try and rid it from a lingering pain.<br>\r\n\"No no... Mesprit I'd really love to come, but... I'm not sure...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Thinking about it, I could really use a hand in restoring the lake...</span>\" Uxie chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf adopted a small smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hey, I got it!</span>\" she said, looking down at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Why don't you simply choose with which of us you want to stay? He can come with you, Mesprit, or with me, or remain here with Uxie, and we could see you anytime! It's perfect!</span>\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" you replied, think about it... it was actually a good idea. You wouldn't be forced to leave, and you can choose which sister you were going to stay with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Well... It's admittedly a good idea... Although I still want you to come with me. </span>\" Mesprit said, gently picking you up and holding you close to her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Let him choose Mesprit.</span>\" Uxie said as she and Azelf got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quiet down as you try to choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie... the shy, sweet Uxie... who had the power of erasing memories. If she went into heat again, she could do anything to you and simply make you forget it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit... the sweet Mesprit that loves you... and is the most wild of all three...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf... calm, rational, responsible... with the power of stealing willpower...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh.<br>\r\n\"I'll stay with...\"</span></div></div>",

Your perch shook, Mesprit had almost let go of you, but managed to keep her paws cupped under your body. You regained your balance and glanced at the legendaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three siblings were staring at you, shocked. Uxie and Azelf knew what their sister had tried to do to you. Mesprit knew as well, and was ashamed of herself for letting her heat control her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, the same Mesprit felt shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer precious little human was giving her a second chance...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her, feeling conflicted. On one side, she had just attempted to have you against your will; on the other, she was out of control and she was now half-depressed. Something told you that you had to stay close to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie...</span>\" she murmured softly. Slowly, her paws started to retreat, you along with them as Mesprit pulled you in a gentle hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">A-Are you sure about this...?</span>\" Azelf suddenly asked as her sister moved forward and made a 180 degree turn, facing both her and Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... What do you mean sis?</span>\" Mesprit asked glumly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Mesprit, you're a wild card.</span>\" Uxie bluntly chimed in, mentally bracing herself for Mesprit's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink-headed sister frowned.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Why, aren't you? Just look at you lake...</span>\" she retorted.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">That was entirely <i>your</i> fault! I should throw you out!</span>\" Uxie hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giantesses started growling at each other, and you felt a strong fear rising at the perspective of the imminent fight... that never came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf suddenly flew in between the two, arm spread as she held both her siblings back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Quit it.</span>\" she sternly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit flew back, sensing your fear. She looked at you dejectedly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... Sorry, sorry. Here, let me fix you...</span>\" she offered as your fear was suddenly replaced by a sense of calm, which was quite odd given the circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Thanks.\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess smiled, before looking back at her siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf was floating forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Come on sis... the human made his choice, so let's leave.</span>\" she said. Mesprit nodded as the two giantesses floated to the exit of the cavern, Uxie following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still nighttime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Bye sis.</b>\" both Azelf and Mesprit said at unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Uxie...\" you timidly chimed, earning a smile from the yellow-headed pixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf and Mesprit flew upwards, to the point where they were flying above the whole Lake Acuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giantesses looked at each other, before one of Mesprit's paws left you to close around Azelf's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">See you sis,</span>\" the blue pixie said, before looking at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And you... be careful. Both of you - I'm talking to you Mesprit.</span>\" she bluntly, receiving an indignant expression from her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the two started to fly in opposite directions, Uxie watching them from below, before looking forward and sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Need to restore the lake...</span>\" she muttered dutifully, before starting to float in direction of her lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Uxie left too, two pokemon came out, looking up and watching as Mesprit and Azelf left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would be noticeable in the sky for quite a while more given how big they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">And so... it happened... those two went on a rampage again...</span>\" Lucario said, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Yeah but... two of them left now, no?

She was smiling, you noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie... thank you... I knew you would have never left me...</span>\" she said, genuinely glad that you opted to stay with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... Look, I-I... I'm sorry for earlier...</span>\" Mesprit apologized shamefully, losing her smile for a moment, before smiling again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... But I won't waste this chance, I promise!</span>\" she chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I hope so...\" you mumbled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit giggled, and lowered her in her paws. And you soon found yourself struggling in between her paws and her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey... stop that...\" you were blushing, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit simply smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... We already came her at some point, huh?\" you broke the silence as Mesprit flew down, fluttering above her own lake, Lake Verity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess nodded, seemingly having cheered up to some better mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yep... don't you remember?</span>\" she asked, before remembering herself and adopting a dejected expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded.<br>\r\n\"Not sure... y'know...\" you recalled Uxie erasing your memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I'd like to forget the whole experience.\" you joked, attempting to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink-headed guardian giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her golden eyes fell on you as she stared at you intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Human...</span>\" she mumbled,</span></div></div>",

Yes?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Nothing.</span>\" the giantess quickly replied, before adopting a smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Come on, let's find someplace where we can sleep...

I get it.\" you replied, causing the giantess to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout adding another word, the pixie started floating into the depths of the forest surrounding her lake, seeking for a cave, or maybe a clearing, where she could spend the night with her human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer human... the same one she almost killed earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit suppressed the urge to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human had conquered her heart; it wouldn't be worth living without him, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while passed in complete silence as Mesprit flew past trees and too-small caves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil she finally found an opening that looked big enough for her to fit in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled down at you, before starting to squeeze herself inside the gigantic cave... at least, to you it was gigantic; to Mesprit, it could be compared to a simple door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was nothing out of ordinary; stone walls, stone floor, stone ceiling... occupied by Zubat and Golbat, hanging upside down, wings crossed, asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... About those...\" you pointed out, instinctively bringing your hands to your neck in a protective manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">They won't dare... it'd be the last thing they do.</span>\" she hissed as if one of the bats had already bitten you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole cave shook, shaken by an earthquake that was caused by Mesprit laying down; a few Golbat flew away, awakened and scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looked at you, smiling... for some reason, you felt like that wasn't a joyful smile. But, after what happened earlier, you guessed that she was simply regretful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you risked asking her,<br>\r\n\"Mesprit, how are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at you for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the last occasion to talk, get some of the remorse off her chest... but, she didn't want you to worry for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm fine.</span>\" she said, maybe a bit more hastily than she wanted,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Good night cutie. Love you~</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned forward, gently pecking you before laying back down. The large paws holding you pulled you in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head rested against the endless land that was her chest. You looked up, discovering that the giantess was staring at you, her smile gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit, don't think bad of yourself, you lost control... but we all do sometimes, no?\" you said sympathetically, trying to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked away, ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You don't threaten to exterminate a whole lake...</span>\" she pointed out,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... Or its inhabitants.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled,<br>\r\n\"Lake Acuity isn't entirely destroyed... and the pokemon were all fine,\" you recalled, before yawning.<br>\r\n\"Seriously Mesprit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess looked back at you, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You're sweet. But, please, don't worry for me, go to sleep. Use what is left of the night, cutie... who knows what'll happen tomorrow,</span>\" she reasoned, gently petting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned reassuringly, before laying your head on her chest again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, in a matter of minutes, you were asleep, exhausted from what you witnessed throughout the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit stared at you, her smile gone, replaced by a sorrowful expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had almost killed you... you were about to be crushed beneath her body, because of a stupid fight with her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was undeniable: the whole thing was her fault... she lost control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe - and her sisters - had to learn to control themselves... or else the lakes, the pokemon and, most importantly, the human were going to be doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... I'm sorry...</span>\" the giantess whispered as she closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, sleep claimed her as well, and she followed it without opposing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes, feeling extremely drowsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around, your vision blurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your eyes, before looking around, discovering that you were sitting on the soft grass, next to a bluish-grey wall. It was morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Mesprit?\" you called, remembering what happened yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh... you're awake...</span>\" Mesprit's voice came from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small pile of berries was pushed in front of you; it reached your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up, noticing the pink-headed guardian eating her own meal from a veritable mountain of berries in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

I'm sorry, human,</span>\" Mesprit continued, her voice cracking,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I lost control and tried to use you; I attacked my sister and ruined her lake...</span>\" she exhaled heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit...\" you muttered, but the giantess didn't even hear you as she continued,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I... don't know why you're here right now,</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged.<br>\r\n\"You asked me to come with you, no?\" you recalled, although \u2018asked\u2019 didn't feel like the right word... \u2018demanded\u2019, maybe? \u2018You're coming home with me\u2019... yeah, that DID sound demanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sighed, and you felt much like you were back to the first time she played with your emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yeah.

As a matter of fact, why were you even here, talking with her about this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike she said, she DID represent a menace, why did you pick her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout being able to formulate a proper answer, you opted to remain silent instead, limiting yourself to look at Mesprit dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... I dreaded this answer.</span>\" she admitted, and her grip on you grew a bit tighter.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You don't even know why we're here talking, do you?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of her wanted to giggle, because her human, the one she was so fond of, was clueless of his own reasons, and that made him look adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mesprit knew that this wasn't the right time to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- no!\" you hastily replied, feeling like this chat was going to sink into a disaster if you didn't think of something smart to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit, I-I... didn't want to leave you alone, okay?\" you said, and the pink-headed pixie raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lowered your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to leave you...\" you repeated, a bit more convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Mesprit's turn to remain silent after your poorly-stated sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">So you are telling me that you really, really wanted to stick with me?</span>\" she asked, her eyes seeming to be looking deep into your soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were growing more and more uncomfortable with this chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I... of course!

I know.\" you replied, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What I want to know is: do you love me back... even after what happened tonight?</span>\" she asked, and finally her serious expression changed into one of sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her, a thousand answers forming in your head but none of them being actually able to leave it through your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Silence again.</span>\" she whispered dejectedly after a minute of you unspeaking,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">That wasn't the answer is was hoping for.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sensed a storm of emotions raging inside of you, but she quickly blocked her powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were suddenly hugged by the giantess again, and were kept against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to stop in its tracks, and you weren't able to calculate how many minutes - or hours - Mesprit kept you restrained behind her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she finally opened her eyes and looked down at you; her eyes, once so expressive, now looked somewhat void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I felt love from you, you know, so I know for sure that you did love me back before,</span>\" she stated, and her paw suddenly began caressing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm not sensing your emotions right now, so I'm going to repeat my question.

A week since you openly declared your love to Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd life was really great right now, although you missed Azelf and Uxie. Since your arrival, you didn't hear of them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mesprit's behavior was too contagious for you to linger on such line of thinking for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that you forgave her for everything she had done in the past, Mesprit was happier than you ever saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife around Lake Verity was being quite normal (as normal as living with a giantess, and a pokemon giantess too, could be), if not a bit boring, and the guardian of this place was being quite serene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from her emotion-manipulating games, Mesprit wasn't doing anything weird. She wasn't even asking you to \u2018fix\u2019 her heat anymore, though you were sure that you saw her blushing madly while looking at you at some point. However, as long as she didn't try anything, it was fine. Sometimes, you woke up in the mornings, only to find yourself laying on the stone floor of the cave, the air inside carrying a heavenly scent; you suspected that your giant host had been trying to take care of her heat by herself, but you didn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit, life couldn't be better right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou met some pokemon during your explorations of the Lake, but none of them ever made any attempt to approach you; instead, they only shot startled stares and fled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know how to feel about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, basically, everything was fine and uneventful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the morning of your eighth day at Lake Verity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Mesprit woke up late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrowsy, but with the usual smile she constantly wore while around you (and that was basically all day, all days), she floated out of the cave that became like a home to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Mornin' human~,</span>\" she sang cheerfully, her lips landing on top of your head,<br>\r\n\"Mornin'...\" you replied drowsily, not even blushing anymore after having gotten used to the giantess' displays of love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSun rays greeted the both of you with a comforting warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trapped in her embrace, Mesprit hovered towards the Lake and sat down by the sparkling water, before telekinetically drawing a small hill of berries with a mere flick of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Here.</span>\" she chimed, handing some to you and taking the rest for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha- hey...\" you interrupted, your fingers stopping in the act of grabbing a berry as sunlight was suddenly eclipsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Mesprit, but she was looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... Azelf.</span>\" you heard her mumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up as well, but you soon discovered that there was no need to: said azure giantess was already coming down, filling your whole sight in a matter of a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hey sis!</span>\" she greeted, a spreading on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit didn't smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Azelf... what are you doing here?</span>\" she asked instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue sister looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">For Uxie, no? She- oh wait, how are you? Oh, and human! Nice to see you again!</span>\" she chimed, extending a large paw to pat you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">How are you? Did Mesprit try anything?</span>\" her face now showed concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink-headed guarding bit her lip at the blunt question, but you smiled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Glad to hear that. At least someone's happy...</span>\" she suddenly frowned.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Stupid heat... it's killing me.</span>\" she clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Don't even mention that.</span>\" Mesprit retorted, holding you a night more tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence followed the statement, before the titaness holding you decided to change subject,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hey, what were you saying about Uxie?</span>\" Mesprit wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Didn't she call you too?</span>\" Azelf questioned,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">She called me last night, told that she finally restored Lake Acuity and that we could go back there... possibly without starting anymore fights around there.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uxie restored the Lake?\" you parroted back, getting a nod from the blue giantess.<br>\r\n\"That's good news, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yeah... I wonder why she didn't call me though...</span>\" Mesprit mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf waved a hand in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Whatever, you can ask her, no? Let's go.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLake Acuity didn't change since the last time you saw it. Well, aside from the fact that the vegetation that was destroyed in the horrible fight between Mesprit and Uxie was now completely restored and verdant again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA certain Knowledge pokemon was waiting by the water of the Lake itself, and smiled as she sensed the two giantesses and you approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hi there,</span>\" Uxie greeted calmly as Azelf and Mesprit hovered in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie's closed eyes seemed to land straight on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">It's good to see you again. Are you alright?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" you replied from Mesprit's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And you, sis?</span>\" Mesprit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie's expression fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Aside from the obnoxious fact that I haven't been sleeping lately to restore the Lake and tranquilize the pokemon, that my heat is being quite bothersome and that I can't do anything about it... I'd say I'm decently fine.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Oh, I feel you.</b>\" Mesprit and Azelf replied at once while you felt a tingle of sadness for the yellow-headed pixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't be sure, but you felt the eyes of all three sisters moving to your form at the mention of their heat being still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Uxie looked up, and specifically back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well, I believe we have some catching up to do. Why don't you tell me what has been going on?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike your whole week, the day passed pretty quickly, between the attentions of the three sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their heat, they seemed way calmer than you had anticipated. Mesprit and Uxie didn't even mention their fight or its consequences, though you noted them staring at each other at some points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, sun was replaced by the moon and, after a quick meal, the three declared their intention to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I even had to fix the cave.</span>\" Uxie chimed smugly while looking at Mesprit, who avoided her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't paying attention though, too focused on a particularly fascinating bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when the loving Mesprit extended a paw to grab you, you stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to stay up for a while more,\" you told upon noticing her confused stare.<br>\r\n\"I wanted to explore around, if that's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Of course, cutie!</span>\" she chimed, unaware of what you were truly up to,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">See you later then! Be careful!</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as you watched the giantess moving up beside her sisters, who looked bemused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... Are you still planning to leave?</span>\" she wondered, a feeble hint of disappointment in her voice. Azelf didn't say anything, but stared at you, expecting an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh, trust me, he's not.</span>\" Mesprit jumped to your defense with a smile. Clearly, after you admitted you loved her back, she began trusting you a lot more.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Besides, if he wanted to leave, wouldn't he have done it when it was only me and him instead of waiting for us three to be around?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Mesprit's siblings seemed convinced by the explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well... you know the way.</span>\" she said as she began floating away, followed by her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Be careful!</span>\" Azelf chimed, while Mesprit blew you a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, the trio left completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dug your hands in your pockets as plants behind you began shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">You're back,</span>\" a voice spoke as you turned around to face a familiar Lucario.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">You should have never came back.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, nice to see you too.\" you sarcastically replied,<br>\r\n\"Are you gonna tell me I have to leave again? Because these days have been the best of my life.\" you told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jackal sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Instead of running, you grew even more attached to them?</span>\" he asked in a tone that made you understand that he couldn't believe what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Because Mesprit didn't try anything, and I'm sure the other two didn't either.\" you mused, though not mentioning your recent feeling towards Mesprit. You were sure that was going to disappoint the jackal, and it was none of his business anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike he was none of his business your decision to remain, but he didn't seem to care, or at least not to the point to stop spying on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario shook his head at your statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began walking towards you; a thousand thoughts began darting across your heads, but Lucario walked past you, gesturing for you to follow, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Come with me human, we need... a more secluded place.</span>\" he said in a neutral tone, leaving a perplexed you behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were unsure of what to do: one part was curious about what Lucario wanted, though you could assume it, while the other wasn't up for a discussion of any kind, let alone an argument with the many, many inhabitants of Lake Acuity, which you expected wherever Lucario wanted you to go along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn impatient growl coming from the jackal made you take your decision.</span></div></div>",

Either he didn't feel cold at all or he felt it and was complaining to himself, mentally cursing you for having him do all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis felt like a little payback, you childishly thought with a smirk, having him walk in the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, how much time have you been walking already? It felt like hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, may I know where are we going?\" you broke the silence.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Just a bit more. Keep  up human.</span>\" Lucario's growly voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt tempted to turn around and leave, but you ignored the voice in your mind that told you to leave Lucario by himself without even knowing that you left until he arrived to wherever he was bringing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, true to his word, the steel-type walked into a deserted clearing before stopping, causing you to stop as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">This'll do it...</span>\" you heard him muttering, before he turned around to face you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Now, human, we-</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario didn't even start talking that he was interrupted by the chiming cry of a pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked past you, and you turned around to see a familiar Vaporeon walking towards to where you and Lucario were standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Vap!</span>\" she exclaimed, smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">She's glad you managed to remain alive,</span>\" Lucario grumbled, before glaring at the water-type,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Did you follow us?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vaporeon nodded her head, before walking up beside the jackal and shooting him a glare as she began barking indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I didn't think you'd want to talk too...</span>\" he stated, only causing the barking to grow louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario waved his paw at her, and the Vaporeon reluctantly quieted down, her barking reducing to a mere growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">... Sorry,</span>\" the aura pokemon was addressing you with this,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Now, as I was saying, we need to talk human,</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard that before,\" you replied in an almost bored fashion as you gazed at the two pokemon in front of you,<br>\r\n\"Lemme guess, I need to leave because those three sisters are dangerous to me, to you and to the whole Lake, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon smirked at Lucario, who folded his arms and huffed in annoyance; he opened his mouth, seeming ready to reply with a sadistic comment about this being serious. But he sighed, deciding that he didn't want to start a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Well... yes,</span>\" he replied, sounding vaguely embarrassed,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">It's-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For my own good as well as yours, right?\" you interrupted, and the Vaporeon nodded her head in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Go ahead.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been away for a week, no? Did Uxie try anything with all of you since I wasn't there?

No.</span>\" he replied,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">On.</span>\" Vaporeon confirmed with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit didn't try anything with me either, and I'm sure Azelf didn't do anything while at Lake Valor, because she mentioned that her heat is \u2018killing her\u2019, like it is with all three of them.\" you said, before pausing to swallow,<br>\r\n\"Don't you get it? Since I told them what they do, they're trying to control themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth pokemon listened with serious expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario looked deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">You're right,</span>\" he declared after a while of thinking,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">They're trying to control themselves. But it's like you said, they can't fight their heat, none of us pokemon can. You mentioned that their heat is \u2018killing them\u2019?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. Lucario exchanged a brief glance with Vaporeon, before he looked back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Then the situation is worse than it was before.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a knot tying itself around your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What do you mean?\" you dared to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario signed, looking exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">They're trying to keep themselves under control, alright. But, by doing so, their heat is increasing. It'll gradually make them suffer more and more, if it already hasn't, until they won't bear it anymore and-</span>\" Lucario trailed off, but Vaporeon spoke for him,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">On...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, you managed to break the language barrier for the single word she spoke,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Rampage...\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as a fit of fear began spreading throughout your whole being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, you recalled your time with Mesprit, your declaration of devotion towards her. And those memories seemed to fill you with courage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm sure they won't,\" you stated firmly,<br>\r\n\"If they managed to control themselves so far, why shouldn't they be able to keep it up until the end of the season?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">... That's a... remote possibility,</span>\" Lucario admitted,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">But it'd be much safer for you to leave, human. Trust us.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">We'll hide,</span>\" he replied,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Like we always do.</span>\" Vaporeon nodded dejectedly at this,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">On...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Sometimes they find some of us... I don't envy those pokemon...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the grip of fear closed itself around your stomach, but you ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna leave. I'm sure those three are gonna control themselves and won't go on a rampage.\" you declared, causing the Lucario to sigh deeply, before he looked back at you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I don't want to oppose to your stupid wishes, human, so I'll ask you once: are you completely sure about this?</span>\" he asked with a very serious expression, while the Vaporeon shot you the biggest pair of puppy-dog eyes you've ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated for a moment, before you gathered the courage to reply,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario nodded, while the Vaporeon stared at you dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Then this conversation is concluded. Good-bye, human, try to stay alive.</span>\" he said as he turned around, beginning to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vaporeon tracked his walk, then looked back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">On...</span>\" she said, causing the Lucario to stop and glance backwards,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">She'll escort you back to the cavern.</span>\" he said, before disappeared into the thick woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon walked up beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks.\" you said, getting a meek smile in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mix of fear, determination and drowsiness running around within you, you began walking, Vaporeon following up.</span></div></div>",

And if that happened, they were going on a rampage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of you believed in that possibility, but the other silenced it as you repeatedly reminded yourself that those three would have never laid a finger on anyone on purpose. Unless someone threatened their lakes. You firmly believed that the three legendaries could control themselves if they managed to so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vaporeon beside you was eerily quiet, but you figured that she was probably reasoning on your same line of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, ehm... some night, huh?\" you asked, attempting to make casual conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those three won't lose it, I mean... they managed to keep themselves under control for a week, no? Why shouldn't they be able to do the same until the end of the season?\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon blushed at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Vapo...</span>\" she incomprehensibly muttered in response while you realized the reason of her flustered behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... you're in heat too, huh?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red shade on Vaporeon's cheeks grew wider as she closed her eyes and nodded for several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Who's your-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Vap! On!</span>\" the Eeveelution interrupted as she pointed to something in front of you; alerted, your gaze darted to it, but you took notice that Vaporeon was simply pointing at a cave, which was your destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" you mumbled as you halted, turning to face the water-type again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh...\" you knelt, gingerly bringing a hand to her head; she gladly accepted the offer as you began rubbing behind her ears, eliciting a small moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you around, I guess.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the blue pokemon looked at you longingly, before she stepped forward, stood on her hind legs and leaned forward, licking your cheek a few times, a pink shade spreading across her cheeks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she fell back on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">On...</span>\" she said with a gentle smile, before she began walking past you. Soon, you saw her form disappearing into the forest and you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you turned around and walked into the cavern, your ears almost immediately getting assaulted by the snoring of the legendary sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to yourself, you walked deeper inside the cavern, finding three familiar giantesses laying down beside each other; two of them were asleep, but the third...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing your footsteps on the hard stone, Mesprit perked up, shooting you a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" you said as you began hovering in the air, held by an invisible psychic grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I was waiting for you,</span>\" the giantess said as you floated into her open paws, which gripped you softly, holding you in front of the face of the titaness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's grin grew wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I knew you weren't going to leave,</span>\" she continued while you were lowered down, right into her lips, which placed a little kiss on the side of your head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I told Uxie, Arceus knows how much time it took to convince her that you were coming back.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right - here I am.\" you said while the paws that held you gently placed you in top of your bed, Mesprit's bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">It means we can go to sleep then,</span>\" she chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Wait, Mesprit,\" you called, but you got no response: the giantess opened her mouth, which was a cave itself, and yawned deeply, sending a wave of hot air in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hm?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was asking myself... you're still in heat, no?\" you asked,<br>\r\n\"All three of you are, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit blushed vaguely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Why the reason of such thoughts, cutie?</span>\" she replied with another question, a suspicious expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... It's making you... suffer, you mentioned that, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this mention, Mesprit closed her eyes, and the blush on her gigantic visage grew stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she opened those golden eyes of hers shortly after, smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You shouldn't worry of such things, human. As long as I've got you...</span>\" she began, but you interrupted,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please, let us talk,\" you said, before noticing the look she gave you at your demand,<br>\r\n\"... I mean, you haven't been asking me to... y'know... and I wanted to know why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looked perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What do you mean, \u2018why\u2019? We both know-</span>\" Mesprit had to interrupt herself, because Azelf moaned something incomprehensible in her sleep, protesting against your voices piercing the silence and bothering her slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit ignored her blue sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You were the one telling us, remember? That doing that is dangerous for you, and for the whole Lake for what matters.</span>\" she recalled, before offering a sigh and looking at you with her eyes sparkling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began feeling uncomfortable under her golden gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mes-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You're wondering why I didn't lose control again, like I did back then?</span>\" she questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip and looked off to the side, nodding meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sighed deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I was so close to killing you just last week,</span>\" she started.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I let my heat best me, I tried using you and attacked my sister, not to mention I started a fight that destroyed a good percentage of this Lake. Mercifully, all the pokemon were fine, but I almost crushed you, remember?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you remembered, the memory of the giantess busily fighting Uxie, her body straight on yours before it was stopped by a Psychic. You weren't going to forget <i>that</i> so easily, unless Uxie opened her eyes to make you forget again, which was something you didn't exactly wish for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought was rudely interrupted as Mesprit continued after a long sigh,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Since then, I swore to myself that I'd have never let my heat control my actions again. That's why I haven't been asking you to \u2018fix\u2019 me anymore,</span>\" she explained, before adopting a look of determination,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">For the sake of Lake Verity. For the sake of you,</span>\" her gaze softened at this,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">For the sake of our love.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed again, along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Each time it happens, I think about what would happen to you if I ever-</span>\" Mesprit interrupted herself and shivered at the thought, before she looked back at you, smiling cheerfully,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And that thought gives me strength, strength to fight back my heat.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at the mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure how to feel about that, Mesprit,\" you said, causing the titaness to giggle.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Neither do I.</span>\" she replied, before another yawn escaped her mouth, mixing with the snoring of her two siblings in a single, loud noise that took up the whole place, like an orchestra of bodily music, which had its own soothing power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... Can we go to sleep now? Or have you got something more awkward to ask me?</span>\" Mesprit snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no... I'm pretty tired too.\" you replied as you yawned too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms of the giantess traveled to you, her paws clasped together behind your back, pushing you deeper into Mesprit's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Sleep tight, cutie~,</span>\" the titaness sang cheerfully, before her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you too.\" you distractedly replied as your eyes closed and your body relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, a few moments before you fell asleep, your mind went back to Lucario and how wrong he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps Azelf and Uxie were still a danger, but Mesprit definitely wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot anymore.</span></div></div>",

Azelf!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one time, Uxie huffed, Mesprit sighed and Azelf smiled brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to pick Azelf - she's the most calm of the trio. Your chances would improve to a decent level with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But... why?</span>\" Mesprit asked dejectedly as she watched her blue sister bending to grab a hold of you.<br>\r\n\"Because... uh...\" you quieted down, unable think of any good excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018You're dangerous,\u2019 and she was going to be even more depressed than she already is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">...

Bye!</span>\" she exclaimed, you holding your ears in pain from the sonic assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit glared as Azelf giggled awkwardly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hehe... starting now...</span>\" she said as she started floating backwards, until she reached the exit of the cave, at which point she smiled at her siblings and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You'll see... we'll have fun, me and you.</span>\" she reassured gently as she exited the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moon was still high in the sky, suggesting that it was still quite early to be awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground below started to recede more and more as Azelf flew up and headed to Lake Valor, holding you close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the cavern, Uxie and Mesprit sighed at unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well... he made his choice...</span>\" Uxie told.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Wonder why... he barely even knows her...</span>\" Mesprit mumbled to herself, before turning to face her yellow headed sister whose eyes were closed as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Sis... I'm sorry for... this all...</span>\" she spoke with sullen voice as she went to hug her sister, who happily returned the hug.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">It was my fault too...</span>\" she said, smiling dejectedly, before letting go of Mesprit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Now go sis... I need to restore Lake Acuity...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit bit her lip in sorrow and nodded as she too exited the cave.

Ow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf just carelessly laid belly-down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw her smiling, eyes closed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I finally get to sleep without those two attempting on each other's lives~</span>\" she said, obviously referring to her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill startled, you adjusted to a less precarious position and watched the giantess in front of you... her golden eyes suddenly opened again as she stared down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh... sorry...</span>\" she teased with a smirk upon seeing the startled look on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could reply, you discovered her large paw moving towards you as she grabbed you in her fist and shifted on her side, hugging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Mhh... sleep tight...</span>\" the blue giantess moaned, closing her eyes again, her giant paws pressing you deep into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as you leaned your head against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you wanted to do right now was sleep on and hopefully forget the frightening fight you witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, sleep DID come quite soon as Azelf, Lake Valor and your consciousness faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell asleep, deep into a sweet, dreamless slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun shined brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around midday when you and the giantess cuddling you finally started to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunshine fell on the eyelids of the sleeping titanesses, who slowly opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guardian of Lake Valor gives a deep yawn, before looking down, discovering the she was holding a still-sleeping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">H-Human...?</span>\" she asked herself as her gaze darted around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't Lake Acuity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hey, weren't we-</span>\" memories started to seep from the depths of her mind. Memories of violence, sadness.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Right.</span>\" Azelf whispered as she yawned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Well, rise and shine human.</span>\" she said as she looked at you, gently shaking your small form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Come on... wake up...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave an annoyed groan as you opened your eyes, shooting Azelf a tired gaze.<br>\r\n\"... Azelf.\" you said with a yawn as you recalled the events that occurred last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess nodded cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Mornin'...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, how do these things fill you up?\" you asked as you bit into a berry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">They don't.</span>\" Azelf replied dejectedly as she swallowed a mouthful of berries.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I have to eat like a ton a day and I'm not even close to be satisfied!</span>\" she said, throwing another handful in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you mention that you eat fish pokemon too?\" you recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue mountain next to you blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">We... try not to do that too often...</span>\" she awkwardly replied.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I mean-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<b>Not that I like to kill but I need to eat!</b>\" you and her concluded at unison, Azelf smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was growing to enjoy the presence of this human...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say...\" you asked at some point.<br>\r\n\"How come you never realized your heat was dangerous?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you regretted asking - maybe it was an indelicate question to ask...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Azelf simply shrugged, wondering how the chat landed on such topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I have no idea.</span>\" she bluntly responded, lazily leaning back against a tree slightly bigger than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" you said.<br>\r\n\"Hey, is it still bothering you after yesterday? Because you look pretty fine...\" you pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf looked at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... That thing is killing me from within.</span>\" she revealed as she slowly leaned down, laying flat on the ground.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I managed to control myself after I... almost had you... but it's still there... it hurts...</span>\" she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... sorry to hear that...?\" you tried, taking a few steps, placing some distance between you and the giantess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze rose as she looked at you again. And she was quick to cover the distance between you and her. You suddenly remember Mesprit's warning, \u2018<i>Whenever she likes someone, she usually gets close...</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this the occasion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Human...</span>\" the pixie giantess started with a pleading voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have been adorable to see her laying down, wearing a painful expression... if it wasn't for the fact that she was 200ft tall and looked all but innocent. You'd call her intimidating instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" you interrupt before she can even speak. You couldn't - it was dangerous... and Mesprit made a not-so-subtle threat about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Please...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Listen to me - I don't know how much longer I'll control myself... I might lose it at some point... do it while I'm still thinking straight, and your permanence here will be much more pleasing for us both.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou signed in exasperation.<br>\r\n\"Azelf... I can't...\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Why not?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit is going to kill me...\" you admitted, recalling her unfinished but still very clear threat. Azelf smiled sympathetically.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Like she can without her willpower... and then, who says she's going to know?</span>\" she said with a reassuring smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her, slightly reassured but not completely sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Come on...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt conflicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one side, Azelf was suffering; on the other, <i>you</i> were going to be suffering if Mesprit found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould you really betray her trust?</span></div></div>",

Remorse? It was very faint though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe instinctively looked in direction of Lake Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">...

You didn't want to abuse Mesprit's trust, she was the first to confess her feelings for you, you wanted to be loyal go to her... and you also wanted to avoid facing the consequences of your betrayal, but you mostly wanted to be loyal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm sorry Azelf... I can't help you.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess looked at you with a disappointed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I-I... don't want to anger Mesprit.\" you continued, feeling uncomfortable as you met the gaze of the lustful, disappointed Azelf. It was like you were in presence of a goddess, her golden gaze was as heavy as a boulder on your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were starting to feel scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the giantess finally spoke,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Look. I understand - loyalty to my sister, that's adorable,</span>\" she said, trying to be comprehensive, but feeling dazed because of her heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made her head spin, her breathing heavy, her cheeks flared up and her heart pound her chest from within. She had to put an end to that all... or better, <i>you</i> had to put an end to that all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... But I need this so much - and for God's sake, come here!</span>\" she exclaimed in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, who took a few other steps away, found yourself levitating in the air and on top of the giantess' paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Sorry.\" you apologize awkwardly. Azelf sighed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Don't worry... point is, this is not just you helping me! It's also you avoiding me losing control! Think about it, human, if I lose it, I'll just force you to do it!</span>\" she paused to sigh in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noted her cheeks completely red because of her lust, her eyes glazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a point... If she lost her lucidity, you'd have to deal not with a sexually-hungry Azelf, but with a totally out of control sexually-hungry Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, she was reasoning on the same line of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I-I... don't want to hurt you human... I do really like you... you're one good human, it'd be... horrible to lose you.

Please...</span>\" she plead, giving you another lustful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess suddenly lowered herself and let go of you, gently placing you on the ground and laid in front of you, her mouth exhaling heavily, blowing humid air in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inhaled just as heavily, before speaking again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I feel like I'm on fire... my head's spinning, I need relief...</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, this reminded you of your first time with Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were starting to grow tired of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf... we can't. I can't... yes, I like you too, that's undeniable, but I don't want to anger Mesprit,\" you repeated.<br>\r\n\"Plus, even if you're actually lucid right now, it could still be lethal to me... so, I'm sorry, but I won't help you.\" you said, gently but firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf stared at you, looking somewhat dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she spoke.</span></div></div>",

You didn't know what to do - how could you calm two desperate titanesses when you could have been easily drowned in one of their tears?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, and stood there without moving, opting to wait for them to eventually calm down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tap on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around, noticing a black paw on your left shoulder and a familiar blue jackal. The Lucario from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" you said, wondering what he wanted from you but at the same time having an accurate idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Those two just almost destroyed Lake Acuity. It was over you, I must assume.\" he spoke, his grumbly voice echoing in your ears because of the closeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shot a look at the two sisters: Mesprit had her eyes closed, Uxie had her face buried in her sister's chest. So they weren't paying attention. And their lament quite certainly covered your and Lucario's words, so they couldn't hear either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Mesprit lost control. Uxie tried to stop her but... things kinda got out of hand...\" you dared to explain. Lucario nodded.<br>\r\n\"Azelf?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a deep sigh.<br>\r\n\"... Mesprit stole her emotions... she's probably still staring at the ceiling of the cave.\" you revealed, somehow still hoping that this all was nothing but a nightmare. You brought a hand to the back of your neck, apparently scratching it while you were in reality pinching yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope. You were wide awake, Mesprit and Uxie just tried to kill each other, Lucario was still in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bipedal jackal fixed on you a solemn gaze as he folded his arms.<br>\r\n\"... So, do you finally understand why you need to leave? D'you comprehend the power of these three now?\" he asked, causing you to perk up.<br>\r\n\"Again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded.<br>\r\n\"I don't know why you wanted to stay with them after what happened this morning... I don't know why you want to stay after this. But, point is, you can't.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n\"... I recall that I already told you that I'm not going to leave, Lucario. Especially not now.\" you told with annoyance. This was the third time he tried to make you leave... fourth if you included the meeting you couldn't remember about. Nonetheless, you were getting quite tired of his stubbornness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing your words, the jackal moved a step forward.<br>\r\n\"Human...\" he told calmly, but you interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look... I've done it, alright?\" you admitted. Lucario stared at you in confusion.<br>\r\n\"What exactly? Did you let one of these two have sex with you ag-\" you blushed and interrupted hastily by waving your hands back and forth, uncomfortable.<br>\r\n\"No no no... I've told them what their heat causes around here... Azelf told that she'll protect me... I must assume that she'll extent her protection to the whole lake...\" you admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario's crimson eyes widened as his eyelids opened up completely.<br>\r\n\"You did WHAT?!\" he yelled, before adopting a look of indignation.<br>\r\n\"You! You knew that we didn't want to break their hearts! Why did you?!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at the two crying siblings - they didn't hear the loud cry of the Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed back at him.<br>\r\n\"... I didn't know that you didn't want to break their hearts until now... and quite frankly, it broke mine more than theirs to tell about it.\" you recalled the moment you told it - Azelf had started crying, like Mesprit and Uxie did much later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario looked at you.<br>\r\n\"Of course you knew it! I've personally told you-\" he stopped.<br>\r\n\"... Last night...\" he said breathlessly, remembering that Uxie erased your memories. You raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"... Sorry.\" the jackal apologized, blushing, before shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... But the point is that you have to leave, human. There's no choice - if you remain, they'll keep fighting until they end up killing each other or destroying this whole place!\" he told quite pessimistically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n\"... What about you pokemon?\" you asked as you casually glanced at a group of pokemon who were staring directly at you and Lucario.<br>\r\n\"If I leave, won't they hunt you down?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jackal sighed.<br>\r\n\"We'll be fine... we've gone through this countless times now, and those sisters hopefully don't manage to get us... except for that poor Snover... not to mention that Floatzel... they didn't end so well...\" Lucario recalled with a blush, causing you to shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, he sighed, this time all his exasperation detectable in his sigh.<br>\r\n\"Look... if you don't want the same to happen to you, you gotta leave... also, they could start fighting again if you don't...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you tell \u2018no\u2019 in any other way, look around.\" he interrupted before any sound could escape your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giantesses still crying, the lake partially destroyed... pokemon looking at the two titanic sisters in shock and terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all scared, some were gazing at the sisters, others were glaring at you. One was staring at you pleadingly. You recognized her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see? They're scared human,\" Lucario unnecessarily stated.<br>\r\n\"They're scared by the possibility of another fight like this one, a fight that might happen again if you don't leave this lake.\" he told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his exasperated voice, you could tell that this was his last attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you felt conflicted. You didn't want to leave the sisters, but you certainly didn't want the pokemon of the lake to be scared... and, of course, you didn't want another fight between Mesprit and Uxie. You looked back at them, they were still crying, a veritable lake of salt water had formed around Mesprit's head, while her chest was wet from Uxie's own tears. You felt sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you really have the heart to leave?</span></div></div>",

If it wasn't Uxie, why were you leaving?</span>\" Azelf repeats as she lowers herself to better hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth, but whatever was coming out from it dies down in your throat as you feel a lump forming, blocking your words as your mouth closes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were firm on the intention of leaving... but now, you find that you're not so sure about it anymore... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sudden agitation doesn't go unnoticed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hey, are you feeling alright? You're all white!</span>\" she exclaims. Quite surely, you must have went pale as a sheet as you realize that you don't want to leave anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few steps back and grab your head in your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They are dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are dangerous.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance past the worried-looking Azelf, at Mesprit and Uxie, who are still hugging in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They love you...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are reduced to nothing as you are suddenly grabbed by a large hand. Whose paw is this, you don't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paw releases you. You fall flat on your rear. Another paw gently removes your arms from your face, and you notice that it was Azelf the one that scooped up. She looks extremely worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I apologize if I'm wrong, but you're not feeling well. Your soul isn't feeling well, am I right?</span>\" she asks. You look at her, meekly nodding your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Is It because you feel like you don't want to talk?

However, the giantess doesn't seem to understand.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">About what?</span>\" she asks, tilting her head in a confused manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rise your gaze.<br>\r\n\"About leaving, Azelf. I'm not sure about it like I was before,\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness stares down at you for a moment, before a smile appears on her face as she feels her heart perking up within her chest.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Tell me you aren't kidding.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Tell me you aren't making me say this,\" you retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess blushes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">No no, you're telling it yourself,</span>\" she assures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Mesprit and Uxie are listening to the conversation, you judge as Mesprit suddenly breaks the hug and turns around, fixing her eyes on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even know it, she floats forward, scoops you from Azelf and brings you up, pressing you against her pink cheek.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">P-Please... D-D-Don't g-go... You are my l-love...</span>\" the giantess pleads, tears sliding between you and the wide surface of her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour limbs go limp. You close your eyes and bite your lower lip in a useless attempt to keep yourself from crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop against Mesprit's cheek and let your tears roll down your own cheek. Your own tears become one with hers.<br>\r\n\"I-I don't want to l-leave you girls...\" you sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit tightens her hug as she too closes her eyes, tears keeping sliding down. Soon enough, you feel another surface pressing your further into Mesprit's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing backwards, you notice that Uxie just grabbed her sister in a hug, pushing her own cheek into Mesprit's, pushing you deeper.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Then don't.</span>\" she says as she starts to cry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, her words succeed where they failed last night: they shatter your resistance. Your wish to leave wanes away all of sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't want to l-leave you...\" you repeat.<br>\r\n\"A-And I won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words aren't greeted with cheers, like you expected, but with more tears instead.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Y-You...</span>\" Uxie stammers.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Y-You're staying...? Y-You mean it?</span>\" Mesprit asks.<br>\r\n\"Yes. I mean i-\" your sentence is never finished as you feel a third surface pressing into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long for you to realize that Azelf joined in this group hug, with you in the middle of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you're sure that the three legendaries got what you were saying anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cry and the legendaries' becomes one, a cry of both pain and joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT is he thinking?!\" the figure of Lucario growls behind the bushes that serves him and a certain pokemon as a hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Lucario is slapped by Vaporeon's tail.<br>\r\n\"<u>Quiet!</u>\" she barks while keeping her voice low.<br>\r\n\"<u>Do you want them to discover us?</u>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario meekly rubs the back of his head that was unceremoniously hit.<br>\r\n\"Can't you simply talk before slapping me?\" he mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon smirks.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, the point is another: the human wants to stay...\" Lucario tells, his ears drooping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon flinches.<br>\r\n\"<u>What?</u>\" she asks, incredulous.<br>\r\n\"<u>Does he realize that he's in danger?</u>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario nods.<br>\r\n\"He does. He just doesn't care. He got too close to the legendaries, and now he doesn't want to leave!\" he exclaims, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>What do we do then? We try to talk to him again?</u>\" Vaporeon asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else can we do? The human mentioned the pokemon around the lake, me included. If we do something against him, the legendaries will hunt us down...\" Lucario reasons, shivering as he thinks of himself and the other pokemon facing the wrath of those three giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently thinking about the same thing, Vaporeon backs away in a scared manner.<br>\r\n\"<u>Right...</u>\" she tells.<br>\r\n\"<u>But what do we do then?</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario sighs.<br>\r\n\"We'll think of something...\" he mutters as his paw finds its way to his face. He shakes his head slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why couldn't the human simply stick to his decision?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Well, one good cry never hurt anyone,</span>\" Mesprit sniffles. Uxie and Azelf pull off, letting the giantess remove you from her cheek as she wipes her tears away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit then looks at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">So... er... you're staying?</span>\" she asks, hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" you reply, nodding your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three guardians smile. Mesprit leans forward, lovingly catching your face in between her lips as she smooches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">That's nice,</span>\" Uxie tells, hovering closer.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But now, just out of curiosity: why did you want to leave?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze up.

Easier said than done...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lips fall back in place as your mouth closes again.

Your eyes shut open, and a blush spreads across your cheeks as you realize what Uxie is talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rape.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill silenced by Mesprit's paw, you try to express yourself:<br>\r\n\"Mh mh!

Mesprit didn't do anything, then? Did you willingly... help her too?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance back at the pink headed guardian, smiling gratefully as you remember that you had to do it for Mesprit to forgive you, which she did.<br>\r\n\"Totally.\" you reply, causing the giantess behind you to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Okay. But the problem remains then: why did you want to leave?</span>\" she repeats the very first question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go silent again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Uxie remembers one of her earlier deductions. The giantess perks up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Did we do something... but, not to you yesterday?</span>\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you ask, suddenly feeling nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie just guessed right, although she doesn't know it... yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nervousness doesn't go unnoticed as it is detected by Mesprit's empathic abilities.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I think you got it, sis,</span>\" she says. You swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">That's it?</span>\" Uxie asks, before continuing:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Alright, what did I - or we - do?</span>\" she asks. You don't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Was it because you saw me handling those Sneasel when they stole the eggs? Did that scare you?</span>\" she asks, feeling guilty as the thought that you were trying to leave because of her emerges in her mind again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you reply, sighing deeply.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Then-</span>\" you interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you're sure of your answer:<br>\r\n\"You know what? Forget it. Just... forget it. I'm tired of this,\" you bluntly say, before turning to Mesprit.<br>\r\n\"Now, would you be so kind to let me down? I've got to take this off,\" you motion for your bag, which is still hanging from your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'll come with you,</span>\" she says, dreading the chance that this could be simply another attempt to leave. However, a quick check to your emotions tells her that you're actually... happy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" you reply with a smile. The giantess nods, before floating off, marking the end of the interrogation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">So, you're really staying?</span>\" Mesprit asks as you place your bag in a corner of the cave.<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" you reply, before turning to her, starting to walk out of here.<br>\r\n\"I'm not going anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit smiles as she follows you out of the cavern.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hey, since you're staying, what do you say if we do something together? Me and you? Alone?</span>\" Mesprit asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... you're not talking about sex again, are you?\" you ask. The giantess giggles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Nope. And I won't be for a day or two more,</span>\" she pointed out, winking.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">No, I'm talking about something we can actually enjoy,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" you reply, intrigued.<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind then?\" </span></div></div>",

And not wanting to shatter the trio's hearts either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Mesprit soon decides that she's had enough of this silence of yours. Her human will have to make his decision, once and for all. She can feel it, you loved her back. Now, it's time to see how strong that love is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Alright, fine.</span>\" the giantess says.

Something taps your shoulder. You find that it's a gigantic tail. You look backwards, noticing that it belongs to Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Know it, the same goes for me.</span>\" Azelf says dejectedly, floating into the forest as well, following her sister, leaving you alone with Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to her, finding her staring down to you.<br>\r\n\"You aren't going?\" you ask, almost resignedly. The giantess tilts her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'm afraid yes, dear.

I'm sure you know what is best for yourself,</span>\" she says, leaning forward to place a light peck on your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flush red as the giantess stands back up, looks at you dejectedly one last time and hovers into the forest too, leaving you all by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What to do...?\" you mutter with an exasperated sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want an advice?\" a voice speaks from behind you. You turn around and watch as the familiar figure of the Lucario you met earlier comes out of the woods, an as well familiar Vaporeon following silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" you mutter.<br>\r\n\"Were you spying on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At all. Just checking if you told them about us,\" he replies.<br>\r\n\"...

The decision is easy,\" Lucario recalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but... I'm not so sure anymore...\" you tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Lucario growling and Vaporeon barking something.<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on! Your own life over the friendship... or whatever it is with those three?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario huffs.<br>\r\n\"Whatever human. The choice is up to you. Go ahead, throw your life away!\" he growls. You clench your fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that he maybe was too harsh, Lucario quickly adds:<br>\r\n\"If you want to leave, though, we'll still escort you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following moments, silence falls between the three of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to take a decision, whether to go after the three sisters or leave them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" you mumble, having taken a decision.

I'm sorry, but I've got no clue of who you are.\" you bluntly reply.<br>\r\n\"Maybe you, though. Aren't you the same Vaporeon from yesterday? The one who told me about those pokemon slipping up inside Uxie?\" you remark, looking at the quadruped water type, who nods her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario smirks.<br>\r\n\"Of course, you can't remember about me, or our meeting, can you? Not after what Uxie did to you...\" he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat as you hear his words.<br>\r\n\"What... How do you know that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<u>We saw her. We saw her opening her eyes and forcing you to look into them.</u>\" the Vaporeon speaks up. Sadly, being no pokemon, the only reply you can give is a confused stare and a blink of eyes, which, in clear body language, means: \u2018What?\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We saw her opening her eyes. She forced you to look into them. That's why you forgot everything about last night, our meeting included. That also explains a few things that happened around here...\" the Lucario helpfully translates, while glancing at the Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the reason of why nobody could remember Uxie going on a rampage, made uncontrollable because of her heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your legs feel weak and you discover that you can't stand properly anymore as you almost fall on your knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe description of the events that apparently occurred last night matches the one Uxie told you yesterday, \u2018If you look into my eyes, you will forget everything\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo these two are speaking the truth. They really saw the giantess wiping your memories away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, if that's true... you really had a meeting with them, one you couldn't possibly remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou question about it.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that brings us back to the point: our meeting.\" the Lucario says, while holding out a paw to help you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you say as you get back on your feet.<br>\r\n\"So, what are you talking about? Does it involve Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie?\" you say, while mentally struggling to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you accomplish, though, is a vague sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely. It was about them we talked you about. About their problem.\" he says, now looking dead serious.<br>\r\n\"Problem? You mean their heat? Because I think... heh... I might've helped them a bit...\" you say, blushing faintly.<br>\r\n\"<u>That's exactly where the problem is!</u>\" the Vaporeon says, walking closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you stare at her confused, causing her to give a deep, annoyed sigh.<br>\r\n\"That's the problem, human. You did help them. But you dug your grave.\" Lucario bluntly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood seems to freeze at the last statement.<br>\r\n\"... What... what do you m-mean?\" you stammer, starting to get scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up.\" Lucario says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you feel your legs unable to hold you anymore. Slowly, you sit down, and grab your head in your hands. You can literally feel it spinning, and you find your heart aching. Like really a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario just told you what he apparently told you last night. He told you what you couldn't remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you only manage to tell three words in response:<br>\r\n\"This. Is. Crazy.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kneels down, getting to eye level with you.<br>\r\n\"I know, it may seem crazy. But it's the truth, we can assure you,\" he states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel tears starting to form in your eyes. The three legendaries, they apparently caused damage to the inhabitants of the Lake they protect because of their heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, according to Lucario's words, you would be their next victim...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, refusing to believe any of it.<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it. I don't want to. I spent a day with those three sisters. Not only they were lucid, they were the sweetest living beings I ever met! They didn't - and don't - represent any threat, I can assure you that!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n\"<u>They don't, for now, since their heat was satiated for a while. But it'll come stronger. And stronger. Until they turn into sex crazed beasts, and use you until you-</u>\" the Vaporeon doesn't have the courage to finish her phrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you understood what she said, but seeing her shudder only makes you feel more uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario and Vaporeon argue for a moment, and you see the water type wagging her long tail, which causes Lucario to growl with annoyance.<br>\r\n\"She said that you're in danger more than us right now. Those three will turn into lustful beasts that will be the last of your problems.\" he translates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou understand what he means, and shudder at the thought that those three might end up killing you. Maybe not on purpose, but the thought is still terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can reply, though, the Lucario speaks up again:<br>\r\n\"And that's the point of the situation: you need to leave. We will escort you to-\" you interrupt him.<br>\r\n\"Leaving? I c-can't! Those three would be heartbroken!... I would be heartbroken!\" you exclaim, desperately trying to find a point against Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind simply refuses to believe that the three legendary sisters could hurt... nobody really! And you less of everyone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>We know this is hard for you. But it's for your own sake,</u>\" the Vaporeon says. Somehow, you make out the meaning of her words.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I really can't believe this... and maybe I should go back. Those three were arguing when I left them, I'd better check on them.\" you say, getting back up, and turning to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Lucario places a paw on your shoulder, stopping you.<br>\r\n\"Maybe you don't believe us now,\" he starts.<br>\r\n\"But you need to. If you don't, you might end up believing us anyway... When you're nothing more than a broken sex toy.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly imagine what he just described. And you end up frenetically shaking your head to get rid of the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario continues.<br>\r\n\"The choice is up to you, human. You can believe us, if you want, and we'll take you away from the Lake and to nearest city,\" he says.<br>\r\n\"... Or...?\" you dare to ask.<br>\r\n\"Or you can go back to those three sisters, and throw your life away. But remember that we warned you,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back, looking into the pokemon's crimson eyes for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, ultimately, you make your choice...</span></div></div>",

And if you change your mind,<br>\r\nwe'll still take you to safety.</u>\" you don't make out the meaning of her words. So you just kneel down and pet her head. She lets you, and moans as she feel you rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA call from Lucario claims her back to reality. Barking something in response, she makes her way towards him. The two briefly glance at you, before disappearing into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there, still somewhat confused about what they told you, before deciding to go find the three legendaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, though, it turns out it isn't necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around you suddenly shakes as you discover a familiar, azure giantess suddenly coming out of nowhere, looking worried, and stops as she sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... hi, Azelf?\" you say. In response, the giantess hastily picks you and brings you to her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You! We need you, like now! The situation got out of ha-</span>\" she abruptly stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear someone crying distantly:<br>\r\n\"<b>I refuse to believe this!</b>\" you cringe as you recognize Mesprit's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, you look at Azelf who, not adding another word, hugs you to her chest and floats off, in direction of Lake Acuity, where her sisters are arguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you weren't solidly held in Azelf's arms, you would have fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating in front of you are Mesprit and Uxie, one looking really angry, the other looking somewhat scared. They appear to not have even noticed Azelf. And if they did, they didn't pay her any attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I refuse to believe this, Uxie!</span>\" Mesprit repeats.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">It's the truth! That's why I had to make him forget!</span>\" Uxie retorts. You quickly remember that you're the cause of the argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">This makes no sense at all! Why would the human -<br>\r\nmy human! - have wanted to leave?</span>\" Mesprit inquires.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">That's exactly what I was trying to discover! He just told me that her wished to leave! Where could I find the heart to let him?</span>\" her yellow headed sister asks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You could have simply tried to talk sense into him! You erased his memories before even knowing what reason he had to leave. And I still don't believe it,</span>\" Mesprit says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, for the first time since Azelf brought you here, her gaze shifts on her blue sister. More specifically, on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her frown changes into a small smile as she hovers closer and gently snatches you from Azelf and hugs you to her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Cutie! Uxie there is saying you meant to leave. But you would never leave us (me), would you?</span>\" she says, her voice going from venomous to honey-sweet in a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can reply, though, Uxie hovers closer as well.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Dear... I don't know how to find the words to say this... but you meant to leave for some reason. I... I am ashamed of my actions... but I had to make you forget, do you understand? I am sorry.</span>\" she says, lowering her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I sure don't wish to leave none of you...\" you reply truthfully. Even if you believed what Lucario said you, you couldn't have escaped anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot in the middle of the day, when the three could have found you in less than five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">See, Uxie? This little one doesn't wish to leave like you said... why would he have wished to leave last night?</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'll tell it again: that's what I was trying to figure out.</span>\" Uxie replies, as she gently picks you from Mesprit, who stares daggers at her sisters.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hey-</span>\" Uxie interrupts with a movement of her paw, which only irritates Mesprit further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie holds you in front of her gigantic eyes, causing you to cringe once again. Even though the situation, the giantess smiles: seeing the human scared is kind of cute. Like the resistance he put up to avoid her gaze last night. It didn't work, but still, it was admirable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Don't worry, you. I'm not going to do anything to your... I just wish to know, did me or my sister do something to you yesterday? Something wrong? Or maybe, not to you? None of you will do anything to you, so I beg you to be truthful.</span>\" she ask with a sweet smile, succeeding in reassuring you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uxie, nor you or Mesprit or Azelf did anything wrong. You were simply the sweetest creatures I ever met. I don't know about last night, I don't remember whatever I did, but I do not wish to leave...\" you say. You catch Azelf and Mesprit smiling, maybe relieved by the fact that they didn't do anything bad to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe because you called them \u2018the sweetest creatures I ever met\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you feel light-headed for some reason, and you discover Uxie staring at you intently through her closed eyelids as she scans your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the sensation fades, and the giantess smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Okay. Thanks for your sincerity, dear.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you are again snatched by Mesprit, who hugs you tightly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">See Uxie? He didn't wish to leave, and he doesn't wish to leave. So I think you should-</span>\" Uxie interrupts.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I already apologized. And I'll repeat it again, I only made you forget because you wanted to leave!</span>\" she says, pointing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">And this only leaves one question: if it wasn't us, why did you wish to leave?</span>\" she asks, mostly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou however start to feel nervous.<br>\r\n\"Don't ask me. I can't remember. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">And I didn't believe Lucario...</font>\" you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Mesprit seems to hear the last name.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Lucario...?</span>\" she asks looking down at you, seeming confused, before remembering something:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hey, now that I think of it, a Lucario told me about what you did Uxie! He and a Vaporeon...</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood seems to freeze. Uxie turns around.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">A Lucario and a Vaporeon? Oh no, did someone see... me...</span>\" Uxie says, noticing the nervous look on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment, the attention of the three sisters is on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You didn't tell completely everything, did you?</span>\" Uxie asks after a few moments of hesitation.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Tell us everything, sweetie. Everything.</span>\" Mesprit says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">It's the only way to solve this. Come on.</span>\" Azelf adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're in cage. If you tell what Lucario and Vaporeon told you, you're not certain of how the sisters would take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, you didn't believe it yourself. But, apparently, you believed to it last night, and you wanted to leave... something you regret. But it is also true that everything started from what you have been told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, not saying anything is an option too. But you feel like that an attempt to avoid the trio's questions wouldn't be exactly wise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, once again today, you find yourself forced to make a choice, wether to tell everything to the three, or say nothing and face the consequences...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three sisters stare at you intently, their gazes feeling like a weight on your heart.<br>\r\n\"<b>Whenever you're ready, dear,</b>\" the three says with  reassuring smiles, eager to find the truth.</span></div></div>",

Uxie did really erase her precious little one's memories?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he really admit-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit frenetically shakes her head, causing the Lucario to take a few steps back and the Vaporeon to disappear underwater again, fearing that the agitated pink headed giantess could kill them with a single swing of one of her tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit simply refuses to believe the words of the duo. For what she knows, they could lie to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the only solution to this situation is one: find Uxie and demand answers from her, since her little one can't possibly remember anything of last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat if Uxie really made him forget something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, there is still one major problem: where is Uxie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo many questions in her mind, Mesprit decides that she needs to be alone for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm sorry,</span>\" she says to the Lucario, trying to sound polite.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I need... I need some privacy...</span>\" she speaks, rising herself from the lakebed and hovering upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, before the jackal can say anything, she had already left for an unknown destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back inside of the cave, you are going nuts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back and forth, trying to come up with an answer. Why can't you remember anything of last night? You remember sleeping with Mesprit, but then?<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Azelf, did I do something wrong to Mesprit? Why did she look so... sad?\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">First, could you stop walking on my belly? It tickles,</span>\" you halt yourself. The giantess smirks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Thank you. Relax, will you? You made it up to her. Heck, you slept together! Do you sleep talk?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"... No?\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Then, you didn't say nothing wrong either. So, Mesprit isn't like that because of you,</span>\" she states.<br>\r\n\"Alright. But why I can't seem to remember anything after going to sleep?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf shrugs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Well, it's normal to not remember exactly everything when you wake up. Maybe-</span>\" the giantess abruptly stops as she casually looks in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her gigantic, golden eyes widening.<br>\r\n\"... Maybe...?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Nothing.</span>\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you find her large paws coming down on you, pushing your whole being down as she embraces you for no apparent reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her. And you recognize the look she's giving you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same shocked and dejected look that Mesprit gave you earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Mesprit, now Azelf?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What does this mean?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She was happy not a minute ago</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted by your own stomach growling, reminding you that you haven't eaten anything since you woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf gives a dejected smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Let's go get you something to eat, shall we?</span>\" she says, shaking her head, as if she just imagined something weird. Or as if she <i>noticed</i> something weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her stomach growls too. You, who are still being pinned against it, experience what might be compared to several earthquakes occurring at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess giggles softly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And let's go get me something to eat.</span>\" she says, slowly moving upwards, and flying out of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDejected, Mesprit dips herself into the warm waters of Lake Verity. The same lake she calls her own home. The same lake where she intended to bring her little one, who was curious to explore around when she first brought him here after... it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince her heat was momentarily relieved - and so was her scent - there is no risk of pokemon slipping up inside her like happened to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Mesprit can now think freely without anyone bothering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slips up to her neck into the water, and closes her eyes, trying to relax and collect her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, she'd rather be at Lake Acuity right now, forget this situation and play with her cute little one for the all the day long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe imagines herself now, but with him in the water with her while they-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes the thought off. She has to figure this out first. She has to figure out why Uxie had erased her human's memories. What she made him forget. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit simply stays afloat for what seems an eternity, but is in reality an hour or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can't really find answers to her many questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why did Uxie wipe away his memories?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit opens her eyes again, tears starting to form again. Why can't she find the answer? Why didn't she listen to that Lucario? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Little one... what did she do to you? What did you do to make her erase your memories?</span>\" Mesprit asks to nobody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are those two?\" you ask Azelf, while she eats berries from a small pile she gathered. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I don't know.</span>\" she replies after swallowing a mouthful of fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I think of it... I didn't see Uxie at all today,\" the giantess, who has grabbed another mouthful of berries, nearly chokes at your statement.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I... Uh... Me neither,</span>\" she says nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Azelf has a good reason to be nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she looked at you in the eyes, she quickly understood why Mesprit was so upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes were glowing yellow. And, although the yellow is starting to fade from them, it still can be seen. And Azelf knows as well what that glow is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chose, though, to not worry her new human friend with a revelation that would shock him, and decides to have a talk with Uxie whenever she shows up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat reason could she have had to wipe the human's memories away? After he 'fixed' her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf shakes her head. She already had her own heat problems, nobody to help her and now this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe life of a guardian is already stressful as it is, there is really no need for more problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thought is interrupted as she ends up biting her own paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a cry of pain, she takes notice that she ate all the berries while she was lost in her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then notices the human snickering.<br>\r\n\"Heh, I tried to warn you. You totally ignored me,\" you laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf frowns for a moment, before giggling, deciding to let it slide.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Should have been more careful,</span>\" she says, moving a paw to pat your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you thinking about? You seemed pretty... thoughtful...\" you remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess flushes red.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Ehm... I was thinking about my Lake,</span>\" she lies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her gaze locks on you. And all of sudden, her heat becomes unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, no pokemon has ever volunteered to help her since she grew to 200ft. But whoever said it had to be a pokemon? This human had already been with Uxie, then with Mesprit, and in a single day, showing that he isn't scared of such experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps he was at first. But after doing it twice, he isn't anymore for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould he help her as well? Would he be okay with that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, Azelf... why are you staring at me like that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Huh?</span>\" she asks, snapped back to reality by the sound of your voice.<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling alright?\" you ask, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf sighs. She's alone with you. Mesprit and Uxie are gone to Arceus knows where. And her urges are rising more and more each second that passes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow or never, she decides. For now, she'll put everything, your problem and her responsibilities, aside, to focus on one thing: quenching her heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">No, I'm not,</span>\" she replies to your question closing her eyes.<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\" you ask, stepping closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens her eyes to give you the most heart-shattering pair of puppy eyes you've ever seen. Even though her intimidating size, that stare successfully melts your heart.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I... I have a problem...</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What problem?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before realization hits you like a rock that was thrown at you.<br>\r\n\"Noo. You're not talking about that problem. You don't mean that. You-\" <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I'm afraid yes, dear,</span>\" she interrupts, while confirming your thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour open palm connects with your forehead.<br>\r\n\"Crap...\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf doesn't give any sign of having heard you, and continues:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">So, er... I was wondering if you... if you could please... if you want of course... ifyou'dliketohelpmeout.</span>\" she hastily says the last part, closing her eyes and moving her head elsewhere, a massive blush spreading across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few steps back. You woke up, feeling great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, first Azelf and Mesprit act weird, now this?<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf looks at you again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Please?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Alright...\" you reply with a sigh, although unsure of how Mesprit would react if she finds out about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Mesprit's not here, and you're doing it just to help... plus, she doesn't need to know it, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing your affermative reply, Azelf smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou discover her paws reaching out for you as she picks you up and pulls you in an embrace.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Thank you.</span>\" she whispers with sincere gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, slowly, she breaks the hug, and carefully places you back down on the snow-covered grass, before nervously sitting in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">So... er...</span>\" she says with a nervous smile while spreading her legs, revealing her slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, and give another sigh as you start walking towards her...</span></div></div>",

Just know that I appreciate your help with this. I-I trust you.</span>\" she stammers, clearly uncomfortable with the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she already made up her mind. She wants - she needs! - you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding to her, you start walking once again, past her feet and in between her legs, towards her awaiting sex which, judging by her crotch growing moist, is eager to receive some relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath, inhaling the scent of Azelf's heat which, like her sisters', smells heavenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertain of how to start, you reluctantly place you hand on Azelf's slit, not quite knowing what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, embarrassed and unsure at once, you start rubbing her crotch slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue mountain reacts instantaneously: her eyes close, her tails twitch and a sharp moan pours from her lips. A non-verbal and yet very clear acknowledgement: you're doing something right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" you mutter, your other, free hand joining in with the first one as you increase both your rubbing and the pleasure Azelf is feeling right now, you can tell by her moans escaping her mouth more frequently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without any warning, the giantess suddenly lays down on her back. As a result, the ground shakes beneath you for several seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her concerned, fearing that you might have hurt her, but your concerns are greeted by the sight of Azelf spreading her legs, meaning that she just shifted into a more comfortable position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Please... I need more...</span>\" you hear her pant, telling you that she's still far from satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, obedient, you walk towards her once again, resuming your rubbing on her vagina, occasionally speeding up or slowing down as you pleasure the blue titaness at top of your skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Azelf, she's feeling ecstatic! The human... no - HER human is doing a great job in pleasuring her. Her eyes are shut closed, her heart gallops within her chest, her arms and legs flail around frenetically, and her tails swing with the same frenetic fashion of her limbs, almost hitting you a couple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth drools, her belly rises up and falls down along the rather fast rhythm of her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all feels... great! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf didn't have this kind of pleasure for a long time, when she was still normal sized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she grew this big, not many pokemon - if no pokemon at all! - agreed to help her... or get anywhere near her. Sure, being the willpower pokemon meant that she could have forced some pokemon to grant her desires, but she wasn't the type to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this tiny human, he's the only one that has willingly agreed to help her so far. And Azelf quickly understands why Mesprit loves him that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep going, rubbing, licking or even biting the pokemon's slit until Azelf is no longer able to contain herself anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I... ngh... watch out!</span>\" she manages to say as a river of her own juices literally flies out of her, hitting you with such strength that you are sent back down on the ground, like you were just swept away by a tidal wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before you can think of getting up, you find that you can't... and you discover yourself glowing blue.<br>\r\n\"...Azelf?\" you call out for the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">S-St-t-till a-a b-bit... P-Please...!</span>\" she stammers as you are moved by a psychic force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can complain, though, you are psychically shoved inside of the giantess' vagina, which closes behind you, sealing your puny form in the darkness of Azelf's moist insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she feels you slip up inside her, Azelf is backed into pure bliss, moans starting to escape her mouth again as she feels the human flailing inside the most sensible part of her body.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Ah... ngh... ooh...</span>\" she moans incoherently as the human squirms inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirm within the dark, hot, sticky, tight and wet insides of Azelf's sex, hearing her howling in pleasure as you struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Please... that's lovely... don't stop!</span>\" the blue pokemon encourages you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting that she needs to be satiated for good, you squirm even faster while you start to worship Azelf's vaginal walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lick, rub, slide your whole body against their length, while also crawling upwards - where light pours inside her sex - and downwards - in the dark depths of Azelf - and squirming frenetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou even try tickling, or even pummeling your surroundings, trying everything that you can think of to fully satisfy the lustful giantess, the paradisiac scent of her heat growing stronger and stronger, threatening to make you faint within the psychic type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Azelf is in heaven, screaming, moaning, <i>howling</i> in pure pleasure as she feels your intensified activity inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil she can't hold it in anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a last, ear-shattering scream, the giantess orgasms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of white, wonderful smelling love juice flows towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can act, you are hit with great strength as you...</span></div></div>",

You also take notice that you're laying back down on the hard ground, which lacks of any snow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, all the snow around the body of Azelf seems to have molten. Also, it seems that some kind of liquid is insistently hitting your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you get back on your feet and notice that you're still by Azelf's dripping crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing faintly, you back away from it, and take a better look at the giantess; she's laying on the ground, her face completely red, her tails inordinately scattered on the grassy floor while her breath is shaken by her panting, her belly rising up and sinking back down at a rather fast rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">L-Lit-tle...</span>\" she mutters, unable to talk properly. You however understand that she is concerned about you. You didn't make any actual sound when you came out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here,\" you reassure her while walking up to her face. You see a concerned look shifting into a smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Y-You... w-wonderful...</span>\" she stammers.<br>\r\n\"Just helping a friend! I said I was ready for everything, and I meant it!\" you proudly exclaim. Azelf's smile widens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after a good amount of time, the blue mountain finally recovers. Aided by her paws, she slowly gets back up, while you busily clean yourself from her juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you find a large paw wrapping around your lower body as Azelf rises you up to her smiling face.<br>\r\n\"... Er... feeling alright?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Alright? That's not even close! I feel great!</span>\" the giantess chimes gleefully.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And it's all thanks to you little sweetie,</span>\" she adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't reply. However, the red shade on your cheeks does it for you. Azelf, continues:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You have my sincere gratitude. What can I do to repay you?</span>\" she says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, first off, not a word about this. Nobody must know, alright? Especially, NOT Mesprit.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Deal. Anything else?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Hmm... no. I'm fine with this,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Azelf smiles again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Okay! Then just accept my thanks... and this...</span>\" she chimes. You watch as her large lips pucker and dart forward, pressing on your left cheek as she smooches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls back, snickering. And, although you can't see it, you can definitely feel your face going red as a tamato berry.<br>\r\n\"You're welcome...\" you reply, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to both the legendary and the human, someone was watching them. Specifically, a Lucario and a Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mesprit flew away, refusing to listen to them, they decided to check on the human instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they were greeted with the sight of him... pleasuring the giant legendary.<br>\r\n\"<u>Damn. He did it again.</u>\" Lucario grumbles as he and Vaporeon retreat in the depths of the forest.<br>\r\n\"<u>He couldn't remember our words. He has no fault, Lucario.</u>\" the Vaporeon says.<br>\r\n\"<u>I know.</u>\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, the two stop, safely hidden by dozens of trees and bushes. Nobody could possibly see or hear them talking, with the exception of some pokemon passing by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough that would be no big deal. Almost every pokemon that inhabits Lake Acuity knows about the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad news travel fast; dangerous news travel at light speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>What will happen now?</u>\" Vaporeon asks with a hint of worry.<br>\r\n\"<u>Give them a few days. For now, the three legendaries won't be a problem. But when their heat will strike back...</u>\" he doesn't finish his sentence, and shudders.<br>\r\n\"<u>Poor human...</u>\" Vaporeon says with a dejected look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an annoyed huff, Mesprit decides that she's had enough of thinking and slowly rises herself from the water of Lake Verity, while mentally scolding herself for not being able to find the solution to this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome pokemon flee at the sight of the giant guardian getting out of the water and shaking herself dry. She spent at the least the past two hours trying to come up with an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little success. In fact, she still has two big questions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why Uxie erased his memories?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where is she?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sheds a tear, and briefly thinks about her little one. And she decides that she needs to hug him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, slowly, she flies upwards, before hovering in direction of Lake Acuity once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Mesprit hovers above the water of the Lake her sister  protects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then floats into the forest, in search of the cave where her human and Azelf are. Or, at least, it's where they were when she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, she suddenly halts in front of a blue, huge pokemon who's sitting on the ground, holding a human in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon noticing Mesprit, Azelf rises her head. And so do you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mesprit! Where have you been? Why did you look so upset earlier? And why are you looking at me like that?\" you ask, taking notice that she's eyeing you intently, with an indecipherable expression painted on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of replying, she leans forward, gently snatching you from Azelf and hugging you against her face.<br>\r\n\"Uh... what is this for...? Are... Are you feeling alright?\" you ask, looking at her pink eyelids, which currently cover her eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">It's... It's nothing. I'm fine.</span>\" she replies with a somewhat dejected voice, while opening her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder an answer, before noticing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Everything doesn't look yellow anymore!\" you exclaim excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch both Mesprit and Azelf exchanging weird looks at this. Also, you see Azelf nodding to her sister solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can question it, though, Mesprit looks back at you, this time with a small smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">That's... that's good, sweetheart,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find her leaning down as she carefully lets you on the ground.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Now, if you'll excuse us, me and Azelf need to have a... a girl talk!</span>\" she says nervously, while Azelf gets up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Uh, yeah! We... uh... later!</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the two hastily turn their backs to you and disappear into the forest in a blink of an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there, dumbfounded, for a few moments. You blink a few times, trying to understand what just happened.<br>\r\n\"... Was it something I said...?\" you ask to nobody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Tell me that you noticed as well,</span>\" Mesprit says dropping her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nods. Well hidden inside of the same cavern they spent the night in, they can talk freely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">The human's eyes. Uxie...</span>\" she mutters.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yes.</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">But why? I mean, he didn't anything wrong to her...<br>\r\ndid he?</span>\" Azelf asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Not at all! He helped her around the Lake... and he...</span>\" Mesprit closes her eyes, bites her lip and clenches her fists remembering HER human next to an unconscious Uxie after they-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Leave this aside, Mesprit. If he didn't do anything wrong... then why did Uxie wipe his memories away?</span>\" Azelf asks, growing annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, the human 'fixed' her as well. The least she can do is care about the very first mate she's had in ten years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I don't know! What reason did she have?!</span>\" Mesprit shouts, causing some dust to fall from the ceiling of the cave.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Calm down, Mesprit. There's only one thing to do: for now, let's forget about it. The human has no clue about it, and he doesn't need to. Do you want to freak him out?</span>\" Azelf says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit nods, silently agreeing with her sister:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What do we do then?</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Easy. We wait for Uxie, we make her talk. She'll have to return sooner or later. I mean, this is HER Lake, after all. She can't avoid her duties forever,</span>\" Azelf states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer logic makes sense, although Mesprit has another question:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What if she doesn't want to talk?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue giantess smirks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Trust me, she <i>will</i>.</span>\" she snickers, causing Mesprit to smile as well.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Alright. Now let's go back to the human. I bet he's worried.</span>\" Mesprit says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nods as the two start floating towards the exit of the cave.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You know what, sister? You should find a mate as well. You're really starting to smell weird.</span>\" Mesprit giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf flushes red, but internally sighs in relief. Luckily, Mesprit mistook the smell of sex for the smell of her heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't want to know what her pink headed sister would do if she ever finds out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit against a few trees, patiently waiting from the two sisters to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but wonder, though, why the two were looking so agitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery concern you have fades as a shadow engulfs you. Before you can even look up, you are picked by a smiling, pink and blue titaness.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hi cutie! Missed us? I sure missed you!</span>\" Mesprit chimes, her cheerful attitude back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and notice Azelf hovering next to her sister. <br>\r\n\"Er... so... what now?\" you ask them, somewhat eager for whatever they've got in store... everything, except Mesprit's emotion games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two legendaries exchange two smiles, silently warning each other to not say a word about what the human mustn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stare at each other for a few seconds, before looking back down at you and replying...</span></div></div>",

And the human is-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf!\" she hears a cry coming from deep within her body. A cry coming from the depths of her uterus. The giantess blushes wildly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Heh... I'm sorry... I'll get you out...</span>\" she mutters, her golden eyes closing up as she focuses on the struggles within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering a bit with pleasure, Azelf detects your body deep within hers. Her mind sends a forceful thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of her womb, you struggle, trying to get to the entrance of it to get out of here. However, you soon find that it's not necessary; your body is suddenly embraced by psychic energy as your dark, sticky surroundings disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughly, you materialize and fall flat on your face on a soft surface.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hehe, whoops! I guess I crossed the line a little bit...</span>\" Azelf says. A gigantic, strong paw grabs the back of your shirt and gets you back to your feet.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Sorry!</span>\" Azelf nervously says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Now, we need to get cleaned up. My sister-</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Is right here, Azelf.</span>\" a familiar voice speaks from above, sending shivers down Azelf's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<span class=\"cpblue\">I'm dead.</span>\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Azelf watch with horror as a familiar giantess hovers down, stopping a few feet above the grass around Lake Acuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid giantess has a pink head, and two golden eyes, which are currently glaring daggers at her sister Azelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's gaze shifts on you. Seeing you there in her sister's paw, covered in her juices makes her heart pound the walls inside her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened again. First Uxie, then Azelf. How many other times Mesprit will have to deal with this?! She was already trying to deal with the fact that her sister took the human's memories, now this?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit moves her lips, but no sound comes out of them. How could her own sister betray her like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can make her thoughts clear to Azelf though, said pokemon suddenly speaks up:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I'm sorry!</span>\" she starts.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I couldn't resist it anymore!</span>\" she says, her gaze traveling to you. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">But the human - it isn't his fault! I insisted, and he's just a little sweetie who consented so kindly...</span>\" Azelf decide to let the fault of this fall entirely on her - also because it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human consented only because she had asked. Plus, she could handle Mesprit's rage. If needed, she could take her willpower until her sister calmed down. But the human, he wouldn't be able to face Mesprit's ire, so the only thing to prevent her from blaming him was to assume the responsibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Azelf's words hit something within Mesprit. Again, the golden eyes of the giantess fix on you, who stare back at her in silence, your vocal chords paralyzed with terror.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Y-You... consented?</span>\" Mesprit asks, feeling betrayed. Betrayed by Azelf, betrayed by Uxie... betrayed by the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho else could betray her today?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit closes her eyes. She wants to cry, she wants to scream... but instead, she feels her cheeks burning hot and her nether regions starting to itch. Her heat just came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit opens her eyes again, fixing on you a lustful gaze. Perhaps, she can give the human the chance to be forgiven again after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit...\" you try, but a move of her paw cuts you off.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You know what? I don't even care anymore.</span>\" she says with a calm voice, taking both you and Azelf by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's paw closes into a fist, leaving out her index finger, which she points to you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You,</span>\" she starts, hovering forward.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Me,</span>\" she continues, her paw extending.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Alone,</span>\" she snatches you from Azelf, who floats back, not daring to interrupt.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">N-O-W!</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing you can do is meekly nod your head. Mesprit gives a \u2018mmmph\u2019, before turning to her sister, who returns the gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stare at each other for a whole minute, before Mesprit floats off, you solidly enclosed in her fist as she leaves Azelf behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when her sister fully disappeared, Azelf dares to sigh in relief.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Went better than expected.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are roughly placed on the floor of the cavern where you spent the night. Ignoring the pain in your ankles, you look up to Mesprit, finding her busy spreading her legs wide. You notice that familiar smell emanating from her nether regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess fixes on you an expectant gaze.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Come on.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, can I say I'm sorry?\" you say. A smirk suddenly finds its way on the giantess' lips.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Sure you can. Now, get to work. Based on how good you are, I'll decide whether you will be or not forgiven.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, you walk towards her revealed sex and place your hands on the surface as you start to rub, immediately getting Mesprit to moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting that you're doing something right, you speed up, then slow down. Speed up and slow down, pleasuring the giantess at top of your abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the giantess isn't content with mere rubbing.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">That won't be enough. Come up with something new already.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot stopping your massage, you start thinking. How could you please her more...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea suddenly finds its way in your thoughts as you get how can you spice things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands slow down as they're joined by your tongue as you rub and lick the giant organ, making Mesprit moan.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">That's what I'm talking about!</span>\" she cries from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you start rubbing your whole being against the huge organ, getting the giantess moaning in pleasure. Words of appreciation pour out of her mouth as you continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, a wave of white water erupts out of Mesprit as she comes. You leap away just in time to avoid getting soaked with the stuff. Although you already know that you'll soon be literally drowning in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, before Mesprit can even say it, you dash towards her dripping wet vagina, entering it. Mesprit, who stopped moaning for a moment, is backed into pure pleasure as she feels the human squirming within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Y-Yep. Decidedly forgiven, sweetie...</span></i>\u2019 she thinks as a smile spreads on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hehe...</span>\" Mesprit nervously laughs. After the second wave of love juice came out of her, the human wasn't ejected with it, she notices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling movements deep within herself, the giantess has a clue of where he might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, the giantess focuses, her feeling of betrayal fading away to let a smile spread across her cheeks. A moment later, a cum-soaked body appears on her left paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess uses her free paw to clean you up.<br>\r\n\"So...\" Mesprit wipes the stuff from your head, before placing a kiss on your face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Does this answer you, cutie?</span>\" you sheepishly nod your head as Mesprit finishes her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... where were you anyway? And why did you look so upset?... I didn't do anything wrong to you... last night, did I?\" you ask. After apologizing for a few times, you simply had to know why the pokemon giantess looked so upset earlier today, and why she left in such a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh no, you didn't do anything wrong - not last night...</span>\" she replies, eyeing you with a look that screams \u2018I dare you to do it again\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choose to ignore it.<br>\r\n\"But then... what was going on with you?\" you ask with concern.</span></div></div>",

You never know what might happen while you're away.</span>\" the explanation makes perfect sense, so you nod your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess closes her eyes and smiles brightly. The human bought her lie. He's completely clueless about what Uxie did to him, suggesting that Azelf didn't-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's smile drops as her mind travels back to the primary problem of the day: Uxie erasing the human's memories for no apparent reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, for some reason, she's gone hiding from her sisters. The very one pokemon that always told that running away from problems doesn't solve them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit frowns, remembering that she has to find Uxie and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit? What's happening?... what did I do?\" your voice claims her back to reality.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hm?</span>\"<br>\r\n\"You're kinda... glaring at me...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh - no no no no no. I was just thinking about something, don't worry.</span>\" she says. Without giving you time to ask about her thoughts, she gets up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Let's get going, shall we? Otherwise, Azelf might think I did something I would regret.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess starts hovering to the exit of the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Should I be worried...?</i>\u2019 you think to yourself, dreading the possibility of an imminent fight between sisters. After all, you were forgiven; Azelf wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, trying to get the thought out of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf sits on the shore of Lake Acuity, her tails submerged in the water while her head rests in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpblue\">What could be Mesprit doing to the human?</span></i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf saw her face earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit didn't want to punish the human, Mesprit wanted him. That couldn't mean anything bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf remembers the talk she had with her sister yesterday. Specifically, she remembers four words, \u2018I love the human\u2019. Azelf can't deny that she feels sorry for what she did to Mesprit... but she also can't deny how good it felt, to finally have her heat soothed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human was the very first living being that offered help, she couldn't let the opportunity escape, could she? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf decides to discard this line of thinking, opting to focus on the problem she found out about earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human's eyes were glowing yellow; Uxie is still missing. The two things are linked by a third fact: Uxie had erased the human's memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question is: why did she do such thing? What reason could Uxie have to make the human look into her eyes? Azelf saw her sister with her eyes open only a few times - and everytime, she hurried to close hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did the human do to make Uxie use her powers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Azelf.</span>\" a familiar voice calls the giantess from behind, interrupting her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf turns around to face Mesprit, who is holding the human.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh. Did you two make up already?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" you respond.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Couldn't stay mad at you~</span>\" Mesprit chirps, nudging you with her head, almost throwing you off her open palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her thoughts, Azelf smiles. She's about to tell how adorable the scene looked, but she quickly swallows her words as she remembers that Mesprit probably didn't forgive her yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Mesprit I'm so-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Save it. I am quite happy now. So I'll forgive you. Just-</span>\" Mesprit is interrupted as Azelf gets up and grabs her in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gesture would have been adorable, if it wasn't for the fact that the sudden hug made Mesprit throw her paws in the air, throwing you about 215 ft above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips several beats, and you scream out in terror as you fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the psychic intervention of both sisters saves you from becoming a red mess on the ground.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Whoops! Sorry!</span>\" Azelf exclaims as you are floated back in the relative safety of Mesprit's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart resumes its beating, and your face slowly - very slowly - regains color.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">As I was saying: Just don't do that again.</span>\" Mesprit says to her sister.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Sure thing. Or, sure things.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two hiding?\" you ask the two legendaries, who are currently speaking in their natural language - repeating their names over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Don't worry about it.</span>\" Mesprit says with a quick glance at you, before going back to speaking with Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not worried, I'm curious. You two are hiding something from me, I'm sure of it.\" you say, trying to not sound too defiant.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">It's nothing, really. Just, uh, family stuff.</span>\" Azelf lies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What about Uxie?\" your words have the extraordinary result to interrupt their speeches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sighed, before turning to you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">It's Uxie we are talking about.</span>\" she reveals. You rise an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">We... We can't seem to find her anywhere, and we're kinda...</span>\" Azelf says. Mesprit finishes her sentence:<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">... Worried about her.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing - or not remembering - what happened to you, you nod your head, buying the explanation. <br>\r\n\"I'm sure she's fine. I mean, what could could possibly hurt her?\" you say, trying to be positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, for a moment, you catch a glimpse of something transparent behind Azelf and Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like... a shadow. And, for some reason, it has a vaguely familiar shape...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your eyes; when you open them, the shadow is gone. The two legendaries in front of you look back, discovering nothing.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hey, are you alright?</span>\" Mesprit asks concerned.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">What did you see?</span>\" Azelf questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate before answering:<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two legendary sisters look at you confused for a few moments, before shrugging at the same time.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hey, could you take a walk or something? We kinda need some privacy...</span>\" Mesprit says you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug and nod your head, guessing that they need to talk about something important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, starting to venture into the forest, leaving Azelf and Mesprit behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk for about half an hour, exploring the woods around Lake Acuity. You've always liked exploring. That was the whole reason of your meeting with the three legendaries. If it wasn't for Uxie, you would probably be a frozen sculpture in the middle of nowhere right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou empty your mind of these bad thoughts and keep walking, enjoying the silent nature around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you stop as a mysterious smell catches your nose. You sniff the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn inviting smell of pecha berries just spread around you. You turn around, moving a step towards it... only to stop right after. What if it's a trap?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering about certain thieving - not to mention perverted - Sneasel that live around here, the idea of a trap doesn't sound so improbable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you don't recall such ice/dark types using sweet scents to lure people or pokemon into traps. It's the exact opposite, they prefer to sneak behind their victim and attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe there's some grass type around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, maybe this sweet smell isn't a trap after all, and you're curious enough to find out about it's source. Whether to follow the smell or not, it's up to you.</span></div></div>",

The chances that this smell is a trap are the same ones that it is not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with a shrug, you decide to investigate the source of it. You move a step in its direction. Then another, and another as you walk towards whatever is producing this sweet scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gust of cold wind blows past you, but you ignore it. You're genuinely curious, and you want to find out what this smell is, so you grit your teeth, adjust your jacket and keep walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason you can't explain, you feel like someone is watching you... you shake your head to rid yourself of the feeling and go on, deeper into this seemingly endless forest, intending to satiate your curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent gets stronger and stronger each step you take, and your ears start to catch faint noises... you listen attentively, capturing muffled words. It's almost like whatever, or whoever is producing the sweet scent you are chasing is trying to be as quiet as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour walk soon comes to an end though. A literal vegetal barrier made by several trees blocks your path. However, the smell here is stronger than ever, and the whispering became a little bit more loud, though still not loud enough to allow you to<br>\r\nhear the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo curious to let it slide, you start rubbing your head, trying to find a way to get past these trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere ought to be one, there must be one. You just need to find it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the two legendary giantesses you left behind keep talking to each other. The human had left a while ago, allowing them to talk freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they have quite a lot to discuss about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">So, let's see: what reason could Uxie have to do such thing to the human?</span>\" Azelf asks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Azelf, that's the first problem: we don't know,</span>\" Mesprit replies.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And the human can't possibly remember. The only way to get answers would be asking Uxie, but-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">She's hiding from us. Look, can you detect her presence?</span>\" Mesprit closes her eyes, trying to feel her sister psychically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the attempt goes poorly: Mesprit can't feel her. Uxie is probably blocking her sisters' psychic powers. After all, the pixie has the strongest mind power, and she knows how to use that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">She's keeping us from finding her.</span>\" Mesprit states.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Exactly. So, we have another problem: we need to find her.</span>\" Azelf says. Her sister shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Right. How do we find her? We can't detect her, but she can detect us. I've already searched Sinnoh and I've found nothing. If we get too close, she'll see us coming and she will flee...</span>\" Mesprit reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">We need a plan.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had found a way to get past these trees, the problem is how to realize it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you walk towards the shortest tree you find - which is huge anyway - and place your hands on the trunk. Then, you place your left foot on the roots and your right one on the trunk as you start climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, your left foot leaves the ground as well as you get a bit higher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot without difficulty, you manage to climb up to the first, lowest branch of the tree.<br>\r\n\"Wow... that's harder than I thought...\" you say, envying the Pachirisu you see on the higher branches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter resting for a bit, you resume climbing, desperately trying to ignore the vertigo while remembering to absolutely not look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you manage to climb to the higher branches of this tree. You stop on a particularly high one and stop to rest. Then, remembering your objective, you peek your head through the branches, inhaling again the mysterious smell, and hearing muffled words again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the way too thick vegetation still blocks your view. So, the only way to find out the whole thing is to climb down, to the other side of the barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly, you start climbing down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when you're at a few feet above the ground, you leap down, landing softly on the snow-covered grass.<br>\r\n\"Done...\" you mutter, before looking around, discovering a small path to your left. The scent, and the whispering are coming from there, you realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily walk towards it. But your walk comes to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice what - or rather who - is making that smell as you see...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The path ends with a small, secluded clearing. You notice a titanic body sitting there, back turned to you. Said body is furry, azure in color and with a yellow, round head; two twin tails rest on the ground behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a big smile as you call out:<br>\r\n\"Hey Uxie!\" the giantess' head perks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, that head turns around, pointing two closed eyes in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie feels her heart sinking as she sees you walking towards her smiling, suggesting that you didn't find out about what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is a good thing. But the giantess feels comprehensibly guilty about it.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Oh, it's you...</span>\" she says, smiling a little as you halt beside her.<br>\r\n\"Yep! Good morning!\" the titaness giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I believe it's a bit late for that...</span>\" she responds.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But, say... this was your first night here. How did you sleep? Was it good?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I slept like a rock! I don't know what you did last night to soothe me, but it was great! Thanks!\" you exclaim, leaning forward and getting an armload of fur as you gratefully hug Uxie's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie's heart leaps within her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had deleted the human's memories and he was grateful! This only contributed to make her feel worse.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I did nothing at all. Thank the Lake,</span>\" Uxie says, remembering the excuse she had made up last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snicker in response.<br>\r\n\"Good one!\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You're sweet. But you're missing something...</span>\" the giantess says.<br>\r\n\"What am I missing?\" you ask, finally releasing her fur.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">My arms are up here.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even a second later, you are grabbed and brought against the giantess' chest as she hugs you tightly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Better, don't you think?</span>\" she chimes.<br>\r\n\"Can't deny it.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie smiles even more. You couldn't possibly know about her internal pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess woke up early this morning, finding you sleeping with her. Recalling the reason of why you were laying on her chest, she gently put you down and left the cave to come here - the most secluded area of Lake Acuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to do some thinking; the whispering you heard earlier was coming from Uxie herself, who was thinking aloud. About what reason might have made you want to leave her and her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a self-imposed task, she simply had to find out. Otherwise, the giantess isn't going to forgive herself for wiping your memories away anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, you had found her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie is unsure whether your today quite cheerful attitude makes her feel better or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are being cheerful only because you can't remember the heartache you felt last night, when you were firmly intentioned to leave Lake Acuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering about it, Uxie's smile drops. If she never woke up, if she never noticed you leaving, if she never erased your memories, you would have left. Possibly, without ever coming back; the giantess wouldn't have dealt with that so easily, she's sure of it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie decides to rid her head from these sad thoughts. She returns to reality. And she hears your voice calling her:<br>\r\n\"Uxie?... Don't misunderstand me, this is adorable, but a hug isn't supposed to last this long...\" you say.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hm?</span>\" she replies, casually looking down to notice that she is, in fact, still hugging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks go from yellow to crimson red.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Oh, ehm, sorry,</span>\" she sheepishly says, while releasing you, letting you sit on her left, open palm.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I was thinking.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Say, you did manage to find me here. That was pretty clever of you,</span>\" the titaness compliments. Only to earn a questioning stare from you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">This is the most private place around Lake Acuity.<br>\r\nCome on, tell me, how did you find me?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I followed this sweet scent that led me here. I climbed up those trees and-\" <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Sweet scent? What are you talking about?</span>\" Uxie interrupts, curious about the scent you talked about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there was this sweet smell. I initially thought it was a trap of those Sneasel, but then I decided to follow it. It led me here,\" you pause to laugh a bit.<br>\r\n\"And it was just you! The last living being who would harm anybody else!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Uxie's heart pounds the insides of her chest with the force of what might be compared to Arceus' Judgement. And a dark type one. However, the pixie focuses on what you told her. Otherwise, she would have started crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Sweet scent...?</span>\" she parrots back, trying to figure out what you are talking about.<br>\r\n\"Yep. It was - Hey...\" you pause to sniff the air. Again, that wonderful scent of pecha berries. And it's coming from down below.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">What?</span>\" <br>\r\n\"I can smell it again...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenuinely curious, Uxie emulates your actions and sniffs the air, effectively picking up on a sweet smell... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guardian's face goes from yellow to white, then from  white to bright red as she realizes what the smell is. So lost in her thoughts, she didn't even notice it earlier... is it really that strong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uxie? Are you feeling fine?\" you ask, noticing the shift of color her face went through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I-I think I know what this smell is... this is so embarrassing...</span>\" she mutters.<br>\r\n\"Embara-\" you suddenly understand.<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" is all you can say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cyellow\">Stupid heat... go away... it's not the right time...</span></i>\u2019 Uxie thinks as she starts to feel the effects of the problem; her body burns with lust, her nether regions start to become bothersome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you are here with her... nobody else knows of this place... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie mentally slaps herself. After what she's done to you, how can she even consider it? True, you don't know about it, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess grits her teeth. No, it isn't the time for morality, she decides. Her needs to be satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the giantess in pain, you feel a huge urge to help... only to remember that Mesprit already got angry with you twice already. If you do it again, she might not forgive you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously pretend to cough, awaiting for the fateful question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich doesn't take long to come:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">H-Human... I'm sorry, but... m-mind lending me a hand... ag-gain?</span>\" she stammers with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou purposely breath in deeply. That gives you a few seconds to think, whether you should help Uxie or keep the non verbal promise you made to Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, you exhale what you took in as you open your mouth to reply:</span></div></div>",

Clearly, the titaness isn't totally comfortable with the whole thing, even though you've done it once already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the confirm you were seeking for, you nod your head and move a step towards the giantess' sex. Then, you take another as you start walking, soon getting past her feet and legs, stopping by her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...\" you say, the last remains of your uncertainty trying to fight back the determination to help Uxie.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Just do it... please...</span>\" these four, simple words shatter your resistance like glass as you, once again, nod your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you look forward, both your arms extending as you press your open palms onto the fur covering the warm flesh that lays beneath it.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Oh!</span>\" the giantess cries from above, signaling you her first wave of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore the moan, and keep rubbing, occasionally speeding up or slowing down as you try to pleasure the lustful titaness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're doing something good, it seems, you can tell from the pleased mutterings coming out of the giantess' mouth along with moans of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you decide that mere rubbing won't get you  nowhere, and you opt to spice things up. You start rubbing more vigorously, your nails starting to scratch the flesh of Uxie's sex; your fingertips slide along the length of the gigantic lips as you try tickling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you accomplish are giggles, moans and grunts of pleasure coming out of her mouth, replaced by deep breaths. All while the flesh and the fur grows wetter and wetter, the blue fur starting to get stained with white stuff you recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, before you even know it, Uxie moans louder than before, and you barely register the stream of juice that rivers out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a quick leap back, avoiding getting touched by the fluid, before looking up to the giantess; her once yellow face has turned completely red, her chest rises and falls in a frenetic fashion along with her breath, which sped up. Her tails flail weakly behind her, suggesting that they've been swinging through the whole process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I can imagine the answer, but... are you satisfied?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk paints on the giantess' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives no response, but her paws travel to her crotch. Her lips are pulled apart, and Uxie shoots you an expectant look... at least, you can assume it's an expectant look. It's hard to tell since her eyes are always closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, getting the gist of her message, you nod as you once again walking past her legs and slide into her sex, your view getting eclipsed as she closes her lips back up, enjoying having your body within hers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world is squeezed as the walls around you connect, almost breaking your bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie just collapsed on her side, you judge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, the giantess quickly rolls on her back as a second wave of her love juice erupts around you, washing you out into the light again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich soon gets obscured as a giant paw grabs you and carelessly brings you up, towards the smiling face of the titaness.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Y-You... w-wonderful... t-thanks...</span>\" she stammers. You dismissively wave a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie rests on her back for a couple of minutes, before placing the elbow of her free arm on the ground as she sits up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You were perfect,</span>\" she says, her free paw finding its way to you as she starts cleaning you from her juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing...\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Stop being modest. You helped me again, I can't even find the words to express my gratitude...</span>\" she says. All the red blood cells in your body choose this moment to move to your cheeks as you blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">And for that,</span>\" Uxie continues, wiping the last drops off your body as she cleans you up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I think you deserve a reward.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What rewa-ah!\" you exclaim as a large pair of yellow lips physically assaults you, Uxie smooching you over and over until you're completely breathless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls off, giggling merrily while you stumble on her paw, trying to not lose your footing.<br>\r\n\"Warn me next time...\" you dizzily mumble, before shaking off the nausea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought then penetrates your mind.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think I should go back to Azelf and Mesprit now... it's been hours since I left them...\" you say, before recalling something.<br>\r\n\"Actually, they're searching for you. They look pretty... worried...\" you reveal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie's head perks up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Worried...?</span>\" she parrots back, before realizing. Azelf and Mesprit aren't worried, they're searching for her because they want answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost probably, they found out about what Uxie herself did... Maybe, they were the ones sending the human to find her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she decides, the human looks clueless. He would have never agreed if he knew what she did to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uxie...?\" your voice cuts off her thoughts. Uxie looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Listen, I nee-</span>\" Uxie is interrupted as she hears a voice crying:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\"><b>Human? Where are you?</b></span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and the giantess recognize the voice.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">And she's looking for you...</span>\" the Uxie mutters, before continuing:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Listen, you must go now. But, please, don't tell my sisters that I'm here,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay?... Any reason?\" you ask, curious.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I can't tell now. Just promise,</span>\" the giantess sees the skeptical look on your face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... Pretty please?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug.<br>\r\n\"Alright. I promise.\" you reply. Uxie smiles and leans forward, briefly pecking you, before muttering a \u2018See you later\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, your surroundings fade as the giantess teleports you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you regain the ability to see, you look around, finding yourself back on the other side of the vegetal barrier you got past earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you expected to see a certain giantess around. But instead, no one. Which is weird. Mesprit wouldn't go anywhere unseen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound draws your attention. You turn your head to notice a creature flapping its wings, before stopping on a tree. And you take a good look at it: blue wings, yellow and green chest, white neck and a black, note-shaped head with a big, red beak and a pointy, black tail on the opposite side of its body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Chatot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at it as it stares back at you, before it talks again, in a very familiar voice:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Human! There you are!</span>\" it exclaims, emulating Mesprit's voice. Did this bird just prank you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't make fun of me!\" you exclaim, irritated. The bird snickers.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What? Don't you like playing?</span>\" it says. You growl at it.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Suit yourself, cutie.</span>\" it cries mockingly as it flaps its wings, flying off the tree and into a casual direction. You, however, don't lose sight of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs move on their own. You won't let some random bird make fun of you or the three sisters.<br>\r\n\"Get back here!\" you exclaim with rage.</span></div></div>",

So, hastily, Azelf thinks of a way to get out of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, soon, she comes up with an idea.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Well, we do need to find Uxie after all...</span>\" she mutters, while closing her eyes as she focuses. Soon, the human appears on her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are greeted back to the outside world by the face of an agitated blue giantess.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">H-Hey there,</span>\" Azelf says, smiling a little. Before you can reply, she talks again:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Listen, we don't have much time, Mesprit is coming back... so I need to send you away for a while...</span>\"<br>\r\n\"What?!\" you ask, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Don't worry! I'll just send you to Uxie... You know, if Mesprit finds us like this, we'll be in trouble,</span>\" she says, not mentioning, though, the details of her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie is the most sensible of the trio. So sensible in fact, that a great amount of pleasure disabled her powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being of knowledge had the strongest mind power of the three, and she could easily use that to keep even her sisters from finding her psychically by deviating their own psychic powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, without being able to mask her presence, Uxie could be easily traced. So, Azelf is actually going to send the human to Uxie's-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Alright.\" you reply, knowing that Mesprit probably won't be forgiving you for a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nods, and hastily cleans you up from her own juices, before pushing you to her face as she briefly nuzzles you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Thank you~</span>\" she says, before placing a quick kiss on your forehead. You blush as her smooth lips are pressed on your face, before she pulls off, producing a smooching sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the giantess holds you in front of her face. With a smile, Azelf closes her eyes and focuses on you again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">See you later, dear.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even know it, you disappear from her paws in a flash of light. Azelf opens her eyes, giving a sigh. She felt bad for lying to you, but she couldn't risk Mesprit finding her in such state, stained with her own love juices and still red from the love making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, a huge shadow that Azelf recognizes as Mesprit flies over.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hi Mesprit,</span>\" Azelf mutters as her sister flies down to her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Azelf,</span>\" Mesprit begins.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Where's the human...?</span>\" she asks, concerned, before noticing the state her sister is in. The same state Uxie was in yesterday when she had her way with HER human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's dejected look changes into a frown. First Uxie, now Azelf? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How many other times is it going to happen?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf notices Mesprit's face, but says nothing as her sister speaks up:<br>\r\n\"Azelf... you just 'had fun', didn't you...?\" Azelf looks down.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Well, actually yes. It was becoming unbearable, sister,</span>\" Azelf whines.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I understand that, but the human is-</span>\" Azelf looks back up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I didn't do anything to the human. I solved the thing by myself, alright?</span>\" she lies, showing the paw she used to clean you off, resulting in it being still stained with her cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit is taken aback by the explanation, and blushes for thinking bad of Azelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really needed to stop jumping to conclusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Sorry,</span>\" she apologizes. Azelf smiles. She managed to solve her first problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But... where is the human then?</span>\" Mesprit asks again, remembering her first question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf laughs nervously.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hehehe, you see, it's a long story...</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou materialize again, expecting to find yourself in front of a certain yellow headed pixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you get a look of your surroundings, you understand how wrong you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself in a dark, tight space. The walls have a fleshy texture. It's also somewhat damp and sticky in here. Yet, for some reason, this place seems incredibly familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as your eyes start to adjust to the darkness, you move hand to get a hold of something to get on your feet. But, as you touch one of the walls, a loud sound booms through the confined space:<br>\r\n\"<b>Oh!!</b>\" someone shouts. You stay still for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did recognize that voice... Uxie? But... where is she...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization suddenly hits you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf didn't send you to Uxie. Azelf sent you <i>in</i> Uxie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You did what?!</span>\" Mesprit shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf meekly nods her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You do realize, right, that this just wrong? We need to find Uxie, alright, but why imply him in this? I didn't want him to even find out about it!</span>\" Mesprit cries.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And he doesn't! But, by blocking Uxie's powers, we can easily find her wherever she is!</span>\" Azelf retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit remains silent for a few moments, not sure of how to take the thing. She still had to deal with Uxie wiping her human's memories away, now she had to deal with Azelf sending her human inside of Uxie's body? Could her day get any worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, most of all, could her little one's day get any worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Poor my little cutie,</span>\" she whispers dejectedly, letting a tear roll down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Please, tell me it isn't another Sneasel.</span>\" you hear Uxie muttering to herself. <br>\r\n\"What - no! Uxie, it's me!\" you cry at top of your lungs, trying to make her hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, she seems to detect your voice.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... Human?</span>\" <br>\r\n\"Precisely.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">W-What are you doing in there? How did you end up there, dear?</span>\" she stammers, trying to process what is going on.<br>\r\n\"I don't know! Azelf sent me here! She must have done it wrong!\" you cry, your voice sending vibrations through the sticky walls of Uxie's womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the giantess lets out a low moan.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">A-Azelf...?</span>\" Uxie stammers, before realizing what really happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf didn't do anything wrong. It was the exact opposite, she sent the human inside her on purpose! She knew about her weakness, and she used it against her - her own sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf knew all along that she couldn't have used her powers to teleport you out... or deviate the psychic powers of her sisters... they could detect her at any moment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Listen, you have to get out of there. Try to get out. And be q-quick please,</span>\" Uxie begs you.<br>\r\n\"I-I'll try. But it's kinda tight in here...\" you mutter your response, before starting to squirm, trying to get out from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie moans again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Okay, focus now. We must find her,</span>\" Azelf says while closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit the same thing and closes hers as the two focus their psychic powers.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You know that I still don't approve what you did, don't you?</span>\" she says. Azelf opens one eye.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">It may be. But you want to find the human, don't you?</span>\" she retorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit remains silent, and focuses again, imitated by her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several struggles, you finally manage to reach the entrance of Uxie's womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeeze yourself through the tight opening, falling onto the slick and warm floor of her vagina.<br>\r\n\"Uxie! I'll get out now!\" you shout.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Be quick!</span>\" Uxie cries from outside as you start walking in direction of her vertical lips, the giantess letting out moans each and every step you take, making the ground beneath you vibrate as you walk towards the exit.</span></div></div>",

You take a look at yourself, noticing that your clothes are covered in sticky slime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you glance upwards, discovering the familiar yellow face of Uxie, her eyes closed as usual. And yet, those closed eyes of hers are staring right down at you as she lets a small smile spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie breaths in relief as she feels her psychic powers coming back. To make sure that it really happened, she tries using psychic on the human, who starts hovering in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, she opens up her paws and lets the human float into them as she closes him into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're shoved against a wall of smooth, blue fur as Uxie hugs you against her chest.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hi there, dear,</span>\" she says.

It's not like she'll do anything to him! Ehm... maybe? I mean, she li-</span>\" Azelf nervously says. However, Mesprit interrupts:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Do not finish that sentence.</span>\" she says, both annoyed and worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf's plan to find Uxie went poorly. And now her little human was in the paws of the same pokemon who erased his memories for an unknown reason, and both are at an unknown location. Possibly alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Alone.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit yelps, feeling forming tears starting to make her eyes damp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie could easily have her way with her beloved little one and she couldn't do anything about it! Even worse, maybe she already did it. Maybe she even made her little one forget it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the more Mesprit thought about the possibility, the more she self-convinced that it was the only logical explanation. Was Uxie really having the human over and over, only to make him-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's train of thought is cut short as Azelf suddenly places her paws on her shoulders, making her rise her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue giantess felt bad for the human as well - majorly because this situation was her fault. Plus, he was the first mate she's had in years. The least she could do was worry about him.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Come on... staying here will solve nothing...</span>\" she mutters dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sniffles and nods as Azelf helps her up. Then, both hover upwards, leaving Lake Acuity behind as they commenced their quest to find their sister and the human...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we, Uxie? And why are we here?\" you ask Uxie as you glance around, noticing her floating on some sort of island, sea surrounding it. You don't actually know Sinnoh too well, but this definitely isn't Lake Acuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well, we're at Iron Island, home of many steel-types of Sinnoh. And I'm here because I... uh... needed to check something,</span>\" Uxie lies while cleaning off the thin layer of slime covering your comparatively tiny body, mentally scolding herself for not being honest to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut \u2018I needed to think about why I had to erase your memories\u2019 didn't seem like the perfect thing to say...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But tell me, did you sleep well? After your nightmares...?</span>\" Uxie then asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the moment to find out, wether the human had discovered about what she did or he still doesn't have a clue about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah! I had no more problems. I feel great!\" you exclaim happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie breaths in relief. Apparently, the human had no idea of what she did to him last night. Maybe Azelf and Mesprit found out, maybe they're searching for her, but the human is clueless. That's all that matters to her. She'll confront her sisters later on, she decides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">That's nice,</span>\" she replies, pushing you to her face as she nuzzles you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rubs you against her gigantic, yellow face, you extend your arm forward, starting to pet the red gem on her forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie lets out a loud moan:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">OH!</span>\" she exclaims, almost breaking both your eardrums. A blush spread on her cheeks right after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Note to self: red gem is a soft spot,</i>\u2019 you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hehe, sorry about that...</span>\" the pixie mutters, giggling nervously, before adding:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hey, I've got nothing more to do here, so... want to return ho- ehm, Lake Acuity?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already? I mean, I just got here, I kind of wanted to explore around...\" you admit while rubbing the back of your head.<br>\r\n\"Though, if you want to return to the Lake, that's fine with me...\" Uxie smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Oh, no no, the choice is up to you! If you want to stay for a bit longer and explore, I really don't mind.</span>\" she says cheerfully.</span></div></div>",

I love him!</span>\" she remarks, not caring of the red shade spreading on her pink cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<span class=\"cpblue\"><i>So do I,</i></span>\u2019 Azelf thought to herself. Only to assume a flabbergasted expression right after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she just admit to herself that she was in love with a human...? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pact she and her sisters had made, forgotten. All because of a single, little human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Well, that wasn't totally correct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in love with <i>the</i> human. The same sweet little guy who had so kindly helped her with her... physical problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, Azelf can't help but flush red.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Azelf?</span>\" Mesprit calls out, snapping her back to reality.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Uh?</span>\" <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What are you thinking about? You're kinda... red...</span>\" Mesprit points out.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh... ehm... I'm sure it's nothing...</span>\" Azelf replies, before rising her head. Her gaze briefly fixes on the blue sky as she closes her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpblue\">Yep, It's official. That little one stole my heart as well...</span></i>\u2019 she mentally says, blushing even more, letting a small smile spread on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she opens her eyes back up and looks at her pink headed sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't admit around Mesprit. She wouldn't take it exactly good. Also, Mesprit could always feel emotions. One wrong move, and Mesprit could just check Azelf's emotions and find out the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf sweat drops as she watches her sister staring intently at the floor, submerged in her own thoughts about the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpblue\">I need to be careful...</span></i>\u2019 she thinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Mesprit rises her head again. She uses a paw to wipe the tears from her eyes, before fixing her gaze on Azelf.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Come on, sister. We need to find them.</span>\" she says while starting to hover upwards. Azelf nods and follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">I need to find him...</span></i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Home sweet home.</span>\" Uxie mutters while hovering above the waters of Lake Acuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flies over the lake shore and the psychic aura surrounding you fades as Uxie gently picks you from her shoulder with her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">There you go,</span>\" she says, slowly and carefully lowering her paw to ground level.

You're sure that Uxie just asked you something, though you did not hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I actually asked if you wanted to help me...</span>\" she repeats her request.<br>\r\n\"Help you with what?\" you ask back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crane your neck to fully look at the yellow headed pixie's face.

You place your hands on it, starting to rub it like Uxie asked.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">YES!YES!YES!</span>\" the giantess shouts loudly as you keep rubbing the lucid surface of the gem, seeing your own reflection in the red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you feel a vague sensation as you stare at your own reflection.

Why did you delete his memories?</span>\" she asks, opting to get straight to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Uxie doesn't reply, and keeps staring at the ground.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Why, Uxie, why? Did that human hurt you? Insult you?Or is it a more... personal matter?</span>\" Azelf asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last remark succeeds in getting Uxie's attention as she rises her head, pointing both her closed eyes on Azelf, while a curious look appears on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">What do you mean?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Did you... have him 'fix' you again? Is it why you wanted him to forget? So me and Mesprit wouldn't have found out?</span>\" Azelf asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie's heart skips a beat. Inadvertently, her sister spoke the truth, although she couldn't possibly know. Uxie indeed had the human for a second time, but it was after she had deleted his memories. She must be careful with her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">None of the reasons you told. The human did nothing wrong to me. And I wasn't 'fixed' again!</span>\" she finally answers, blushing as she says - more like shouts - the last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Then why?</span>\" Azelf presses on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Uxie remains silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Could she tell Azelf about it? Could she tell that the human meant to leave her and her sisters? That he had no apparent reason, that he didn't want to answer?... That he seemed in a hurry to leave the trio?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly thinking about it, Uxie sighs, her heart aching at the bad memories. The human wanted to leave. She <b>had</b> to make him forget, she hadn't any other choice. And because of that, now Uxie had to pay the price of her actions and face Azelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue titaness seems to notice her sister's internal conflict, but she decides to not question about it. Maybe Uxie is just sorry about what she did to the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">He's done nothing wrong to you, you said. Then why?<br>\r\nWhy, sister?</span>\" Azelf repeats herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie shook her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I... I can't. Y-You would never believe me. You'd think I'm making up excuses. Maybe you would hate me.</span>\" she replies, suddenly understanding what the human felt like last night, when he refused to tell her the reasons of his wish to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose reasons were still a mystery to the pixie, and the whole thing was a mystery to her sisters. At least, the part where he wanted to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">We are sisters. I would never hate you. Why would I hate you anyway?</span>\" Azelf asks with a much softer voice, repeating almost the same words that Uxie told the human last night, when she was trying to convince him to tell her the truth. Now more than ever, she feels like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Come on, tell me.</span>\" the last words successfully shatter Uxie's resistance like glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Alright,</span>\" she says, breathing in deeply.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Listen up.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'll start from the beginning of it. Do you agree?</span>\" Azelf nods quietly as the two sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie gives another sigh, before commencing her tale:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">It happened last night. I woke up, and I saw the human, awake, walking out of the cave. I called him, asked him where he was going in the middle of the night,</span>\" she starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Go on,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">He replied that he was going for a walk. I didn't believe him. I tried to get answers from him, but he simply didn't want to respond. So I decided to try with a different approach,</span>\" at this point, Azelf raises an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I did nothing weird. I just brought him to the Lake.<br>\r\nI tried to get him to talk. I reassured that if he told me, I would have told nobody, that I would have kept the secret. He kept refusing at first, saying that I would have hated him. I told him that I would have never hated him and he finally gave in...</span>\" Uxie says with a noticeable hint of sadness in her voice. Azelf notices her sister look away for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Did he... did he talk?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie wipes a few tears from her eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Yes.</span>\" she says. A moment of silence follows.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... And...?</span>\" Azelf asks, knowing that this is the moment of truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Azelf. T-The human told me that he... that he wanted to leave.</span>\" Uxie forces the words out if herself while imagining her sister's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is pretty close to what she imagined: Azelf's eyes widen, her mouth opens and her whole being ceases moving as the words leave Uxie's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral moments pass before the revelation fully sinks in the blue mountain that guards this Lake.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">What?</span>\" she then manages to ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">The human wanted to...?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Yes. I begged and pleaded him to tell me why he wanted to do so. But he refused, he told me that he simply had to leave,</span>\" Uxie takes a deep breath.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">... And I... I took his memories away. What else should have I done? That human is the best thing that ever happened to me... to us!</span>\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf blushes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Er-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Do not even deny it. You still smell of sex.</span>\" Uxie bluntly says, interrupting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf blushes even more, but she shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I can't believe this Uxie. The human didn't want to leave, did he? You're lying!</span>\" she exclaims, pointing an accusatory finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie sighs dejectedly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Just as I told. You don't believe me,</span>\" she mutters.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But you'd better believe it. I can't give anymore explanations, because that's all I know. And it's true, like it or not.</span>\" Uxie says, before looking at her sister, waiting for her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf sits there, silent, for an eternal moment, pondering how to react. Uxie seemed sincere, but could she trust her? She's her sister, she would never lie to her. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf shakes her head frenetically. Her whole being is trying to believe what Uxie told her, but a voice in the back of her mind tells her that her sisters is very probably lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy the human would have wanted to leave after all? He had no reason, and Uxie masked that by telling that he didn't want to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was a possibility. Like it was what Uxie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow to know which one was the truth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a frustrated cry, the blue giantess looks at Uxie again, trying to choose what to do...</span></div></div>",

But the problem remains: what reason did he have to leave?</span>\" her problem quenched again, Uxie can focus on her primary objective again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I sure don't know,</span>\" Azelf says, before a thought finds its way inside her mind.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hey, you know what?

I ran into these two...</span>\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">\u2018These two\u2019 who?</span>\" Uxie asks, getting more curious as her sister speaks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh, a Lucario and a Vaporeon. They told me that they wanted to talk to me. At first, I thought they had some problem, and I told them to ask you. But they said that they knew what you did to the human. They told me that they casually saw you making him forget the reason of his leaving...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie mentally face palms.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Casually, Azelf?</span>\" she asks with irony. Which her sister doesn't seem to detect.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Yes, they told-</span>\" she suddenly realizes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">...That wasn't true, was it?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie smiles a little.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'm afraid not.

I instead think that they were keeping an eye out for the human for some reason.</span>\" Uxie responds, before placing a paw over her mouth as she ponders. Thanks to Azelf, she had new information, and the whole thing became brighter. Although by just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being of knowledge digs in her own memories, imagining herself and the little human talking, while two unknown pokemon were hidden somewhere nearby. They saw what she did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new idea springs up in Uxie's expert mind. What if those two were the cause of the human's sudden decision to leave? They must have seen him with Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie herself. They must have thought that he was a threat for the guardians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, they told waited for the night to fall and they woke him, telling him to leave Lake Acuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing worked, it made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">They saw us and the human together. They thought he was a threat to us, they convinced him to leave...</span>\" Uxie thinks aloud, gaining Azelf's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Do you think so?</span>\" she asks, worried. Did those two really menace the human? Or did they lie to him and convinced him to leave?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf shakes her head. There was only one way to find out, and that was finding those two pokemon first.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Let's go back to Lake Acuity. We need to find them.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Also, we need to watch out for Mesprit.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie nodded as the two started flying, leaving Lake Valor behind as they headed to Lake Acuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe activity around Lake Acuity was pretty calm today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is Uxie's first thought as she and Azelf hover in the forest, the tall trees concealing their presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow headed guardian feels Azelf tapping her shoulder. Uxie looks at her, discovering her pointing at something big and pink just out of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie nervously nods, recognizing her second sister's head. She distinctly hears Mesprit talk:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">That's what happened...</span>\" that phrase meant two things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne, the human is with her. Two, she just told him the reason of the agitation of the morning. Uxie and Azelf have to avoid her. At least, until they figure out what really happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the two start floating deeper into the forest, searching for two particular pokemon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next two hours, the two legendary sisters aimlessly fly through the woods around the Lake, avoiding the area where Mesprit is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey have to constantly watch out; if their sister moves, she would find them. And let Uxie have a piece of her mind. Something that the pixie didn't want to experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quest doesn't have too much success, though, as they don't even find the shadow of a Lucario or a Vapo-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Why didn't I think about this before? Vaporeon spend most of their time in water!</span>\" Uxie silently exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf spends a moment realizing:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">The Lake!</span>\" she exclaims, before remembering that Mesprit is currently sitting right in front of it.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">How do we-</span>\" Uxie's spirit leaves her body and hovers in direction of the Lake, leaving her body - and her sister - behind.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">... Right.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie's spirit slips into the water unseen. She starts floating around as she searches for any quadruped, long-tailed blue pokemon she could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Too bad she doesn't find any. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater types pay no attention to the shadow of Uxie as they swim past her, but not even one Vaporeon was among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guardian searches for a while, before giving up. Her spirit floats out of the water, completely unaware that she was being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bodies made of water, Vaporeon have the useful ability to disappear from eyesight when in contact with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat allowed one in particular to watch Uxie's spirit before she gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for her to decide that the pixie was searching for <i>her</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>We need to be careful...</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">So? Found anything?</span>\" Azelf asks as Uxie regains consciousness.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Absolutely nothing,</span>\" she mutters dejectedly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I found no Lucario,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie sighs loudly, a clear sign of annoyance.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Okay, you know what? I've got a plan.</span>\" Uxie says. Azelf eyes her with curiosity.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">What plan?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Let's wait until tonight. When the night falls, we'll stick around and see what happens. What happened last night could happen again, and in that case, we'll finally find out why the human wanted to leave.</span>\" the yellow headed pixie explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Do you think it'll work?</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">If they were the cause, perhaps they'll try to talk to the human again. And we'll be waiting for them. I really want to have a word with those two...</span>\" Uxie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Alright. But I suggest that we don't let Mesprit know anything about this yet. She's still clueless... and angry... Let her stay with the human for a while, she'll eventually calm down.</span>\" she suggests.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Deal.</span>\"</span></div></div>",

You just couldn't believe what she said you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie would have never done something like that to you, right? Even if you spent just a day with the three of them, you're certain that the yellow headed guardian of Lake Acuity, who you helped with her heat twice, would never have took your memories away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not funny, you know,\" you scold.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Of course it isn't! In fact, I'm dead serious!</span>\" she snaps back, with a not-so-subtle hint of anger present in her voice that makes you shake in her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emotion pokemon is, in fact, holding you tightly against her chest, like she has been doing for her whole tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm sorry,</span>\" she then says, realizing that she startled you.<br>\r\n\"This... this can't be real Mesprit! Please... tell me you're just kidding... you can't be serious...\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I am, trust me...</span>\" she replies, before moving you upwards, pushing you on her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel something wet sliding in between you and the pink surface of her left cheek, and you realize that a tear just rolled down her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm sorry!</span>\" she cries, several other tears following the first one down her face.<br>\r\n\"F-For what?\" you ask, your voice muffled by the two giant paws pushing you again her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">For letting it happen!</span>\" Mesprit replies. You free one of your arms from her grasp and start rubbing her cheek.<br>\r\n\"Come on Mesprit, it wasn't your fault...\" you say, still not completely able to believe it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shy, sweet Uxie did something like that to you? For what reason?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought is interrupted by Mesprit:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">It was! You're the sweetest little thing I've ever met, and Uxie did something so horrible to you, and I wasn't able to protect you from her, and I... I...</span>\" she pulls back and sniffles a few times while holding you in front of her giant, golden eyes, which are wet with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that Mesprit was really speaking the truth about Uxie. The guardian of Lake Acuity really did delete your memories!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why? And when? And what did she make you forget?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel extremely sorry for the crying pokemon who is holding you. You didn't believe her without realizing that she just really cares about you, and she-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can formulate anymore thoughts, Mesprit pushed you against her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle against her gigantic lips, trying to break free. You have little success. And your own lips suddenly get locked with hers, causing you to shut your eyes open while your face goes vermilion at light speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit holds the kiss for a whole, eternal minute, before she pulls off. And you fall flat on your back on her open paws. The giantess' face moves closer to her wide palms where you lay as she speaks up, ending her previous sentence:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I... I...</span>\" she flushes red as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough not with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I... I want you...</span>\" she breaths, her voice suddenly becoming sultry with lust. All the problems of the morning had awakened her needs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heat is manifesting itself again, and she needs it to end, again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks back at you, who stare up at her.<br>\r\n\"Er... Mes-\" she unceremoniously cuts you off.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You. Me. Now.</span>\" she says with an imperative voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly forgetting what Uxie did to you, you find yourself nodding timidly.<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am, er, miss!\" you quickly say. Even if dealing with many problems at once, Mesprit finds herself smirking.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Good.</span>\" she says as she floats up and hovers in direction of the cave where she had spent the night. And where she's going to be satisfied again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are roughly placed on the hard, stone floor as Mesprit places herself right in front of you, her titanic body looming over yours as she sits down, legs crossed and back leaning against the rock walls of the cavern.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Here we are~</span>\" Mesprit says, fixing two glazed eyes on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Now, how about some role playing?</span>\" she suggests with a grin.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I play the goddess, and you play the tiny servant who must satisfy me! Isn't that fun?</span>\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you say, trying to find an answer different from \u2018No\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mesprit doesn't wait for an answer as she spreads her legs, her vertical lips coming into view. A strong psychic force then pushes you forward, stopping you mere inches from the giantess' sex.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Come on, my cute little slave! Show me your loyalty!</span>\" she booms. Either she's already playing her part, or she's being serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhichever it is, you quickly decide that it wouldn't be very wise of you to disobey her in any case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choose to start in a traditional way and begin rubbing Mesprit's vagina with both your hands, immediately getting her to moan loudly, her voice shaking the walls of the cavern.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">G-Great! F-Faster, s-slave!</span>\" she says, maintaining what you hope is role playing as she is pleasured by your tiny hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, you decide to take this further and you remove your hands from the slit, replacing them with your tongue as you start devotedly worshipping the 'goddess', who starts moaning even louder.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Ngh! Y-You g-got it! Keep go-going!</span>\" she yells as you keep licking her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor further support, you place your hands back on the unshaven surface, starting to slide them along the length of it, as long as they can reach. It feels extremely weird to lick something warm and pulsing, and it's embarrassing as well, but you decide that it isn't so bad. Mesprit's slit carries an almost sugary taste, and the smell of her heat is just as paradisiac as it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in your thoughts, you barely register one <b>loud</b> moan, rocks falling from the ceiling of the cave and a sticky wave of white, cherry-smelling liquid washing you away from the giantess, who collapses on her back.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">L-LOVE! L-LOVE H-HUMAN!</span>\" the giantess screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely have the time to get up as one gigantic tail finds you and wraps itself around your waist, pushing you to Mesprit's vagina again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">M-M-M-More!</span>\" she shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd your world is obscured as you penetrate a second cave, this one with liquid, sticky 'stalactites', fleshy floor, but as well dark surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You already know what you need to do, don't you?</span>\" Mesprit says from outside. You nod to yourself. You know what to do. And you hurry to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Ohh!!</span>\" Mesprit lets out one last moan as a second, tidal wave of love juices river its way towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you expected to be washed out of Mesprit, but you open your eyes to find that your surroundings didn't change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still inside of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly look around, finding yourself stuck to one of the walls of her sex. Your body, made sticky from all that cum, must have remained glued to the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...

With a bit of an effort, you manage to pull it from the warm, living wall. Your brain then commands it to aid the other arm as it travels on your right elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the help of your left arm, you quickly manage to free your other arm as well. Then, both your arms move to your legs, repeating the same moves of before as you literally unglue yourself from the fleshy wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a single moment, you mentally cheer, before realizing that you are moving. You look down, in the dark depths of Mesprit, finding that your earlier suppositions came true: you're sliding in deeper!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide down into the dark insides of Mesprit's vagina until you hit her cervix. The sudden hit is greeted by a muffled moan coming from outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing, you gaze upwards, spotting a subtle light shining inside from Mesprit's slit, which is your exit. Unfortunately, the giantess is laying back down, meaning that you'll have to climb...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you get to work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Mesprit feels your activity in her sleep. And she enjoys it. You can't possibly know it, but your squirming and crawling to climb to the giantess' sex are actually affecting her dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess lets out a soft moan as her paw travels to her own sex...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mesprit! This isn't funny! Let me-\" the human's screams could be heard from the insides of Mesprit's mouth as she licked him over and over, covering his tiny body in saliva. She could feel each and every movement he made inside of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpred\">Mh~hh...</span>\" she sang, stifling a giggle as her tongue kept sliding over the human's body. A few last licks before she finally spat him out, in her open paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust looking at her human made Mesprit giggle. He was pale as death itself, and her was bodily shaking in her paws.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Aw, come on! That wasn't so bad, was it?</span>\" she snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually, YES!\" the human yelled, scared, making Mesprit giggle harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh, you shouldn't be scared for these little things... after all, it was only the beginning...</span>\" she said sinisterly. The human looked up at her. If possible, he was starting to pale even more.<br>\r\n\"T-The beginning?\" he asked, fearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit snickered.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yep! This little game of ours has just begun!</span>\" she said cheerfully, before smirking almost maniacally.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">And I do exactly know how to continue~</span>\" she said. One of her paws left the human, while the other started lowering him. In between her legs. Without moving from her sitting position, the giantess hovers up, placing the human down on the ground, right beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at her, finding two holes dangling dangerously close to his head.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit...\" the giantess doesn't giving him anymore time to speak as she gently sat down, pinning his body in between her sex and her butt, using her psychic powers to keep almost all her weight off him. Though the mere action was surely enough to procure him an heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You can't even imagine how cute you are right now, stuck under me! Enjoying the view, down there~?</span>\" she chirped, feeling him squirm beneath her crotch, tickling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess snickers, pleasure starting to spread in her body.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'll take that as a yes!</span>\" she giggled, before assuming that sinister grin again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Now, my little human, why don't you give <b>that</b> some love?</span>\" she asked, wiggling her lower half a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human reluctantly nodded his head as he started licking her crotch, immediately sending her into moaning...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made some progress since you started climbing, yet you aren't even halfway there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden noise coming from downwards draws your attention. You look down, and things start shaking as a white fluid suddenly rivers upwards with great strength as Mesprit orgasms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking, you let the tidal wave overwhelm you as it drags you upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her sleep, Mesprit removes her arm from her sex as it falls onto the ground, letting a small body flow out along a white wave...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you successfully reach Mesprit's vagina and get out as you're washed onto the furry opening of the 'cave'<br>\r\n\"YES!\" you exclaim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, your vision becomes blurry, and you find that your legs can't hold you properly again. A moment later, with the last remains of your consciousness, you feel yourself hitting the vertical lips of Mesprit as you collapse, falling asleep a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the golden eyed legendary giantess wakes up, her sleep bothered by your sudden cry breaking the silence. Instinctively, Mesprit rises her head up, one paw running her left eye while her right one fixes itself on her sex, discovering a very familiar tiny human laying on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looks at you confused for a moment, and opens her other eye, glancing at the pool of cum surrounding you, then at her own paw, before stifling a giggle, remembering the events that occurred before she fell asleep. And before remembering her so-nice dreams.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hehe. My paw slipped~</span>\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours pass.

Rise and shine, human!</span>\" it says cheerily, while revealing you who just talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour rub your eyes a bit and look up again, discovering the pink headed giantess who goes by the name of Mesprit staring down at you with a sweet smile. You also take notice that she's currently holding you with both paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mesprit...\" you mumble, before giving a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hehe, we really went overboard, didn't we?</span>\" she giggles.<br>\r\n\"In effect, doing it even in your sleep was a bit exaggerated...\" you drowsily reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess flushes red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Mesprit gets up and hovers out of the cave. A nice breeze blows past you as you are carried out by the giantess. You notice the sun descended over the horizon, crafting an orange shade on the Lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" you question.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Simply taking a look around.

She isn't completely sure that her sister really had you over and over, only to make you forget right after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if she's mistaking? Not only it is something horrible to think of her own sister, but if that turns out to be incorrect? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">For-Forget it.</span>\" she says, deciding to not share her theory. She doesn't want to risk and put the wrong idea of Uxie in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Okay?\" you reply. But you find that Mesprit isn't looking at you. Actually, her eyes are fixed on a common bush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is happening to her...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit focuses. She's sure she felt a presence around. A <i>strong</i> presence. And she's sure of who that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Uxie.</span></i>\u2019 she telepathically says. Her call is greeted by telepathic silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cyellow\">Mesprit.</span></i>\u2019 her sister replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie and Azelf, hidden deep into the thick vegetation of the forest, patiently wait for the night to fall. They cannot risk the two pokemon they're searching for be alarmed by the two giantesses floating around the Lake in an agitated manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they sit quietly, careful to keep themselves out of Mesprit's eyesight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I'm bored.</span>\" Azelf complains with a sigh.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Why am I here anyway? I've got a lake to guard,</span>\" Uxie frowns<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Because I need your help. And because you want to be here, don't you?</span>\" she says. The image of the human briefly travels across Azelf's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue pixie smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You are right,</span>\" she replies. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Like always.</span>\" Uxie smiles triumphantly, before frowning again. She needs to find out why the human wanted to leave. That, or she's going to hate herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in her thoughts, Uxie's psychic powers get loosened a bit, but enough for a voice to penetrate her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2019<i><span class=\"cpink\">Uxie.</span></i>\u2019 Mesprit's voice echoes in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie rises her head, fixing her closed eyes on Azelf, who shoots her an inquisitive gaze. The yellow headed guardian sighs, before telepathically replying:<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cyellow\">Mesprit.</span></i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Mesprit, finding her frowning.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit, are you feeling alright?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, she totally ignores you. For what reason, you would never find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Uxie, where are you? I think we need to talk...</span></i>\u2019 she says, trying to not sound too angry like she is in reality. There'll be time to be angry when she finds Uxie, she decides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cyellow\">Agreed. But come alone. The human doesn't need to see this.</span></i>\u2019 Uxie states, before cutting the psychic link off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit nods to nobody in particular, before turning her gigantic head back to you, discovering you staring up at her with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit... what happened to you?\" you ask her. The giantess gives no response, but she gently lets you down on the ground, before finally deciding to reply.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm sorry but... could you give me some time? I need to check something...</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even answer, the giantess had already disappeared into a random direction, leaving you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">What do you mean, \u2018She is coming\u2019?</span>\" Azelf asks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">We need to settle this. Plus, Mesprit will help us too if she knows why I had to... you know it.</span>\" Uxie replies. She didn't like talking about what she did to the human. It makes her feel comprehensibly guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Azelf can say anything else, an agitated pink and blue titaness shows up, glaring daggers at Uxie.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Calm down already and listen to me!</span>\" Uxie says in an unusual stern manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if surprised by her sister's change of attitude, Mesprit still has no intention of calming down.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Why should I listen to you?</span>\" she asks coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, Azelf decided to speak up:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Because we know what happened!</span>\" she exclaims. Mesprit just seems to notice her second sister.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I do as well! Uxie-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Erased the human's memories because he wanted to leave!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit flinches. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">... Come again?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Let's not shout, shall we? You never know who could be listening.</span>\" Uxie declares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the story ended, the day has ended as we, the sun replaced by the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I don't believe any of it.</span>\" Mesprit firmly declares.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You just made this up, didn't you? Congratulations, the story was pretty convincing, I must admit,</span>\" she says sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I hope so, since it was the truth.</span>\" Uxie calmly states.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yeah, right! The human wanted to-</span>\" <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Check my emotions if you don't believe me!</span>\" Uxie interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit bites her lower lip, but does as her sister told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrritation.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You are sorry...</span>\" Mesprit mumbles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Yes. What I did was wrong, I admit it. But I had no other choice. Otherwise, the human would have left m- us. But now we know something more about this.</span>\" Uxie replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit looks at her sisters with curiosity.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Yep. Apparently, some pokemon made him want to leave...</span>\" Azelf speaks up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Some pokemon...?</span>\" Mesprit parrots back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie leans forward, whispering something inaudible to Azelf. Or anyone who might be listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What...</span>\" Mesprit suddenly remembers something.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hey, now that I think about it, those two tried talking to me...</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">We believe that they might be the cause of everything...</span>\" Azelf explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">How can you tell?</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Think, Mesprit. When was the last time humans came to this Lake?</span>\" Uxie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit ponders for a moment.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">When we were...</span>\" realization hits the pink headed guardian.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">They thought he is a threat!</span>\" she suddenly exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Precisely.</span>\" Azelf says. Mesprit's face twists with anger.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">If I ever lay my paws on-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">No. If our plan works, I'll be talking. This is my Lake after all.</span>\" Uxie solemnly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What plan?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Understood?</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yes. We wait for the night.</span>\" Mesprit says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And if they show up again, we'll have our answers.</span>\" Azelf finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Okay. Now go back to the human.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Uxie?</span>\" the pixie blushes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm sorry...</span>\" Uxie smiles as Mesprit disappears into the forest again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what took you so long?\" you ask while chewing one last berry. Since Mesprit came back, she didn't give you an explanation of why she suddenly left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit shrugs while a few Magikarp disappear into her mouth. Something you don't totally approve but, after all, she's a pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallows, before turning to you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Trust me, it was nothing important. Now-</span>\" she exaggeratedly yawns.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Let's call it a day, alright?</span>\" she gently picks you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... Azelf and Uxie?\" you question.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">They're fine.</span>\" Mesprit says as she carries you off into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce their sister and the human disappear into the cavern, Uxie and Azelf come out of their hiding spot, and hide in the area behind the cave, waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes, but no one shows up. A few hours pass, and no pokemon comes out, especially not any Lucario or Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf and Uxie keep themselves from yawning as they wait for anything to happen...</span></div></div>",

The only sounds that break the silence are the wind, which blows past the leaves, making them rustle, and the occasional cries of the nocturnal inhabitants of Lake Acuity, who most probably left their lairs in search of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut two particular giantesses are no nocturnal pokemon at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden behind the cavern where their sister and the human currently sleep, Uxie and Azelf fight against drowsiness to stay awake. They mustn't fall asleep. Not before finding out the truth they've been chasing for the whole day long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're close, they can't sleep right now. The only thing they need to do is spot two pokemon in particular and demand answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, those two pokemon they're waiting for don't show up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome more time passes. Azelf gives a deep yawn.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I'm sleepy...</span>\" she mutters while rubbing her eyes, trying to physically wipe the sleepiness out of them. Even the most skilled psychic type couldn't erase sleep from their minds, and Uxie and Azelf are no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Focus, Azelf.

That human is the sweetest thing I ever met. I need to repay his kindness, and will do so!</span>\" Uxie silently exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human really was the sweetest, and kindest little thing she ever met. True, she had saved him from a blizzard storm, but he did repay her by helping her around Lake Acuity, by taking care of her home alongside the giantess herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, though. He warned her about those perverted pokemon who snuck their way inside her body while she couldn't even feel them. He was the cause if they got out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe even agreed to quench her heat! Not once, but twice! The human is the only one Uxie herself ever called... a mate. A true mate... who she has to share with her sisters. Obviously, she and her sisters share one common feeling for the same creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie blushes. She fell for him too...? All three legendary sisters, all three Lake Guardians are in love with a human? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I wonder how this is going to end...</span>\" Uxie mutters to the, before focusing on her task once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, soon, she discovers that her drowsiness is winning the consciousness. The giantess yawns loudly, while mentally struggling to remain awake.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Must... not... sleep...</span>\" she says, while giving another yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the ground quakes as the yellow and blue titaness falls down, asleep before even hitting the ground.

However, Lucario is pretty reluctant to take this risk. If Mesprit wakes up and sees the two of them, she'll probably wake her sisters up as well. A giantess isn't exactly too silent, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it is also true that the three sisters are most likely going to keep their eyes out for the human. And Lucario himself, Vaporeon and every inhabitant of Lake Acuity could not risk him be with the sisters again. It already happened too many times in two days, no telling when the three legendary giantesses will be consumed by their own lust and go on a rampage around Lake Acuity again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario shakes his head, as if trying to shake off bad memories.<br>\r\n\"You are right,\" he says in the end.<br>\r\n\"We mustn't risk the tragedy repeating itself again. That human must be warned as soon as possible.\" he lets out a low growl.<br>\r\n\"And it means now.\" Vaporeon smiles.<br>\r\n\"<u>Glad you are reasoning,</u>\" she says, starting to walk towards the entrance of the gigantic cave, which can easily hold all three Lake Guardians inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon briefly stops, noticing that Lucario isn't following.<br>\r\n\"<u>Are you coming?</u>\" she asks. Lucario shakes his head once more, before nodding.<br>\r\n\"Lead the way.\" he says, hurrying to follow his quadruped companion within the dark depths of the cavern where Mesprit and the human are currently resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first look Lucario and Vaporeon take of their surroundings reveals them a dark, immense place, which could hold more than just a giant - which it actually does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walk deeper inside, the sound of snoring gets more clear to the ears of the two pokemon and, soon, they manage to make out the silhouette of a blue and pink titaness they recognize as Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lone giantess is currently laying on the ground, snoring as she sleeps. Her dreams mustn't be very sweet, Lucario judges by the troubled expression present on her gigantic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering their gazes, both the bipedal steel type and the quadruped water type notice the giantess' arms wrapped around something on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, more specifically, they're wrapped around someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human quietly rests, lost in the furry landscape of Mesprit's chest, held in place by both her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Uhm... maybe there is something between them...</u>\" Vaporeon says.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, lust. He gives them what they demand for, they cuddle up to him in exchange.\" Lucario bluntly states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon shakes her head as the two get closer to the gigantic body of Mesprit. The giantess sleeps on her side, so they have to figure out how to reach the human. Then how to pluck him from Mesprit's grasp and get away unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if fate itself decided to lend a hand, Mesprit suddenly rolls on her back as she sleeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon briefly looks at the scene, before looking at Lucario and nodding her head. The jackal nods as well as he takes place beside the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, showing incredible ability, he leaps onto the land of blue fur that is the pink headed giantess' side. His hands grappling her fur and his legs swiftly leaping up, the black and blue pokemon climbs the giantess' body and finds himself on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf by any chance Mesprit wakes up now, he's gonna be in trouble - like he already was, after all. Luckily, the giantess felt nothing, and keeps on sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Lucario slowly starts walking towards her chest where her paws - and the human - rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden movement of the giantess' stomach makes him trip and fall face down. The fur softens his fall but, still, he rises his head to check if Mesprit woke up from her slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess moans softly, but her eyes remain sealed. Lucario breaths in relief as he makes his way to her arms, soon finding himself close to the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there is only one more obstacle: pulling him out of Mesprit's grasp without her feeling anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the jackal grasps the human's ankles, which are left out of the titaness' hug, and starts pulling slowly, gently sliding you out of Mesprit's embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario stops for a moment as he plucks you from Mesprit and waits; for a few moments, the giantess' arms flail around, searching the human's body, attempting to get a hold of him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario dodges one of them as they fall back onto the human, pulling him up as Mesprit readjusts him on his original position on her chest. The giantess smiles in her sleep as she cuddles the human to herself once again, pushing him into her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario growls, and walks up to you again, getting a hold of you as he starts pulling again. This time, Mesprit's body reacts in her sleep, and tightens her grip on your own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, Lucario lets go and falls again. Growling, he gets back up, grabbing you by your ankles again and pulling with all his might in order to free your body from Mesprit's strong grip; only after a while does he succeed to pull you out again. Weirdly enough, Mesprit's paws don't react this time like they did earlier as the jackal carries you on the wider surface of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario pays it no mind. Sighing in relief once again, the black and blue pokemon gets a hold of you and lifts your body over his head as he carries you on his shoulder, over the edge of Mesprit's body. He looks down, finding Vaporeon staring up at him with concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, the jackal slides down onto the solid ground again. You don't feel any of it as you keep sleeping soundly. Vaporeon, who was watching every movement of her companion, rushes to him, silently cheering with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario smirks, before motioning for her to follow him put of the cave with a nod of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, silently, the two pokemon start walking towards the exit of the cave...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cut it out, will you?\" you mutter in your sleep, before resuming your snoring. For a moment, Mesprit's rage is put aside as the giantess looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without saying a word, she moves forward, in direction of the entrance of the cavern. In the meantime, she makes sure to separate you from Lucario and Vaporeon, who don't speak a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit flies out of the cave, holding a sleeping you in a paw, while Lucario and Vaporeon are held in the other. The giantess discovers her sisters sleeping at the sides of the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You almost did it...</span>\" she mumbles, before hovering over Azelf, starting to shake her gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf moans, before yawning and opening one golden eye, which she fixes on Mesprit. Before she can proclaim her annoyance, though, Mesprit holds you in front of her sister, saying four simple words:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Take care of him.</span>\" Azelf's other eye opens up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you, then at Mesprit, not taking notice, though, of the two captives held in Mesprit's other paw.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Alright?</span>\" Azelf mutters, moving her own paw as Mesprit hands you to her, before flying off into some random direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf stares at the spot where she was a few moments ago, before shifting her attention on you, who keep on sleeping, unaware of the shift of location that just occurred. Azelf stares at you for a few moments, before remembering that the human she's holding onto is the same one she loves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness shrugs, deciding to not question what just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf leans forward, pressing her lips on your forehead. Then, she pulls you in an embrace as she lays back down, closing both her eyes again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Sleep tight I guess...</span>\" mutters the blue titaness as she falls asleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You wanted to talk to me, right?</span>\" Mesprit asks while glaring at the two pokemon held in her fist when she feels she's got far enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that there's no risk of waking her precious little human up, she can let her rage flow uninterrupted.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Here's your chance: talk!</span>\" she orders, her head darting forward in a menacing manner, her golden eyes piercing both normal sized pokemon's souls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo remain silent. A quick check of their emotions reveals the reason to Mesprit: they're paralyzed with terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">The human. What did you do to him? Why he suddenly wished to leave? You know what consequence this had, don't you?</span>\" the pink headed legendary presses on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question brought a drastic change of expression on Lucario's face, which shifts from a scared to a neutral one.<br>\r\n\"We did nothing to the human.\" he speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">No? Then, why did he suddenly want to leave me and my sisters? You two, you threatened him, didn't you?

What did you do?</span>\" she inquires, trying to repress her anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Vaporeon looks at Lucario, trying to warn him, but she finds him speaking already:<br>\r\n\"Yes! He wanted to leave because of us!\" he exclaims. And then immediately regrets doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's fist tightens around him and Vaporeon.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'll ask nicely.

Assuming that it's just Mesprit's paws, you wiggle your way out of the grasp and stand up, finding yourself on a belly.

Muttering some incomprehensible words of annoyance, the giantess opens her golden eyes, before giving a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she remembers about what had happened earlier. An agitated Mesprit gave the human to her, muttering \u2018Take care of him\u2019. The blue mountain lazily looks down to her arms, which are wrapped around... nothing. The human is missing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Where-</span>\" Azelf confusedly says, before remembering the events of yesterday. The human... was he kidnapped by the Lucario and the Vaporeon?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFully awakened, Azelf floats to Uxie, starting to shake her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Uxie! Wake up! Uxie!</span>\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie's eyes remain sealed, but her mouth opens to let a growly cry out:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">What?</span>\" Uxie says, clearly bothered from being woken so rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her sister awake, Azelf pulls off.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">It's the human! He's missing!</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Azelf, he's probably with Mesprit...</span>\" Uxie says with a yawn as she slowly gets up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Mesprit gave him to me earlier!</span>\" Uxie frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe silently hovers inside of the cave, only to come out of it a few minutes later.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Actually, Mesprit is missing too...</span>\" she mutters.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">She must have brought the human somewhere.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf internally sighs in relief.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You mean... he wasn't kidnapped while I was sleeping?</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Don't think so, there was an high risk of being discovered... however...</span>\" Uxie focuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cyellow\">Mesprit... is the human with you?</span></i>\u2019 Uxie telepathically calls her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer doesn't take long:<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Yes.</span></i>\u2019 Mesprit replies, before speaking up:<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Uxie, you, me and Azelf need to talk. Alone.</span></i>\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cyellow\">Why? What happened?</span></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Remember the Lucario and the Vaporeon you talked about?

What happened?</span></i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><span class=\"cpink\">We'll talk later.</span></i></span>\u2019 with that, the link is interrupted by Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie returns to reality to see a worried-looking Azelf staring at her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">He is with her. And she found out something, sister.</span>\" Uxie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Lake Verity?\" you assume. In response, the giantess behind you gives a nod.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I promised that you could have explored around. So, you get to take a look around, and I can check on my home.</span>\" Mesprit says as she hovers above the Lake. Much like Lake Acuity, Lake Verity has a rich vegetation around it. The only difference is that here there's not even a snowflake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit gently deposits you on the land.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Now, you be good while I, uh, run some chores around here.</span>\" she lies. She could sense her sisters getting closer to her, meaning that they are coming like she told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay?\" you say, not even remotely suspecting what the giantess has to do in reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, starting to venture into the woods. You hear Mesprit's voice one last time before she fades from eyesight:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Don't get lost!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the human disappeared into her forest, Mesprit's face shifts from a loving one to a worried, saddened one. Her little human is in danger, and SHE is the danger! She and her sisters... she cannot allow herself to kill the little one she loves because of her stupid heat. Of their stupid heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><span class=\"cpblue\">Mesprit...</span></i>\" the voice of Azelf calls her from within her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness sighs.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Girls.</span></i>\u2019 she replies. Should she tell them what she found out about? Or should she keep it to herself? After all, she's not sure of how her sisters would take the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... they have to know... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cyellow\">You talked about those two pokemon.

A quick glance revealed that Uxie was holding Azelf back.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Let's just give some time to think. We'll talk to her later.</span>\" the pixie suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">B-But... Mesprit... The human...</span>\" Azelf complains.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">They'll be fine.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink headed guardian grabs her head in her paws. She literally feels it spinning in her paws as she tries to recollect her ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called herself a guardian. Of the Lakes, of the whole region of Sinnoh. And she was a threat to both pokemon and humans. To HER human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all because of one thing. Her heat. Her damned heat, the problem she shared with her sisters, the problem that could only be cured in one way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this way is the major problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sobs, burying her head further into her paws. The situation could be solved, but it has one horrible consequence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't be with her precious little human until the heat was over. She couldn't get any more relief because she could lose control at any moment. She always saw sex as a way of bonding, and the bond she developed with the human - she felt it growing between herself and him. The human loved her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she could not have him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears start to pour down the giantess face, some ending up caught in her paws and some falling on the ground, the gigantic teardrops splashing loudly on the soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in that precise moment, fate decided to be cruel to the poor legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit rises her head from her paws, her cheeks going from pink to red as she feels it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heat, which she already repressed earlier, just came back, impatiently demanding to be quenched. Mesprit lets out an ungraceful grunt, which is followed by a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't have the human fix her again... it was going to be a torture, staying without sex until the heat season was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit places a paw on her cheek, shedding a tear... and then, she looks at said paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sniffles. If she couldn't have the human again... might as well solve the thing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, the giantess sits down in the depths of her own forest. Pokemon flee as they see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood. No one is going to watch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Mesprit spreads her legs, starting to rub her sex slowly. A low moan escapes her mouth. Several others join it as she continues rubbing her slit, which grows more wet as she keeps touching herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo aid herself, Mesprit imagines herself yesterday, when the human 'fixed' her. Squirming and twitching inside of her, worshipping her insides like a devoted little servant with his goddess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new thoughts seem to help as Mesprit feels a new wave of pleasure overwhelming her body. Then another. And another as the guardian speeds up her rubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Mesprit could not keep it in anymore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she comes, Mesprit lets out a loud cry, before removing her paw from her sex, before gently placing it down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit then closes her eyes as she recovers from her orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after closing them, the guardian of Lake Verity feels something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe feels... watched...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit opens up her golden eyes again.

This atmosphere is sure soothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes open again. You just heard a noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head, noticing a bush shaking, producing a rustling sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as out of a bush comes a small, brown quadruped creature with two big teeth coming out of its mouth. A Bidoof. And it stops right before you as it stares at you with a curious expression, clearly not used to see humans wandering around the Lake.<br>\r\n\"Hi there,\" you say with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bidoof stares at you for a while, studying you. You stare right back at it, before it decides that you're harmless and jumps onto your lap. You absentmindedly start to pet it, making it giggle happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you pet the pokemon, your mind travels back to earlier today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit seemed under distress because of her heat. Heck, she seemed to be in a lot of pain, but she refused your help anyway. You would've gladly done it again to help! After all, you've already done it several times, with all three sisters. One time more won't surely kill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could have gotten into Mesprit earlier? Why was she acting so weird? And why did she bring you here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of searching, Azelf comes to a halt at the sweetest scene shes ever seen: the human, sitting on a stump with a Bidoof on his lap as he pets the beaver pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe willpower pokemon smiles brightly. The human really loves pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, she imagines that she never grew, and that she's in that Bidoof's place right now. Again, the giantess smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf totally forgets about what she had to do, why she had to get you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">We need more time together.</span>\" she says. Only to regret it afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bidoof leaps off your lap and flees as you turn your head to face the giantess who just spoke. And the same giantess who comes out with a small blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any good reason to be spying on me?\" you ask with a defiant smirk.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I wasn't. Just looking for you. And I found you.</span>\" Azelf says, turning her head to the side as she briefly looks elsewhere, only to look back at you the following instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up from the stump as the giantess hovers closer, holding out her paw for you to climb on. You step onto her paw, which she brings up to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you mean before, \u2018we need more time together\u2019?\" you ask, recalling the words you heard coming from the giantess.<br>\r\n\"Were you talking about me?\" Azelf flushes red again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Yes.</span>\" she admits, closing her golden eyes in embarrassment.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I was talking about you.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou your forehead, unsure of how to reply.<br>\r\n\"Alright?... Er, why do we... ehm... need time together?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Oh, I was just thinking aloud.</span>\" you shoot an inquisitive gaze. The willpower pokemon sighs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">You and me are technically mates, but we know so little about each other... that's kinda frustrating, since you spend most of your time with Mesprit or Uxie,</span>\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, now that I think of it, I already helped Uxie with Lake Acuity, and I played with Mesprit once.\" you recall.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">That's what I'm talking about.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start snickering. Azelf glares.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">What's so funny?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the giantess, trying to control your laughter.<br>\r\n\"Azelf... are you jealous?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie blushes furiously.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">What? No! I'm just saying that we should do something together, nothing more!</span>\" she cries, only making you laugh harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly stop laughing. Actually, you find that you can't move anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes, which are the only thing that can actually move, fix a curious and startled gaze on the giantess. You find her smirking at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Now, not so funny, is it?</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself able to move again.<br>\r\n\"Okay, what the hell was that?\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Simple. I took your willpower. I do that.</span>\" she explains, like it is no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Can't tell if that's awesome or frightening.\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Both.</span>\" Azelf giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snicker.<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"So, you told you want to do something together?\" you recall, patting the one of the giantess' blue cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf nods slowly.<br>\r\n\"Any plans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf smiles. Your availability for her only makes her wish stronger this opportunity to be alone with you, at least from a while, without being bothered by her sisters, her heat or bad pokemon who try to make you, her little human, leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Actually, yes.

You dizzily mutter an answer as the blue titaness proceeds to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I'll give you a small headstart. But the rest is up to you.</span>\" she says, while gently lowering you down. You are placed on her lap.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">There! Now...</span>\" Azelf pats the tip of her pointy blue head and giggles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I won't play with your willpower, I'll be testing it. Let's see how much you can last without resting!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you regain your hearing, you look up to the giantess and nod your head, causing her to smile down at you. Your gaze then shifts on the wall of blue fur in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as fun as this sounds, this game has its risks. For one, you could fall off, straight to your death... you shake the thought off. Azelf would surely catch you before you hit the floor... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn impatient \u2018ahem\u2019 coming from upwards dissipates your doubts like wind with sand as you decide to play her game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping Azelf's fur with both hands, you place your foot on her massive belly and start climbing. To anyone, the task would seem impossible. But you are determined to do it. The giantess said that she wanted some more time with you, and you don't want to disappoint her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you keep going onward, clinging to the smooth blue fur which currently has a dual function: for starters, it does a good job in covering Azelf's... private regions; second, it assures you a good grip as you continue climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while passes. Azelf keeps her gaze fixed on you, ready to catch you in case her precious human falls off her. Plus, it's fun seeing you climb her body like an insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you climb past Azelf's belly as you reach her abdomen; soon enough, you leave that behind as well as you reach two... hills that block your path.<br>\r\n\"Azelf?\" it seems that the titaness had already picked up on the problem as she smiles, blushes and replies:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Go on. I'm okay with this.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGot her approval, you nod up to her and resume climbing. Though, you opt to not touch too much, and decide to climb in between her breasts instead, in her massive cleavage. You try to be quick, not sure if Azelf feels completely comfortable about this. You don't for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passes as you finally leave the two twin 'moons' behind and reach Azelf's neck, swiftly making her way towards her left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golden eyes above you fix on you a surprised state.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Wow, I really figured you'd take longer!</span>\" the titaness chimes with a playful giggle.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Come on, you're almost there!</span>\" she adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, you look in front of you, facing one problem: you've got to climb her face now, and it lacks any fur you can cling to.<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">It's up to you.</span>\" the giantess intercepts your question before you even speak. You notice her closing her eyes, ready for what comes next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you place your hands on the bare skin of her face. It's just as smooth as her fur, but this surely won't be of any help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot without difficulty, you manage to climb up where the red gem all three sisters have on their foreheads rests. You briefly stop.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Azelf, can I try something?\" the giantess opens a single eye.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Try wha-ahh!</span>\" she feels your left hand suddenly starting to rub the gem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour action has the expected effect, and Azelf starts moaning loudly in pleasure.<br>\r\n\"Yep. This gem is your soft spot too...\" you mutter, before stopping. Keeping that up could have caused Azelf to shake her head, making you fall of as a consequence. And you don't really want to start over... or become a red stain on the ground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf mutters some dejected words, bothered that the amazing feeling stopped so soon, but you pay her no mind as you climb the last of her face and onto the pointy tip of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to keep your balance as you cry out:<br>\r\n\"Done!\" you are snatched by a giant paw before you can even think of enjoying the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">It's been an hour and a half! Where are those two?</span>\" Mesprit says, annoyed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Calm down, sister. She might be still searching for him,</span>\" Uxie says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Uxie, you know that I usually believe whatever you say,<br>\r\nbut I highly doubt it.</span>\" Mesprit bluntly replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Don't know if to feel flattered or offended.</span>\" Uxie mutters.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Why don't we talk in the meantime?</span>\" she suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">About what?</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I don't know, maybe about what happened earlier with those two? You've been pretty vague on the argument,</span>\" Uxie replies. Mesprit huffs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I told you, I got distracted.</span>\" she for the third time today, Mesprit repeats her lie.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But, didn't you learn anything at all from them?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">No... nothing at-</span>\" Mesprit doesn't have the courage to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears start to pour from her eyes as she leans forward, burying her head in her sister's chest fur.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Mesprit! What's going on?</span>\" Uxie asks with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink headed giantess sniffles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I-I... I don't want the human to leave, that's all.</span>\" she lies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie's paws move as she embraces her sister.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">None of us does, and he won't, trust me.</span>\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being barraged with kisses and words of appreciation, Azelf finally calms down.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">That was fun!</span>\" she chimes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Thank you!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you're welcome...\" you mutter, trying to breath properly again. Once you do, you look up to the smiling giantess.<br>\r\n\"We've had out playtime. Happy now?\" you question.</span></div></div>",

You smile back, before absentmindedly looking at your watch.<br>\r\n\"Er, Azelf? I think we lost the track of time. It's been almost two hours...\" you point out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Heh, time sure flies when you're having fun!</span>\" she says, before remembering the reason of why she had to get you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">And... we should go back. Mesprit and Uxie might be worried about us...</span>\" she says. You nod, silently agreeing with her as the giantess, holding you in a gentle but firm grasp, flies up, above the trees around Lake Verity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe floats for a couple minutes, before finding what she's searching for... or who she's searching for. Azelf spots the familiar yellow and pink heads of her sisters... but, something's wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit has her head buried in Uxie's arms while the pixie hugs her. Azelf loses no time and quickly hovers over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething as big as a giantess is very effective to draw attention. In fact, Uxie rises her head in the newcomer's direction.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Oh, there you are.</span>\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis makes Mesprit rise her head from her sister's paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, who are still held in Azelf's left paw, watch as the gigantic head of Mesprit rises up and look in direction of Azelf, who gently places you down in the meantime. Your heart leaps within your chest as you take a good look at Mesprit's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit's usually cheerful eyes are completely red, wet with tears that keep pouring down from them. The giantess' gaze shifts on you. She stares at you in complete silence for a few moments.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit... why are you crying?\" you ask, concerned about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Mesprit frees herself from Uxie's paws and darts towards you. However, she ends up bumping into the same Uxie, who flies in front of her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Uxie...!</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Azelf, take care of her.</span>\" Mesprit is pulled back by the blue giantess that is her sister. Mesprit flails in Azelf's grip, but it's no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a yellow headed giantess floats towards you slowly. You instinctively back away, recalling what she's done to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie towers above you, her shadow engulfing your whole being.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">May I share a few words with you? Please?</span>\" you take a few more steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich results to be pointless, since the titaness scoops you up with minimal effort.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Look, I understand. You are mad at me, you are scared of me. You probably hate me for what I've done to you. Well...<br>\r\nI hate myself too for it, alright? But... I had one good reason.<br>\r\nWhich I intend to share with you.</span>\" she says with sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze shifts behind Uxie, to Azelf and Mesprit, who didn't lose a single word. Mesprit instantly stops flailing and looks straight at you, nodding her head, silently telling you that Uxie hasn't any malicious intent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrusting the pink headed guardian, you look back at Uxie.<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" you reply. The pixie giantess smiles a little, before turning to her sisters.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">A few moments of privacy, please.</span>\" she says, before floating off into the forest, you held solidly in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">There. Now we can talk undisturbed.</span>\" Uxie says as she stops after a few minutes of flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk about what?\" you say, somewhat uncomfortable.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I think you already know it, dear,</span>\" Uxie replies as she sits down, holding you in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, you wiping my memories away?\" you say, feeling quite betrayed. You trusted the giantess... you even let her have you twice, unaware of what she's done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Yes. That. We need to clarify this.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I don't have another choice, I suppose.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Listen, what I did to you was horrible. Trust me, I hate doing it. I only erase others' memories when there's need for it.</span>\" Uxie explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Why did you need to erase mine?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">First, promise me that you'll believe what I'll say. I assure you straightaway that this the one and only truth.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who can assure me that?\" you say.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">My sisters, if you want. If don't trust, you'll trust the three of us, right? Especially Me-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"I am listening!\" you quickly interrupt. Uxie smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Good. Listen up.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant what?\" you ask, not sure you heard good.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Leaving. You wanted to leave.</span>\" Uxie grimly says.<br>\r\n\"Why would I have wanted that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">That's the point. We believe, dear, that someone's been threatening you.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time today, your heart skips a beat.<br>\r\n\"What?!\" you ask, suddenly fearing.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Yes. We believe that someone convinced you to leave us three sisters. For what reason, don't ask, because I don't know. I can only assume that they believed you to be a threat to me. To my sisters.</span>\" Uxie explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A threat? We got along so well!\" you exclaim indignantly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I know! But you were so determined that I simply had to...</span>\" Uxie doesn't finish her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there on her paw, confused, scared, angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this the truth? Or an excuse the knowledge pokemon made up? Well, there's only one way to find out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uxie. Please, assure me that this is truth. Please. Please.\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I swear it.</span>\" she says solemnly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">And I'll share something else with you: whenever we're at Lake Acuity, watch out for a Lucario and a Vaporeon.<br>\r\nKeep your eyes out.</span>\" she warns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucario and Vaporeon? Those two...?\" Uxie nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Do you believe me?</span>\" she then asks.<br>\r\n\"You assured that this is the truth... and I... I'm sorry!\" you blurt out, repressing the urge to hug the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie tilts her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Sorry for what? I should be the one sorry here.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Yes. But I thought bad of you!\" you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'll forgive you. Only if you forgive me first, though.</span>\" she says, giggling. You smile, glad that the giantess doesn't hold hard feelings for you.<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie doesn't reply, but leans forward, pecking your right cheek.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">The deal's sealed!</span>\" the yellow headed guardian merrily says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing vaguely, you smile. Peace had just returned between you and the giantess.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, at Lake Acuity, various pokemon took advantage of the legendaries' absence and formed a small crowd, much like they did the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario, Vaporeon, even the Sneasel who crawled inside of Uxie. Almost every inhabitant of Lake Acuity is present. The only one missing is the human. But, every single pokemon in the crowd knows why he's not present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, it's the middle of the day; second, the legendaries won't let him out of their sights a single instant; third, his memories were erased by Uxie, so that the human didn't remember the first meeting or the pokemon that had participated to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome pokemon are currently sitting on the ground, some on a few branches of nearby trees, some are more simply standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon sits in front of the crowd and watches Lucario walk back and forth.<br>\r\n\"<u>What to do? The human cannot stay here forever. The legendaries will lose control sooner or later!</u>\" a Vileplume speaks up from the crowd.<br>\r\n\"<u>Right. And when they're done with him, they'll come and get us. We're only doing that human a favor.</u>\" a Bellossom adds, getting some murmurs of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Lucario halts his walking to face the crowd.<br>\r\n\"But me and Vapid actually spoke to Mesprit about it and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>You mean, you told her about it?</u>\" a Buizel asks.<br>\r\n\"<u>Did you really had to talk about that? You probably broke her heart!</u>\" it adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon steps forward, taking place beside Lucario.<br>\r\n\"<u>We didn't have a second choice. Mesprit caught us red-handed! What were we supposed to do?</u>\" she defends. Silence falls among the pokemon crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know what happened after we talked to Mesprit. We only know that she and her sisters left. Now, we don't if Mesprit told her sisters what we told her; we don't know what her reaction was and we don't know how long it'll take before the legendaries lose control.\" Lucario says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the only thing I can say is: keep an eye out, all of you, for the human and for those three sisters. Whenever they lose control - and I'm sure it'll happen - we have to make that human leave.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd of pokemon starts murmuring again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>But... the legendaries will be heartbroken if he leaves!</u>\" Vaporeon speaks up.<br>\r\n\"<u>So what? Better safe than sorry!</u>\" a Leafeon counters, earning a glare from the water type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, before the argument could get any further, three huge shadows obscure the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario quickly looks up to confirm what he already thought: the sisters are coming back to Lake Acuity.<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you this: let's think about it for good, alright? For now, we have to go.\" he ends his speech with a small movement of his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd of pokemon begin to disperse as the Lake Trio returns to Lake Acuity. Only Lucario remains for a few moments more, before heading into the depths of the forest, disappearing into the thick vegetation as the three giantesses and the human Mesprit is carrying come to a halt above the Lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day fades away rather fastly. The sun soon sets and gets replaced by the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three sisters gather berries for dinner as usual. However, you notice, Mesprit doesn't even lay a paw on them. Just what is going on with her? She's been acting weird from this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, when you question about it, she simply smiles, replying:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm fine. Just... I'm not hungry.</span>\" she says, earning two confused stares from Azelf and Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't fully buy what the titaness said. When you asked why she had been crying earlier, she didn't give any response but a vague \u2018Don't worry about it\u2019. You though that it was her heat at first, but you're not so sure about it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is she hiding from you...? The more you think about, the more grows the fear that you might have accidentally done something to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, something's going on. And you intend to discover what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, the legendaries declare their intention to sleep and retreat inside of the cave, you following close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, Mesprit gets a hold of your body, embraces you and lays down. You don't even attempt to protest anymore, knowing that it would be completely pointless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exchanging their \u2018goodnight\u2019, the sisters relax. And so do you; you close your eyes, enjoying Mesprit's rhythmic heartbeat, which, like always, does a good job in soothing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, you are soundly asleep on Mesprit's chest. But the giantess couldn't sleep at all. She has too many thoughts scattered across her mind. Something close to lots of rubber balls bouncing back and forth within a closed room, and they keep her from getting some well-desired sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink headed guardian waits for her sisters to be asleep too; as soon as she hears their snoring, Mesprit slowly gets up, careful to not wake you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she moves to Azelf, gently placing you on her belly. It's only a matter of seconds before her sister's paws find their way to the human as she embraces him in her sleep. A smile appears on the giantess' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of how to feel about this, Mesprit decides to let it slide as she turns around and flies out of the cave, beginning her search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pale moonlight aids the giantess as she searches through the whole forest around Lake Acuity, but not finding, though, what she's searching for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, more specifically, who she is searching for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDejected, Mesprit arrives to the lake shore and sits down, a paw traveling to her chin. She doesn't know how to feel about what she learned this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could she ever look at her own face again? She and her sisters lose control during the heat season. Apparently, they already did several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit chokes back a sob, her own words coming back to her mind, \u2018Some guardian I turned out to be, huh?\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it is true. She feels like the doesn't deserve the title of \u2018guardian\u2019 anymore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts are rudely interrupted as a voice echoes in the darkness of the night:<br>\r\n\"Sorry to bother you, but you were searching for me, I believe?\" someone talks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecognizing the voice, Mesprit takes a deep breath, before slightly turning her head back, noticing a Lucario coming out of shadows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Precisely.</span>\" Mesprit replies as the Lucario takes place beside her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Where's your friend? Vaporeon?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid she won't be joining us,\" Lucario replies.<br>\r\n\"Now, tell me, why were you exactly searching for me? Didn't I give enough answers this morning?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yes,</span>\" Mesprit replies.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">But nonetheless, we need to talk.</span>\" she says with a hint of sadness in her voice.</span></div></div>",

You wouldn't take it good. And modestly, I don't want to see you sad... or angry...\" he says, dreading the being of emotions' reaction.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I promise I won't display such emotions in front of you.</span>\" Mesprit replies reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario takes a deep breath.<br>\r\n\"Sure you want to know?\" he asks. The titaness nods her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario looks upwards, his crimson eyes locking with Mesprit's golden ones as he faces her.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit... let the human go. I know... it would be hard for you, but it's for the best.\" Lucario says softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit stays silent; the tears forming in her eyes speak for her. She wipes them away before replying:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm afraid,</span>\" she starts.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">That I cannot do such thing. The human is literally the best thing that ever happened to me. I will never ever let him go.</span>\" she says, ignoring the blush spreading on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I figured that out,\" Lucario replies.<br>\r\n\"But you may understand that \u2018your\u2019 human is in great danger. If he remains, you can't guarantee he'll be fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'll keep myself under control.</span>\"<br>\r\n\"And your sisters?\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'll keep an eye out for them. They won't try anything funny. Or else.</span>\" Mesprit grimly replies. She's going to keep an eye out for her sisters for sure. Especially for Uxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness notices Lucario shaking his head.<br>\r\n\"Do as you wish, guardian of Lake Verity. But I suggest you think about it. If you truly love that human, you'll know what's best for him.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComplete silence falls between the two pokemon. Mesprit's gaze travels elsewhere, and her right hand starts absentmindedly digging the ground up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Lucario awkwardly says, but he gets no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit?\" he calls out. But the giantess isn't listening anymore, he finds. She's looking at the Lake glumly without paying her surroundings any attention. A clear message: Mesprit wants to be alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... see you around I guess...\" Lucario says the giantess as he takes his leave. Soon, a bush behind Mesprit shakes, suggesting that her left her to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit stays still for a while, thinking. She couldn't let her little one go away, could she? She didn't need to think about it like Lucario suggested; that was simply out of question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut such decision implies another, as well as painful as the alternative: her needs could not be satisfied again, not before her heat ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting back tears, Mesprit slowly gets back up and starts floating in direction of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she finds herself at the entrance of it. Silently, the titaness hovers inside, greeted by darkness and the snoring of her sister deep within the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess hovers deeper inside, stopping near her blue headed sister, Azelf, taking notice that she shifted position, now laying on her side, one arm on the ground, the other wrapped around the familiar body of the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit extends her paw. Inches from you, that paw hesitates, and Mesprit feels tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess sniffles, before slowly pulling you out of Azelf's grasp. Then, Mesprit sits down in between her sleeping sister. She spends a good amount of time staring at you, repeating to herself that she couldn't physically love you until the damned season is over. Lucario gave her an advice, tell the human - her human, her precious little mate - about her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut could she tell him? How would he feel about it? Would he comprehend? Or would he be scared?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould he remain with her, even knowing how dangerous his mate is? Or would he run away from her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's a given, Mesprit would never get over with his loss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">My little human... what have we got ourselves into?</span>\" Mesprit whispers, before leaning forward, pressing her lips on your forehead. She decides that she'll keep what she knows a secret for the time being. Her human, and her sisters mustn't know anything... yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess holds the kiss for a couple seconds before pulling away, you murmuring something incomprehensible in your sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Mesprit decides that staying awake for the night won't accomplish anything but worsen her already dire situation. So, the pink headed guardian decides to sleep on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit sighs in a sad manner, her body sliding from a sitting to a laying position. Much like earlier, the guardian embraces you and kisses your head, before laying hers down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an incalculable amount of time, the giantess stays awake, until her mind slowly started to slide into a deep, dreamless slumber. Which is a good thing to the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe expected to have nightmares.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as you're about to reach Azelf, a huge shadow engulfs your whole form. You briefly glance at the blue mountain, to find her slamming her legs close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look upwards, discovering a certain blue and pink giantess floating down, right a few inches above the surface of Lake Acuity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile upon seeing Mesprit looking at you.<br>\r\n\"Hello there Mesprit! Where-\" you don't manage to finish you sentence as the giantess hovers over you, picks you up and hugs you lovingly in the blink of an eye, causing you to feel slightly dizzy.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Missed you~</span>\" she chimes as she tightens her grip on you, pushing you more into the wall of fur that is her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf smiles seeing the scene, before remembering your current situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tries to say something, but her sister shoots her a gaze that screams: \u2018Shut up!\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently caught in the middle of a display of affection of the pink headed legendary, you don't notice anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">So, where have you been Mesprit?</span>\" Azelf asks instead, changing topic.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh, just went to check on Lake Verity! You never know what might happen while you're away!</span>\" Mesprit giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo any ear, that giggle might have sounded sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo sincere that nobody but Azelf could tell what is going on with Mesprit's sudden change of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin her, her heart is still beating faster than normal, her brain is still working wildly to come up with an answer to her questions while Mesprit herself tries to hold back the storm of emotions currently raging inside her like a cyclone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugging her little human is a great help with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is that why-\" you get a mouthful of blue fur that chokes your voice.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hehehe, whoops! Sorry!</span>\" Mesprit apologizes in an irresistible cute voice as you spit out thick strands of her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that... Is that why you looked so upset? Were you worried about your Lake?\" you ask, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile shrinks instead, although not by much, so you can't really tell the difference.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Of course! I mean, am I not a guardian?</span>\" she says somewhat proudly, masking her internal sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like she didn't deserve that title. Like it just didn't fit her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit shakes the thought off with an imperceptible move of her head, and leans down, lightly touching your head with her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at Azelf,  she discovers her smiling, the word \u2018cute\u2019 painted all over her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Say, what have you two been doing while I was away?</span>\" Mesprit chirps. Azelf blushes. And so do you.<br>\r\n\"<b>Nothing important.</b>\" you both reply simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappily ignoring that Azelf was trying to have you as well before her arrival, Mesprit giggles again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golden gaze of the blue headed giantess fixes on you as you are hugged yet again by her sister. The human is the only one that ever agreed to help her with her problems since she grew to 200ft... she can't help but feel a slight hint of jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit and Uxie had their heat solved while she-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sooner or later, human.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks are crossed by a faint, red shade. Much to her irritation, she'll have to deal with her heat for longer, when she was so close to place an end to it!... Well, at least, temporarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue titaness shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sooner or later.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day eventually fades away, the sun replaced by a wonderful, full moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the whole time the sun has been up in the sky, you've been spending time with the two legendary sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no trace of Uxie for the whole day long. Whenever you asked about her, Azelf and Mesprit had different reactions; Azelf simply looked at you weirdly, while Mesprit immediately turned her head away. You swear you could hear a choked sob everytime she did that. None of the two, you noticed, did actually answer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, a few times, you caught them giving each other weird looks, only to smile right after upon noticing that you were staring at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, aside from you concerns for Uxie and the weird actions of Azelf and Mesprit, the day went on pretty smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick meal of berries - you assume that the giantesses don't want you to see them eating fish pokemon - the two decide that it's bedtime, empathizing the thought with exaggerated yawns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you willingly agree with their wishes, not even remotely imagining the reason of why they wanted to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr why they wanted <i>you</i> to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the two find shelter for the night inside the same cave where you last slept. The only difference is that it currently lacks of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I didn't see Uxie for the whole day. Where...?\" you ask again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, still grasped by Mesprit, feel her shake slightly behind you as she lays down, followed by Azelf.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I... I'm sure she's fine. She must be doing something important around Sinnoh...</span>\" Mesprit says, before laying her lips on your forehead.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Good night then, sweetie. Sleep tight.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Goodnight, you two. See you in the morning.</span>\" Azelf says, yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with the answer, you lay your head against Mesprit's chest, feeling her soothing heartbeat relaxing your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, you feel the giantess' chest moving along her rhythmic breath, probably meaning that she's asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you drift off too as sleep claims your consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, the two legendary sisters aren't sleeping at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she makes sure you're asleep, Mesprit opens her eyes, and dares to whisper:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Azelf,</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Yes.</span>\" her sister responds from beside her, while slowly turning around to face Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer suddenly worried gaze told the pink headed legendary everything. Azelf noticed that gleam in the human's eyes, and she came to the same conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason Uxie had wiped his memories away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, like the conclusion, she also came to the same halt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did Uxie do such thing? And where is she? Why didn't she show up the whole day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">We need to talk. About Uxie,</span>\" Mesprit says, once again feeling her heart leaping in her chest.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Yes.</span>\" her sister agrees.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"<span class=\"cpink\">I have no clue!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis voice, that you register as Mesprit's, roughly claims you back to reality from the warmth that a good dream brings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a yawn, which is greeted by complete silence. Your eyes open up a little bit, and you find yourself laying face down on the familiar furry surface that is Mesprit, both her paws laying on your back, keeping you still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you're about to get back to sleep, you hear her voice again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">As I was saying, sister, I've got no clue about it...</span> she repeats. You feel one of her paws gently sliding along the length of your back as she caresses you, believing you asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you're tugged back to reality as you realize that she and Azelf aren't sleeping, and are talking instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the voice Mesprit is using, you get that it is about something important. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn't, why would they have waited for you to be asleep to talk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, you decide to pretend to be still sleeping, only to hear what they're talking about, and to discover the reason of this secrecy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">But, there must be a reason. I mean, did he do something wrong to Uxie?</span>\" another voice, that you recognize as Azelf, speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018He\u2019?</i> Are they talking about you? If they are, what did you do to Uxie...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">That's the point - he didn't!</span>\" Mesprit cries. You choke back a sigh of relief that would alert the two that you are listening to the conversation they were trying to keep secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you like to eavesdrop, but if the two are talking about you, you have the right to know... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you carefully listen to every word, while breathing slowly, pretending to be asleep to not reveal your awake state to Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">He's been just perfect, the sweetest little thing you will ever find,</span>\" Mesprit continues, before smiling.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">The only thing he did was... stealing my heart...</span>\" she says sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood thing you aren't laying on your back. Otherwise, she would have noticed you blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Heh, careful sister. Or I might just fall for him too...</span>\" she says with a nervous giggle upon noticing the glare that Mesprit gives her as the words leave her mouth.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hehe, kidding,</span>\" she says, masking her delusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't kidding at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Anyway, what reason could Uxie have to do it? He didn't do anything, you are saying...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">At all! He actually helped her around the Lake!... And he...</span>\" Mesprit shakes her head, shaking the thought off as well.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Stop thinking about that, Mesprit,</span>\" Azelf says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown. So they ARE talking about you! But... what did Uxie do to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you focus really hard, trying to remember. You didn't see Uxie for the whole day, and yesterday... you can't remember her doing anything wrong to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Well, can you think of anymore reasons? Did he do something around Lake Acuity? Did she... make love with him against his will?... Was he trying to leave?</span>\" you hear Azelf speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit stays silent for a few moments. She didn't think about the last possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she quickly shakes it off.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Leaving? Why would he want to leave?</span>\" she asks with a hint of disbelief.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Well... heat problem... we are really big...  it could be lethal?</span>\" Azelf reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Okay, first off, he's mine,</span>\" she proclaims in a possessive manner.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Second, I highly doubt it.</span>\" you internally agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would you have wanted to leave? Sure, you were kinda afraid when Mesprit asked... forced you to do it the first time. But then, you willingly went along twice afterwards, so you aren't <b>that</b> scared anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Alright. Then why did Uxie wipe his memories away?</span>\" your heart skips a bit, and your blood seems to suddenly freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie did what?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs that why you can't remember? Uxie did really erase your memories? But why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Azelf and Mesprit are talking about someone else? No, they're taking about you, you know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your heart beating faster and your mind trying to find answers, you listen more carefully to their words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I don't know. I mean, he helped her with chores, warned her about those pokemon who slipped up inside her, he even helped with her heat... Why did she erase his memories?</span>\" at this point, you have no more doubts: they're talking about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie had erased your memories? But why? What did you do to make her want to make you look into her eyes, like she explained yesterday?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're pretty certain that you didn't do absolutely anything wrong. Or perhaps you did and she really deleted your-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you imagine yourself cowering in fear while Uxie looms over you, much like she was with those three Sneasel who sneaked inside her; You imagine her scolding you with harsh words, before opening those gigantic eyes of hers and making you forget everything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep yourself from shaking your head. You refuse to believe Uxie did something like that to you. Azelf and Mesprit must know that you're awake and listening, this must be some kind of prank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">This little one is been just a sweetie. All he did since we met was help, and Uxie did something like that to him...</span>\" Mesprit says dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel touched by her words, and enter a flustered state.<br>\r\n\"I did nothing.\" you whisper. And then instantly regret doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid it go unheard? Or did the two legendaries heard you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments of unnerving silence follow your whisper. You can't see anything aside from Mesprit's blue fur, but you can definitely feel the gazes of both sisters suddenly shifting on you, locking on your apparently sleeping form. You feel all the weight of those four, golden eyes, a crushing weight that keeps you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you can move too much anyway, with the paws of Mesprit easily keeping you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of pure silence, Mesprit speaks up again:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Well, might as well join in since you are listening, don't you think?</span>\" she says with a sigh.</span></div></div>",

D-Don't go!</span>\" she stammers, hastily trying to get up to go after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Azelf suddenly moves a arm in front of her sister, stopping her. Mesprit shoots her a worried gaze and she notices her sister shaking her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Let him. He needs some time to think...</span>\" Azelf states while retreating her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Mesprit still seemed reluctant to let her precious little one wander around a dark forest, all alone in the middle of the night.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">B-But... it could be dangerous...</span>\" she says worriedly, trying to deal with many emotions at once.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">He'll be fine.</span>\" Azelf replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run aimlessly through the forest around Lake Acuity while trying to find an answer to your questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate, you stop by the crystalline water of the Lake, and place a hand on your forehead, trying to collect your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie did really erase your memories? You cannot bring yourself to believe it. Uxie would never do something like that... or at least, not the Uxie you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the shy, sweet Uxie that saved you from a snow blizzard which almost killed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, then again, Mesprit and Azelf looked seriously concerned about you. Did it mean that Uxie really-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. How could they know? Uxie didn't show up for the whole day long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization hits you hard, like you just hit the floor after several seconds of free falling, while another thought finds its way inside your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Uxie didn't show up because she felt guilty? Because of what she did to you, the same human who had snuggled up to her just last night...? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you remember about yesterday night, the moment before you went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were with Uxie right where you are now, by Lake Acuity, while she was telling you that you had a nightmare, and that she meant to soothe you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, realization struck you with great strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if Uxie lied to you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-She wasn't trying to help me... t-this is a nightmare...\" you mutter, still unable to believe what's happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a good amount of time, you just stand there, looking at your own reflection in the water of the Lake that Uxie protects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Then... It all was true? Uxie, did you really wipe my memories away? Why?! Did I do something wrong to you? Or to Mesprit? Or Azelf? I'm sure I did nothing! Why then? Why did she wipe my memories away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy?</i>\u2019 you mentally ask yourself, while trying to keep tears from falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head in an almost frenetic manner, you decide to go back to the cave. Azelf and Mesprit are unaware about what you remember about last night, but maybe they could come up with a proper answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you hastily turn around and start to walk back to the cavern...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You walk away from the Lake and into the forest again. You need to talk to Mesprit and Azelf, tell them what you know. It may not be much, but it would surely be a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you walk, you try thinking about it yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie told you that you had a nightmare, and that she intended to help you get rid of it. But now you know that she had in reality erased your memories for some reason. But why? You can't remember anything happening before that! You just remember going to sleep with Mesprit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... But then? What happened? Why did the yellow headed giantess delete your memories? What reason did she have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Maybe... she was jealous? Or... or maybe she... she really abused you and made you forget it? The mere hypothesis is horrible, and it is even more horrible that you're considering it. But it is a chance. Uxie is still in heat after all, and Mesprit has shown you how delirious a pokemon can get when in that state of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. You're not actually sure that Uxie would ever do something like that. But then, it is the only logical explanation right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, if that isn't the reason, the problem remains: why did she erase your memories?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat must have been her motivation, you decide. Maybe she couldn't sleep because of her heat, she became uncontrollable and she used the first thing she found - you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really is something horrible to think about, but it was not her fault, you guess. So, if it really was her reason, if she really wasn't thinking lucidly, you guess that you could bring yourself to forgive her after all-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought is interrupted. You're sure you heard a noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen carefully. Again, you hear the noise. It seems like leaves shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, you glance around, and spot a few bushes rustling.<br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" you call out, expecting the cry of some pokemon in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again human,\" a voice says. Startled, you take a leap back and watch as a bipedal figure emerges from the rustling bushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou initially don't see it clearly due the darkness of the forest. But as the figure gets closer to you, you manage to make out the silhouette of a black and blue jackal, that you recognize as a Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Lucario...?\" you mutter, calming down a bit. Only to fear again as you notice a second figure leaping out from behind the bushes. This one is quadruped, and has a long tail and two big ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pale moonlight allows you to recognize the second pokemon as a Vaporeon. You take notice of them staring at you with different expressions: the Lucario stares at you with slight annoyance. Probably he doesn't like humans too much, and you're a human... better not piss him off, you decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Vaporeon - she stares at you with an expression of... pity? Why does she look so pitiful?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Hi?\" you say as the two walk closer to you, before remembering about something.<br>\r\n\"Hey, could you please tell me who talked? I mean, I'm sure I heard a voice...\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct. It was me, human,\" the Lucario speaks up, surprising you.<br>\r\n\"Oh... er...\" you mutter not sure of how to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, human. Us and you need to talk about something,\" the blue and black pokemon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...About?\" is the only reply you can give him.<br>\r\n\"We actually already tried to talk to your... friend Mesprit. But she ignored us and flew away. That's why we need you to listen to us.\" he continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step back. These two wanted to talk with Mesprit? About what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm listening. What did you want to tell Mesprit? I'll make sure to tell her,\" you assure.<br>\r\n\"There's no need for it, since you are personally involved in this,\" you look into the Lucario's crimson eyes, before blinking a few times, talking in clear body language: \u2018What?\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, you just found out about what Uxie did to you, didn't you? Mesprit and Azelf told you, right?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... How do you know about it?\" you ask, before answering yourself:<br>\r\n\"Were you spying on me?\" you hiss.<br>\r\n\"No no, we were just keeping an eye on you. And, trust me, we had a good reason,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the turn of the Vaporeon to speak up.<br>\r\n\"<u>Yeah, we saw Uxie wiping away your memories,we saw her lying to you...</u>\" she says, although you can't possibly understand her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the Lucario picks up on this problem.<br>\r\n\"She said that we saw her wiping your memories away. We saw how she lied to you,\" he speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou self-convince that these two are speaking the truth.<br>\r\n\"Alright, I believe you,\" you say, earning a smile from the Vaporeon.<br>\r\n\"But now, I need to know, why did Uxie erase my memories?! You two, you are saying that you saw her so please, tell me!\" you plead, this time earning a smirk from the Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, human. That's what we're here for. As I already told, you and us need to talk. Preferably in a more secluded place,\" he says, turning around while motioning for you to follow with a single movement of his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vaporeon emulates him as she turns around as well as they start to walk deeper into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there for a few moments. Can you really trust these two pokemon? Do they really know why Uxie has erased your memories?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, you decide. They told you what you already knew, meaning that they were speaking the truth: they SAW Uxie lying to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" the Lucario calls you, his voice calling you back to reality.<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" you reply as you hurry to follow them, your heart beating faster as you are about to find out the truth...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you follow the two pokemon, a shadow - a huge shadow - suddenly obscures the moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance backwards, discovering a familiar giantess with a yellow head and eyes closed as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled by the sudden apparition of Uxie, you turn back, only to discover that the Lucario and the Vaporeon disappeared. Your gaze shifts on Uxie again, and you find her hovering above her own Lake, a dejected look painted on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as you're about to shy away, the giantess happens to rise her head up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving always her eyes closed, it's hard to tell is she saw you or not. But you find your answer as you notice her mouth opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without any warning, the giantess floats towards you; before you even know it, you're snatched up and hugged against the giantess face.<br>\r\n\"Hi Uxie...\" you mutter as calmly as you can. She doesn't reply, but she starts nuzzling you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only serves you as a confirm: she's sorry for some reason. Or maybe, wherever she was for the whole day, she just really, really missed you. But, given the circumstances, the first option is more probable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushed against her face, you notice her floating over the lake shore and sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... do you feel fine...?\" you ask her. You still get no reply.<br>\r\n\"Come on, did something happen to you? Why do you look so sad?\" you ask again, still getting no response from the yellow headed giantess, who doesn't give any signs of wanting to break her hug anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where were you? I... uh... missed you?\" you say, trying to make her talk using sweet words. She still doesn't answer, but your words definitely had an effect on her as she suddenly pulls you backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie lets you sit on her cupped  paws  as you are brought in front of her face. You find her staring down at you intently, her closed eyes fixed on your comparatively puny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she slowly moved you to her face again, though this time not to her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her <i>lips</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie placed a small kiss on your forehead, before pulling back, leaving you feeling like you're on fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess giggles softly. Then, for the first time since she returned, she finally decides herself to talk:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Don't you worry my little one,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I am fine.</span>\" shaking off your blush, you smile and nod your head.<br>\r\n\"Why were you acting so weird then?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the pixie drops her smile, but quickly shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Don't worry about it,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You instead, I didn't think I would have found you awake in the middle of the night. And I didn't think I would have found you out in the open. What are you doing out here?<br>\r\nAll by yourself?</span>\" she asks concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before remembering about why she had been away from home for the whole day. Was her little human trying to leave again? But... she did delete his memories! He couldn't have possibly regained them! When someone looked into her eyes, their memories were gone for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie looks at you up close. You didn't have your bag with you this time. This was a good sign, but she doesn't discard the idea that whatever made her human want to leave the first time could have convinced him that he had to leave without losing anymore time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, he maybe waited for her sisters to be asleep before trying to escape...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Hey, you aren't leaving, are you? Please, do tell me the truth...</span>\" Uxie asks you with worry.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Why does everyone keep asking me that...?</i>\u2019 you think.<br>\r\n\"Uh, no? Why would I want to leave anyway?\" you state with a hint of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie stares at you for a moment.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Azelf and Mesprit. Are they asleep...?</span>\" she then asks.<br>\r\n\"No? I told them that I needed some air, that's why I'm here,\" you lie, before an idea finds its way in your thoughts.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think we should go back. Maybe they're worried about me...\" you try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">They can wait for a bit more, dear,</span>\" Uxie tells you, before assuming a serious expression. You find her face inching closer to you - or she's moving you closer to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... what is happening...?\" you question, not quite sure of what the blue and yellow titaness has in mind. Uxie stares at you for a few moments. You have a feeling that she's looking into your eyes. You swallow, praying that she isn't planning to open hers again, making you forget what you had learned earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie stares right into the human's eyes, noticing that the yellow gleam that was usually present in the eyes of those who forgot things because of her has faded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe the human didn't find out about what she did? Mesprit and Azelf did for sure, but she'll confront them later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the question remains: did the human discover about her actions...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie seems to be pondering something. She remains silent for a few minutes, just staring at you, before talking again:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Listen, I need to know something now,</span>\" the yellow headed pixie tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what?\" you ask. Uxie takes a deep breath.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Here we are...</i>\u2019 you think as she talks:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\"> I need to know... did you find out...?</span>\" she asks with an anxious voice.</span></div></div>",

Better go and reassure them.</span>\" Uxie replies, starting to float into the depths of the thick forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before the titanic figures of the two pokemon come into view. They quickly take notice of their sister's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even letting Uxie talk, Azelf floats forward, grabbing her in hug. Making you fall off the giantess' paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go pale and scream as you fall to your very probable death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Mesprit notices you falling. Her two tails dart forward, right underneath you. You land onto them, and sigh in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">And that makes two. Hehehe, looks like you really can't survive without me.</span>\" Mesprit snickers, retreating her tails, snatching you up and closing your body in a hug.<br>\r\n\"Apparently.\" you reply, giving a small, grateful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit smiles sweetly, before turning her attention on Uxie.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">How are you feeling, Uxie?</span>\" she asks with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf breaks the hug, letting her sister breath.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'm fine, thank you.</span>\" she replies, smiling.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Mesprit told me what happened, Uxie. That's simply-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Rough, I know.</span>\" Uxie ends the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence follows. Then, a bright smile spreads on Mesprit's face.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"chotpink\">So, we're here now,</span></i>\" her smile shifts into a grin.<br>\r\nYou find her mouth approaching your ear.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">What me and this little cutie here could be doing right now? Preferably in private?</span>\" the statement, said in a mere whisper, makes you freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're firmly held into Mesprit's hug, and the giantess has no intention of letting go of you. Not anytime soon. There's no way out.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"chotpink\">Come on, you. You said you wanted to help, didn't you?</span></i>\u2019 she speaks with a small smile.<br>\r\n\u2018Not <i>that</i> kind of help, Mesprit!\u2019 you mentally retort.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"chotpink\">Too late~</span></i>\u2019 she giggles in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can do anything, though, the sun settles down. Having spent the past few hours worrying for your own well being, you totally lost the track of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moon slowly rises into the sky. You take your chances.<br>\r\n\"Hey, is anyone hungry? Because I sure am!\" you quickly say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Now that you say it, I'm pretty hungry too.</span>\" Mesprit says. In confirmation of her words, her stomach growls loudly. You sigh in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf floats forward, snatching you from Mesprit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Hey-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Human, let's go find something to eat.</span>\" she says you. You nod slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, before Mesprit can further complain, Azelf quietly ventures into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue giantess stops after a few minutes, and stares down at you intently.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Listen. I actually wanted to talk to you,</span>\" she says. You nod at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Uxie and Mesprit trust you. They say you're a friend, but...</span>\" you already don't like where this is going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to interrupt, but Azelf doesn't let you as she continues, staring right into your eyes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">...But I know your kind.</span>\" she speaks, keeping her voice low. Yet again today, you feel fear rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">If you ever hurt my sisters-</span>\" you interrupt her.<br>\r\n\"<i>If</i> I hurt your sisters - and I can't nor do I have any intention to - you'll blow me up or something like that?\" you say with a hint of indignation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Nope,</span>\" she says, while leaning forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to ask what's going on, but you suddenly find that you can't move or talk anymore. You just stare at the titaness for a minute, until she speaks again:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Got that?</span>\" you discover that you're able to move again.<br>\r\n\"...Okay, what the hell was that?!\" you ask, somewhat startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Simple, I took your will away. That's what happens if you ever hurt my sisters,</span>\" she says threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the frightened look on your face, her smirk fades into a smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">... That said,</span>\" she says reassuringly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Don't let my words get in the way of our friendship,</span>\" suddenly, her smile drops as she continues:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Please, forgive me. But my sisters are my only family. I already almost lost them once and-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"It's alright. I understand.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile comes back on her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Come on then. We're supposed to get food.</span>\" she says, her fist opening as she lets you sit on her palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before Azelf gathers a large amount of berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're cur holding to one her tails. In fact, Azelf has currently her arms occupied by the berries.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I think these will be enough...</span>\" you hear her mutter as she floats out of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finds Mesprit and Uxie chatting near the lake shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey abruptly stop, noticing Azelf's presence.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Where's little one?</span>\" Mesprit instantly inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an answer, the tail holding you lowers. Your feet connect with the ground as the tail gently unwraps from your waist. .<br>\r\nYou can't enjoy the ground beneath your feet for long, though, as you are soon snatched up by two paws which, you see, belong to Mesprit. And they bring you straight to her chest as she hugs you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Missed me?</span>\" she asks playfully. You look elsewhere as a blush spreads on your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Um. Mesprit, it seems that you like our little friend quite a lot.</span>\" Uxie states with a small smile. Mesprit blinks innocently.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Who? Me? We're just good friends, sister.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"chotpink\">Or maybe something more~</span></i>\u2019 her telepathic voice resounds in your head.<br>\r\n\"Yes! Just <i>good friends </i>, Uxie.\" you state, making sure to empathize your phrase. Mesprit giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess lowers her paw back on the ground, gently letting you on it.<br>\r\n\"Well then... let's eat.\" you suggest. You dumbly realize that you didn't even need to say that. The three already dug in their meal. Sighing, you take a few berries for yourself and start eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you're done you and the three giantesses are done eating, the moon fully rose in the sky, enlightening it along with thousands of stars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're totally stuffed and, judging by the satisfied sighs of the three, they are as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Well,</span>\" Uxie says with a yawn.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I guess it's time to sleep.</span>\" <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You're right. Today was sure full of emotions!</span>\" she giggles at her own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, her gaze travels on you. She stares at you for a few moments, that smirk of hers not leaving her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Mine!</span>\" she suddenly chimes, startling you as two gigantic paws rush towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't even think to move out of the way as they get a hold of you and retreat, bringing you to Mesprit's chest. The titaness giggles as she encloses you in yet another hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance quickly at Azelf and Uxie, mentally begging them to help you. You notice Uxie shaking her head with her paw on her forehead, while Azelf rolls her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world shakes Mesprit lays flat on the ground, making it quake softly. Soon, the other two giantesses follow her, laying down on the snowy floor on each of Mesprit's sides.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Uxie, aren't you sleeping in your cave?</span>\" you hear Azelf asks. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I'm fine sleeping outside.</span>\" comes her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming satisfied with the answer, Azelf talks again:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">See you all in the morning.</span>\" she says, before she goes silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<span class=\"chotpink\">Well, goodnight my little one,</span>\u2019 you hear Mesprit's telepathic voice in your head. Seriously, this day will end with your head aching as hell.<br>\r\n\u2018<span class=\"chotpink\">Sleep tight. Oh, and...</span>\u2019 her voice gets sweeter.<br>\r\n\u2018<span class=\"chotpink\">Welcome in the family.</span>\" you don't know if to feel flattered or scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes pass, in which point you notice all three sisters fast asleep. You have to admit, Mesprit actually makes a comfortable bed, her paws acting as a soft blanket, while the beats of her heart slowly soothe you to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly wake up. Looking up, you notice it's still nighttime, but you're unsure about what time it is. Mesprit is still asleep, snoring softly, maybe swimming in sweet dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your vision blurry from the drowsiness, you casually glance to your side. And notice that Azelf is no longer there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting your eyes open, you look around. And there, truly impossible to escape eyesight, you notice the blue mountain sitting at short distance from the sleeping form of Uxie, her tails and feet submerged in the water of the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks like someone who's pondering something. You wonder what is going on in her mind. Maybe she's thinking about her sisters. True, you met her only earlier today, but you really couldn't not get that she cares deeply about her sisters... though you would have appreciated if she hadn't expressed it by menacing to take away your will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling curious, you consider to slip out of Mesprit's hug and go talk to her. But your lack of sleep soon reclaims you to dreamland, and the thought of sleeping is really tempting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a yawn, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Curiosity winning your sleepiness, you slowly start sliding out of Mesprit's tight hug. It takes you a full five minutes, as you work your way out careful to not wake the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you manage to slip out from under the giantess' paws. But, even if she is asleep, Mesprit seems to feel your absence. She starts moving her paws around, trying to find you, needing you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for them to give up on finding you and slide down onto Mesprit's chest. You focus on the major problem: how to get down? Jumping is absolutely out of question, unless you have a death wish... Sliding down the giantess also sounds pretty... deadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a sigh, you look around and notice one is Mesprit's arms laying on the snowy, cold ground. From there, you could easily walk on it and get down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you walk towards the other side of the giantess' chest and hop onto her shoulder. You look back at her pink face, to see if she woke up.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe didn't. Her eyelids are still closed, hiding those golden, charming eyes of hers. For a 200ft pokemon, she looks rather adorable... Adorable? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, returning to your senses.<br>\r\n\"Okay, what was that?\" you ask, before remembering what you're supposed to be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, giving a sigh, you turn around, starting to climb down Mesprit's titanic arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you almost twenty minutes to accomplish the task, but you finally get past Mesprit's wrist, palm, fingers, and you finally hop on the ground, feeling your feet sinking into the snow. Luckily, Mesprit didn't wake up in the whole process, and Azelf is still in the same position as she was when you noticed her, still thinking about something unknown to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decidedly make your way towards the giantess, walking past the sleeping bodies of Mesprit and Uxie, stopping at Azelf's side.<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\" you clear your throat, succeeding in getting her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find her star shaped head slowly moving as her golden eyes fix down on you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Oh... you.</span>\" she mutters distractedly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Why aren't you sleeping? Nightmares?</span>\" she then asks, giving a bit of a teasing smile.<br>\r\n\"No,\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"I could ask you the same thing, you know. Why are you awake?\" the pale moonlight allows you to see a faint blush spreading across her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes her a while before answering.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Uh... you know, just thinking.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"About what?\" you inquire again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">About things that happened in the past. Things that you couldn't-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"Things like a pact and you three getting big?\" you interrupt. You see her eyeing you with her mouth wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">... Mesprit told you about this, didn't she?</span>\" you smirk, nodding your head. Apparently, you guessed right about her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice her huffing, turning her head to her sleeping sister.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">\u2018Never trust humans\u2019, uh Mesprit?</span>\" she asks in a noticeable annoyed whisper.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm human. And you're talking to me.\" you stick up for Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf's gaze travels back on you. She smirks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Well, you're an exception, I believe. Otherwise, Uxie would have wiped your memories about us away.</span>\" she says. The last remark makes sends shivers down your back. You find nothing to say afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear Azelf groan.<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's happening? Are you alright?\" you ask, concerned.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I'm fine.</span>\" she replies with a broken voice.<br>\r\n\"No, you're not,\" you say firmly.<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" she looks at you for a moment. You see an expression of pain on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives a sigh.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">You know what period is for us pokemon, don't you?</span>\" she asks you. You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd how could you not know? Mesprit spent the whole day plucking out pokemon of her sister's... love tunnel because of that. And then, the same Mesprit had you 'play' with her. You wonder if part of her issue is gone, at least for now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf goes on.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Yeah, <i>that</i> is tormenting me. And no pokemon to help me. They're either too scared, horny, or... I-I don't even know!</span>\" she stammers, her voice rising, risking to wake Uxie and Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly wonder what would happen if Mesprit suddenly wakes up and notices you talking about sex with her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm... maybe I could help... ehm... somehow?\" you ask, keeping your voice low.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">You can't help me. Humans and pokemon aren't compatible. And-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"Not that kind of help, Azelf.\" you state bluntly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offers a sympathetic smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Well, there is no other way,</span>\" she pauses, seeming to be thinking.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Of course, if you're willing, we could... Maybe there's some private place into the forest</span>\" you take a step back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe it. It's the third time you hear a pokemon - and huge one as well - asking to have sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence follows Azelf's question, interrupted just by the snoring of Mesprit and Uxie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seems to stop. The giantess stares at you intently, waiting for your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what to do. If to agree - and risk your own life - or refuse - and you're pretty sure Azelf won't take 'no' as an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did she even ask? She mistrusted you just earlier!... Why did you even bothered to check on her? She threatened to take your will away! These seem pretty good reasons to refuse. However, you're pretty sure that you would regret it the moment you say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, her sisters trust you, right? She wouldn't harm someone close to them, right? Maybe you can convince her that you're tired and you want to go back to sleep? Mesprit would make a good protection for the night. But, are you really willing to sleep with her? You quickly decide that it's better than the alternative...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels like an eternity since she asked the question, but it is only a few minutes. The silent giantess stares down at you with hope. You rise your head, gazing up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a few more moments, but you finally make a choice...</span></div></div>",

I m-mean-\" <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I can't sleep like this!</span>\" she exclaims, waving her arms. You notice Uxie moaning out in her sleep. You repeatedly press your index finger on your mouth, silently telling her to keep her voice low. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf quietly lowers her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Please... I beg you...</span>\" she says, a suffering look taking place on her face. Her expression successfully melts your heart. Damn it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Are you really suffering?\" she nods her head almost frenetically, keeping her eyes fixed on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour palm connects with your face as you shake your head, praying that this is only a nightmare, that you're still asleep on Mesprit's chest. But you know this is hard reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hardly find the words to reply:<br>\r\n\"A-Alright. I-I will help you. Just... let's be quick, alright?\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf's face almost immediately brightens up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Of course. I understand that you're scared of it, but I tell you, take it as bonding.</span>\" you rise your head at the last remark.<br>\r\n\"Mesprit is going to kill me.\" you say, sighing. She smiles softly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">It appears that you developed a close relationship with her already, uh? Don't worry, I'll handle everything problem that this may cause,</span>\" she says sympathetically, before holding out a paw.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Now... shall we?</span>\" you take a few more moments to finally decided yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you hop on her paw. Azelf gives you another, grateful smile, before silently floating past her sisters and into the thick forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moonlight enlightens the way as Azelf floats into the depths of the dark, snowy woods, searching for an... appropriate spot. You can't help but feel scared. Scared of what will happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a few minutes, she stops in small, secluded clearing, hidden by tall trees, thick vegetation and darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness lowers her paw, gently letting you on the snow-covered grass. You see her paws closing together, a blush spreading on her cheeks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">So... er... Ready?</span>\" she asks, her gaze fixed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath.<br>\r\n\"I-I guess...\" you stammer. She nods.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I know how are you feeling right now... so, I hope this will enjoyable for... as it will be for me...</span>\" she says softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, she places her paws down and slowly lays on her back, spreading her legs in front of you, revealing her slit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate at the sight of it.<br>\r\n\u2018Let's get over with it.\u2019 you mentally prepare yourself. There's no going back now, and you know it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you step forward, getting closer to her vertical lips.<br>\r\n\"H-How am I supposed to do it?\" you stammer, rubbing the back of your head. Seriously, is all this really happening?<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Well... rub it, I guess...</span>\" comes Azelf's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding to yourself, you slowly extend your arm, until your arm lightly touches her slit. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Oh!</span>\" she exclaims, feeling your touch on her sensible nether regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azelf! Quiet!\" you suffocate your voice, so that only Azelf hears you. The giantess rises her head, nods briefly and places her paws on her mouth, before laying back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, giving a sigh, you start rubbing slowly, feeling her crotch pulsating against your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't sure you're doing it good, until you feel the area getting wet.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Mh!</span>\" the titaness confirms that you're doing well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to speed up the process, you bring your other hand to her crotch, starting to rub faster. Suffocated moans start to escape the giantess' mouth more often. You notice her legs moving frenetically, her tails swinging wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth drools beneath her paws, small rivers of saliva pouring down her cheeks; her eyes are closed from the intense pleasure she is feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, she can't hold it in anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\"> Mhh!</span>\" understanding what is about to happen, you quickly pull yourself back. Just as a wave of white liquid flows out of her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice her removing her paws from her mouth, letting herself pant.<br>\r\n\"G-Great... T-thanks...\" she stammers, never having recovered from her orgasm, that left her unable to talk properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes her a full twenty minutes to recover. Twenty minutes in which your blush gradually fades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly sits upright.<br>\r\n\"D-Did I do good?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">You were wonderful,</span>\" comes her reply. You notice her scanning the ground, trying to spot you. She seems to notice you as you feel yourself being lifted off the ground and onto her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't let you say anything more though, as she pushes you into her cheek.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I can't find a way to express how grateful I am. Just know that you have my sincere thanks. My heat won't bother me for days!</span>\" she silently exclaims.<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" you reply, smiling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles brightly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Come on, we're supposed to be asleep. And remember, we did nothing~</span>\" she brings out a cheerful tone for the first time since you met her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a few minutes for her to get back to the lake shore where her sisters are currently sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe floats over Mesprit, placing you down on her chest. Instantly her paws enclose your whole being in a hug.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Goodnight then.</span>\" Azelf says, blowing you a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf takes her original place beside Mesprit. Within minutes, you hear her snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, and close your eyes, ready to drift off as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Did anything fun?</span>\" Mesprit's voice snaps you back to reality.<br>\r\n\"M-Mesprit?\" you say. Did she hear what you just did?!<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Yup. And I dare you to sneak away from me while I'm asleep again.</span>\" she calmly says, leaving out the part where her spirit left her body to see what the two of you were doing. She will tell you about that later on, she decides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at her face, expecting to see an irritated expression. But you don't. You notice her staring down at you, one eye closed, and a teasing smile on her face.<br>\r\n\"... You wouldn't hurt me, would you?\" you ask, fearing the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Nope. I couldn't do that, you're just too... precious to me. But I can assure that you'll feel incredibly sorry for a week,</span>\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pale at the perspective.<br>\r\n\"What if I say that I'm sorry now?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Apology accepted. You did it to help my sister. But,</span>\" here she lets out a low giggle.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You aren't forgiven yet.</span>\" she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get where this is going.<br>\r\n\"Alright, what do you want?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I'll tell you later. Now sleep, you'll need it.</span>\" she says, leaning to place a peck on your forehead, which immediately burns hot.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Goodnight again, cutie.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Er... goodnight...\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes disappear behind her eyelids, and her paws push you deeper into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes as well. Whatever she has in store, you're sure you're going to hate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you feel her chest rising up and falling down along her breath, meaning that the giantess is asleep. You let the movements cradle you, while the beats of her heart slowly soothe you to sleep as well.</span></div></div>",

One paw was removed from you, and is currently resting on the ground, but the other still has a firm grasp on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lake guardian is still asleep herself, like her sisters, who are still floating in their own dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, until dawn fully rises up in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hour of sound sleeping, Mesprit's eyelids slowly open up, revealing her golden eyes to the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe absentmindedly sits upright. But, as she is about to stir, she notices she is holding something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly releases you from her hug and brings you to her gigantic face as she inspects you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a few seconds for her mind to process who the tiny human she is holding is. A smile appears on her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Why hello there, my little cutie. Silly me, I was about to think you were a dream. But you weren't,</span>\"she whispers, placing a small kiss on your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snickers.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You're still here. Still all mine.</span>\" she says, proceeding to lightly shake you in order to wake you from your slumber.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Wake up, my little one. There will be time to nap later,</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moan out in your sleep.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Wake up sleepyhead~</span>\" she repeats, placing a paw on your head, starting to stroke it softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still don't wake up. Mesprit grins.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">And I thought it was hard to wake Uxie up. But I have one more trick in my fur~</span>\" she sings lowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she pushes your unconscious body into her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems to work, as you slowly open your eyes. And the first thing you see is a gigantic pair of pink lips being pressed on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fiery blush takes place on your cheeks as memories of yesterday come to your mind. You recognize the lips as Mesprit's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd your thought is confirmed when she pulls off, smiling down at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Good morning, sleepy!</span>\" she cheers.<br>\r\n\"Eh... good morning, Mesprit...\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess lowers her paws. You hop onto the ground and glance around, spotting Azelf and Uxie still fast asleep. Their snoring can easily be heard from miles of distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of last night come to you as you look at Azelf, and you flush bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Hey, I'll get something to eat. Wait for me here.</span>\" You hear Mesprit saying behind you. You turn around just in time to see her leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to return after ten minutes with her paws full of all kinds of berries. She lowers herself, and sets the literal hill of fruit down in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Let's dig in. I've got something to tell you.</span>\" Mesprit says, sitting down in front of you, crossing her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Hey, remember when I told you about something you had to do for me?</span>\" Mesprit asks while chewing on the berries she provided for both of you.<br>\r\n\"I was hoping you'd forget about that.\" you reply bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I don't forget things easily,</span>\" she giggles, while playfully wagging one paw.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">But it's not what you think. Listen, I've been away from home for two days now. I just want to make sure that Lake Verity is alright before coming back here. But I needed someone - you - to do a few chores around, like you did here with Uxie.</span>\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...\" <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Aw, please! I just need some help, nothing more!</span>\" she insists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't what to do. Going with Mesprit would mean remaining alone with her. And, knowing her, you're not quite sure if you're going to like whatever she means with 'chores'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you don't want to upset her by refusing. And plus, you're quite curious about her own home, the Lake Verity she mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">So? Will you come with me? It'll be just a few hours, then we'll come back.</span>\" she says again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of silence follow her last question. She just stares down at you with an expectant look, her head crafting a huge shadow that engulfs you completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your time deciding what to do. You quickly glance at the other two giantesses, but they're still dead asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, ultimately, you rise your head and reply...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without second thinking, you quickly turn around and dash away from the lustful giantess.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">W-wait! D-don't go!</span>\" you hear her stammer with a pleading voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you aren't going to stop. The only thing that counts now is getting as far as you can from the Emotion pokemon. At least for a while, until she calms down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, sadly, you don't get too far before having to stop right in front of Acuity Lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar away from you is the cave where the guardian of this place currently is. But you know that there's no chance you can reach it. Mesprit would simply use her psychic to get you in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Please... come back... I need you...</span>\" you hear Mesprit's voice. And it's definitively not too far from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that you can only do one thing to escape the delirious giantess. Even though it seems impossible, it's worth a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, taking a deep breath, you leap into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water of the lake is still freezing cold, having been unfrozen just a short while ago. The cold quickly assaults your body as you start rethinking about your choice. Many pokemon swim past you, paying you no attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering that you have limited oxygen, you start swimming forward, in direction of Acuity Cave. Sure, Uxie is probably not in the mood to fight her own sister, but she could at least keep you away from her for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Mesprit makes her way towards the lake as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she gets there, she glances around, trying to spot you anywhere on the snowy land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, her little one couldn't have been so inconsiderate to dive into the lake. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze darts around frenetically, but she can't find you anywhere. Her fear starts to rise. You couldn't possibly have done it... the water is too cold for any human to survive... you would freeze to death... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last look around finally confirms her fears.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Darn...</span>\" she mutters to herself as she closes her eyes, staying perfectly still as her own spirit floats its way out of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without losing anymore time, Mesprit 'dives' into the lake as well. She's not going to let you die of frostbite, she has to rescue, no matter what!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at you, you swim as fast as you can, as your breath is running short. You're pretty sure that Mesprit had arrived to the lake as well; if you emerge, she would see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the situation is becoming unbearable. Your lungs, already deprived of air from the running you had been doing in order to get away from Mesprit, are now starting to freeze along with the rest of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you come to the point where you have to necessarily surface. You rise your nose from the water, greedily inhaling as much air as you can. Not daring to look back to see if Mesprit is there, you instead take a look forward; the cave where Uxie resides is nearer than it was before... Still a bit, you can make it!... At least, you hope. Even though your lungs are finally getting filled with oxygen again, the cold certainly getting any better. If you don't reach the cave soon, you're afraid of what is going to happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you,  Mesprit's spirit, which is still floating underwater trying to find you, comes to a halt as she spots your body afloat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, she makes her way back to the land and enters her body again. In the same moment, you dive into the water once again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Hold on, my little one, Mesprit is coming!</span>\" she thinks out loud as she starts floating on the surface of the lake at supersonic speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it's not long before the Emotion pokemon catches up with you. But she ends up surpassing you, stopping at short distance from the cave where her sister is. Still fearing the worst, she starts looking around once again, trying to find you in the immense mirror that is the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you have to surface. But, before you can take the first breath, you notice Mesprit floating right in front of you, her back turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep yourself from gasping, and gaze underneath her in the meantime. You notice that you're almost there... if you manage to reach the cave, you'll be safe! Of course, you have to go through one major problem first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, taking a deep breath, you dive once again, strongly hoping to make it...</span></div></div>",

Her huge body, which is currently  floating on the surface of the lake, casts a huge shadow even underwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so, you rise your head out of the water. Much to your relief, you notice Acuity Cavern right in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly glance backwards. And your heart seems to melt as you notice the same pokemon you're trying to get away from with her back and to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently but quickly, you get out of the water and rush inside the cavern completely unnoticed. Only when you're safe from the emotion pokemon's gaze, you dare to sigh in relief. Granted, diving into the lake might have been an irresponsible move, but, at least, you made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering a bit because of your wet clothes and the cold atmosphere, you look upwards, discovering Uxie laying down on the floor of the cave, sleeping. Or not. It's really hard to tell, since her eyes are constantly closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all your doubts are dissipated as she turns her head in your direction.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Oh... you...</span>\" she says, not moving from her position. After all, as Mesprit said, it's practically impossible for her to fit completely inside the cavern, but you guess that that it's spacious enough for her to at least lay down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Uxie talking again:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Why are you all wet?... Did you take a bath into the lake?... With your clothes on?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Kind of...\" you mutter, before remembering your current situation.<br>\r\n\"Uxie! Mesprit has gone crazy!\" you exclaim in a scared whisper, fearing that the pink and blue giantess might hear you from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie rises her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Why? What ha-</span>\" she roughly stops, reality hitting her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Oh no! She didn't try anything weird with you, did she?</span>\" she asks, a noticeable hint of worry in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou timidly nod. In response Uxie slams her paw against her face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Damn...</span>\" you hear her mutter, before she turns to you again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Listen. Go outside, I'll join you in a second.</span>\" she instructs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic starts to rise in you.<br>\r\n\"Do... Do I have to? I mean-\"<br>\r\n\"Running from problems won't solve them.\" Uxie interrupts you. She quickly adds:<br>\r\n\"But don't worry. I'll talk to Mesprit. I won't let her do anything to you, promise.\" she speaks with a softer voice, a small smile adorning her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, you nod. Almost mechanically, you turn around, starting to walk towards the entrance of the cavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get hit by the warm sunlight as you get out of Acuity Cavern. And, right a few meters from you, you spot the looming figure of Mesprit, who still seems to be looking for you, although a worried look had taken place on her face. After all, she did search for you for a while. Can you really blame her for being worried?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. Guilt is the last thing you need right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you're about to forget what Uxie said and head back into the cave, Mesprit turns to look straight in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer worried expression instantly fades, leaving a smile in its place.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">There you are!</span>\" she says, while starting to lean down, her paw extending, eager to get a hold of you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">You had me worried for a moment. But-</span>\" she is interrupted as Uxie suddenly appears in between you and her, causing her to retract her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit frowns.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">What are you doing, Uxie?</span>\" she asks. Then, remembering about her current state, she puts you aside for a moment.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">How are you feeling, sister?</span>\" she speaks with soft words.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Better, thank you.</span>\" the yellow headed giantess replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two go silent for a couple of moments, before Uxie speaks again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\"> Say Mesprit,</span>\" she says, cocking her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Have you been trying anything weird while I wasn't there?</span>\" Mesprit seems taken aback by the sudden question. But she quickly recomposes herself.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Who? Me? Nope. Just some emotions games. Right, little one?</span>\" she asks, peeking over her sister's shoulder to catch a glimpse of your form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't reply.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Do not lie to me Mesprit,</span>\" Uxie says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">You can't fool me.</span>\" the pink headed giantess huffs loudly in response.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Do you necessarily have to spoil <i>all</i> my fun sister? I haven't tried anything... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">yet</font></span>\" she retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Uxie can reply, Mesprit continues.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Now, if you'll excuse me, we were in the middle of something nice and-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I won't let you, Mesprit.</span>\" Uxie says bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an answer, Mesprit cups her paws together, a blackish sphere starting to form in between them.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I don't want to hurt you, sister. Let me get the little one, and I'll leave.</span>\" she speaks slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Uxie spreads her arms in front of you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I don't want to hurt you either, Mesprit. Stop this foolishness, or you'll regret it.</span>\" the knowledge pokemon calmly says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Foolishness? I just want to have some fun!</span>\" Mesprit retorts.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">And then, you're the one to talk! I've had to pull, like, twenty pokemon out of you! Wasn't that 'fun'?</span>\" Uxie blushes furiously at the memory.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">I didn't want any of that!</span>\" she shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing the imminent fight between the two, you, who had been watching the two arguing the whole time, decide to try and stop them.<br>\r\n\"Can I say so-\" <br>\r\n\"No!\" both giantesses shout, menacing to break both your eardrums. You can literally <i>feel</i> the irritation flowing like electricity between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sphere dies in Mesprit's paws. You sigh. At least, she wants to avoid the conflict. You notice her looking at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Come on, I didn't try to hurt you in any way, did I?</span>\" she asks. You catch the hint of sadness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you don't find reasons to blame her. It's not her fault if she can't hold back her urges.<br>\r\n\"Well... no...\" you admit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess lowers her head for a second, before looking at you again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Come on... let's leave...</span>\" she says you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, you feel your body getting surrounded by psychic energy as the giantess lifts you off ground, and moves you towards her.<br>\r\n\"W-wait...!\" you shout, fear once again rising inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou float right in between the two, before you feel yourself stopping. More psychic energy surrounds you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">Won't let you do that, Mesprit. If you want to leave, that's fine with me. But if he doesn't want to leave with you, he won't.</span>\" Uxie says resolutely, pulling you closer to her with her own psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what to think. A big part of you doesn't want to spend another moment with the pink and blue giantess; The other pities her. After all, she delirious right now, she can't control herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit keeps pulling with all of her powers. The fire inside her burns with great intensity. She's determined to get what she wants. And, should she tear her little human from her sister's paws and force him to do as she wishes, she will do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit tries to pull you to her, while Uxie tries to pull you in the opposite direction. But you don't move of an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can definitely a sharp pain starting to manifest itself. You go pale as you realize that the giantesses might just tear you in two if they don't stop this soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain soon becomes unbearable.<br>\r\n\"Stop! Stop!... Please!\" you shout, hoping that the two would realize you're in pain and stop this stupid, pointless fight of theirs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel yourself rocketing into a wall of fur. In the same moment, a loud thud is heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a moment to realize the fight is over. One of the two has beaten the other, and is currently holding you. With your heart galloping within your chest, you shift your gaze upwards. Only to notice that the winner of the fight is...</span></div></div>",

Then, still enclosed in her hug, you do your best to turn around in her paws and look at Mesprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice her floating on her back on the surface of the lake. Suddenly you know what the loud splash you heard earlier was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit stays completely silent, not moving a single muscle; those golden eyes of hers, which are easily five times your size, look completely void, while her whole face remains emotionless. Which is completely weird for the being of emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><span class=\"cyellow\"> Mesprit...</span></font>\" you hear Uxie whisper as she gets closer to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the approaching giantess, Mesprit briefly turns her head, before finally rising herself out of the water and turns around, her dripping back turned to both you and Uxie.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Good fight, Uxie.</span>\" you hear her say with an indecipherable voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a deep breath before talking again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">...

Suddenly, you feel very sorrowful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she playing with your emotions again? No, you decide, you didn't feel them coming from nowhere. You're <i>genuinely</i> sorry for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\"> Wait...

Don't go!\" you shout, surprising both giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink headed, fairy-like pokemon slowly turns her head to look at you once more. The damp spot under her eyes became wet. You figure out that in a matter of moments, she could burst into tears. Just imagining it is a heart-shattering experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">What?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder about your answer, not really knowing what to say.<br>\r\n\"... Can I... can we talk for a moment? In private?\" you ask. Seemingly curious about your question, Mesprit stares at you for a good amount of time, before slowly moving her head up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Uxie moving slightly behind you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cyellow\">But-</span>\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'll be fine.\" you say her, as Mesprit's twin tails wrap around you and snatch you from the yellow headed giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself being carried back into the thick, snowy forest you were in before everything happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two tails holding you release you on the snowy ground, while the giantess turns around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you can feel the ground shake beneath your feet as Mesprit lays down in front of you, her bodily warmth quickly melting the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">So, here we are,</span>\" she says, not pulling her gaze from you as she speaks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">What did you want to talk about?</span>\" deciding to go straight to the point, you quickly speak up:<br>\r\n\"Look, Mesprit, I don't want you to leave. You've been nice to me so far,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cocks her head. You interpret it as a \u2018go on\u2019.<br>\r\n\"But why... what was the reason of all this?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit blinks a few times, looking perplexed.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Weren't you listening?</span>\" she asks after a few moments of awkward silence.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I...</span>\" one of her paws move behind you, pushing you closer.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">...Want...</span>\" her tone of voice suddenly gets darker.

And that's the exact reason of why I ran,\" you say bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit goes silent, another moment of awkward silence following.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">When I talked about <i>that</i> kind of playing earlier, you knew what I was talking about. Why don't you want to play with me now?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hasn't to wait long for your answer.<br>\r\n\"... Because you're a pokemon? And a 200ft tall as well?\" you ask back, thinking it is an obvious reason.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Do I look like I care? I shouldn't even let you see me - and yet, I want you!</span>\" she repeats, once again lust controlling her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you consider running again. But you decide against it. <br>\r\n\u2018Running from problems won't solve them.\u2019 you remember Uxie's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit continues:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Please... let me play with you for a while.

Mesprit doesn't want to give up on you. Sure, you could help her, but then? What would Uxie say? And, most of all, whatever Mesprit has planned, it could be deadly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel like you're on fire, thousands of thoughts burning inside your mind.

And, as a result, you have to emerge from the cold water of the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your luck, Mesprit seems to not have noticed the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly glancing backwards, you notice that her huge form is standing at mere inches from you. You can almost feel the warmth emanated from her fur; Apparently, with her gigantic size, she didn't notice you surfacing. You can finally reach the cave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before you can dive again, you happen to sneeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, unluckily, the noise did not escape Mesprit's hearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the giantess' gaze shifts on you; you can literally feel all the weight of that golden stare of hers, a weight that keeps you in place, leaving you unable to move a single muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, before you can even turn to face her, you feel something tightly gripping you and pulling you out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay perfectly silent as Mesprit manipulates you so that you're staring right into the twin golden mirrors of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without pronouncing a single word, she shoves you forward, right into her chest.

And your world shakes as she sits down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can ask her whatever she has in store for you, she pulls you into yet another hug. The warm and soft fur cushions you, effectively succeeding in drying up a little your dripping clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost feel... safe. Like nothing could hurt you in this exact moment. Like-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesprit, stop playing with my emotions!\" you shout. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Quiet you. Just enjoy it.</span>\" comes her reply, followed by her signature giggle. You let out a deep sigh, which causes the giantess to giggle more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit keeps you 'entrapped' in between her chest and her paws for about an hour, doing a great job in warming you up. Much like Uxie has done earlier, when she found you unconscious in the middle of a blizzard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Feel better?</span>\" Mesprit asks after a few more minutes as she releases you from her hug. You look upwards, right into her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Actually... yes. That was kinda nice.\" you admit with a small smile. Mesprit giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the sweet smile on her face fades, leaving the same grin you saw earlier in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Now then,</span>\" she says. Is it you, or her voice got darker?<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I helped you. So, now, will you help me? Will you play with me?</span>\" she asks, a mischievous sparkle in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're in cage. Still held in her paws, you can't run away again. Mesprit must have thought about it. There is no way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of screaming her to let you go, you ponder an answer.<br>\r\n\"Do I have a choice?\" you ask, pretty much expecting the answer.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Nope.</span>\" she replies flatly, before continuing:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Now, to start off...</span>\" she mutters to herself, pondering what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find one of the fingers of her free paw finding its way on your head, stroking it as she thinks what 'game' should she start with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I know!</span>\" she chimes after a while, the excitement in her voice making your heart freeze.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Let's start with...</span></span></div></div>",

A mere toy for this titaness to use as she wishes; a toy she would wildly use to pleasure herself. She can do whatever she wants with you, and you can't do anything about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, sensing your fear, Mesprit gives a small and somewhat reassuring smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Why are you scared? You know I'm not going to hurt you.</span>\" she pauses to let a giggle escape her mouth, before continuing:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">And how could I? You're just too cute. I could never bring myself to hurt. In fact...</span>\" she stops in mid sentence to bring your helpless body upwards, lifting you like a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, before you can even think to talk, she does it for you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">...I think that our little game can wait for a bit, after all,</span>\" she says, seeming to be thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to let a out a relieved sigh, but her next phrase throws it right back in your lungs:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">I just thought of something else we can do.</span>\" contradictory to what she just said, she inches you dangerously close to her mouth, which is curled in a sickeningly sweet smile. She's deliberately creating an unnerving atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can <i>feel</i> her warm breath gently blowing into your face, which only serves to scare you more. Where the hell is Uxie?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit moves you an inch closer to her titanic mouth. You watch her lips move as she says one last sentence:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Pucker up.</span>\" with that, she pushes your whole being forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour struggles to break free from her grasp are pretty much useless as the Emotion pokemon starts to repeatedly pressing her lips on different parts of your face; she smooches your forehead, pecks your cheeks, all while you feel a burning sensation taking over your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe keeps doing this for a few minutes, when your breath is cut short, in which point you start struggling in between her paws and her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, the titaness soon pulls off, leaving your with a massive blush on your cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time today, you find yourself greedily filling your lungs with fresh air.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">That was some good start~</span>\" Mesprit cheers in a seductive manner. If the red shade on your cheeks could grow wider, it would be probably doing so now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink and blue giantess lets you regain your breath for a few minutes, before talking again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">So... Ready?</span>\" she asks, opening her mouth nice and wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart stops as you see where she intends to put you - a massive, slippery cave, full of pearly teeth; a red, slimy 'floor' already moving, looking eager to dart out at any moment to taste you. And, shortly distant from it, a dark abyss, a portal that leads to an assured, painful and slow death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what to do to avoid such fate. You open your mouth to scream, but no sound comes out. You already know that trying to slip out of her grasp is useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Mesprit moving the paw holding you near the cavernous mouth.<br>\r\n\"W-wait!!\" you shout out of fear, finally regaining the ability to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart resumes its beat as you see Mesprit closing her mouth, an inquisitive - and bothered - look on her pink face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">What now?</span>\" she asks, not hiding her annoyed tone.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Come on, I promise you won't be hurt. Just trust me.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can open up again, though, your brain hastily comes up with an idea.<br>\r\n\"Wait! I-I k-kinda wanted to hear the rest of your story!\" you try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two parting lips stop.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Come again?</span>\" Mesprit inquires.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I want to hear the rest of the story. You know, what happened after you and your sisters grew?\" you ask, feigning a curious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe psychic type smirks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">So you did like my emotion games!</span>\" she exclaims with a triumphant expression.<br>\r\n\"A little,\" you lie.<br>\r\n\"But I was REALLY interested in the story. Could you tell me the rest?\" you ask, expecting her to feel your hope. She's the one who created emotions after all, and she already proved herself able to sense them in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems to be working. Mesprit closes her eyes, seeming to be thinking about your request.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Want to know more, uh?</span>\" you nod in almost frenetic manner.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Do you want me to play with your emotions again?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n\u2018No!No!No!\u2019 your mind screams.<br>\r\n\"Uh, if you want?\" your mouth says instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess smiles. You hope that you managed to convince her to talk for a while. At least, until Uxie comes out and rescues you or Mesprit grows bored, whichever comes first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary talks again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Well...</span></span></div></div>",

And you are just like the others, trying to get relax from a stressing day. You reach the end of the path, a beautiful sunset dyes the sea red, a small breeze through your hair. Everything's perfect right now, nothing could ruin this moment. You breath in the fresh air and sigh, relaxed like you were never before \"Oh?!\" comes a surprised squeal from beneath you. Instantly, the ground begins to lift. You fight to keep your balance  as two huge flowers enter your view \"W-who is there?\" a female voice speaks, seeming scared \"It's me. I'm up here\" you reply \"U-up here? What are you doing on my back?\" the voice asks \"Y-your back?\" you ask, confused \"Yeah, you're on my back\". You look over the edge of the 'ground' and notice a large white object that seems a paw \"Wait, let me get down there so we can talk\" you say. Hopping down, you land softly on the flowers. Next to you stands a tall white surface, with a green back. Whatever it is, it was camouflaging \"Are you still there?\" the voice asks again. You walk around the surface and find yourself staring into two green eyes that are about the size of your head \"W-what?\" taking a few steps back, you notice that the thing you'd been staring at is an about 200 ft tall Shaymin \"H-hi?\" she says, embarrassed by the situation \"Uh hi\" you reply, as well embarrassed \"W-why were you on my back?\" she asks \"And why were you camouflaging in the flowers?\" you ask back. The Shaymin turns her head shyly \"I-I didn't want people to be scared of me\" she says \"What?\" \"Y-you see, people that would come here run away as soon they see me. So I decided to hide, so people wouldn't be scared\" she explains. This explanation calms you down as Shaymin goes on \"Do you think of me as a monster as well?\" she asks with a mix of shyness and sadness in her voice. You are saddened by this. Why do people believe, even if it's huge, that such an adorable and docile thing is bad? So you move closer to her and hesitantly put a hand on her white cheek and start rubbing it. Shaymin looks surprised at first, but she doesn't stop you \"Why aren't you afraid of me?\" she asks instead \"Because I don't see anything bad in you. You're not so scary after all\" you reply, smiling a little. The Shaymin seems slightly pleased by your words, showing you a shy smile \"Thanks... you know, I never got your name\" she says \"I'm Matt\" you say \"Thanks Matt. And nice to meet you\" she says, nuzzling you. You then notice that the sun settled down and was replaced by the moon, meaning that it's now evening \"Well\" you say \"I think it's time to go home. Well, it's been a pleasure to meet you. Maybe I'll come back someday\" you say, petting Shaymin's cheek on last time, before starting to walk away. But something, you notice, holds you in place. You turn around and notice Shaymin holding your shirt with her mouth. She releases you \"Wait, don't go please. I'm very lonely here and I want some company\" she says \"What do you mean?\" you ask \"I mean...\" she pauses to let a blush spread all over her face \"Would you like to... to be my trainer?\" she asks. You are taken aback by the question, but you then smile kindly \"Sure, why not?\" you reply. Hearing a big cheer that almost breaks your eardrums, your smile grows larger as you pick a pokeball \"I'm not sure if this'll work, but trying won't hurt\" you say, holding the ball out at her. Shaymin seems hesitant, but it's just a moment as she taps the ball with her nose. Luckily, it works, and she is engulfed in red light. She smiles down at you before getting pulled in the ball. It doesn't even shake, it just clicks in your hand as she wasn't struggling to get out. You stare at the pokeball with a smile, when Shaymin suddenly pops out \"Man, it's cramped in there. Can I stay out?\" she asks \"Sure\" you reply as she nuzzles you happily, a bit of a blush on her face. After a but she pulls off and speaks \"Matt...</span></div></div>",

You were sleeping so good on Shaymin's flowers, when the light gets in your eyes, waking you up. Annoyed, you move to a sitting position and stare down at the two flowers that had been your 'bed' for the night. Reclutantly, you get up. You really don't want to leave your comfy bed, but you'd have to sooner or later. You then notice that Shaymin is still asleep, judging by the soft snoring and the movements of her back. Smiling, you start to pet her grassy fur \"Come on Shaymin, wake up\" you say; Shaymin gives a small moan \"Aww, five more minutes\" she says \"And some more petting\". You chuckle as you keep scratching her fur until her white face pops out of the flowers \"Why good m-\" you attempt to say, but Shaymin pushes you off her back and on the ground. You don't have time to do anything that she pins your arms to the sides and starts nuzzling you happily \"S-shaymin, what does this mean?\" you ask \"Just happy you're no mere dream\" she giggles, completely covering your face with her gigantic nose. She holds you down for a few minutes before releasing you. You rub your sore arms  while Shaymin stares at you with a shy smile. You notice something different. In fact, her back is now full of Gracidea flowers \"What the...?\" \"That happens when I'm happy\" she explains, nuzzling you once again. The sweet scent of the flowers is now pretty strong, and it fills your nose, giving you a pleasing sensation and making you smile. Shaymin's smile just grows as she speaks again \"Matt, may I ask you something?\" \"Sure, what is it?\" \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

Now, could you help me find one?\" she asks \"Why'd you want to change your form?\" you ask \"You'll see\" Shaymin replies winking, a small blush on her cheeks \"Fine, can you tell me how does this flower look like?\" you ask \"That's easy. Do you see the flowers on my back? They're pretty similar\" she replies. Nodding, you knee and start start searching for the Gracidea flower. It's not easy, as this path is covered inch by inch by flowers, especially pink colored ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you spot a flower that is almost identical to Shaymin's ones \"Is this the Gracidea flower Shaymin?\" you ask, showing her the flower. Shaymin does not answer, she just touches the flower with her nose. Immediately, she starts to glow. You have to cover your eyes because of the bright light blinding you. When it dies down, you open your eyes, and the first thing you notice is that Shaymin is no longer there. Instead a majestic, tall, reindeer-like creature is standing there. It has two ling antlers on each side of its head and a red flower is behind its neck. A little bush of fur standing under its neck \"S-Shaymin?\" you ask. The creature looks at you \"Yes Matt, that's me! Am I prettier now?\" she asks, flashing you with a smile. You have to admit, she looks gorgeous. But you can't even respond that your now more-than-huge pokemon FLIES to you and pushes you to the ground and pins you to it with her nose, nuzzling you \"So? Do you like me more now cutie?\" she asks. You can't believe it. Your shy and calm pokemon has turned into a wild and much less shy pokemon. But you can't deny that she is as well adorable in this form, if nit more \"Yes, you're beautiful\" you admit. Giving a light giggle in response, Shaymin pecks your cheek. Ignoring the blush that has just appeared on your face, you smile \"But are you going to stay like this all the time?\" you ask \"Nah, I'll return normal once sun settles down.

Blushing even more, you insert your member inside her and start thrusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thrust into the white and green pokemon for a while. You are about to blow, you can't hold it in anymore \"Shaymin...\" <br>\r\n\"I'm about to come!\" she ends your sentence, spurts of white cum flying out of her and splashing you. Shortly after, you come as well, your own seed wetting Shaymin's fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both pant, trying to recover from the violent orgasms. Shaymin is the first to recover and stands up<br>\r\n \"That was wonderful! Thank you Matt!\" she beams, planting a quick kiss your cheek.

Out of the many berries that come out, there are a few berries that are shaped like a flat shaped heart. Its looks make it tempting to eat.

You don't hear it, and keep on sleeping soundly, not quite willing to leave the warm embrace of sleep. Nor your nice, soft bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, again, the voice talks:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Master, wake up!</span>\" it exclaims, tugging you a little further towards reality. But, still, you remain asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">You asked for it.</span>\" the voice mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, any resistance your barrier of sleep put up is destroyed as you feel a pair of lips pressing into your face. Startled, you open your eyes, finding two large, blue lips smooching your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they pull off, you clearly see the form of a very familiar-looking giantess who goes by the name of Manaphy, aka your newly caught pokemon.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">About time, master!</span>\" she exclaims, happily nuzzling you against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh nervously, trying to shake off your embarrassment.<br>\r\n\"Glad you weren't a dream, Manaphy,\" you say, extending arm to pet her slick cheek. The water type giantess smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What are we going to do now?\" you ask from inside your bubble. Manaphy once again enclosed you in one and, excitedly declaring that she had something to show you, she dove back into the sea, holding the bubble containing you solidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Trust me, master,</span>\" she says, giving you a wide-open-mouth smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">You'll love it. Just wait and see~</span>\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a brief nod, which is followed by a sigh. Then, you go silent, admiring the ocean around you. The sunlight shines from upwards, enlightening the crystalline seawater and the underwater, allowing you to see the scenario surrounding you; thousands of water types, from the small, weak Magikarp to the huge, threatening Gyarados (although none of these ocean inhabitants could ever match Manaphy in height). All of them just swim past your pokemon, ignoring her intimidating size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery once in awhile, you hear the giantess mumbling something incomprehensible from behind you. You do not question about it, though. You're so caught in admiring the underwater world in all its beauty that you barely hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust after a good amount of time, Manaphy finally speaks up:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Alright master, hold on,</span>\" warns. You wonder about the meaning of her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon you get your answer as Manaphy suddenly pops your bubble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you get your first inhale of water, Manaphy closes you in a hug and takes a huge leap upwards, directly out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gracefully lands on her feet, whatever surface she's standing on quakes lightly. She releases you from her hug and gently lets you down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when you're completely sure that you're out of danger, you dare to open your eyes, and look straight up to Manaphy.<br>\r\n\"... Don't do that again... please...\" you whisper. Did she realize you could have drowned?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue giantess just giggles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Sorry, cutie. But I assure it's worth the rough ride. Look!</span>\" she says, pointing forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, and realize why Manaphy is acting so excited as you notice where she brought you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cliff, from where you can see both the sea forward, and the majestic trees of a thick forest behind. Also, you notice, the sun has descended while you were inside the underwater cave that serves as Manaphy's lair; the sun rays craft a a golden shade over the sea, with the only effect of making the crystalline water shine brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother Nature in all her glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Amazing, isn't it?</span>\" Manaphy asks you, suddenly scooping you up while sitting down.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">This is the best time to come here. This place is just so quiet... <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">and secluded...</font></span>\" she mumbles mischievously, though you don't get the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an uncertain amount of time, none of you two talks. Manaphy just enjoys the quiet atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there, on the giantess' right paw, contemplating the sea while thinking. This sea princess saved you, let you catch her, offered you to live with her after your ship sunk. She even let you in her own home. And now, she's offering you the best view ever. Suddenly you realize that you didn't thank her all day long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manaphy?\" you timidly call out.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Mh?</span>\" <br>\r\n\"I just... I'd like...\" you try to find the right words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh.<br>\r\n\"Thank you... for everything...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Don't even say it. I mean, I finally got someone to keep me company. You don't need to thank me,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">But, could you pet my antennae again?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What about heart swap?\" you ask, recalling the little incident that occurred earlier, in which you suddenly found yourself in Manaphy's body and vice versa. She giggles, blushing slightly at the memory.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Hehehe, I'll try to keep that under control,</span>\" she replies, eagerly moving the rounded tip of one of her antennae over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing nothing bad with it, you start rubbing, immediately getting a moan from the water type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep going, until the tip you're rubbing suddenly glows pink, in which point you stop.<br>\r\n\"Uh, Manaphy, body-swapping problem incoming,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManaphy blushes a bit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">D-Don't worry, it's not that...</span>\" she stammers.<br>\r\n\"What is it then?\" you ask concerned about her well being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks elsewhere for a moment, before turning down to you, opening her mouth to reply...</span></div></div>",

Being a gynecologist before, you have dealt with the vagina and female anatomy of various species. However, Manaphy is something you are excited to do for it is a first time encounter you are about to do to her. With her being the only recognizable legendary pokemon that can be bred at daycare centers, more importantly, without society rules prohibiting pokephillia, you may as well have the free will to breed a legendary pokemon to your whim. \"In heat huh Lie on your bed. Make me a giant my girl. From what I know, your species are smaller than yours. But I want to be around the same size as you are right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you want it just as much as I would. Remove your clothes for now.\" After removing your clothes, with a bit of her psychic powers, you steadily grow to about the same size of the iconic Gumshoos Tower <i>(if you get the reference, then you'll also find out its height since it nearly matches Manaphy's 200 ft tall height)</i>. \"Hope you get to like my body master. May my heat satiate your inner sexual desires. Come breed me. Breed me for days master Matt. Feed me with cum.\" rubbing her watery face with your hands, you enjoy the wet and smooth texture before pecking her lips with your lips. She does the same thing to your face until your penis reaches its full throbbing erect form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any worry on holding back, you thrust your penis as deep and hard as you can inside manaphy's vagina and begin humping non-stop. Their moans become the only words both human and pokemon use to express their messages and emotions to one another. Whenever manaphy coos in a low pitch, she wants you to release your cum deep in her womb. Every time either one of you place their left hand or paw on their chest, both of you ask to momentarily rest your bodies. Finally, if either manaphy fondles her legs around your thighs, or you stretch her legs with your hands or legs, both of you resume your carnal sex to create and release more cum. At one point, Manaphy heart swaps both of your bodie to get an in-depth taste on what it is like to be the opposite gender. For you, it surprises your known knowledge as to how flexible and stretchy manaphy's watery body can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours has pass, you cum inside your giant manaphy for the 49th time shown by her truly bloated belly. \"Good girl. I am in love with you so much Manaphy. We will find out how many babies we can make.\" With a goofy smile etched on her face, both of you fall asleep with you being on the floor and your pokemon being on top and penis still buried inside her vagina and womb trying its best to spew all of the remaining cum it currently has inside the water type's womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs six hours pass where your size returns to normal, your body ends up sleeping on top of your pokemon's outer lips. Deep inside Manaphy's giant womb, a growing population of developing phione eggs paired with a few manaphy eggs start to fully develop yet stay in their original body size, weight, and height. Along the way, a new water temple is being created where the hundreds or thousands of pokemon you created are located.</span></div></div>",

You end up seeing a bundle of Phiones and Manaphy babies the size of a small house in provincial places such as houses found at Littleroot Town, Nuvema Town, and others alike. As one of the baby phiones encased in a bubble get close to you asleep, you get a good glimpse that it is a either a male or female phione as evident by the slightly protruding penis. From your lessons in gynecology, if the baby becomes male, the tiny penis grows in its full form. But if it is female, it sinks back deep into the body and forms the parts of a female vagina with the clit being a reminder of its biological. At it's current height, it looks like it is one of the children that is nearing maturity in terms of body growth for infants. Intrigued if these babies can do the same things your Manaphy does, you slip into the bubble ad plunge deep in the phione's vagina/penis hybrid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Manaphy's it looked natural pure vagina muscle. But upon a closer run, you find a glowing circle below. Curious as to where it leads, you step on it which teleport you to a place you may not expect. As you reappear, you now stand on what looks like a blue colored headquarters on top of what looks like the Baby Phione's brain. Now taking notice of your current surroundings, the portal is just behind you still working. Just a few steps away, you take a close look to find a chair containing two pedestals, a headset that seems to be wearable, two levers meant for your arms to use, and what looks like a phione model between the chair with an open hole depicting an eager vagina ready to be rutted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wow! This is something I never expected. Is this like something were one can possibly manipulate or play with? Interesting. Time to have fun my mate.\"</i> taking a seat on the controller chair, you set your legs on the pedestals, then carefully insert the helmet on your face, sit on a very cozy water bed-like chair, and set your arms on the levers. Playing a little bit with the controls, nothing is happening. You then notice the open vagina. \"Something tells me I just have to do it.\" setting your arms out to pull down your lower garments, you carefully pick up the phione model and insert it on your penis thoroughly and wrap its malleable arms like a belt.  The physical pleasure feels so tight and invitingly wonderful. Once you have all the controls in your touch, the eyes of the Phione you inhabit opens its eyes. You have total control of its body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Guiding one of the mature phones to her cervix, it inserts its head. However, its body gets stuck. Adding a push to the baby, the phione slips through and makes its crawl to the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Matt's case, all of the crawling and pushing inside his female Manaphy body keeps him screaming and crying in pain where he stops speaking out words. With one phione finally out of his mate's vagina, his steady breathing gets short lived as another baby gets through the cervix. It continues until a total of 5 babies come to the world breathing fresh sea cave air for the first time. \"Manaphy....please ... tell me that is .. the last one. Being ... mama ... hurts so bad.\" Matt pleads out for his mate to stop playing her body like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Manaphy decides to bring the mature male Manaphy she is piloting with her. Making one last push, she guides the baby towards her tight vagina. During the final trek, she sees her giant g-spot swelling pinkish red. Just to have her fun one more time, she pilots the baby manaphy to rub her g-spot in a circular motion. While Matt continues to shed his tears mixed with yelps of pleasure, Manaphy now gets to see her own body creating cum through one of her babies.

Maybe he just cannot handle that much pleasure and pain yet. Seeing that her body is still carrying plenty of immature babies still growing, Perhaps Matt will be alright paying as the baby. Deciding to switch their places back, she waits for Matt to wake up from his rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, she gets to play with the other baby phiones and the extra female manaphy. During her playtime, she gets to see that the manaphy baby she is piloting becomes a male. Now checking on her mate, she sees her mate getting up. Using this opportunity, she climbs onto her chest. Just before she gets to suck on her breast for her milk. \"Manaphy. I don't find what you did too fun. It hurts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting her master to go away from her, she tries her best to reason with him. \"Look, I am sorry about that. But Matt, didn't you get to enjoy the pleasure of bearing those babies? To me, childbearing is like sex on a bigger scale of pleasure. If you want, you get to play the baby next. Do you still trust me? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile seeing another Manaphy make baby doll eyes on his face makes it already hard for him to hate her, the fact that his actual body is inside the brain of this Manaphy only makes it more of a desire to be on his body again. \"Ohmy. Just please bring me back to my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Set your antennae on my paws. Then I will do my best for you to make you normal again.\" Slowly turning the antenna of his mate to their baby's paws, the energy that the baby gives also triggers his heart swap ability. With two hearts floating above their heads, both return to their respective bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Manaphy gets to see her baby through her actual eyes, Matt ends up seeing the big face of his mate through his eyes. However, he also intices that he is sitting on a chair with control tools similar to the one he found inside the phione he explored. He gets to discover that he has his penis buried inside the manaphy doll's vagina like fleshlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt. Just be careful if you unplug your penis from that doll. The baby you are controlling will return to normal and act on his own if you unplug your penis from it.\" just as he is about to say something, his helmet highlights a futuristic digital screen showing signs of the Manaphy he is controlling possibly getting hungry for milk. Yet Matt himself is not hungry. Then again, should he trust the sudden information data he is seeing right now? It is his first time piloting an actual pokemon from his brain. But playing as the child wouldn't hurt right now. The one thing you are sure is that your mate will willingly di whatever you ask for her to do. You just hope you won't have to deal with the other babies yet.</span></div></div>",

While Matt tries to make the baby move its stubby short legs through hopping and rotating the small joints on its lower body, the other baby manaphy and the three baby phiones have gathered around Mama Manaphy to cradle on her arms resting on her bloated giant belly. As they giggle and cry happily around her face, she sets two of the phiones on one breast each and begins suckling her breast to drink her milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there little ones. Enjoy my sweet milk dear babies. Mamaphy is here.\" while she enjoys the way her babies drink her milk, she gives a warm smile to everyone. Mamaphy feels the bumps, flips, and kicks being done by the other babies in her womb. With two phiones already ending their sweet drink quickly and passing out into slumber, she grabs the two remaining babies and let the manaphy suckle her left breast with the third phione feasting on her left breast. Seeing Matt getting the hang of playing with one of her babies, perhaps she can play with him with his tiny and huge size again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Matt's training with his baby, he gets to watch his children play with her body while still gazing at Mamaphy's chubby body. He may already love having sex with her vagina and womb, but now he wants to get a taste of her breast milk. A part of him wants to drink it by himself and momentarily part ways with this baby manaphy he is piloting. However, he realizes that all of his children are the size of a provincial house which can easily squeeze him too hard or play him like a toy for they are simply too naive. With another digital screen telling him that the baby wants some milk too, it motivates him to play with her game of him playing as the baby. Sloppily floundering and hopping on their waterbed, he hears his mate moaning from the amount of times her nipples getting sucked like a lollipop<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama. I want milk too. Please?\" splatting on their bed, the male baby manaphy he pilots starts crying on its own accord. <i>\"Looks like I can't control some things. But you know my baby know, you are going to be something special for me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow looking on his mate's giant vagina lips and bulging belly, he sees two giant flippers pick up this baby he pilots and sets them on her breast, \"Come here little Matt. Drink. This baby wants it very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother digital screen appears in front of Matt's helmet telling him that the helmet is changing its shape to accommodate a nutrient feeding feature to the pilot. \"Thank you ... mama. I want some milk.\" the helmet then begins to surround his head and a tube forms around his mouth. With a bit of controlling, he rests its body on her breast and places its wall sized mouth until the baby begins suckling on Mamaphy's left breast. As breastmilk flows down through the throat until it reaches the gullet, some of the milk gets through a tim=ny pipe that acts like a straw for Matt to sip the milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmhhhmmm. You taste like Oran Berries with a touch of purified water. So milky in a good way. I have not had warm milk for such a long time. So good my girl. So good.\" Matt slowly gets drowsy from enjoying the taste of her majestic breast milk. But at the same time, he sees and feels like he is the baby nibbling and sucking on her breast.</span></div></div>",

Hearing your little phione girl's deep breathing leaves him gazing at its adorable face. Yes, he enjoyed playing with their naive reproductive organs and brains like play things. Yet her voice when pushed to her infant body limits leaves him telling to himself that he is essentially a father of these many children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst thing that Matt notices would be the flipper paws that would normally be similar to their mothers. However, it is evident that he can see three bumps that would look like evolving fingers. Continuing his exploration of the phione held on his mat's arms, he carefully crawls as close to the girl's clit as possible. <span class=\"cteal\">\"You want to climb back in there Matt? You can always go back inside me and breed me. I am a brood mother sea fish after all.\"</span> already loving his mate's open nature to sex activities, Matt will make sure that he uses her naivety and kindness to his advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now Manaphy my mate. I am looking at our girl's appearance.\" continuing his tour of his bay girl's body, he usually knows that Phione do not have legs like Manaphy. However, he reached the girl's clit and carefully climb down on the phione's vagina until he reaches the bottom lips. Seeing the curvy tip of the smaller sea slug for balancing when swimming on water, there are 4 developing bumps of developing bone and muscle on both sides of its empty tail<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Fingers? Feet like fins? Does that make Phione be an evolution to a Manaphy instead?\"</i> after pondering for a while, he shouts out to his mate. \"Manaphy. Pick me up.\" like an obedient girl, he sees his mate's paw touching her daughter's vagina until she feels Matt on her paw and places him on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, Mamaphy. Can you share to me your story about yourself? Maybe you could even tell me as to how you are able to create offspring and the unique charateristic you have. I had been aught that pokmon of immense legendary status are not able to have succeeding children. Yet, here you are letting me breed you like a baby making machine. How come?

You try to shake off the thoughts about this day, just trying to forget it. The sunset is making a quite good job in helping you with it. Suddenly, as you walk, a sound catches your attention. It's somewhat soothing and sweet, it's so... hypnotic. It seems like a song. You follow the sound until you discover its source. Your jaw drops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting there, in a small valley, is the gigantic white face of a pokemon. This pokemon has a black dress, adorned with a green 'belt' around her waist, white and slim legs, fingerless, black and round hands. A greenish blue gem on her forehead and long, green hair. It must be around 200 ft tall. Totally female, you assume from both the looks and the voice of the pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she opens her eyes, that are baby blue colored, and starts crying. You snap out of your trance and look at her crying. Saddened by the sight, you make your descent into the valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon must be feeling you, because she suddenly looks in your direction and sees you.<br>\r\n\"W-who are you?\" she asks between sobs.<br>\r\n\"I'm Matt. Who are you? And why are you crying?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"My name is Meloetta. And I'm crying because I'm all alone here in this forest. Pokemon and humans avoid me because of my size, and I can't help but... but...\" she bursts back into tears without ending her sentence.<br>\r\n\"But you were singing so sweetly,\" you state.<br>\r\n\"That was a sad song, I'm sad,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling sad for this unlucky pokemon, you go sit next to her.<br>\r\n\"There. You see, I'm not afraid of your size. Stop crying now,\" you say, trying to comfort her. Meloetta sniffs a couple of times before speaking.<br>\r\n\"Why aren't you scared of me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Because you don't seem bad, you look like a nice pokemon,\" you say. Meloetta smiles a little and moves a hand to pick you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what she wants to do, you feel yourself being pressed into her chest, pulled in a tight hug.<br>\r\n\"Thank you Matt. You made me happy,\" she says. Smiling, you notice the sun settled, the moon taking place.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think it's time I go. I'll come back someday,\" you say, trying to free yourself from her hug. Unluckily, Meloetta has no intention of letting you go.<br>\r\n\"Wait! Don't go, please! Please don't leave me alone again!\" she says, determined to not stay alone anymore.<br>\r\n\"What can I do? I have to return home,\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Then, why don't you bring me along?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I mean, can you catch me, so I won't be alone anymore?\" she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think carefully to this, but finding no problem with it, you agree with her idea. Meloetta squeals joyfully as you hold out a pokeball. She frees you from her hug and carefully put you on the ground. Then, she taps the pokeball. It surprisingly works. She blows you a kiss before disappearing into the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou happily look at the pokeball in your hand, but it begins to shake as Meloetta pops out. Two gigantic arms slide under your armpits and bring you closer to her face.<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Meloetta squeals, giving you a big kiss on your face. She pulls off, leaving a blushing you. She closes you in another hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt?\" Meloetta asks after a while of hugging you non stop.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" <br>\r\n\"I think it's a bit late to go home now, do you agree?\" she says, a small smirk on her face.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n\"I mean, why don't we stay here for the night? We can go home tomorrow,\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" you say, wondering why she does want this. But you don't make any questions. Meloetta smiles and tightens her hug.<br>\r\n\"Are you hungry? Cause I am,\" she says.<br>\r\n\"What do you eat?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I eat no more than a normal pokemon, everything's fine,\" she tells, snatching a few berries from a nearby tree<br>\r\n She hands you some and takes the rest for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating the berries, you yawn, Meloetta yawning as well.<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to hit the hay. But I think it's gonna be a cold night. Wanna snuggle up for the night?\" Meloetta asks. Blushing, you nod, getting a smile out of her. <br>\r\n\"Very well then...</span></div></div>",

So you snuggle up to Meloetta and, within minutes, you drift off to sleep, sweetly cradled by her heartbeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are awakened by the sound of an early Pidgey chirping. You drowsily open your eyes and yawn, not wanting to leave your warm, soft and comfortable bed. But eventually you get up. You slide down Meloetta's skirt  and land softly on the ground. You notice the green haired giantess is still asleep, snoring softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you spot a small river. Rubbing your eyes, you walk over it and start splashing your face with water, the cold liquid completely waking you up. You make your way back to Meloetta. Shortly distant from her, you notice she's talking to herself.<br>\r\n\"How stupid can I be, thinking someone would get that near to a huge monster like me.\" she says, a tear escaping her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, not seeing you when she woke up, she must have thought you were a dream. Smirking, you reveal yourself.<br>\r\n\"Well, I would get that near to a beautiful girl like you.\" you say, getting her attention. Her blue eyes widen.<br>\r\n\"Matt?\" Meloetta asks as you get closer \"You're not a dream?\" <br>\r\n\"Last time I checked.\" you laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta suddenly grabs you and closes you in a bone crushing hug.<br>\r\n\"Master! You're real! I'm so happy!\" she shouts gleefully, while pecking your cheek. You faintly blush.<br>\r\n\"What was that for?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"You called me a beautiful girl, you deserved that.\" Meloetta giggles, making you blush more.<br>\r\n\"Le-let's go home, shall we?\" you say sheepishly.<br>\r\n\"Fine, where do you live cutie?\" Meloetta asks.<br>\r\n\"Just outside this forest, I can lead you th- Ahhhh!\" you scream as Meloetta flies up in the sky.<br>\r\n\"Did I mention I can fly?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta flies out of the forest, spotting the first houses of your town. You point to your home.<br>\r\n\"I live there.\" you say, getting a nod from Meloetta. She settles you down in front of the door. You get in.<br>\r\n\"Home sweet home.\" you mumble, heading to the kitchen. After a quick breakfast, you grab a fruit bowl and head out.<br>\r\n\"Hey Meloetta, I brought you some bre... Meloetta?\" you call out, noticing she disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, a crowd of people is standing outside your door.<br>\r\n\"That creature that was standing there... you knew it?\" a man asks.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was Meloetta, my pokemon. What happened to her?\" you ask worriedly.<br>\r\n\"Your pokemon? Why she was so big?\" someone asks.<br>\r\n\"No clue, what happened to her?\" you inquire once again.<br>\r\n\"We really don't know, she suddenly disappeared,\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meloetta? Are you there? Please come out,\" you say. To your surprise, Meloetta suddenly appears from nowhere.<br>\r\n\"I can also turn invisible,\" she says. Immediately, people start to panic, running in every direction, screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your useless tentatives to calm the people down, Meloetta decides to act for you. She starts singing, a sweet  melody making the crowd relaxed. She sings for a small bit, but it's enough to make the people almost drowsy.<br>\r\n\"How did you like that people?\" Meloetta asks blissfully.<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes.<br>\r\n\"Would you calm down please? Meloetta is completely harmless!\" you shout.<br>\r\n\"Right, I wish you no harm!\" your pokemon confirms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd seems to be reassured by your and her words and slowly leaves, not pulling their eyes away from both of you.<br>\r\n\"Matt?\" Meloetta asks.<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\". <br>\r\n\"What were you saying before all of this happened?\".<br>\r\n\"Right, I forgot, I got you some breakfast,\" you tell, showing her the bowl that was in your hands the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta gladly takes it and starts eating, just throwing fruit in her throat without chewing. You get in your home again and begin packing up thing, knowing that you'll have to leave since people would probably try something against you and Meloetta sooner or later. After packing, you exit the house, finding out thst Meloetta ate all the fruit in the bowl. <br>\r\n\"Thanks Matt, that was a good breakfast,\" she says, handing you the bowl. You throw it in a bag and start explaining the situation to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, we should leave. Here, let me help you,\" Meloetta says, picking you while lifting the bags with psychic.<br>\r\n\"But where we should go?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Well...</span></div></div>",

It doesn't seem too hard to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta makes a very good bed, you discover. Her skin is smooth and warm. Plus, you find comfort in the sounds coming from within the giantess; the soft gurgling of her stomach, the rhythmic beats of her heart and the silent breathing, which makes the ground beneath you rise up and fall down in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's almost like her body is trying to help you sleep, cradling you while singing a sweet lullaby, a song almost better than the one Meloetta was singing when you met her earlier today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in appreciation as your eyelids feel heavy. You close your eyes. And your consciousness slowly starts to fade as your mind sweetly slips up in the land of dreams...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up, your sleep bothered by something. Also, you discover a foreign weight upon your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes open up. The first thing you notice is that is still nighttime. Also, you discover two giant, black... things holding you down, pinning you against your bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your mind hazy because of the drowsiness, you barely remember meeting Meloetta earlier. She must have cuddled you to her in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's not what woke you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the reason of your awakening is a strange, sweet smell coming from somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inhale deeply, trying to figure out what this scent is. While you have little success is understanding what it is, you figure out that it is coming from down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious enough, you decide to investigate its source. You're awake anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you slip out of Meloetta's grasp, her paws falling down where you were shortly ago. You glance at her face, discovering that the sudden lack of you didn't wake her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, and inhale the scented air once more. Yep, it's indeed coming from down below...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start walking on the black land of Meloetta's body. It takes almost half an hour to move from her massive abdomen to her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, you walk past her green 'belt' and climb down, finally reaching the end of the black land after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the point where her skirt stops and where her slim, white legs poke out of it. The smell here is stronger, you find. You start feeling flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the skirt, you'll find yourself right upon Meloetta's crotch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUniversally, pokemon don't wear clothes, so that means that the giantess' sex is standing right beneath your feet, separated from your eyesight by her skirt. The smell seems to be coming from there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance backwards, at Meloetta. The green headed giantess is still sleeping. Can you risk exploring further, underneath her skirt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if she wakes up and finds you? Would she be mad at you...? Curiosity killed the cat after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake the thought off. Meloetta is too sweet for that... yet, you can't shake off the feeling that she could feel betrayed by you, the only living being that, according to what she said, ever got this close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you shake your head. She won't necessarily wake up, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour doubts dissipating, you start walking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and carefully, you manage to climb down her skirt, stopping on her exposed lap. And, like you deduced earlier, beneath the dark skirt of the giantess, stand the vertical lips of her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInhaling, you discover that you were right. The smell is emanated by the huge organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head perks up as you glance at Meloetta again, making sure she is completely asleep; she's, in fact, still sleeping, her eyes closed and her chest still moving along her soft snoring. This is your best chance to get a closer look...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you move a step on the white skin beneath the skirt. Then another. Your ears catch a muffled moan, coming undoubtedly from the giantess. This must be a sensible part of her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, you tiptoe forward, stopping whenever the giantess moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you come to a halt as you're standing right before the giant sex. The smell again assaults your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before you can think of anything, you feel the ground moving beneath you... apparently, Meloetta has a restless sleep... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow hard as you pray that she doesn't wake up...</span></div></div>",

It is a female, you notice from her dripping sex. She stares at you with a huge blush painted on her furry, cream colored face. After moments of staring at each other, she finally decided to speak up \"Uhhhh... Hi there\" she says \"H-Hi\" you mutter \"M-maybe I should go away\" \"Wait, don't go. I'm sorry, but nobody came to this island from ages, so I wasn't expecting anyone\" she explains. You nod in understanding \"Maybe we should introduce ourselves. I'm Victini!\" the victory pokemon says smiling, doing the victory sign \"Umm.. I'm Matt\" you say \"Nice go meet you Matt and welcome to Liberty Island\" she says \"Thanks I guess\". Victini gets near you: she towers above you \"Matt, tell me more about you\" she says \"There's really nothing to say\" you say, forgetting the previous embarrassment \"I'm a pokemon trainer and I travel around the world to find pokemon\" you say \"What about you?\" \"Well, as I told you before, I'm Victini. I'm a legendary pokemon, and I'm very lonely on this island. People left when I grew to this size, because they were scared of me\" Victini explains \"How did you grow up so much?\" you ask \"I really don't know. I just exploded this size one day, long time ago. Before that, tourists would always come here. I was happy back then. But when I suddenly grew, they all run away and told everyone that this island was cursed. And here we are\" she says, a tear pouring from her blue eye. You suddenly feel sad for this unlucky pokemon who is belived as a monster. So you sit down next to her \"I don't think you're cursed\" you say, attempting to comfort her. In response, she smiles warmly at you \"Thanks. You know, from some time I had a dream\" she says \"What dream?\" \"My dream is to have a trainer, so I could finally leave this island and see the world\" she says. This takes you by surprise, before you stand up \"That's not impossible. You could always find one\" you say \"Really? But who would have a huge monster like me as their pokemon?\" she asks tearing up. You smile at this \"Well\" you say picking a pokeball \"Me for example\". Victini stares at you silently, with a shocked expression. But it's just a second, before she taps the pokeball with a hand. Instantly, Victini is engulfed in red light \"Thank you\" she says, doing the victory sign, before disappearing inside the pokeball. It shakes three times in your hand before clicking. Victini is captured. You state at the pokeball happily, before it starts to shake and Victini comes out \"It's surely... new to stay in a pokeball, but it's cramped. Can I stay out of it?\" she asks \"Sure\" you say. Victini picks you in her hands and pulls you in a hug to her chest. Her fur is really warm, as she is a fire type \"Thanks again cutie\" she says nuzzling you. You blush returning the hug. Victini then lifts her head and looks at you \"Matt, what are we gonna do now you're my master?\" she asks. You think to this for a moment \"Well, I think we should....</span></div></div>",

Instead, Victini doesn't look upset at all. In fact she smiles brightly \"No problem Master! I guess we'll just have to snuggle up at night so I can keep you warm\" she says. You blush at the thought of you snuggling with her, but Victini simply giggles \"Well, now that we have fixed the sleep problem, I'm going to dispose of my bags. They contain my supplies. Mind if I put them in the lighthouse?\" you ask \"Not at all\" Victini replies, gesturing for you to enter. You smile grateful and enter in the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter disposing of your bags in a room, you reach Victini outside. She's waiting for you sitting on the sand. You go sit down next to her, but she looks at you weirdly \"What are you doing master?\" she asks \"Uhhh? Sitting on the sand?\" you say. Victini shakes her head \"The sand is cold. I'll provide you a warm seat\" she says picking you from the ground. She sits you on her lap and starts stroking your head with a finger. You feel slightly relaxed, warm and safe, between Victini's warm and soft fur cushioning you and her as well warm and gentle touch on your head. You almost feel like going to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Victini notices you sleeping and smiles gleefully. She lowers her head and kisses you on the head softly, careful to not wake you up \"Have a good rest master\" she says, a blush on her cream colored face \"Already love you\". With that, she starts petting your head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, you wake up and open your eyes. You never slept so good in your whole life. You find yourself still on Victini's lap and smile, glad that she was not a mere dream \"About time you wake up master\" her voice comes above you \"You look so cute when you sleep\". You blush at the compliment \" Thanks, but can you cut the master thing out? Just call me Matt\" you say \"As you wish Matt\" she says smiling.

Immediately, Victini bursts into laughter \"What kind of monster you have in there, master?\" she says laughing. At her size, this is enough for the ground to shake. After a few moments, she stops and looks at you \"How much time passed from your last meal, master? That was really loud\" she asks \"Again, cut the master thing out please\" you say \"Awwww, but is a cute nickname\" Victini pretends to whine. You roll your eyes \"About the food, I thing my last meal was a few days ago\" you say. Victini gasps \"Matt! You need your food! Eat something now!\" she says, somewhat angry. You laugh at this \"Yes mother\" you say, laughing heartily, while making your way to the tower \"Where are you going, master?\" Victini asks \"To get food?\" you ask, thinking it's obvious \"Wait here\" she says, extending a arm to one of the huge trees of the island. She pulls a berry from one and lowers it to the ground; to her it's a simple berry, to you it's a boulder  \"How come the berries here are so big?\" you ask \"Well, you see how the trees are so big, so the berries are as big, don't  ask me how\" she says \"Dig in, this will fill you up for days\".

Meanwhile, Victini helps herself with a few berries and bites into them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fifteen minutes, you manage to finish the berry, feeling full. So you sit down, your back against Victini's leg, a comforting warmth coming from it. Victini notices and smiles, moving a hand towards you, pulling you closer to her. Each of her fingers are as big as your upper body. After a bit, Victini looks at you \" Master, how about we...</span></div></div>",

You nod, walking towards the tower, but Victini's paw reaches for your leg, stopping you \"Where are you going cutie?\" she asks \"I'm going to sleep?\" you ask. Even though the darkness of the sky, you see Victini pouting \"You already forgot you have to sleep with me in order to keep you warm?\" she asks \"Right. But wouldn't that be a bit... weird? I mean, we just met\" you say. Victini releases your leg and shrugs \"Do as you want, but remember: if you feel cold, there's a warm bed waiting for you here\" she says. As to confirm her words, a gust of chilly air passes, sending shivers down your back. So you sigh and walk up to her \"May I sleep-\" you begin, but she interrupts you by picking you in her paw, before moving it towards her chest area. She drops you on her furry chest and wraps both of her arms around your body, leaving just your head uncovered. Your body, with the exception of your head, completely sinks in her warm, soft fur as Victini speaks \"Yes, you can\" she says giggling \"If you need anything, just wake me up\" she then says \"Same for you\" you reply \"You're so sweet\" she says, leaning her head to nuzzle you, making you blush \"Well then, good night master\" she says yawning, before closing her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, she is asleep, you notice from the constant rising and falling of your 'bed'. You try to collect the thoughts of the day: first, you came to this island, hoping to find a shelter from the winter. Then, you find Victini, a legendary pokemon that is supposed to bring victory to the trainer who owned her. Then, you capture her, fulfilling her wish. And now, you are laying on her asleep body, completely unable to move. You close your eyes, listening carefully to Victini's heartbeat. It's a soothing sound, it's almost like it's asking you to go to sleep. You feel very comfortable and warm for the second time today, you could get used to this. With this thought, you drift off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

You desperately try to get some more sleep, but it's useless, so you open your eyes. You really don't want to get up as you feel too warm and comfy, the warmth coming from the Victory Pokemon's fur protecting you from the winter's cold air. So you rest your head on the furry land, waiting for your pokemon to wake up. You don't have to wait long; in fact, after a few minutes, Victini starts to move in her sleep. She opens her blue eyes and starts to stir, apparently not immediately remembering about you. She moves in a sitting position, making you fall on her lap \"Whoa!\" you scream. This catches Victini's attention as she looks in your direction, spotting you. She stares at you confused for a second, before remembering everything \"Victini?\" you call out. The Victory pokemon decides to act obvious; it was fun to see her trainer confused \"Hi there\" she says, trying to hold her laughter \"Who are you, little one?\" she asks. You, unaware of her intentions, look at her confused \"I'm Matt! Your trainer!\" you say. Victini shooks her head \"Trainer? I didn't have a trainer last time I checked\" she says, faking confusion, as she picks you from her lap and puts you on the ground \"I'm Matt, don't you remember me?\" you say, trying to act calm \"Well, there is a way to find out if you are my trainer\" she says. She has you where she wanted \"And that would be?\" you ask \"Close your eyes\" Victini says. You do as told and close your eyes. Victini giggles silently, before pressing her lips on your whole face. You shut your eyes open, a huge blush on your face as Victini pulls off, laughing like crazy \"Yeah, you are my trainer\" she says, shedding a tear \"Why did you do that?\" you ask \"It's fun to see you confused\" she replies, still giggling, pulling you in a hug \"I'll get you for that\" you say \"Good luck with that cutie\" she says, tightening her hug. You take the opportunity and grin, before starting to struggle \"Vic... Victi... can't.... breath...\" you say, pretending to choke, before closing your eyes. Victini's eyes widen in horror as she drops you on the ground \"Matt!\" she yells \"Please wake up! Wake up! I didn't mean this! Horrible, Horrible me! I killed my trainer!\" she shouts, bursting into tears. She brings her paws over her eyes as she cries, while you grin and get up. Luckily, she doesn't notice you as you get bear her leg and start  petting it \"Why are you crying Victini?\" you ask like nothing happened. Victini instantly looks in your  direction; within a second, she grabs you and brings you up to her face. She then buries you in her cheek fur and nuzzles you \"Master! You're not dead!\" she says, with a huge smile on her face, as tears continue to pour down her cheeks. You have to admit, the sight of Victini crying shattered your heart \"More like I was pretending to be\" you say grinning \"WHAT!?\" she yells, anger in her eyes. She stares at you with a death glare \"YOU SCARED ME TO DEATH!\" she shouts, dropping you \"Whoa!\" you yell. Luckily, Victini catches you and puts you on the ground, before turning around and crossing her arms \"Come on, I'm sorry'\" you say. Victini...</span></div></div>",

Victini then closes your body in a hug \"Don't you dare do that again. You really scared me\" she says, speaking in soft tone, before smiling a little \"I won't. On one condition\" you say \"What condition?\" \"You mustn't call me master\" you say \"No promises master\" she says winking, starting to pet you with a finger. You smile, enjoying the relax of the moment, when you speak up again \"Does this mean I'm forgiven?\". Victini stops petting you \"Not yet\" she says \"Why? I've already apologized\" you say \"Yeah, but that was really mean of you. I know we know from just a day and all, but I already care deeply about you-\" \"Same here\" \"- So I think you owe me something\" she says \"What do you want?\" \"Well, it's been ages since someone scratched my ears. I really liked that. Do it and I'll forgive you\". You look up at her titanic V - shaped ears \" How do I get up there?\" you ask. Victini shrugs \"That's up to you cutie\" she replies. With a sigh, you start climbing her body. Thanks to her fur, you have something to grasp as you make your way towards her head. Victini waits patiently. You hardly get on her head, just to find yourself staring at her face. Her mouth is easily as long as your whole body \"Almost there master\" Victini says, snapping you back to reality. You nod and go to the back of her neck. You then start climbing. After a minute, you manage to get to your destination. You sit down, right in the middle of her ears, before you start rubbing them. As soon you touch them, Victini's whole body shakes, almost making you fall. No doubt Victini would catch you, but still, that would be scary \"Victini what was that?\" you ask \"Well, there was a reason I liked that so much. Those two are very sensible, so please be gentle\" she replies. You nod as you start rubbing her two red ears slowly, Victini sighing in pleasure. After a few minutes, a moan escapes her mouth. She quickly covers it, blushing like crazy. You grin \"So you like this uh? I'll just have to pay this spot special attention then\" you say. But as you start petting again, Victini's paw comes and snatches you from her head \"That's enough. Thank you\" she says \"Am I forgiven then?\" you ask \"More than forgiven, I owe you something\" she says, winking \"Really, you don't owe me nothing\" you reply \"I insist Matt, I haven't felt like this from a loooong time. I owe you \" \" No you don't\" \"But...\" \"Victini, really, you owe me nothing, so stop thinking about it\" you say. Victini sighs in defeat as you smile; the Victory pokemon defeated, nobody would believe that. This is your thought as Victini sets you on her lap \"I'll find a way to repay you in a way or another\" she says, petting you \"*Sigh* you're stubborn\" you say. Victini does the victory sign in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay silent for a while just enjoying the warm touch of your pokemon. Suddenly her voice breaks the silence \"Master?\" she calls out \"Don't call me like that. What is it anyway?\"</span></div></div>",

The Victory pokemon sighs; she knows she had to do this \"Do you remember when yesterday, when you came here, what I was doing?\" she asks, blushing heavier than before.

You get closer, trying to look inside it, but Victini suddenly sneezes. Shockwaves are sent through her body. You lose your balance and fall right into the cave you'd been staring at.

She smiles warmly at you and does her signature victory sign, before wrapping a paw around your upper body and snatching you from the ground. She doesn't speak, she just sits you on her lap, before starting to pet your head. You lower it and a blush appears on your face: you are staring straight at Victini's sex. You rise your head again, blushing like crazy. And, awkward to say, you strangely have a boner. Victini notices that your tenseness and turns you around. Seeing the growing bulge in your pants, she blushes as well, before setting you down at her vagina. She seems to have an idea, an idea that can solve both your and her desires. Using a hand, she opens the fleshy cave and then points to it. She seems to be inviting you to venture in her pussy. Blushing even more, you start walking towards the huge cave that is Victini's vagina and you prepare to step in it...</span></div></div>",

Just the sight of her vagina muscles twitching around you further hardens your boner with every step you take. You rub and explore her sweet caverns until you come across a lump of orange muscle bulging upright. Enticed by the sights, you take a climb on it thanks to the ridges acting as handles. Once you reach the top, the peach holds a concave lump where you take a slide until you actually land on the middle of Victini's G-spot. What you end up seeing is the sight of a victini in its actual size looking at you happily with her legs stretch wide open. Taking a seat in the middle of the G-spot cavern, one nod is all it all you needed to remove your lower garments, take hold of the little pok\u00e9mon, and ram her pussy on your dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust outside of her vagina, the macro victini uses her psychic powers to create a duplicate of you ramming her actual vagina in synch with your thrusting. Built out of lots of psychic energy, Victini lies down on the island moaning out as if a solid penis is actually fucking her slick hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are not aware on the activity that her actual body goes through as the victini surrogate eggs you to go harder and faster. Moments later, you came on the victini surrogate as you get to see her vagina muscles excrete big drops of girly cum. However, your cum only spills on the surrogate victini. Once the twitching muscles settle down, you continue your walk further until you reach the walls of her cervix stretched wide open. You end up seeing a bustling town filled with some buildings that Victini herself built with her psychic powers. Initially, you thought that all of them are purely molded out of her innards muscles. As you come across a restaurant filled with lots of caramel, red, and orange, Victini, taking a form of an inner copy of herself shows off your victory pose, \"Hello Matt! I know you have wanted to see my womb and the rest of my inner body. Welcome to the home I give to you: my entire body. Not only will this make you safe and warm, but it can always stick us together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the restaurant, two plates contain sliced fruit greet your's and victini's visit. Eating the decorated apples and watermelons, you ask her as to what makes this body of hers enable to be hospitable for someone like you. She shares, \"This capability was revealed by a distant friend in the past. A Jirachi taught me how I could give pleasure to myself by letting little beings reside at my inner body while letting them able to have sex with me wherever they may be. Sometimes, I can immerse myself and do things inside my body by creating flesh dummies. But Matt, you are the first one to see me both outside and inside. If you want to have sex with me, you're welcome to do it. If you want children, feel free to allow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank her nicely until you ask as to how that Jirachi knows Victini's potential. Victini tells that the female Jirachi she met demonstrated it to her by the civilizations of selected humans and pok\u00e9mon living inside the wish maker's body. Right now, you have some thoughts on trying to be able to keep her happy once you might be gone. A family just might not be bad to create with you to witness the process on how pok\u00e9mon make eggs after the sex. With her fallopian tubes open for you to injsert, you end up making an assumption for you to take action. Or it seems to be the actual thing once you see another victini saying, \"Hi daddy!\".<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Back at you, you wake up, with the biggest boner ever. That was the wettest dream you ever had. You open your eyes and find yourself completely surrounded by fur. You quickly get the idea of where you are, so you start petting the long strands of fur. To your surprise, a large orange object penetrates her fur and starts scratching your chest gently, before other two similar objects come in as well and wrap around your torso, before they pull, bringing you to the outside world. The objects, that reveal to be Victini's fingers, bring you close to her face. She smiles warmly at you \"Good afternoon master. Slept well?\" she asks sweetly \"What did you say? Afternoon? What time is it?\" \"It's 5 PM, you slept for eight hours. You look so cute when you sleep ~\"  she says, giggling. You blush at the compliment, when you remember your dream \"Victini?\" \"Yeah?\" \"May I ask you something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I was actually bored and I decided to look in your dreams. And seeing what you were dreaming about, I decided to enter your dream\" she explains once you tell her your dream \"So you We're actually telling me those things? You were suggesting me about kids?\". She simply nods, before blushing \" Yeah. Y- you know, if you don't want to, we won't do that \" she says. You think about the possibility of impregnate her and have kids, but are you really ready for that. Maybe not, you're still young \"Victini, I would be honored to have your children, but I don't think I'm ready to be a father\" you say. Victini's expression drops a bit, but she nods in understanding \"I understand\" she says \"I really don't feel ready to become a mother either\" she admits \"I suggest that we at least wait to end our journey, obviously after we start it, for that\" you say. Victini looks at you with a huge smile \"Are you saying that..?\" she asks hopeful. You nod as she snatches you in her paws and hugs you to her chest as tight as possible. After a few minutes she releases you \"Victini, you said that a Jirachi taught you how to make things inside your body right?\" you ask. Victini nods \"Yeah, a close friend of mine. She's 300 ft tall\" she replies \"Wait! So you aren't the only macro pokemon?\" you ask. Victini laughs at you question \"Are you kidding? There are at least... I can't even count them! They're almost all normal pokemon\" \"Almost?\" \"Yeah, to know, the only macro legendaries are Me, Jirachi and Celia\" she replies \"Celia?\" you ask \"Yes, she's a 200 ft anthro Celebi, another friend of mine. Before you came here, they would occasionally visit me. But I heard they recently got trainers and, like me, they fell deeply in love and had sex with them\" she says, winking at you. You blush at her last sentence as she giggles \"Wow, they sound awesome to be around. How did they got captured?\" \"Well, Celia was beaten in a challenge, while Jirachi's trainer wished for her to be his pokemon\" Victini replies \"And last, you got me. Hey! I got an idea! Would you like to see them?\" she asks, excitement in her eyes \"Really?\" you ask \"Yeah, I can bring you to them\" \"That would be great\" you says \"It is decided then! Just, who can we visit first?\" </span></div></div>",

However,  meeting Jirachi is fine with me, I think I know where they are\" Victini says, snatching you in her paw and putting you in between her ears \"Better for you to not move too much master, you might fall\" she warns you. Getting a nod, Victini flaps her wings like tails and floates up in the air. Looking at the island one last time, you turn your head as Victini flies away. You cross your legs in a meditative position and close your eyes, thinking. You think about when to start your quest to the pokemon league. Sure, at least after winter ends. For starters, you two will have to leave Liberty Island in order to start your journey, and you will have to beat all the gym leaders in battle. After that, you will have to register yourself to the pokemon league and take on the elite four. Even after that, you will have to defeat the champion, who is said to have the strongest pokemon ever. You smile, even though this, Victini would win. Not only for her size, but the fact that she is said to bring victory to the trainer who is her owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of quiet meditating, you are snapped back to reality by Victini \"Master?\" she calls out \"Mh?\" \"We're here. We just have to find Jirachi now\" \"Okay then. Any idea of where she could be?\" you ask. In all response, Victini points to a yellow object that peeks from a hill. It seems a giant star tip. You look at Victini, who nods. She silently flies to the hill and gives a look at the other side. As she expected, Jirachi is here, sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a 300 ft tall Jirachi, like Victini said. she is sleeping her two tails wrapped around her whole body, like a blanket. But something catches your attention. You spot, under her neck, a human figure. Looking better, you see that's actually a human! It must be her trainer \"Aww, aren't they cute master?\" Victini giggles, getting closer to her friend. She gestures for you to not talk as she gets closer to her white face \"Jirachi...\" she whispers. The wish maker gives a small moan in her sleep as Victini smirks \"HEY GIRL WAKE UP!!\" she shouts. Jirachi's eyes shut open, her tails instantly unwrapping form her body. The human also opens his eyes, looking scared. Victini bursts into laughter, sending shockwaves through her body. You have to fight to keep your balance as the wish maker speaks angrily \"Victini, why in the world did you do that!?\" she asks, standing up. The human, still plucked in her chest, falls down, letting out a scream. Instantly, he is lifted upwards by a psychic attack. He is lifted on her waiting hands \"You poor thing, did this big meanie scare you\" Jirachi asks sweetly. Yeah, Victini told you that she loves her trainer. The steel type pokemon turns her attention to Victini again \"As I was saying, why in the wo... Wait\" she says, looking at you \"Who's this?\". Victini stops laughing and shed a tear \" Oh my Arceus, I didn't laugh like that from ages. Anyway, Jirachi meet Matt, my trainer\" the Victory pokemon replies. Jirachi's eyes widen \"So you also have a trainer now? Great!\" she says, a smile on her face \"Hi there, my name's Jirachi, glad to meet you. What's your name?\" \"My name's Matt\" your reply. You then notice her trainer looking at you. You look back at him \"Victini, can you put me down, please?\" you ask \"Yeah, Jirachi can you put me down as well?\" he says. Both pokemon nod as they gently out you two on the ground. You walk towards him \"My name's Matt, nice to meet you\" you say, extending your hand \"Arlos, my pleasure\" he replies, shaking your hand. Arlos? Weird name, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you two talk, Jirachi and Victini talk to each other \"Tell me, how did you meet him?\" Jirachi asks \"Long story short. He can to Liberty Island a while ago and I told him my story and how much I wanted a trainer. So he caught me\" Victini explains. Jirachi nods \"Is he a nice guy?\" \"Yeah, the nicest\" \"I don't think that's right\" Jirachi states \"Wha- why?\" Victini asks \"Because Arlos is the nicest\" \"Matt!\" Victini says \"Arlos!\" \"Matt!\" \"Arlos!\" \"Matt!\". This goes on until both of them burst into laughing \" Just like old times \" Jirachi giggles \"Hey, speaking of old times, now that we have trainers, why don't we...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rain hit your already soaked body as you ran into the depths of the forest in search of a shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all had begun with a pleasant stroll when it suddenly started raining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were soaked to the bone when you finally managed to spot a small cave, partially hidden by the thick vegetation but still noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't think twice as you sprinted inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced around the cavern. From the inside, it looked quite big, and it was apparently deserted, so you could freely sit down and wait for the rain to stop before getting out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted from the strenuous run, you sat down on the hard, stone floor of the cave, leaning back against a wall. You inhaled deeply and exhaled heavily as you tried to regain your breath, small drops of water falling from your soaked air and clothes and splashing onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the rain started raging, a strong wind starting to shake the trees of the forest violently. You gulped, glad that you found a shelter just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you managed to regain some air in your lungs, you finally raised your head, slowly shaking it to rid it from the water. A thunder roared outside, but you paid it no mind. A thunder didn't scare you, the thought that you might be trapped in here for hours to an end did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo take your mind off things, you started looking around the cave. There was nothing interesting aside from a weirdly shaped rock in a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were completely alone in a forest, in the middle of a thunderstorm and trapped in a deserted cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a great day, you sarcastically thought as you grabbed your head in your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, you heard something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around... you were sure you had heard a noise somewhere inside the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Hello?\" you called, your voice echoing around inside the cavern that served you as a shelter from the raging rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head - was your mind pulling pranks on you too now? - and tried to relax, cursing yourself for leaving your phone at home. Now, there was no way you could call for help if you needed to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around again, this time sure you heard a noise. But... there was no one aside from you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou narrowed your eyes - why did that corner seem darker than the rest of the cave? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, you got up and approached the darker side of the cavern. A low sound started assaulting your ears... it barely audible, and yet you could hear it even though the rain outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a ghostly whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a step back, rubbing your eyes. You were sure you saw a pair of red eyes staring straight at you from the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was only your brain, no?... Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath as you attempted to calm yourself, before finally removing your hand from your eyes and looking forward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skipped a beat - they were still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of big, red eyes staring straight at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...?\" you muttered startled as a figure started to emerge from the shadows, apparently having noticed that you noticed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat looked like a pokemon came out... but it couldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was enormous - at least 200 ft tall, tall enough for the tip of its head to touch the stone ceiling without issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the pokemon itself, you've never seen it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had relatively short arms and legs and an oddly shaped head. It was completely dark grey, with fiery red eyes that stared straight at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a few steps back - this... thing had been with you inside the cave for the whole time? Or was it there before you even came inside?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter, it sure frightened you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon kept staring at you for a while more, before closing its eyes and starting to giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low, ghostly giggle assaulted your ears as you took a few more steps back, trying to figure out whether this giant was harmless or dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, you noted, you could hear a slight, feminine tone in that giggle, making you assume that this giant is actually a giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the pokemon looked back at you, a small smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrey\">Hi...</span>\" she spoke in a low, spectral voice. If she really was a pokemon, she undoubtedly was a ghost-type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to hear nothing more.</span></div></div>",

You're friends had said they had finally found the vanishing valley of fire and they challenged you to go enter it. As you walked into the valley you knew this was a bad idea as you were more of a tech type, inclined to sit at a computer and create the leading competitor for the master ball then physical activity. It wasn't that you were fat or anything, heck you were mostly avergae in every aspect save for intelligence but you still had you're preferences that and you still didn't have a pokemon. It was kind of you're own fault as you always tried to catch female pokemon, even then you still pressed on but eventually you did give up on getting a pokemon. It's pretty disheartening when a beautiful pikachu anthro calls you a nerd right to you're face. As you descended further into the valley, trees gave way to flat land and in the distance you saw more trees. All around were fire pokemon; charizards, margmar, typhlosions to name a few and at least half of them or more had to be anthro. You think about what you're friends had told you about the valley; tons of fire pokemon? check, anthros galore? check. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing they told you, you couldn't really bring yourself to believe. As you walked through the second grove of trees you mulled it over in you're head. Apparently there was supposed to be a gigantic female blaziken that lived in the valley. Apparently if you were able to meet it, the blaziken would ask you 2 questions, who you were, and if you wanted her to be you're pokemon. Now the next bit was why you didn't believe the story, apparently every person who had met the blaziken were so afraid of it due to sheer size that they were just able to stammer out the answer to the first question and were usually running away at full tilt by the time she said the second one. The only reason anyone knew there was apparently a second question was that she had apparently yelled it at one guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish I could meet her\" you think to yourself still walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you\" a female voice asks, to you it was the most beautiful voice you ever heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Matt\" you reply, you stop in a clearing and look up and there's nothing. \"Great i'm so desperate i'm hearing things and talking back\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be my trainer?\" the same voice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're that giant blaziken then sure why not, it's not like I have a pokemon anyways\" you yell back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I finally have a trainer\" you hear the same voice yell. You turn around and jump back as you realize that now the voice was coming from behind you. You run back towards the open part of the valley, you make it out onto the flat land and look behind you still running. You run into a wall of yellow, thing is it was a wall of yellow feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're just as happy to meet me as I am to meet you\" the voice says. You look up, and up, and up standing above you is a.....</span></div></div>",

You step back a bit as 2 fingers easily big enough to squish you descend and grab onto the back you're shirt. You're hoisted up into the air and as you rise you're able to get a very good view of the pokemon in front of you. She had a very slim body but you could see muscle underneath all the feathers saying she took very good care of herself. Her legs seemed to go on forever you weren't sure if that was just because she had long legs or because she was so big. You're quickly raised up to chest level and you try to cover you're eyes but you couldn't help yourself. Her chest was a c-cup going on d. She brings you up to her face and smiles, you could see happiness in her eyes as she stared at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" you say raising a hand waving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, i'm Tiffany. but you can call me Tiff, i'm so glad you said I could be you're pokemon\" she says really quickly. You reach over and pinch you're arm \"oww\" you say, \"ok i'm not dreaming\" you think. Tiffany carefully puts you down into her palm and just smiles down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Tiffany how long have you been here?\" you ask standing up and dusting you're jeans off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Around 18 years, why are people so mean? I was gonna give up looking for a trainer if you said no\" Tiffany says looking glum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that feeling\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, i've been trying to get a female pokemon of my own for my entire 18 years of life, thing is unlike you I did give up after a really good-looking pikachu I liked called me a nerd straight to my face\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a nerd, you're cute\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" you say. Tiffany sits down and carefully drops you into her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think of me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great, can't say i've seen a better looking blaziken\" you reply sincerely. Her feathers felt really comfy so you start to sub-conciously lay back but when you're head hits the feathers you quickly sit up. \"Sorry\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we just met each other, so you're probably not really comfortable with me getting that close to you\" you say. You see a smile cross her face and she picks you up with 2 fingers and lifts you up to her face. \"So you think i'm not okay with my trainer being close to me?\" she asks smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not this ear...\" you're cut off as she pushes you into her cleavage and snuggles you inside so you're held in place. She holds you like that for a few seconds before plucking you out and lifting you back up. \"I'm glad my trainer's someone so nice as to worry about me right when we've met, but i'm you're pokemon, so of course I have to be close to you. I'm here to protect you, fight for you and....care for you\" she says the last bit full on blushing although you couldn't tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...you're a very loyal girl Tiffany\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I try\" she says cuddling you against a feathery cheek. \"So Matt why'd you come here, was it for little ol me?\" Tiffany asks giggling a bit at her joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was actually dared to come here by some friends, meeting you was just a very pleasent suprise\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my cute little trainer what do you want to do now?\" Tiffany asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea\" you say laying back in her palm. \"Is there anything you like doing?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually i've had this itch on back for the longest time I just can't reach\" Tiffany says before she puts you down, she lays down on the grass, turns over and places you down on her back. You walk around while she gives instructions like higher, lower, left, right, finally you reach the spot she was talking about. You bend down and start scratching between the feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, that feels great, that's the exact spot\" Tiffany says sighing. You scratch the spot for a good 30 seconds before you jump off Tiffany's back and land on the ground. You walk up to her face \"one itch scratched\" you say sarcastically bowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany stares down at you for a bit \"hey Matt why aren't you afraid of me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know why i'm not scared\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm really glad you're not\" Tiffany says. \"Hey Matt could you close you're eyes for a second?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to give you something\" Tiffany says. You close you're eyes and within seconds you feel her beak/mouth press against you. You're slowly pushed backwarrds until you fall onto the ground and she moves forward gently pressing you down into the grass continuing the kiss. After being knocked over you gain the sense to kiss her back and you do, right on the tip of her beak. You both hold the kiss for a minute before you feel like you're running out of breath and you tap her beak. Tiffany raises her head and you can actually see her eyes sparkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've made me the happiest blaziken ever\" Tiffany says gently hugging you into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you ask trying to squirm out but she holds you firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now I know for sure you're my trainer, since that was my first kiss\" she says trying to hide her face very unsuccessfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was my first time too\" you reply. Tiffany sits down and stares at you for a bit \"Matt why don't you tell me a bit about yourself?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I like girls, you're my first pokemon, i'm 18, always loved the color red and that's about it?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I like guys, you're my first trainer, and I just think you're so cute\" Tiffany replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So matt do you have a favourite kind of pokemon?\" Tiffany asks raising you up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm well i've always kind of liked swampert\" you say. You see a frown form on Tiffany's face, \"i'm kidding i've never had a favorite pokemon before but it's definitley going to be blaziken from now on\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh you're so mean\" Tiffany says pinning you under one finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey let me get up Tiff\" you say pushing her finger but unable to move it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not until you apologize for saying i'm not you're favourite\" Tiffany says sounding actually hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Tiffany, you're easily my favourite pokemon\" you say smiling. Tiffany lifts her finger off you and cuddles you against her cheek. You hug her cheek \"geez you're an affectionate blaziken\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you like affection\" Tiffany says smiling. She lowers her hand and drops you into her chest, you're held in place between them and she gently strokes you're head with 1 finger. \"So do I need to be more affectionate?\" Tiffany asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that an order?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is\" you say. Tiffany gently squeezes her chest together till you're totally surrounded by her down covered assets and much to you're suprise she starts singing. It was a very beautiful song, calming and soothing at the same time. You're just able to keep yourself awake through the whole thing but once she finishes you snuggles yourself into Tiffany's down and fall asleep. You wake up slowly, more comfortable then you've been in you're whole life and you look up to see stars and the moon.. You look down at you're watch and it says it's 11:00pm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you're finally up sleepyhead\" Tiffany says, you turn and smile up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best sleep i've ever had, that's a really comfy place to sleep\" you say stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'll just have to take that into consideration when we go to sleep\" Tiffany says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually I need to know if you want to back to you're old life with me included of course, or stay in the valley\" Tiffany says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's called the vanishing valley for a reason, every night at midnight the valley moves to a new location\" Tiffany says.</span></div></div>",

She picks you up and gets up before walking towards the edge of the valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tiff, how do you know where you're going?' you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have night vision\" she replies dodging a clump of trees, it took you a minute to exit the valley and you turned and you noticed it shimmer before it disappeared. You tapped on you're watch and you realized it had stopped working, \"good thing we got out when we did\" you say. Tifanny snuggles you into her chest, \"which way now?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just head straight until I say stop then turn to the right and head straight for a few more minutes\" you say. Luckily you knew the countryside very well, Tiffany kept walking until you heard a sploosh sound \"stop\" you yell and she turns stepping out of the stream before moving again. \"Sorry, I didn't tell you, I use that stream as a landmark\" you say but Tiffany just shakes her foot dry \"no problem\" she says. You walk for 4-5 minutes \"stop, Tiffany can you put me down\" you say. She does and you run forward right into you're front door \"son of a bitch\" you say and you heard Tiffany giggle. You open the door and run around the house turning lights on, soon you're house was a small beacon, Tiffany walks around to the back and you meet her at the back door carrying a plate stacked with every fruit and vegetable you could find in the house. She bends down and opens her beak and you dump the plate in and she shuts it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmmm, thank you\" she mumbles while chewing or whatever birds do. She lays over and groans, \"Tiffany are you ok?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stuffed, you do know I eat like a normal blaziken right, it's not like there were any giant fruits in the valley\" she says groaning again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry I just thought you required a lot of food\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I did I would have been chased out of the valley long ago\" Tiffany says. You walk up to her and climb onto her belly, you lay down and start rubbing \"does that feel better?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh that feels heavenly, keep going\" she sighs. You rub her belly for a good 20 minutes until you collapse panting, \"Tiff can I stop?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, thanks\" Tiffany says. You lay down between her feathery assets and snuggle up \"you don't mind if I sleep here do you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, in fact I want you to\" Tiffany says lowering a hand over you, she moves you so you're as comfy as possible for her as well as yourself and you quickly fall asleep. You wake up early the next morning to the sound of voices, it was you're friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man I hope he got out of the valley ok, we forgot to tell him it disappears at midnight\" you're first friend says. You run through the house and meet em at the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" they reply nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so lucky I decided to leave that valley when I did, it disappeared right behind me, you wouldn't happen to know why that is?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um well we kind of forgot to tell you about the disappearing part\" they reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all's forgiven, becuase I got a pokemon\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cool, where is it?\" they ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out back, come on\" you say running ahead. You enter the backyard of you're house and you see Tiffany had rolled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dude we don't see anything just that weird big red and yellow thing what'd you catch a 50ft magmar?\" they ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better\" you say walking up to Tiffany's back. \"Tiffany, come on Tiffany wake up, I have some people I want you to meet\" you say. You quickly move back as Tiffany turns over and stretches, \"guys I want you to meet the legendary blaziken Tiffany\" you smile as their all staring at you open-mouthed. You turn to see Tiffany opening her eyes and she smiles as she sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning' she says hugging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning\" you reply, she turns and notices you're friends. \"Who are they?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friends, the ones who dared me to enter the valley\" you say. She turns to stare at them and they cringe \"hi\" they say shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop being such chickens\" you say laughing at the joke, \"she's harmless, and very friendly\" you say smiling at her. Joe the bravest one of you're friends walks forward but he's snatched up in her palm \"mmm what a tasty looking morsel you are\" she says opening her mouth and Joe starts screaming and you're other friends try to run away but she gets up and jumps in front of them blocking their path \"you all look very tasty\" she says a grin on her beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Call-call her off man, we're sorry about the dare and almost getting you stuck in the valley\" they say shuddering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany stop it, they're scared enough\" you say walking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" she says putting Joe down \"Nyah that's what you get for tricking my trainer\" she says sticking her tongue out at them. You're friends split after that coming up with various excuses like \"my stove is on\" and \"I need to brush my growlithe\". You walk inside and rummage around the fridge taking out all the non-expiring food, get all the money out of the small safe you have and pack all the food and water you can carry into a knapsack. You even grab the large bag of pokefood you kept in the back just in case and you're just able to fit that in the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Tiffany asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they're probably going to tell the town about you, and considering you scared them so bad, they'll probably portray you as a monster, so we're leaving\" you reply zipping up the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to take on the pokemon league\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pokemon league?\" she asks confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a set of challenging battles in gyms, that eventually lead to the pokemon league where you have to fight the 4 toughest trainers in the area as well as the champion in quick succession, but I think we'll be fine\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, as long as I get to be near you\" Tiffany replies. She picks you up and smiles \"i'm sorry Matt, I just caused you trouble\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, it was worth it to see the look on their faces, you wouldn't have really hurt them would you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, i'm strictly vegetarian\" Tiffany replies.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You guided Tiffany down the small dirt road, \"where are we going?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New light city, the gym leader there uses grass types, though he'd be a good first match up\" you say. Tiffany walked for hours, singing, whistling or humming, you had to stop a few times as you'd join in and you both would soon be laughing so hard she almost dropped you. You reached New light city by mid afternoon, Tiffany being way faster then a bike or even some cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you put me down?\" you ask and she does. \"I'm sorry Tiffany but I think people would be freaked if they saw you, so can you wait in the woods while I go get the gym leader\" you ask. Tiffany reluctantly nods and runs off into the forest, you head for the town, it was a small town, so it wasn't like it was hard to find the gym. You saw a young man standing in front admiring the building, you walk up to him. \"You also hear to take on the gym leader?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I am the gym leader, name's Joe Seedroot\" he says turning to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Joe, i'm Matt and i'm here to challenge you're gym\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure 3 on 3 good with you\" Joe asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..1 on 3\" you say, \"I only have one pokemon\" you say. Joe looks at you \"where's you're pokeballs\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my pokemon doesn't travel in a ball, in fact we have to go into the forest to have the battle for space purposes\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe looks at you shocked, \"what'd you do catch a legendary\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that\" you reply Joe follows you outside of the town limits and you head through the forest till you reach a large clearing, you look around unable to see any sign of Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where's you're pokemon?\" Joe asks. You look around nervously, \"hope this works\" you think and you give off a high pitched whistle. You heard the sound of trees falling and you turn to see Tiffany racing through the woods towards you before stopping right behind you, you turned back to Joe who was standing there frozen. \"Joe meet my pokemon Tiffany, you can just ya know give me the money and badge right now if you'd like\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe shakes himself out of the reverie he was in \"screw that let's do this, go bellosom\" he yells throwing a pokeball. Out pops a belossom anthro who stares up at Tiffany and looks likes she's going to piss herself, you can't help but laugh and the bellossom stares at you angrily and seems ready to fight. Tiffany steps over you and stares down the bellossom who backs up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to begin?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\" Joe replies, \"bellossom use solar beam\" he yells and you see the bellossom glow for a second before firing off a beam from it's head. This suprised you as you remember solar beam taking a while to charge. It hits Tiffany square in the chest and actually pushes her back a bit and leaving some singed feathers. Tiffany stares down angrily at the belossom and pulls her head back and you see flame lick at the edge of her beak. \"Stop\" you yell and Tiffany keeps her head up and the flame dies down, she looks down quizzivally at you. \"Tiffany if you use an attack like that you might kill the other pokemon, that and you'll set the whole forest on fire. Joe seems to wait for you as you did kind of just save his pokemon. \"So what should I do then?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know pin it, if it can't get up and use an attack then it can't win right?\" you say. Tiffany lowers herself and pins the belossom under one finger, it struggles for a bit but can't get back up. \"Bellossom use\" \"I wouldn't do that if I were you\" you say. Joe looks at you confused, \"look Tiffany has the potential to kill you're pokemon, you hear me, kill you're pokemon not knock it out, wipe it from this earth, so please don't make her injure it and just concede this round\" you say. Joe stares at you and the bellossom looks up at Joe sadly, \"fine, you win\" he says, \"bellossom return\" he says calling her back. The rest of the battle follows this fashion, Tiffany quickly pins a bellsprout girl with another finger and then pins a regular venasuar with her palm. Joe sighs once he calls back his venasuar, \"that's some pokemon you got there\" he says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany smiles down at you, \"did we win?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, great job Tiffany\" you say. Tiffany lifts you up in her palm and taps her beak, \"come on, since I won\" she says happily. You lean over and kiss her beak and she smiles before putting you down. You walk up to Joe who hands you $2000 and a light badge which like the name suggests look like an 8 sided star of light. You smile and he sighs, \"never in my career as a gym leader have I been beaten so badly\" he says laughing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not like you really had much of a chance\" you say patting Tiffany's leg. Joe looks at you, \"wish I had a chance for a rematch, once I got stronger\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey maybe I can come back once i've beaten the rest of the gym leaders, it won't take that long if all the matches are like this\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Matt I want to travel with you and Tiffany, it would be pretty fun, besides I think my bellossom still has something to say to you\" Joe says and you actually did notice the belossom's pokeball was continually shaking. Joe holds the ball out and her bellossom comes out, it walks straight up to you and looks at you eye to eye, you try to move back but you were stuck against Tiffany's leg. It smiles at you and runs a finger down you're chest, \"hey Joe what's up with you're pokemon\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww she likes you, isn't that nice\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for her\" you reply as the bellossom snuggles up against you laying her head on you're chest, \"so call her back already\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, this is too much fun\" Joe replies. You were pulled back and Tiffany stared at the bellossom and stuck her tongue out at her before snuggling you up against her cheek. \"Matt i'm the only pokemon for you right?\" Tiffany asks looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wouldn't mind having a few more pokemon just in case you are ever defeated\" you say. Tiffany stares at you slightly angry, \"so maybe you should go with that belossom\" she says dropping you on the ground although she did lower her hand so you weren't hurt and she turns around in a huff. You stare up at Tiffany shocked and Joe's bellossom runs up and hugs you, looking you over for any bruises or scratches, you stand up but she just pushes you over. You look over and Joe was literally on the ground rolling from side to side laughing. The bellossom moves forward over you're body and you're body won't respond, you've fantasized for this kind of thing to happen so many times and now it was. The belossom smiles at you and giggled a bit before lowering down to kiss her and she was yanked up. You saw Tiffany stare at her angrily, and even though she was a bird, she was growling at the belossom. Joe stands up, and holds up a pokeball and belossom is recalled. Joe smiles at you and throws you the pokeball, \"here, she seems to like you better then me, besides i've got another one\" Joe says pulling another pokeball out of a backpack. You tentativley strap the pokeball to you're belt and say \"welcome to the team Trixie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany glares at you, \"you've already got a name for her?\" she says angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was gonna call you Angela but you already had a name\" you say smiling. Tiffany sighs and picks you up, \"fine she can come, but you better remember who loves you\" Tiffany says gently kissing you and rubbing you against her cheek. You smile up at her and return the kiss, \"I know beautiful\" you say stroking her feathers.</span></div></div>",

Tiffany taps you on the shoulder \"ok, we beat you all in less than a week\" you say. Joe laughs, \"yeah that'd be pretty sad, although I think a giant blaziken is enough justification\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with a giant blaziken?\" Tiffany says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, nothing, it's just the fact that your bigger then Groudon or Kyogre, kind of gives you an advantage\" Joe says. Tiffany nods, \"well I must admit, there aren't very pokemon as big as I am\" she says sitting down and putting you in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't many, Tiffany your the only 1000ft tall pokemon i've ever heard of\" you reply. She looks down at you, \"is that a problem?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, but it makes me wonder if our journey might make a few rules\" you say starting to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New rules?\" Tiffany asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you know height restrictions, weight restrictions, no legendaries, that kind of thing\" you reply. Tiffany looks down at you, \"well it doesn't matter if they don't let us finish as long as I\u2019m with you\" she says. You pet her stomach and get comfy in the feathers, \"I have to agree Tiffany, although I\u2019d like to win, I mean we already beat Joe, would be kind of bad if he were the only gym leader we beat\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you calling me weak?\" Joe yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, No, I mean anyone would lose to Tiffany\" you say. You felt Trixie's poke ball start shaking so you put it down, and she pops out. Trixie smiles at you before hugging you. You moved her back a bit and finally had a chance to get a look at her. Trixie was quite beautiful, she was slimmer then Tiffany although she had a smaller chest probably a pair of b's in exchange for it. Her body was only covered by the grass dress all bellossom wear as well as a crude bra that seemed to be made of giant yellow flower petals although you have no idea where she found them. Trixie stares at Tiffany then at you \"why are you pushing me away?\" she asks. You didn't answer for a few seconds so she pressed on \"am I not pretty enough? Are my breasts too small? Is it because I lost to her\" she says pointing at Tiffany. By the end of her tirade Trixie had gotten herself so worked up she was almost crying, you looked at her stunned I mean you had 2 beautiful pokemon who seemed to really like you. Much to your suprise Tiffany pushes you and Trixie closer to each other, Trixie looks up for a second and sniffles before hugging you tightly pressing her chest against you. You slowly wrapped your arms around her and hugged her back and you felt her kiss your cheek and then just hug you tightly for a few seconds. Finally she lets go and smiles at you \"um....what do you think of me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you look very beautiful Trixie, i'm really glad to have you as my pokemon\" you say. Trixie's smile turns into a big goofy grin and you swear you smelt something for a second. Soon your mind clouded \"oh crap sweet scent\" you think before falling forward into Trixie's lap. The dress was quite smooth as were her legs, Trixie giggled for a second and started to pet your head \"thanks cutie, I like you too\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to him\" Tiffany says lowering her head and examining you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing just used sweet scent, thought I could well seduce him but seems it has a much stronger effect on people then I expected\" Trixie says. Tiffany gently picks you up and turns you over so your facing her, \"don't worry we won't do anything, but you do look really cute all helpless like this\" she says. Your able to raise your eyebrows at her and she lowers you down \"is there a way to fix this, like quickly?\" Tiffany asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it\" Joe yells, Tiffany and Trixie just stare at him as they had been totally obsessed with you. You couldn't see but you heard Joe walk up and search through a bag before you felt something get sprayed on your neck. You felt the feeling return to your arms and limbs and you sat up \"thanks\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\" he says giving you a hand up. You looked up and the sky had darkened a lot in the past half hour, \"well let's set up camp\" you say. Trixie and Joe helped you collect twigs and branches and Tiffany made a little pit in the ground. You piled up all the sticks in the pit and Tiffany blew a tiny flame onto the pile which soon ignited. Joe pulls a rolled up sleeping bag out of his backpack and lays down next to the fire, you return Trixie to her pokeball although she pecked you on the cheek before she was returned. Tiffany laid down and Joe yelled over \"hey where's your sleeping bag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here\" you reply as Tiffany picks you up and snuggles you into her chest. You couldn't see Joe but you were sure he was probably green with envy (hehe somewhat pun). You felt Tiffany start to gently pet your back and you rubbed her feathers in return. You fell asleep like that mumbling \"I love you Tiffany.\" You were woken up by gentle shaking and you opened your eyes to see Joe standing above you and a clear blue sky. \"Damn man, this is the best bed i've ever seen\" he says as you smile up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, companion, battle partner, and a really comfy bed\" you say. You felt Tiffany stir as apparently she had still been asleep and Joe jumps off before you fell to the ground as she sits up, yawns, and stretches. She looks down and smiles at you \"morning\" she says sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning\" you reply, Tiffany in her half asleep picks you up and just smiles at you for a bit before lifting you up and kissing you. You were suprised as her tongue pushed against you and it was almost like she wanted to taste you for a second before she pushed against you as you weren't returning the kiss. You kissed her beak and you were sure a smile spread across her face, she broke the kiss after a few seconds and just gently rubbed you against her cheek. \"My cute little trainer\" she whispered before kissing you again quickly. Tiffany puts you down and Trixie's pokeball was shaking like mad before she popped out and tackled you \"morning\" she says before kissing you on the lips. You were too stunned to do anything for a few seconds but you eventually kissed her back and she stood up, and was returned to her pokeball. Joe looks at you and sighs \"damn man what the hell, why are you getting all the love?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug \"just really lucky I guess\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what gym do we go to next\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think Glacial city up north would be best although it's a few days travel\" Joe says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Twilight town, doesn't that place have a gym?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but it's not as good a matchup for your pokemon\" Joe says looking at Tiffany. She lowered herself and smiled at him \"thank you for the concern but I think we can handle whatever the gym leader can throw at us, it's not like you were much of a challenge\" she says. Joe just stares at her stunned and you laughed your ass off.</span></div></div>",

Also how would it look if given Tiffany's size we took on 2 gyms where she had a type advantage one after the other, probably wouldn't look like I had much faith in her\" you say after you stopped laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then why was I the first gym leader you chose?\" Joe asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually, that was the first battle I've ever fought, even with Tiffany's size I still wanted the type advantage\" you say. Joe smiles but rolls his eyes \"well glad I could give you such an exhilerating battle\" he says sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say man, Tiffany is just a very strong pokemon\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Joe just smiles that is until Tiffany picks you up and puts you on her shoulder and just starts walking \"hey what about me?\" he shouts. Tiffany turns and looks down at him, \"you can walk\" she says, you tap her shoulder and she sighs \"fine\" she says. She picks Joe up and puts him on her other shoulder before starting to walk again. Tiffany walks for an hour before stopping to have a small rest, Joe walks off because he needs to do some buisness and Tiffany sits down and you look up at her\"why'd you do that?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore Joe and try to leave him behind\" you say. Tiffany stares down at you for a second then lifts you up \"Because, I just met you, and already there's someone else vying for your affections, and all you'll do is spend time with him instead of me\" she says. You were kind of shocked, I mean you had just met Joe like yesterday it wasn't like you were best buddies. You sigh and look up at Tiffany, \"Tiffany I will never ignore you, got that, no matter how many people or pokemon I make friends with you will always be my first and well, I love my big beautiful blaziken\" you say. Tiffany cuddles you against her cheek and puts you down right as Joe walks up, \"so can we get going?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, fine by me\" you say climbing up and sitting down on Tiffany's shoulder. She lifts Joe up and puts him down then slowly stands up. The rest of the walk to Twilight Town was pretty eventful, you just had a lot of idle chitchat. \"So Joe, do you know anything about the Twilight Gym leader?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a woman by the name of Ralena, she goes everywhere with an anthro umbreon who is her best friend, although since it's a guy there have been a few....rumours about her and her pokemon\" Joe replies. You nod as you had heard a few of the rumours he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would there be rumours?\" Tiffany asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some people, think anthro pokemon should be classified with animals, so they think it's wrong if we see them as anything more than pets\" Joe replies. Tiffany just shakes her head \"so they think it's wrong that I love my little trainer\" she says leaning her head over so you can pet her feathery cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah pretty much\" Joe replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a problem with it?\" Tiffany says stopping and staring at Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not, I mean I love my pokemon as much as any trainer and I want them to love me back\" Joe says. Tiffany stares at him for a few seconds before nodding and continuing to walk. You just sat back against Tiff's neck and gently stroked what you could of her cheek trying to calm her down. Finally she stopped and looked back at Joe, \"I'm sorry for what I said, it's just I don't want anyone threatening my little trainer\" she says. Joe nods quickly \"that's pervfectly understandable, he probably doesn't want anything to happen to you either\" he says. A few minutes later you reach the outskirts of Twilight Town, Joe decided to stay with Tiffany to try to get her to warm up a bit with him and you headed into town. Unlike New Light City, Twilight Town was a very small place, set in a small valley it got dark there very quickly and the city was known for the colorful displays of lights people kept on their houses all year round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou headed off for the gym as like New Light City it was easily recognizable, however unlike in New Light City there was a whole hell of people waiting in front of the black Crescent moon shaped building that surrounded the actual battlefield. Most people used Twilight Town as there second or last gym battle, so it was a lot more busy than New Light City, although since it was only trainers that ever came Twilight Town was able to stay relatively small. The line into the gym however was in no way small, given that an average pokemon battle could take about half an hour and even longer and there were atleast 30 people standing in the line you just turned around and walked out of town and back to where Joe and Tiffany were waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Tiffany asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have to wait until tomorrow, the gym's way too busy\" you say. Tiffany starts to stand up \"oh come on, I'm sure once they see me they'll clear right out\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they probably will, but Tiffany I don't want to just skip the queue, we're going to wait our turn, and that's final\" you say. She sits back down making you bounce an inch in the air \"fine, spoil all my fun\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany I don't want anyone to see you as a monster, I want them to see the beautiful and caring Blaziken I see\" you say. Tiffany instantly breaks into a smile and lifts you into her lap \"Fine Matt we can wait\" she says. Joe climbs up into Tiffany's lap and lays back \"hey this is really comfy\" he says. Tiffany picks him up between two fingers \"ah hem, Joe remember what I said about personal space\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's part of it?\" Joe asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you may sit on my outer extremities but the inner parts of my body are Matt only areas\" she states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Due I am so envious of you\" he yells down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...thanks Joe\" you say and Tiffany puts Joe down on the ground. He sighs and lays back against her leg and starts rooting around in a backpack before pulling out a book and he starts to read. Tiffany however wasn't finished with you, she lifts you up onto the top of her head just gives you a little pat, you can either take a nap or pet me, your choice\" she says. Obviously you got straight to work stroking her head, Tiffany gave off a small sigh and started to recline a bit laying against a large group of trees that suprisingly held her weight up. Tiffany was actually the first one to doze off thanks to the summer heat, you got off her head and slid down to the ground where you found Joe on the ground and you dragged his body over to a nearby tree so there was no chance of Tiffany hurting him when she woke up. You walked back up Tiffany and lay down on her stomach. Suddenly Trixie's pokeball started to shake and she popped out, she took a second to look around and figured out everyone else was asleep. Before you could react she was attached to you and she laid her head down on your shoulder. After a few seconds you heard her breathing space out, you gave off a small happy sigh and gently hugged the bellossom and fell asleep like that. You woke up to...</span></div></div>",

So long as you can remember you had always been raised by a group of wild pokemon, and you had always treated them as family. opening your right hand you look down at the black scar in the shape of a flame. \"yes its all because of this.\" clenching your fisht you force yourself to remember. When you were young there was a Ninetails in the valley you lived in, and he did not like humans at all, having been betryaed by his old trainer. to say the least he did not like you being in the valley so one day he decided to try and get rid of you. There is an old saying that, anyone who pulls on a ninetails tail will be cursed. Well thats just what happens, he tricked you into pulling one of them, leaving this mark emblazoned on your hand. Because of this the pokemon exiled the ninetails and you had to live with the curse. The curse itself will cause a searing pain to overtake the cursed's body about once a day, and lasts 5 minutes to an hour. Suddenly you feel the searing pain start up, but it doesn't feel like the normal daily pain, more like... The Curse mark flared red and lines began appearing all over your body. 'Not Now, Not Here' you think to your self. just then the line burst open and blood shoots everywhere. 'Yeah definetally the monthly burst' you think as you begin to black out from blood loss.</span></div></div>",

Rounding a bend she sees your bloody body sprawled out at the edge of the river. \"What Happened here!\" She cries out, rushing to you. Placing her fingers to your neck she finds your pulse stong and true. <br>\r\nThen, right before her eyes your wounds which would look lethal to anyone begin to close, the flow of blood sputtering, then stoping completely. Slowly you start to stir, causing Gardevoir to jump, not expecting someone to survive injuries like that. Sitting up, you mutter \"Mornin' Mom\" which it has become habit for you, given the Anthro Kangaskan who cared for you the most prefered you calling her that. Shaking your head you look down at the bloody mess that is yor shorts, and say \"Dang it, this is the only pair of shorts i have\". Standing up you look around, seeing nobody you take of your clothes and step into the stream.<br>\r\nYou dont realise that gardevoir was there, or that she had hidden behind a tree nearby, startled by your \"Miraculous\" recovery. Looking at the creek, and the ground surrounding the area where you were you say to yourself \"Sure was a strong one this time huh. Ah well what can ya do\". Kneeling down you begin to wash your shorts(they are the only clothing you had, given you were raised by wild pokemon you had to get by with what they found).</span></div></div>",

Looking at your curse mark, you reply \"Yah, this happens a lot, so im kind of used to it\".

Is this your curse again?\". With a supreme effort you can gasp out \"Yes\", before the pain causes you body to begin spasming. <br>\r\nStanding up, Gardevoir begins looking around anxiously muttering \"What do I do, what do I do\" to herself. Looking at the river, and putting 2 and 2 together rushed over to it. Kneeling down she rips chunks off the bottom of her dress, soaks them in the river and presses them to your forehead, torso and limbs. Taking any one that warms up and re cooling it in the river, she watches over you for a full 40 minutes before the curse lets up.<br>\r\nGasping for breath your vision starts to clear as the curse releases its grip. The first thing you see is Gardevoir's concerned face hovering over yours. Groaning as you sit up you suddenly find Gardevoir wrapped around you, crying into your shoulder. Wrapping your arms around her you whisper \"Its alright, I'm fine, you don't have to worry\".  Wiping the tears from her eyes, you tilt her chin up to look at you. \"Thank you so much, I never would have expected someone I just met to care for me through my curse, especially one that lasted that long\".<br>\r\nBlushing, Gardevoir gently pushed herself away, before getting up. \"I was wondering\" she said \"If you want, would it be alright if I travel with you? I cant really go back to my old life, and besides I can help keep you safe when your curse acts up. So what do you say?\". Struggling to your feet you say \"Of course, there is no way I would leave someone who helped me alone out here, besides it would be impolite for a gentleman to leave a beautiful lady alone in the woods\". Again your comment extracts a blush from Gardevoir. So, where are we going? Gardevoir asks, looking around.<br>\r\n\"Well.... </span></div></div>",

But he didn't want jujst any pokemon, he wanted one who was big, and not just tall, he wanted her huge, to the point where he would be up to her knee and more. Which is the main reason he learned how to perform magical spells, and he learned enough to set out and find the right pokegirl, one who would enjoy being big, yet still gentle at the same time. He was daydreaming a bit too much, becasue he stepped on something and felt a sudden electric shock, not enough to do any damage, but enough to knock him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Matt finally woke up, his vision was bit blurry. He stood up and tried to clear his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" came a soft sounding voice, Matt looked over to see a beautiful Luxio anthro pokemon, Matt couldn't help but stare at this beautiful creature \"Are you still a bit dazed?\" she asked, Matt shook his head lightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm alright\" Matt said, hearing the worry in her voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for shocking you, you stepped on my tail and I thought something was coming to pick on me again\" She said, sounding a bit sorry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick on you? why would they do that?\" Matt asked, wondering why someone would pick on such a cute girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because....no, you'll just tease me too....\" She said. Matt felt sorry for her and moved towards her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd never bring myself to tease something as cute as you\" He said in a comforting voice, this made her look a little shocked and blushed lightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You think I'm cute?\" She stuttered out, Matt softly nodded. She imediatly wrapped her arms around him, he could hear her purring, Matt smiled and hugged back. They held eachother this way for a while until Matt slowly broke it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Matt by the way\" he finally introduced himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ele\" She said smiling \"And I feel like maybe I can trust you, I don't know why but I feel comfortable, I'm picked on frequently, becasue others find it fun to pick on what I often dream about\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is that?\" Matt asled curiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...I want to be big\" She said heasitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" matt said in disbelief<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know its dumb sounding...\" Ele started<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it is\" Matt said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" Ele sounded shocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually wanted a girl who was big\" Matt explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow\" She said lightly \"Just...how big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big! very big! I mean giantess!\" Matt exclaimed, Ele once again hugged him tightly, holding it again for a while<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you....be my trainer then?\" Ele asked whiled they hugged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be glad to\" Matt said back as they broke their second hug \"And I happen to know some magic\" He said finding his backpack and pulling out a small book<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh!\" Ele said in interest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I can easily make you big\" Matt said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it!\" She shouted excitedly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked to be around 6 feet at first, but she soon was 7, then 8, then 10. \"I...I'm growing!\" She said excitedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a success\" Matt said, then he felt her body on him as she pressed her growing lips on his, Matt didn't object to this kiss and accepted it, Ele had to be 15 feet now and still growing, she laid on her back with Matt on top as they held the kiss as best they could. Soon, she was too big to hold it easily and they broke it, Ele marveled at her size, she was 30 feet and still growing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so wonderful!\" She exclaimed, Matt simply smiled and nodded. She stood up and put Matt on her shoulder, she was now 50 feet tall \"Wow!

Ele was a nice girl, nicer than he had honestly expected someone at her new size to be after growth; as such, he wanted to give her the answer to a dream that she'd thought impossible until now.  He finally found it and grinned as the glow reappeared around his hand; he'd grant her this wish, and then some.  He tapped the Luxio's ankle, making her giggle slightly as the warmth slowly spread over her again.  She grew; 55, 60, 75, 100 feet tall.  It was here that Ele had expected to stop, but she kept right on going; here yellow eyes widened as she looked down to the human that was now resting atop one of her growing feet.  Matt just smiled and waved up at her; signalling that this was no mistake.  And Ele smiled back as she climbed, ever further, into the triple digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrees shrank under her and were pushed aside as he feet expanded with the rest of her massive form, her weight put huge dents into the ground in the shape of her plantigrade feet, her purring could be heard throughout the forest as she kept going.  Finally, once her height had reached 200 feet, the spell released her and she could fully appreciate her surroundings.  The trees were like thick grass to her; mountains, once incredible monuments of nature, were now little more than hills to her; she was easily the strongest Pok\u00e9mon in the forest, in <i>her</i> forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was all thanks to the boy that was sliding off her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Matt.\"  She spoke, her voice holding such power now that it actually took him by surprise.  \"Thank you; thank you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy smiled up, tipping an imaginary hat to the massive Luxio.  \"No trouble at all.\" He said, the grin just growing as he spoke.  \"It's always a pleasure to help one so beautiful as you.\"  Ele blushed at the compliment and Matt chuckled at how someone like him could make this goddess blush; even if it was a goddess he'd created.  \"So; what are you going to do with your new size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEle blinked, then put a hand to her chin in thought.  Her tail swayed lazily as she closed her eyes to concentrate on figuring out the answer to the human's question.  \"Well...\"  She started; grinning down at Matt.  \"I suppose I could...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"June?\" Matt called out, glancing through the door into the kitchen. Where was she? It wasn't like her to not come when called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune was an anthropomorphic Growlithe. Specifically, she was Matt's Growlithe, and his companion. They lived together in Matt's cabin, in the forests around Mt. Flare. Whenever Matt went out for any reason, whether to go to town for supplies or just on a walk, June would follow, zealously protecting her beloved master. When Matt went to bed, June would snuggle up against him underneath the covers. And whenever Matt showed the slightest sign of needing any kind of assistance, June would be at his side, instantly.<br>\r\nExcept she wasn't right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"June, where are you? I'm starting to get worried here-\" Matt stopped mid-sentence as he peeked around the attic. There, in a corner filled with dusty boxes, June crouched on the floor. \"June? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\nJune jumped to her feet at the sound of Matt's voice, clearly surprised.<br>\r\n\"M-m-matt! I'm so sorry! I didn't hear you! I was careless, I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n\"It's okay, June, I don't mind. I was just getting worried. It's not like you to get distracted.\"<br>\r\n\"It won't ever happen again, I promise!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. What was so interesting, anyway?\" June didn't answer. She just shifted her hands around behind her back. Matt suddenly noticed a thin wisp of steam rising from two small trails of water on her cheeks. \"June? Have you been crying?\"<br>\r\nJune quickly rubbed her eyes with one hand, being sure to keep the other hand behind her back. \"No! Of course not! Why would I be crying?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but whatever it is, I don't like it.\" Matt stepped closer. To his surprise, June stepped back.<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, Matt, just forget about it.\"<br>\r\nMatt frowned. He hated to see June crying like this. \"No. June, I order you to give me whatever it is you're hiding.\"<br>\r\nJune gasped, but she would <i>never</i> disobey a direct order from Matt. She slowly moved her hand forward, revealing an old photograph. Matt took it from her and looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were five Growlithe girls standing together, all of varying sizes. If the tree and house in the background were any indication, the biggest of the girls, who had to crouch to fit in the image, was easily over thirty feet tall- large even for a Pokegirl.<br>\r\n\"P-please, don't make fun of me, Matt...\"<br>\r\n\"Why would I make fun of you? June, what's this a photo of? Is this your family?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. It's my sisters and me.\"<br>\r\n\"I thought so. You've all got the same eyes. Is this one you?\" June looked at the girl Matt was pointing to, and broke into tears again. \"June! What's wrong?! Did I say something?\"<br>\r\n\"N-no, it's just...\"<br>\r\nMatt walked up to June and placed his hands on her shoulders. June was taller than he was, about eight feet from paws to ears, but Matt certainly didn't mind.<br>\r\n\"June... just talk to me. Please?\"<br>\r\nJune bit her lip for a moment, then sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. That one is me. I'm the runt of the litter.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm the runt. I'm just a scrawny little thing.\" Matt looked down at the photo. Now that she mentioned it, June <i>was</i> the smallest girl in the photo. Her closest competition was at least ten feet tall, probably a little more. \"I'm sorry I kept it hidden from you, but I didn't want to make you feel bad.\"<br>\r\n\"Why would I feel bad?\"<br>\r\n\"Because my sisters are all huge, and strong, and powerful, and you just got me, little old June, the runt!\"<br>\r\nJune began to cry again.<br>\r\n\"June, I-\"<br>\r\n\"I always wanted to be big like my sisters, so I could take care of you and protect you like they protect their masters, but I can't! I'm useless!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly! You're not useless at all!\"<br>\r\n\"But I'm still just the runt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt bit his lip. It was true that he had always wished June could be bigger. He loved her just the way she was, of course, loved her absolutely- but even then, if she was bigger... if she was huge, gigantic, tremendous...<br>\r\nMatt shook himself out of it. No use putting thoughts like that into his head. <br>\r\nHe threw the photo off into the corner, walked up to June, and hugged her tight. He sank into her soft furry body, gently pressing against her large breasts.<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't care if you were one foot or one hundred feet- you're my Growlithe, June, and I love you.\"<br>\r\n\"T-thank you, Matt... Thank you...\"<br>\r\n\"Now come on, let's go get something to eat. Wipe those tears away.\"<br>\r\nJune smiled and did as her master asked.</span></div></div>",

He had to stop thinking like that! He'd just end up making June feel bad, and that was the last thing in the world he wanted to do. She was the kindest, gentlest, most loving Pokegirl he had ever met or even heard of. <br>\r\nStill...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mount Flare looks lovely when the sun sets behind it, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, yeah.\" Matt glanced out the window. As he stared, a thought suddenly came to him- something crazy, but crazy enough that it just might work! \"June, what you said upstairs...\"<br>\r\nJune looked away, ready to cry again at any moment.<br>\r\n\"Forget what I said, Matt, please. I was just so... surprised, that's all. I didn't mean anything.\"<br>\r\n\"Really? So you'd turn down a chance to get bigger?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not! I-I mean... d-don't be silly! How could I get bigger?\"<br>\r\nMatt smiled at Mt. Flare. \"You have the Flash Fire ability, don't you?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, but... but...\" June slowly turned to look at Mt. Flare as well.<br>\r\n\"And Mt. Flare is a volcano, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n\"It's inactive, though!\" June was visibly excited, even though she was trying to convince herself that what she was thinking would never work.<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean there isn't any lava in it, just that it isn't going to explode. If someone who could absorb heat energy was able to absorb even a fraction of that lava... or maybe a lot...\"<br>\r\n\"Or maybe all!\" June shouted. No sooner had the words left her muzzle, though, than she seemed to regret her outburst. \"I mean, maybe just a bit, not too much...\"<br>\r\nMatt placed a hand atop one of June's paws. \"I don't see why it couldn't be all of it- as long as that person was comfortable with it.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sure this person wouldn't want to scare her master by growing <i>too</i> big...\"<br>\r\n\"That's only an issue if said master actually thinks there <i>is</i> such a thing as 'too big.'\"<br>\r\nJune's tail whipped frantically back and forth, like a metronome caught in a blender. \"Well...</span></div></div>",

Not that he minded in the least, he had made the suggestion for the sole purpose of making her happy; plus, seeing her even big appealed to him as much as it did to her.  \"We're not going to find out just sitting here, now are we?\"  He said, getting the Pok\u00e9girl's attention again as he stood up.  \"Shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune was on her feet almost before he'd even finished, eyes shining with the same eagerness that he'd always loved about her.  \"Yes, Matt.\"  She said, tail wagging as she spoke.  \"Let's go!\"  Matt chuckled to himself as June bounced like a she was a puppy who'd just found out they were going for a walk, which they were in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to Mt. Flare was surprisingly bland; still, Matt had come to expect it thanks to June being so protective of him.  It took very little time to reach the volcano, and both master and Pok\u00e9mon was anxious to see what would happen.  Following one of the numerous tunnels down into the mountain, Matt and June eventually stumbled upon what looked to be a massive lake of magma; the human was sweating from the intense heat, but June was just excited over what was about to happen.  \"Ready?\"  Matt asked his Pok\u00e9mon, like he didn't notice her barely held in excitement.  \"Go for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune ran to the edge of the lake and gingerly put a foot into the molten rock.  As a Fire-type, it was just comfortably warm to her; but, more to the point, it seemed that they'd guessed right.  Even Matt noticed that the small dip had increased her height by several feet.  The Growlite squee'd in joy, before diving right into the lava and vanishing from Matt's sight.  At first, he wasn't all that concerned, June could swim well enough and the magma was much denser than any water, but the seconds grew ever longer and his worry started to rear its head.  \"June?\"  He said, looking about to see if she had come up somewhere out of his sight.  \"June; where are you?\"  He repeated, slightly louder now as he looked around.  Suddenly; the ground began to shake and Matt feared that his Pok\u00e9mon had somehow awakened the volcano and it was about to erupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he was half right; something <i>was</i> about to erupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune broke the surface of the lake, smiling down at her master as she towered over him.  Back on the ground, Matt's jaw went slack as he stared up at the magnificent figure of his Pok\u00e9mon.  \"Oh... my... God....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune just giggled at this.  \"That's 'God<i>dess</i>'.\"  She corrected jokingly; as she now stood at an incredible height of...</span></div></div>",

It was a long, boring and altogether dull walk to the large home; that was, until he was suddenly caught in the grip of something large, warm and furry and found himself rocketing upward.  \"Matt; you're home!\"  You were assaulted by a wet and warm surface that rubbed against you, leaving you wet but smiling nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down, girl; Down!\"  You laughed out as you were set down once again; wiping away some of the wetness, the boy looked up at just what had put him through all that.  It was an anthro Growlithe; not nearly that much of a surprise since they were so very common, what was unusual about her was her size.  The Growlithe, whom you had nicknamed Katie, was just over 300 feet tall.  Matt had become famous for managing to capture her, a one of a kind titan that science was still scratching its head over; no one seemed to know how a Pok\u00e9mon could get as big as her and Katie just giggled and smiled whenever someone asked her directly.  But Matt had stopped caring a long time ago; he had always liked big girls, so he didn't care about the how or why as long as she was the size she was.  As an added bonus, he was getting regular challenges to try and best her in a fight; since he'd never lost a match since catching her, he was filthy rich.  He'd splurged and bought what amounted to a mansion(that barely reached Katie's ankle) to live in with her as his guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brings us back to the here and now; even though he was set for life-literally-with Katie around, he still liked to work so he didn't get lazy or complacent.  However, now that he was home with his girl, everything just seemed right with the world.  But this would turn out to be an interesting day for Matt; in ways that he couldn't foresee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's going to happen today?</span></div></div>",

It wasn't that he was lost, he could easily find his way back to the last town with a few days walk; he was out here because of sheer stubbornness.  This area wasn't your average forest, it appeared in countless legends told by travelers; legends that told of a goddess that watched over the entire forest by herself.  There was a fair amount of variety in the accounts; but, there had been enough consistency to convince Matt that there was a core element of truth to them all.  As  such, he'd taken it upon himself to travel these woods for days upon days upon days until he could find her and meet her for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reviewed the stories in his mind, going over the common details; what little he'd managed to find in the stories.  The goddess was always referred to as an Arcanine; she was almost always recognizable at first sight; and the most common of all: She was always significantly bigger than the rare wild Arcanine that could be found within these woods.  It wasn't very much to go on, not enough to get the attention of a reputable scientist at the very least, but Matt had decided that the sheer number of accounts with these three things in common trumped the lack of more similarities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt a light thudding that vibrated through the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt jumped to his feet, afraid that he was about to get caught in an earthquake, before he remembered that this entire area was geologically stable; this was something else entirely.  The vibration came again, slightly more forceful this time; then again with yet more force.  It continued one like this for several moments before Matt realized that was a very regular pattern to the vibrations; almost like they were.... footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well; whose this cutie I find walking in my woods?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turned, finding himself staring up at a...</span></div></div>",

Whatever type of body change the said, it would occur, such as growth, strength increase, speed increase, etc. These became highly popular since it made battles an even greater spectacle. Not to mention, it helped fulfill many fantasies (Including your own). However, you knew better than to send the best out, the junk you pushed to the public had limitations, and were only temporary, you saved the best for yourself, the ones inside Jill lasted, and there was no limit, Jill could be as fast or as strong as any legendary, and beyond, and best of all, she could grow to be a goddess, all at the command of your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun you from your computer, facing her now, you never did object to her decision of being naked while in the house \"I'm doing just fine, but you look a little uncomfortable in that chair. why not have a seat on something a little more comfy?\" She asked, her usual, feral smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle to yourself, playing along \"Are you suggesting I use you? Why, you'd have to grow to fifteen feet to do something like that.\" You say, as soon as you do, Jill closed her eyes, smiling and running her hand down her hip as she grew bigger, stretching upwards until she did indeed hit 15 feet. Another reason for spacious living, it gave her plenty of room to \"stretch\". She opened her eyes and looked at you as she sat down with her legs crossed, nothing turned you on more than watching your girl get big, you get out of your seat in exchange to sit in her lap, feeling her warm, soft fur as you cuddle up against her. smiling sweetly, you feel her hand petting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so nice to see my little Master enjoy a nice warm lap\" Jill says as she pets<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it when you're big, love\" you say to her, leaning on her,feeling her body add another foot, you nuzzle her soft belly fur.

No winning and then deciding on your prize; if one of us does, the match goes to the other one.\" You grin at her, your eyes darting to her full, firm cleavage dangling before you. \"So, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill holds out her hand. \"I say you're gonna lose, Master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" you say as you hand Jill her dice cup and begin shaking yours, \"if I win, I want you to grow to double your current size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, Master,\" Jill practically purrs, \"that sounds fantastic...\" She thinks for a moment of what she wants. \"If I win, hmm... I want you to give me the ability to lactate! As much milk as I like, and never-ending!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a bit surprised. Jill never mentioned this fetish before. Was it something new, or had she never had the courage to talk about it before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, the bets are made, and Round 1 begins. Good Luck, Jill,\" you say as the two of you slam down your cups.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're Matt and 19 years old. You're a human that lived a relative normal live in an orphanage. Ok how would one define normal? Everyone does it in their own way, so that doesn't help. A quick summary of important things is you never new your parents, the orphanage staff has taken care of you and other very well and you were well educated, even if the teachers were rather set on getting you all well disiplined. Everything seemed like it had always been this way and would stay like it which sounds like the most clich\u00e9 shit, but you can't change your past life now, can you? When you were 12 or so the orphanage burnt down, not thanks to an accident or pyromanic teenagers, but accidentaly by teenagers who were fighting with their pyromanic Pok\u00e9mon.  Surprisingly no one got hurt, but thing were off for a while, since where you come from Pok\u00e9mon are believed to be fiction and even the staff members were at a loss for a bit. Though after a while the orphanage was rebuild and things returned to some kind of normality.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe only new things were the new Anthro Septile caretaker and a Simsala math teacher to help you and the other kids get used to the new enviorment. Everything went well until you turned 18. Back then you weren't told somethings for example people had to venture out and latest at eighteen years. It was normal for the people here as they normally recieved a Pok\u00e9mon at the age of 10, but due to your... circumstances you didn't have one so you had to get your Pok\u00e9mon on your own in the wilderness. Sounds still pretty easy, right?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWell it is, if you get some Pok\u00e8balls escape the regular wildlife,some more wild and brutal Pok\u00e8mon and the average Trainer trying to mug you with his team at your throat. The only thing left then is finding food and shelter. Shelter was the smaller problem as anything in the wilderness seemed to leave you alone for some reason. Food, however proved to be diffecult to get as stores are more than overpriced, while work hwas hardly paid at all, when you didn't provide for a Pok\u00e9mon. The fruits and berries found in the wild are mostly poisoness for humans, so you had to hunt small rodents and catch normal fish just to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only good thing is that die to your desperate lifestyle some low-rank members of Team Rocket noticed you and got you a place in the organisation. Your part since then was to scout out certain locations for their heists or other plan by taking a part-time job there and getting keys or other necessary items. Though they didn't give you a Pok\u00e9mon, since they had mostly stolen ones and those aren't really obedient. But after the first few Jobs you learned it was mostly to allow you the easy access to the jobs as the paperwork normal Trainers have to fill out was rediculous. There also was no way to get around it as basicly everyone is able to look up who has which Pok\u00e9mon, since every new pokeball is chipped and automaticly registers to a personal ID. At least your getting a good payment for the scouting and the actual job your doing. Though that should be a given as you also had to play hostage a few times to bust your teammates out of sticky situations. Good thing you earned some promotions for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the bad part that about it in The present day. Your suppose to move north and work with their newly built facility. Just to get there you need to geht over these Mountains. Snowy Mountains. Without a road. Or food, water, warm clothing or pretty much anything. These guys didn't even give you a guide or a group to travel with! What shitty... Whatever. Now you're at the mercy of nature and it doesn't like you. The snowfall bot stringer in the last few hours and all you can see is white with some grey stone that you almost trip over, since your unable to see further than a few feet in front of you. Right now you're resting in a small cave near a little fire you made. It won't last much longer judging by the flame and how few firewood, but for now it is warm atleast. From time to time you look up, out into the endless white of the slowly calming storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is while doing this, you see a figure mode outside the cave. It isn't exactly the worst option bring torn to pieces by something, when compared to freezing to death or starvation. You get up and slowly approach the figure outside the cave. As you get closer it gets clear to you, standing there is an Anthro Pok\u00e9mon. A female Absol to be exact. Given ALL Pok\u00e9mon are female, which makes one wonder how they reproduce, but ehh... Who cares? She is a little shorter than you, maybe by an inch or so. For some reason though she doesn't react to your approach and you stop a few feet away froh her, befor you call out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you!\" The Absol jumps in surprise and spins around quickly. No wonder she didn't notice  you. Thanks to the  still rageing storm you hadn't even realized she had her back turned to you. You can still just barely make out her siliuett due to her white fur. Only her bloodred eyes pierce the show and let you know where her face is. You have to admit that she does have beautyful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hu-human...!\"she exclaims quite and definetly surprised.\"Ohh- Wh-who are y-you?\" the Absol asks nervous. Atleast she doesn't rip you to pieces or something like that, but why is she so nervous? Afraid of you even, it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Name is Matt. Mind telling me yours?\" You awnser hoping to get this over fast, so you can get back to your fire soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Angel...!\" You like that name. It kind of fits her, but wasn't there something about Absols and disasters? What is that noise anyway?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, noticing while doing so that Angel is also starring at something behind you, and look up. \"Oh for fucks sake...\" Is all you can say. Despite the snow you clearly see the giant avalanch that's starting above you. Quickly you reach out for Angel, which is about to start running down the rather steep side of the mountain your cave is embedded in, and get a hold of her arm. Instantly you pull her with you in the direction your cave was. The fire burnt down so far you could barely see it. A slight bit a head of the avalanch, both of you manage to get inside the cave, just to get catapulted to the other end by the force of a fraction of the snow that entered the cave. After a short flight the trip comes to an immediate stop, as you crash into the far end of the cave with head and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head hurts like hell and the feeling of something liquid like runnig down the back of your head is not helping either. Your head is also almost the only thing you can feel and your vision was already starting to get a bit blurry. But before you even realize exactly what happened, Angel lands right on top of you, the lips of you two locked in an instant. Despite being shocked you enjoy this little accident a lot, aswell as being a little closer to her. She's basicly a walking heater too you in this frozen hole. Also your getting a close look of her beautiful face. Her smooth and pretty soft dark blue skin, the small snout with her cute little nose and not to forget her wonderful mouth (which you feel, rather than see) or her race-defineing cresent-shaped horn, which goes off slightly on to the right side of her face.After another few seconds Angel seemed to recover from the impact too and slowly opened her eyes, which were even more intoxicating up close. Though then she suddenly realizes what happened, her eyes wide open she quickly gets oft you heavily blushing, despite her normal skin color overshadowing it partly, turning her head away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! I'm sorry - I didn't- It was- I mean...!\" While Angel starteled, searches for a way to apologize, you slowly drift closer to a coma.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThough now you can also see her body as a whole, which appears to be very slender if qiuet curvy around the top. She has a cute, small butt, though it can in no way compete to her breasts. Some people call Pok\u00e9mon 'Pocket Monsters' and those were definetly monsters! You're surprised, Angel can walk upright, even sprint with you to the cave, with each breast being the size of her torso. You knew Anthro Pok\u00e9mon are always bigger and ...developed traits larger than average human females, but she definetly takes the cake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry so much about it. It's not like it hurt anyone, right?\" You say in hope of calming her down, because everything is becoming a blurry mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I guess not, but I didn't mean to-!\" she starts again, thpough not stuttering this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is nothing to apologize for of to expain, okay? And of it helps, I must say, you're a great kisser.\" You state truthfully and there she blushes again. Then you feel yourself sliding over to your right side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank,...?!\" You suddenly hit the ground hard, though you felt nothing. Your mind drifts away slowly as your surroundings fall silent. The last thing you see is a flame flickering in the wind, before just as it was fated to, turns to ashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, where is it that you awaken?</span></div></div>",

After literally years of searching places with names he couldn't pronounce and spending what amounted to a small fortune on what everyone had told him was a fool's errand, he'd finally found it.  \"The Azure Flute.\"  He spoke the name barely louder than a breath, as if he thought that speaking too loudly would cause the fabled artifact to shatter.  \"This... will summon Arceus.\"  He spoke the words just a quietly, but there was a certain excitement to them this time.  However, Matt was no glory hound seeking to capture or defeat the Alpha Pok\u00e9mon; no, he merely wanted to meet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt had always been... 'interested' in strong Pok\u00e9mon, and Arceus was supposed to be the strongest of them all; she was supposed to be the goddess of them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith shaking hands, he raised the Azure Flute to his lips and blew out a single, clear note.  Even though his skill with the flute was moderate at the best, playing just that note on this instrument seemed like a song unto itself; a song that made even the best music written by any human composer pale in comparison.  It was as if he was hearing just a glimpse of what Heaven was truly like in that one note channeled through this divine flute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the flute shattered in his grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\"  Matt shouted as the fragments turned to dust; but, before he could say anything else, a flash of blinding light robbed him of his sight for several moments.  When next he could see, he found himself in a landscape of pure white that seemed to stretch for as far as he could see in all directions; even stranger than that, the 'ground' beneath him seemed to be giving off it's own heat.  \"Wh-where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well; you summoned me, didn't you?\"  A powerful voice hailed from the heavens above and Matt turned his gaze skyward and gasped.  Towering over him, and anything that he could possibly imagine, was Arceus herself.  Her palm alone, which he appeared to be on, could have easily held his city and then some; her face filled his entire field of view even though he was only about at chest level; and he couldn't even begin to compare <i>those</i> to anything at all.  \"So; we going to try this fight thing, or would you rather just give up now.\"  She said, sounding bored with the whole thing, like she'd done this enough times to know the routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I-\"  Matt had to gulp to swallow his fear before he could continue.  \"I'm Matt.\"  He finally said to her, trying to keep both his fear and his excitement contained.  \"N-nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus raised an eyebrow.  \"'Meet' me?\"  She repeated.  \"Don't you mean 'fight' me or 'defeat' me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  Matt said, adamantly.  \"Meet you.\"</span></div></div>",

Although I don't think I need any introductions, do I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, there was an akward silence. You'd think talking to something over a thousand times your size wouldn't allow for such moments, but apparently not. \"...so, Arceus...\" Matt said, in an attempt to break the silence, \"Do you wanna...do something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arceus-girl cocked an eyebrow. \"Like what?\"</span></div></div>",

But you were unwavering. \"Well, whaf if I wanted to meet you instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put a hand to her forehead, groaning. \"Of all the stupid...fine. I'll humor you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had been lost in the forest for days, you're friends and family had told you not to go but you heard there were pokemon from all over the world in this forest and some you could only find there so you had to go. The forest was ancient with trees that dwarfed most you would normally see but that just made getting lost easier. You wandered around aimlessly, you were sure that you had left a trail when you had entered but it was almost like something or someone had removed it, wanting you to get lost. You stopped where you were and thought about the legends of the forest for a bit. Swarms of killer beedrill, pink versions of pokemon like rhydon, atleast half the pokemon were anthro, so far you had witnessed nearly every legend. \"I know there was one more legend\" you think as you start walking again. \"Hmm now what was it.....oh yeah, wasn't there supposed to be a mightyena that guarded this forest, I know people have come here before, and that all of them have returned white as sheets just muttering the name under their breaths\" you think. You foolishly keep walking until you don't feel anything under you're foot, you don't even cry out as you start to fall. You fall for a good 2 minutes until abruptly you're fall ends as you land on something that although somewhat hard still felt soft and you're knocked unconcious<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly regain conciousness and it's nightime, you wake up next to a giant bonfire big enough to cook multiple whole cows over and that freaks you out a bit. You look around quickly and you don't see anything except the outline of a small hill in the distance. You hear a girl sniffling \"why do all these bad things have to happen to me, finally someone who seems to just like pokemon shows up and they're dead\" you hear the girl say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um hello?\" you say, the sniffling stops and much to you're shock the outline of what you had taken to be a hill moves toward you. The shape enters the firelight and you stand there stunned as you're looking at a gigantic anthro Mightyena. Her black hair flowed down her back sparkling in the firelight. Her grey and black fur looked just as beautiful and also sparkled in the firelight, you figure you must have landed on her somewhere when you fell. You're attention was grabbed by her chest which would have been a d-cup at normal size and at this size you really weren't sure. She slowly crawls forward on clawed hands and feet and you just sit there unable to move. You stare up at her and you're caught in her gaze, you stare at her giant red eyes and you can't look away as they looked so beautiful in the firelight, you had to admit even though she was huge the mightyena in front of you was absolutely beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might....mighty.....MIghtyena\" you stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you, but you'll probably want to leave like all the rest so i'll take you out of the forest tomorrow\" she says looking down sadly \"don't know why I keep getting people lost since they all want to leave\" she mutters but you hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one that got me lost\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it gets really lonely in the forest because all the other pokemon avoid me, so my only real company are the occaisonal human adventurer that I get lost\" she says shedding a few tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey are you ok?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine\" she says \"now just go to sleep and treat this like a dream, you'll be out of the forest in the morning\" she says laying down and curling up. You continue to hear sniffling noises come from her and now that the initial shock was over you weren't really scared or angry at her. You walk up and touch her back \"Um....I can still hear you and it's kind of keeping me up\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well then i'll be quiet\" she says. You walk around her and sit right in front of her \"that's alright, if it's ok with you i'd like to talk\" you say. She stares at you in disbelief \"why? I got you lost and i'm a freak pokemon, not only am I an anthro but i'm so huge that no one wants me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a freak, you're beautiful\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the most beautiful mightyena i've ever seen\" you say realizing it after the shock wore off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you mean it?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you take such good care of yourself you're hair and fur just sparkle, and you're eyes are well there's no word for them other then beautiful\" you say. She uncurls herself and stares at you, \"why aren't you afraid of me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was, when I first saw you, but you can't be that bad. You were the one that saved me when I fell off that cliff weren't you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes but you weren't supposed to know that\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You also watched over me while I was knocked out and you could have harmed or killed me at anytime but you didn't so that says you're a nice pokemon\" you say smiling. She gently hugs you against her \"thank you, that's the kindest thing anyone has ever said to me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's you're name?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Alice\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you, i'm Matt\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Matt you've made me a very happy girl, do you know what you get for that?\" Emma asks leaning over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope it's something good\" you say. She snuggles you into her chest so you were surrounded completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get the best sleeping spot in the whole forest\" Alice says \"don't worry you'll still wake up outside the forest\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I make a request?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the first time anyone's asked, so sure\" Alice replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you come with me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to be my pokemon\" you say, \"you said yourself you're lonely here and well I think i've kind of fallen for you, so why not?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never in the 17 years since my mom left me has anyone asked me to be their pokemon\" Alice says sniffling. You knew Mightyena left their cubs when they were a year old so you figured she was around 18.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I hope you say yes, it's about time I got my first pokemon\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? shouldn't you already have one?\" Alice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed the ceremony, 18 years of age and not a pokemon to my name\" you say smiling. \"So will you?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses for a second, \"of course I will\" she says rubbing her cheek against you. You give her cheek a hug as she gently squeezes you. \"Thank you\" she says giving you a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you thanking me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew I could be so happy before\" Alice says hugging you into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm glad you're happy, meeting you was worth the days of being lost\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should I call you? master? trainer?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call me Matt\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Matt\" Alice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So as you're trainer is there anything I should know about you, other then the whole size thing\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love being petted more then anything else, I like having my ears scratched, and I have mostly become a vegetarian but I still need meat every so often\" Alice says. You file that last piece of info away as being very important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well do you mind if I give you a pet, you know for watching over me and stuff\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that an order? from trainer to pokemon?\" she asks smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes it is\" you say smiling. Alice lays out and you climb onto her stomach, you start rubbing and you see a look of pure happiness spread over her face. It takes you around an hour to pet her whole stomach but you smiled the whole time. Her fur was so soft and silky you just wanted to curl yourself up in it and never leave. You finished you're petting and Alice gently picks you up, \"that felt so good\" Alice says smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you enjoyed it\" you say. She gently hugs you into her chest and curls up \"it's about time both pokemon and trainer got to sleep\" Alice says and you can feel the happiness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then goodnight Alice\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Matt\" Alice replies giving you a little squeeze.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up the next morning to find yourself surrounded by darkness, you freak out for a second until you hear the sound of light breathing and you feel a heartbeat behind you. You slowly push upwards until you're head was sticking out from between Alice's breasts and you pull the rest of yourself out. You fall into Alice's palm and she doesn't even react, you walk up her arm and climb next to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alice, wake up my sleepy mightyena\" you say smiling at how fast you got used to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that an order?\" she mumbles in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, now get up already I want to see those beautiful eyes of yours\" you say. Alice gently moves from side to side until you see her eyes start to flutter. She slowly lifts her head and looks down at you, a smile crosses her face and she hugs you. \"It wasn't a dream\" she says happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it wasn't\" you reply. She lifts you up to her nose and waits expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's my good morning kiss?\" Alice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine if you won't give me one i'll give you one\" she says leaning over and gently kissing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine fine\" you say standing up and kissing the tip of her nose causing her to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh i'm just so happy that you were'nt a dream\" Alice says cuddling you against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we should probably go now, how long does it take you to get out of the forest?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a 5 minute walk for me from here\" Alice says placing you down on her shoulder and starts walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be really weird to explain when I get back\" you say. You remember what she said about meat before \"oh yeah um...how often do you need to eat meat and how do you get it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only about once a month, and I scavenge off dead animals\" Alice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok well I think we might be able to replace the meat part of you're diet, problem is i'm not sure if anthro pokemon like pokefood\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Alice asks. You take a bar of pokemon food you brought out of you're pocket, you unwrap it and she opens her mouth and you throw it in. She swallows the bar whole and smiles \"that was good\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then we can replace meat with pokemon food, it's a lot cheaper and a lot less....messy\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can still have some meat right?\" Alice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but it'll be kind of rare\" you say. You see her ears droop a bit, \"i'll try to get you as much meat as I can\" you say. Her ears spring back up and you actually feel a skip in her step. You soon reach the edge of the forest \"where do we go from here?\" Alice asks picking you up and holding you in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou point at a house in the distance \"that's my house\" you say. Alice starts walking and it takes her less then a minute to reach you're house. She places you down a few meters in front of the house and you're suprised you're whole family wasn't alerted by Alice's footfalls. You run inside and find you're mother and father sitting opposite you're twin brother and they're all dressed in black. They don't even look up until you speak \"why's everyone looking so glum?\" you ask. They turn and just stare at you for a bit before you get a group hug \"we thought you were dead after you didn't come out of that forest\" you're mother says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, i'm fine, although my new pokemon did help me out\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You finally got a pokemon that's wonderful, so where is it?\" you're father says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's an anthro so she's not in a pokeball\" you say as you're father examines you're belt. \"She's waiting just outside\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then have her come in\" you're father says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of hard to do\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so she's one of the larger ones, okay we'll come outside\" you're father says. You walk out the door and you can't see Alice, you look around for her and you can't see her, all you can see is a few weird looking hills covered in black and gray grass. You smile as you're mother asks \"so where is she, all I can see is that weird bunch of hills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice you mind standing up, so my family can meet you\" you yell. You laugh out loud as you're whole family stands shocked as Alice sits up, you walk over to her and say \"this is Alice the mightyena, she saved my life yesterday in that forest and agreed to be my pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" Alice says giving a little wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow....you sure know how to pick a first pokemon\" you're father says. He walks up to you and pulls you aside \"i'm glad you got a first pokemon, but how are we supposed to feed that thing, and aren't they carnivores\" he whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She likes pokefood\" you whisper back \"I threw her a pokefood bar back when we were in the forest and she hasn't objected for a while, I want to try something\" you reply. You run into the house and grab a bag of pokemon food, you fill up a large bowl with about what you feed you're families mightyena and you run outside carrying it. Alice spots you and sniffs \"is that food?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah so open up\" you say. Alice opens her mouth and much to you're families shock you jump onto her tongue and drop the whole bowl on before jumping off. She swallows the food and to you're amazment she falls sideways. \"Alice you alright?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that's more then i've eaten in a long time, i'm totally stuffed\" she says. You smile as you're hypothesis was proven true, \"hey Alice you said before that you scavenged meat off dead animals? what kind?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small rodents like squirrels and rabbits\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains it, this is gonna sound weird but Alice you're body somehow only requires the food requirements of a normal sized mightyena\" you say. \"Which means no giant food prices\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Ms.Alice where will you sleep?\" you're father asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well can't she just sleep out in the field?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure, but how are you going to make sure she doesn't get in trouble?\" you're mother asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, I sleep with her\" you say. You're mother stands there shocked \"you can't do that, she might hurt you, and it'll be cold\" she objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense mom, but I kinda already slept with her last night and it was nice and warm\" you say smiling. You're twin walks up and pats you on the shoulder \"well i'm glad you finally got a pokemon bro, but what are you gonna do with her?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I don't want to turn her into a sideshow, we could always take on the gym leaders and the pokemon league that'll keep us in the money for a while\" you say. You're twin pulls a cell phone out of his pocket. types in a number and has a quick conversation. He smiles and a minute later a limousine rolls up, a man in a buisness suit walks out of the car and stops dead in his tracks when he sees Alice, he runs over to you're twin and shakes his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't believe it's true but it is\" the man says. He turns to you \"I'm Matt Sliph, owner of Sliph Co. and I want to offer you and that Mightyena of yours jobs\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you're Mightyena will be is our spokesgirl, heck i'll even throw in a house for her\" Matt says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, for her?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will build her a house, it might take a while but it'll happen\" Matt says, you knew how powerful Sliph corp was as they developed the majority of pokeball technology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know, hey Alice how do you feel about this?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it let me be together with you, just you and me?\" she asks. You turn to the man and he nods \"yeah\" you reply. \"Well then i'm all for it\" she says. You turn to Matt and he has his hand out, you take his outstretched hand, \"you'll make sure there are no ads trying to take advantage of Alice or turn her into a monster right?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, this is a once in a lifetime opprotunity and as a buisnessman I will make sure my whole power goes to maintaining a clean image for you're pokemon\" he says. He gets into the car and it drives away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that that's settled, what are you gonna do?\" you ask you're twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess get back to work, it is a normal work day after all\" he says, he turns to Alice \"hey by any chance do you have any siblings?\" Alice shakes her head, \"ah well you win some, you lose some, and then you hit the jackpot\" he says punching you in the shoulder. You're twin walks over to a car and gets in before driving away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess until the house is built we'll be staying with you\" you say turning to you're parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but I better not hear anything weird coming from her\" you're mom says staring at Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't do anything weird\" Alice says her tail wagging a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, atleast until this house is built welcome home Alice\" you say smiling. She picks you up and cuddles you against her cheek and you cna't help but smile.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You can't believe what had happened over the past few months, Alice had become an instant celebrity once the original commercial aired. It began with a shot of you staring her down and she dives toward you, you back flip and throw a new heavy version of an anthro ball at her and it captures her. You smile as you pick the ball up and place it on you're belt before the name of the ball and the Sliph company logo comes on. As soon as people figured out you were the one in the commercials which suprisingly took a month, you're house was swarmed by people. As the months passed both you're and Alice's popularity skyrocketed, you even got a mini-series on tv that consisted of you chasing her around the globe trying to catch her, the final episode consisted of a loose adaptation of how you 2 met. By the time a year had passed you both had apparently quadrupled Sliph Co's sales and were the 2 biggest celebrities in the world (no pun intended). You wake up on the morning Mr.Sliph said that Alice's house was supposed to be finished and you sit up and you're surrounded by darkness. Alice had to start curling up around you since there was so much paparazi around, it got really annoying but you weren't complaining as it let you be close to her. You smiled to yourself the first time you \"sicced\" her on the paparazzi, \"oh man never have I seen so many grown men piss themselves\" you think laughing inwardly. You move around and scratch Alice under her chin, she moves her paws subconciously and you're able to get out. \"Ahhh start of another day, finally that house is done maybe we can get some damn privacy now\" you think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb onto Alice's head and scratch her ears for a bit \"come on sleepy, time to get up\" you whisper into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm 5 more minutes, and more pets\" she mumbles back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, geez I spoil you\" you say scratching her ears. Thankfully the paparazzi had lessened in the last week as you weren't sure how much more you could take, you're blinded for a second by a flash bulb. \"Oh son of a bitch\" you say hopping down, you quickly find the culprit a female reporter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hand it over\" you say sticking you're hand out. She reluctantly holds the camera out and you take out the memory card, \"thank you\" you say handing her a picture you had taken of you cuddled up with Alice late at night before walking back to Alice. Alice was sitting up now, woken up by the flashbulb, \"sorry that you had to be woken up like that\" you say walking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, as long as my little treat is alright\" she says lowering her head and licking you're whole right side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez I thought you knew how to control you're licking\" you say climbing up and stroking her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, but this ways more fun\" she replies. \"Master can you pet me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Alice you know I hate being called that, it's Matt\" you say moving so she can lay down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but \"oooh\"\" she slightly howls as you start petting \"calling you master just sounds better\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Matt or no pets or scratches\" you say sitting down. She picks you up and stares at you with those big doggy eyes and starts whining. \"No, no matter how much you whine or beg it's Matt or nothing\" you say smiling somewhat suprised that she still wanted to play this little game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, Matt it is\" she says putting you down on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, and you better not go back to using master tomorrow or else no pets and I mean it\" you say. You smile to yourself as you rubbed and stroked her backside, it had become a near constant battle of wills, you'd always say I mean it and for a while those eyes and whining got you to concede but then you firmed up and she had to call you Matt to get you petting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, are you comfy?\" she asks turning and smiling at you. You lay back in her fur, \"yeah i'm peachy\" you say staring up at the sky. She reaches over and pulls you up her back, \"come on get back to petting.\" You walk up to her and gently kiss her muzzle \"stop calling me master and I will, geez, even though you're my big cuddly puppy you're still so disobedient\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right i've been a naughty puppy so you need to punish me\" she says licking you and you feel her behind wiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look backwards and smile, \"nah I know of a better way\" you say. You climb onto her head and do the one thing you knew she hated, you blew into her ears. She hated it becuase it tickled so much, instantly she started giggling and as you blew again she started squirming from side to side. \"Are you going to be a good puppy from now on?\" you ask nefore blowing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....yes Matt.. just please stop\" she says between giggles and you stop blowing. She picks you up and smiles at you, \"you're a very bad trainer, exploiting you're own pokemon's weakness\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, what are you gonna do about it\" you say and she starts licking you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm\" she sighs as she licks you, she keeps it up for a minute before stopping and you wipe some of her saliva off. \"There now we're even Matt\" she says smiling nefore rubbing against you with one cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice can we stop this little back and forth, it's fun, but i'm not sure how many times the media's caught you licking me like this and tried to portray you as a monster\" you say hugging her muzzle to show you didn't think she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but you have to give me pets and scratches whenever I ask\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal, as long as you let me curl up with you whenever I ask, no more calling me Master it's Matt, and you always stay by my side\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal\" she says before lowering her muzzle and kissing and you kiss the tip of her muzzle back. You lay back and snuggle up in her stomach fur, you could almost feel her smile but you could feel her tail start excitedly wagging back and forth. You gently start stroking her fur and she wraps her hands around you covering you in her warmth. You stroke harder rewarding her for being a good puppy like she always was and she gives you a little squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt, are you glad we met?\" Alice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I can't imagine my life without you Alice\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good\" she says running one hand down you're back. You smile and you feel no resistance as you stand up, \"give me a sec i'll be right back\" you say. You run towards the house and grab Alice's favorite treat, a whole steak. You come back out and Alice runs toward you and smiles down at you her tail wagging like crazy. She goes down on all fours and moves her head forward expectantly. \"Open\" you say and she opens her mouth, you throw the steak onto her tongue and she closes her mouth and slowly chews it savoring the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh so good\" she sighs before rolling over onto her back. You climb up between her breasts and lay down, you heard Alice's breathing slow a bit and you gently rubbed her chest. \"Such a spoilt mightyena anthro you are, and I wouldn't trade you for the world, I love you Alice\" you say finally getting the balls to say it.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA'ice much to you're suprise sits up and you fall into her lap, she wraps her hands around you and you're lifted up to her muzzle \"I love you too Matt\" she says kissing you and you kiss her back. You break the kiss when you hear a car, Mr, Sliph drives up and exits the car \"sorry to interrupt you 2 but the house is done, Matt you ride with me, Alice if you'd be so kind you'll follow behind\" he says. Alice nods and puts you down, you get into the car and the driver starts the engine. You drive for a good half hour, you heard Alice behind you the whole time ,you pass through the city and then you spend another hour getting to a large forest. You spend half an hour taking a specifically cut path and you enter a clearing that could hold a small city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the place\" Mr.Sliph says stepping out, you step out and you see Alice's house is a..... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice's house seemed to be just a normal 2-story house from what you could see of it. Although it was made for Alice so it took up a large portion of the clearing. You didn't have much time to observe the outside as Alice had dropped down onto all 4s. She runs up behind you, scoops you up by the neck of you're shirt and runs through the door. Alice runs up the stairs with a purpose and she quickly identifies and heads to the bedroom. She runs inside and leaps from the floor onto the bed depositing you on the wool sheet before laying down herself. \"man I wonder how many mareep had to get sheared to make this\" you think. Alice pushes against you with her nose, \"ok Ms. Excited what do you want?\" you say turning around and facing her. Alice traps you under her palm, \"hey get off\" you say and she shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No can do, not until you agree to my demands\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demands? since when do you have demands?\" you ask although you were laughing. \"Fine let's hear em\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pet me\" she says lifting her hand and rolling onto her back. You smile and climb onto Alice's stomach, you start rubbing her furry belly and she starts to sigh and you heard her tail start whacking against the bed. You pet Alice for a good 10 minutes before stopping, \"why'd you stop\" she says raising her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get a new house and the first thing you want is me to pet you\" you say shaking you're head. \"We need to explore a bit, I mean we'll be living here from now ow\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exploring later, petting now\" Alice says pinning you to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice no, I order you to get up so we can explore the house\" you say. Alice smiles at you, \"no can do\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What i'm you're trainer\" you say. Alice lifts you up and she's smiling, \"Matt that order thing worked for a little while when we first met, no more\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, how about we explore then I pet you\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal\" Alice says standing up. You walk around the house and you find out the house has a master bath as well as the bedroom on the top floor, and on the main floor there was another bathroom, a quite sizeable kitchen and a very large living room. You smiled as Alice walked through the place, \"wow, this must have taken a looonnnggg time to build\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm worth it aren't I?\" Alice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, i'm just trying to figure out how they made the tv\" you say examining the comparative 52 inch plasma tv on the wall. Alice lays down on the couch and sighs, \"well Matt back to petting\" she says happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I don't want to\" you say, Alice turns her head and stares at you, \"what if I want the equivelant of a pet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww you feel left out is that it?\" Alice says and you nod. You see a smile form on her face, \"don't worry Matt i'm sure I can give you a good pet\" she says. Alice picks you up and lays you down on her stomach, she then gently runs her fingers over you're back and you can't help but sigh. \"Aww you like pets too don't you Matt\" Alice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'd call this more of a rub\" you say, Alice puts a bit more pressure and you sigh again \"ok fine I like pets too\" you say laying you're head down. You heard Alice giggle and she lays back, \"well this isn't so bad, it's actually fun taking care of you too\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you enjoy it\" you say grabbing one of her fingers to tell her to stop, \"so my beautiful mightyena shall I go back to petting you?\" you ask standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sweet talker\" she says knocking you over with 1 finger then stopping to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't sweet talk, I tell the truth\" you say a wide grin on you're face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine without pets for a bit\" Alice says, she pulls you up her body and smiles down at you, \"is there anything you need?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh \"i'm fine, thanks for asking though\" you say. \"So I guess since you don't take orders anymore, our little game is done?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Game? what game?\" Alice asks feigning ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come off it, you know where you call me master and I threaten to take you're pets away\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes that's right, I still have to repay you for that don't I\" she says grinning. Alice lifts you up and holds you in place seeming to think. \"Oh I know the perfect repayment\" she says, she lays out over the couch and puts you down on her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice I am not petting that\" you say pointing to her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww why not?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are some places you just don't get near, that's one of them\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying my butt isn't cute?\" Alice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? no of course it's cute but....wait a minute\" you say. You felt Alice start shaking, soon she was laughing her tail off and you had to jump onto the remaining couch space to keep from falling off her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't \"haha\" believe that \"haha\" you said that\" Alice says laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah laugh it up\" you say, \"you do have a cute butt though\" you comment. Alice stops laughing and stares at you, \"really?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but then again to me every part of you is either cute, beautiful, sexy, or a combination of the 3\" you say sitting down. Alice looks at you and smiles \"aww thanks Matt\" she says nuzzling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Alice, anything for my special mightyena\" you say hugging her nose. Alice lifts her head up leaving you dangling, \"uh Alice can you lower you're head\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I think i'll just keep you like this for a bit, in fact\" she doesn't finish instead you feel you're tongue lick you're sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't i'm ticklish\" you say, you felt Alice's tongue lick faster as you said you were ticklish. \"Alice \"haha\" stop \"haha\" I give\" you say. Alice doesn't stop, she licks you even faster, you can feel you're grip starting to loosen and you finally lose you're hold, you don't even fall as Alice had her palm right under you. \"Don't do that\" you say looking up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Alice asks looking innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You scared me, I trust you but I do not trust that couch\" you say. Alice looks down at you and holds you about her, \"oh how much do you trust me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've stuck with you this far, so with my life\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Matt\" she says cuddling just above her chest. \"Just for that, you get to sleep in here tonight\" she says dropping you right in letting her chest catch you as you fall. You look up at her \"so if I didn't say that I wouldn't get to sleep with you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, of course you'd still get to sleep with me, but\" Alice doesn't answer she stops trying to think of something to say but can't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, \"it's okay Alice, I know what you mean\" you say. Alice much to you're suprise lays forward instead of backwards surrounding you with her chest and just giving you some room to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey get off me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't wanna\" Alice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, how did I end up with such a disobedient mightyena\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so i'm disobedient am I\" Alice says lowering her head and licking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad dog, no stop \"haha\" you start laughing as Alice licks you and she had a huge smile on her face. She lets you out after a minute and you lay back into her stomach, \"geez Naughty dog\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should train me more\" Alice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, you're perfect as a somewhat naughty puppy\" you say absent-mindedly stroking her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Matt\" she says. You get up and walk to her face, you climb up and stare at her face to face, \"hey Alice I just realized something\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't taken a bath since we first met, so guess what time it is\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo I don't wanna take a bath\" she says giving you those puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh that's not gonna work, now up you go\" you say. Alice reluctantly gets up \"fine but you have to come with me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? you can easily bathe yourself\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No if I'm having a bath, you're joining me\" Alice says.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sighed, \"fine Alice whatever i'll come, but you do really need a bath\" you say. Alice nods and stands up, she carries you in her palm upstairs into the bathroom and puts you down on the counter before she starts running a bath. Thankfully as you looked around Sliph Co. had supplied all the products you needed to take care of Alice so there was a giant bottle of shampoo and other things like a brush and comb both about as big as you were. The tub was soon filled with water although it looked more like an olympic swimming pool to you. Alice turns and smiles at you \"well come on strip already\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said i'd come with you not i'd get into the water\" you say. In response Alice picks you up and drops you into the water, you obviously swim up and glare at her \"that is totally unfair\" you say as she pulls you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, now lose the clothes\" she says putting you down on a towel. You stripped out of the wet clothes and Alice picked you up and and sat in the tub before putting you down in the water, she then flipped over and sighed. \"Ahh the water's so warm\" she says, \"mmm\" you reply, you climb onto the side and coat yourself hands in the shampoo liquid, \"Alice dunk yourself\" you say and she does. You jump onto her back almost slipping off in the process and start rubbing the shampoo into her fur. It soon creates a lather and you start pretty much massaging her causing her to sigh. She starts to submerge herself \"hey hey, I need you to stay up\" you say and she pushes herself back up. It took you around 20 minutes to shampoo her hair, neck, back, and legs as well as give her paws a rub. By the end you were beat and just floated in the water. Alice turned over and slid under you coming up so you were lying on her chest, \"thanks Matt, I\u2019ve never had someone pay so much attention to me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2019re welcome Alice, your worth it\" you reply. She snuggles you into her wet fur and you sighed, thankfully you were squeaky clean as there were a few times you fell while washing Alice. She sat up and moved you onto the towel before draining the bath, she quickly towelled herself off and you got to work brushing and combing her. It wasn't hard, it wasn't like there were a lot of knots in her fur, it just took a while and was tiring. By the time you were done another 20 minutes had gone by. although Alice's fur was now silky smooth, fluffy, and practically shined in the light which brought a smile to your lips. Your clothes by were dry so you got dressed and promptly collapsed on the towel, \"aww are you tired from taking care of little ol me?\" Alice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little my butt, but yeah I actually am beat\" you reply. Alice picks you up and nuzzles you, \"thank you Matt, you take such good care of me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you\u2019re my pokemon and I love ya\" you reply patting her cheek. You just laid in her palm and she walked to the bedroom and sat down. She started to pet your back and you sighed, she lays back on the bed and curls up so she was surrounding you. You felt her continue petting your back and you petted her stomach to sort of return the favour. Alice sighs, \"I\u2019m so glad I met you Matt, everyday is fun, I\u2019m not hungry, lonely, and I\u2019m always comfortable\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really glad I met you too Alice, everyday I get to wake up to your cute smile, those beautiful eyes, and your cheery personality\" you reply. Alice gives you a squeeze and giggles \"thanks Matt\" she says and you were both startled up as you heard a doorbell. Alice sits up and picks you up laying you down on her shoulder, she walks through the hall and down to the door and opens it. She looks around and you look down and see Matt standing there, you tap Alice and she looks down. She bends down and smiles at him \"hello sir\" she says happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, how are my 2 best workers doing? You gotten used to the house yet?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we have actually, thanks sir\" you reply. He nods and walks up \"so do you 2 know about the commercial we're supposed to shoot in an hour?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no\" you reply looking at Alice and she shrugs almost knocking you off. Matt smiles \"well then i'm here to pick you up, now come on\" he says. Alice puts you down and you follow him to his car, he lets you in first and then gets in. Alice taps on the top of the car once your in \"actually have a reason to chase this car\" she says jokingly. You stick your head out and smile at her, \"yeah yeah, it's not like you'll have to work hard to follow\" you reply. Matt pulls you back in and the car's started. Alice followed the car dilligently, the commercial film site seemed to be in the city as that was where the car was going. It was pretty funny at the 2 red lights the car had to stop at as Alice followed right behind the car so you heard the comments such as \"mommy look it's a giant puppy.\" The car headed to the industrial sector of the city and stopped in front of a warehouse, Matt left the car and you followed him into the building as well as Alice although she had to pretty much crawl to get through the door. You tapped Matt on the shoulder \"so uh what kind of commercial is it this time, can't be another pokeball commercial can it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, you 2 are so famous that you are 2 of the most recognizable faces in the whole world, heck some of the legendaries are less known then you 2\" he says. You laughed \"that can't be true\" you say. \"Ok it's not, but you 2 are still really big, so we thought you should have some products of your own\" Matt says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's the product?\" you ask. Matt grabs what looked like a sleeping bag but it had the colors of a mightyena and seemed to be covered in fur, \"uh...it's a sleeping bag\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no it's called the Mightyena's hug, it's supposed to be like what you do every night\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I do every night?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, sleep with Alice curled up around you, people find that really cute, so we thought they might like to try it themselves\" Matt says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't real fur is it?\"Alice asks sounding quite peeved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, it's actually made out of mareep wool we just dyed it and spread it out to make it look like fur\" Matt says. Alice glares at him and he looks at her \"look Sliph is known for it's good treatment of pokemon, we'd never hurt a mightyena just to make a product\" he says. Alice nods, \"so uh how's this commercial work?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you just need to get into it and then we'll have Alice wrap around you and you'll say I can't tell the difference\" Matt says. You climb into the thing but you could easily tell the difference, it just felt weird and no way near as comforting as Alice was when she wrapped around you. \"Matt i'm not sure if I can say that, there is a difference, Alice is a million times better, nothing can make me as comfy or feel as safe as her surrounding me\" you say getting out of the \"hug\". Matt sighs and looks at you, \"I knew you were gonna say that, can you still say it, I mean no one else knows how wonderful Alice's hugs are\" he continues. You look up at Alice, \"you ok with that, it just well feels like i'm lying, no I am lying\" you say looking at Matt. He sighs and Alice pushes against you \"you should do it, I mean i'd much rather have people just buy a mightyena and sleep with it near them, but we're not things so if this is the closest they can get, it's ok\" Alice says. You nod and the commercial went well although your acting was a bit forced. Afterwords Alice gave you a hug and you just sat there together for a bit which was a bit awkward for everyone else. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You heard a cough and looked down at Matt, \"not to break up the love-fest between you 2 but do you want to have lunch?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Alice and she smiles down at you \"it's your choice\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped and thought about it for a few seconds and looked down at Matt \"sorry but I think we'll have to decline. I mean if we went out with you there'd be tons of paprazzi, we'll just have lunch at home\" you reply. Matt sighs but nods and Alice puts you down so she can crawl out of the warehouse. You walk out of the warehouse and she picks you up and puts you down on her shoulder and starts walking back. People thankfully gave her a wide berth, parents held back children that wanted to run up and pet her, and really everyone just kept their distance which was good for you. Alice just barely fit the streets though so she still had to be careful, it took you a bit longer to get home as like before Alice stopped at red lights, even though she was easily the biggest piece of traffic on the road. Finally you reached home without incident which was always a good thing and Alice pushed the door open, walked inside and sat down on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hand reached up and you jumped down onto it and she lowered you into her lap, \"hey Matt, how did that sleeping bag feel?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nowhere close to as good as your hugs\" you reply, Alice lifted you up and gently hugged you in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does that mean you lied?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" you reply holding your head down a bit and you got a light lick in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I am one of a kind after all\" Alice says. You nodded and sat back in her hand just content to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Alice spoke up \"weren't we supposed to have lunch?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" you reply, she stands up and walks over into the kitchen, placing you down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever your hungry for, I really don't mind\" you reply. Alice sighs and starts rooting around the fridge, she finally pulls out 2 steaks which she held between 2 fingers, you still couldn't believe that all she needed to eat was what a normal mightyena might eat. \"I still can't believe that's all you need to eat, you don't sneak snacks when I'm not looking are you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never\" she replies sounding almost offended \"a girl has to watch what she eats, this figure doesn't just take care of it self\" Alice says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah and a few grams of fat totally affect a girl who weighs more then a ton\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that?\" Alice says sounding almost shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, to put it bluntly you are a very.....tall Mightyena, your as big as most skyscrapers\" you say. Alice looks at you for a second and sits down, just reaching over to transfer the steaks to a giant frying pan which always sat on the stove and flick it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt, do you think I'm fat?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No your not fat, I mean sure you weigh more then any other girl, but that's due to your size, and I love every inch of you from the tips of your ears to the soles of your paws\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought a smile onto Alice's muzzle and she reached over and moved you closer to her, \"what was that? I didn't hear you correctly\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile slightly \"I said, I love you from the tops of your cute ears to the very soles of your wonderful paws\" you say. This time a giant smile spreads from ear to ear on Alice's face and she leans over and kisses you gently. You just let her kiss you until a smell reaches your nose, you sniff and quickly look over to the stove, \"um...Alice, the steaks\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh\" she says, she reaches over spearing the steaks on a claw and shutting off the stove, she quickly transfers them to a plate and holds her hand and whimpers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burn yourself?\" you ask, she nods and you can't help but smile. Alice gets up and holds her hand under cold water like your supposed to do when you burn yourself, then she sits down and holds it out for you, mainly the finger with the claw she used to spear the steaks. You slowly walk up and lift her finger up and kiss the tip, making sure that you don't spear yourself on her claw. Alice giggles \"thank you Matt\" she says, you smile up at her \"no problem\" you reply. Alice moved your steak off the plate and handed it you while she picked up her own, the 2 of you dug into the steaks and both were devoured in less than a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice picked up the plate and took all of 5 seconds to clean it before putting it away, she lowers a hand and you climb on, Alice moves over to the couch and just lays out \"hey Matt, what do you think it would be like if we never became famous?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we'd probably have a few more problems\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? Like what\" Alice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no offense but just managing your um....extras, would be a real problem\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice nods \"well then it's a good thing we became famous then\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'd need a pooper scooper bigger then I am otherwise\" you say. Alice seems to get an image of that in her mind as she giggles and lifts you up placing you down on her stomach. Without needing to be told you started to pet her stomach and you got a soft contented sigh from Alice as a response. You decided to just lay out on her stomach since that was more comfortable then sitting and you didn't need to bend over to pet her that way. Her fur was as fluffy and comfy as ever and her low growls and contented sighs served as calming background noise. It was very hard but you somehow managed to keep yourself from falling asleep, After what felt like 10 minutes you sat up and looked over at Alice, you could tell she was asleep from the slow steady breathing and the fact that her chest and you rose and fell at a very rythmic pace. Sighing since you didn't have much else to do you stood up and moved over to the top of the couch. You just sat there and watched as Alice slept, she was quite cute and you just sat there for almost half an hour as she slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly and groggily got up after that half hour and seeming to not feel you she started to look around frantically \"hey Alice, I'm over here\" you say. She turns her head and you were scooped up and hugged to her cheek \"don't do that, you really scared me\" she says. You gently stroked her cheek \"what was there to be afraid of\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I thought you'd left me\" she says her voice cracking for a second. You hug her cheek and softly coo as you speak \"Alice I'd never leave you, your my lovely Mightyena, I'll leave you the same time I cut off my own arm\" you say. You were moved to in front of her and you got a tongue licking and then a quite long kiss from Alice. She laid back on the couch a large smile on her face as she hugged you to her. \"I'm going to have another nap, and this time your not going anywhere\" she says. You sigh making it seem like it was a big deal but just simply got comfy in her grasp. Alice's grip tightened slightly around you and the two of you fell asleep for a not exactly well-deserved but very comfy and restful nap.</span></div></div>",

The place was not a very comfortable cave system, every stalactite dripped water as well as there were tons of zubat. They were everwhere; in the tops of the caves, flying around. Some of the zubat were anthros and a few even came up and talked to you, but well they were zubats and nobody likes zubats simply because of how annoying they were. You walked deeper and deeper into the caves until a zubat anthro came down and landed in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" you reply walking past her. She flies up beside you \"so whatcha doing here?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for pokemon\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New trainer?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just never got my first and technicalities have stopped me from getting it so i've gotta catch my first\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever thought about a zubat?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense but nearly everyone and their mother has atleast one zubat, the only more caught pokemon is rattata\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then what are you doing here?\" she asks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old man told me there was a pretty rare pokemon here, even if it's something like a rhyhorn it'd be a pretty good first\" you say still walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm I think I might know what he's talking about\" the zubat anthro says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? you mind showing me?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but ya gotta catch me first\" she says flying around you in circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense but I thought pokemon didn't want to be caught\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well I do\" she says flying right up into you're face and you tap a ball on her head. It drops to the ground and moves for a bit before giving off an audible ping. You pick it up and let the zubat girl out, \"ok now show me this pokemon\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to name me first\" she says swaying from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, how about Brianna\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds perfect\" she says smiling, \"just follow me and i'll show you the pokemon\" she says taking off. You follow her deeper and deeper into the cave, you walk for 10, 20, 30, minutes before you start hearing a low rumbling sound. \"What the hell is that?\" you ask Brianna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, it just means we're getting closer and closer\" she says still flying. You walk behind her till you both enter a huge section of the cave. The ceiling had to be 2000ft high and there was an equally large pathway going off on the other side. Laying against one side of the wall was a pokemon, you couldn't really tell what kind it was as you looked at it's front but when it turned over and you saw it's blue and red back you instantly recognized it as a typhlosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god that's perfect\" you yell and the pokemon stirs and wakes up, it turns to look at you and you are soon staring at a very agitated looking female</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So human why have you woken me?\" the typhlosion says. You don't answer for a few seconds at she was absolutely gorgeous, there was a mane of orange and yellow hair that looked like a fire on the back of her hair with wavy blue locks on the sides. Her chest had to be a pair of F-cups but that didn't detract from her figure. Her body was a little larger but you could tell if was all muscle under the fur of her stomach and legs as her arms were quite slim. Her most beautiful feature was her face as it went up into a cute set of ears and a really cute muzzle. You snap yourself out of the daze you were in as you hear her growl \"I...I came here to catch some pokemon\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" the typhlosion says \"well I haven't had a challenger in a while this might be a bit fun\" she says standing up and you truly see just how tall she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't think that's possible, all I have is this zubat\" you say indicating Brianna \"and well one of you're flamethrowers would fry her to a crisp\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point, tell you what, you said you're looking for pokemon right\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well how about you take me on, win and you get me as a pokemon\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I lose?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you'll either die or become my servant as recompense for disturbing me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anyway I can just you know leave and never see you again?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, what's the challenge\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pick\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine a mental challenge, you give me a riddle to solve, and if I do, I ask you one, this continues until one of us can't answer\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, what has 4 legs in the morning, 2 in the afternoon, and 3 at night?\" the typhlosion asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, human beings\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright what's the beginning of every death and the end of every world?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm....\" she stands there and thinks for a minute and then sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I concede human, you win\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, the answer's the letter d\" you say smiling. You see the flames on her back flare up and she drops onto all fours and stares at you \"you tricked me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what a riddle contest is\" you say trying to stand you're ground. She stares at you for a few more seconds before the flames subside and she sighs, \"fine throw one of those orbs you humans carry and catch me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't\" you say walking up with Brianna next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ball made for anthromorphic pokemon was made for one of you're size\" you say sitting in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well then there's no obligation to uphold my side of the bargain\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None except you're honor\" you say as she stares at you. \"You have a name?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute, it fits you\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So human aren't you scared of me\" Cynthia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit, but then again i've spent 18 years without a pokemon and now i've got 2 so i'm pretty happy and i'm not letting a little fear stop me\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do we just call you trainer?\" Brianna asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just Matt is fine\" you say reaching forward and stopping just over Cynthia's muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you hesitating?\" Cynthia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm not sure if it's ok to pet you\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am you're pokemon so it's alright\" Cynthia says in a soothing voice. You gently rub the soft fur on her muzzle and she stares up at you with her cute eyes, \"aren't you worried about my size?\" Cynthia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I think the more of you to love the better\" you say smiling. \"You two both look great\" you say giving Brianna a once over. She was pretty small in the chest area but her slim figure and long sexy legs made up for it, that and the fact she had wings on her back not those arm-wing things some anthro pokeon ended up with. \"So Cynthia how do you eat, you know at you're size?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't require anymore food then a normal typhlosion I just exploded to this size one year\" she says. You can't help but glance at Cynthia's chest every so often and she finally catches you \"hmmmm do you want to come closer, maybe snuggle up?\" she asks parting her chest and staring at you, a cute smile on her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\u2026\u2026I couldn't....I mean we just met and all\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now, we both know you want to, besides it's not like I mind\" Cynthia says. You're pushed forward by Brianna who dives forward after you. You land in Cynthia's chest and as you turn over Brianna lands on you. \"See now isn't this comfy\" Cynthia says engulfing the two of you in her breasts and holding them together with one arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmmm I like being this close to you Matt\" Brianna says snuggling against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what's gotten into you 2\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All we female pokemon want is to be loved\" Cynthia says squeezing her chest together a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, but isn't this a bit much\" you say trying to wiggle out but Brianna holds you in place while Cynthia gently pushes you back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt it's alright, we may have just met, but I like you already\" Cynthia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah prove it\" you say and within she had picked you up and kissed you before blowing a small heart shaped flamethrower into the air. \"Happy now?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" you reply and she snuggles you back in. Brianna wraps herself around you and Cynthia falls asleep trapping you both in her chest, considering you couldn't move you opted to just go to sleep as well. You open you're eyes to see Cynthia smiling down at you, much to you're suprise she leans down and licks you're whole body. Even more suprising was the fact that it felt like you were surrounded by a large wet waterbottle not the burning heat you expected. She smiles as she lifts her head and you feel Brianna hug herself into you're side. \"morning\" she mumbles still clinging to you're side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know it's morning, we're in a giant cave\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look up\" Cynthia says and you're just able to see a pinprick of light come from the top of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we doing today Matt?\" Cynthia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't know, I mean I want to show you 2 off but there's the whole size problem, I mean me and Brianna are able to use the area between you're chest as a bed and it could still fit a good few people\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear i'll be really careful\" Cynthia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but you move when I tell you to and stop instantly on cue, can you do that?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" Cynthia replies. You put Brianna back into her ball and Cynthia gently stands up transferring you to one of her palms. She walks out the cave through the other more her sized entrance and you find yourself on the whole other side of the cave system. \"The city I live in is in that direction\" you say pointing right behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright well then it's kind of the long way, should take us 10 minutes\" Cynthia says happily. She walks through the forest and much to you're suprise what you though were tracks created by huge machines were actually created by Cynthia walking through the forest. She walked very carefully as not to disturb the pokemon in the forest too much. As she promised you reached the other side of the cave in 10 minutes and you let Brianna out of her pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you go scout ahead?\" you ask and she nods before flying off. Brianna comes back in a few minutes, there's a crowd of people waiting outside the forest limits all looking somewhat scared and with their pokemon out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Cynthia can you put me down?\" you ask. She nods and places you on the ground, You ran ahead and it took you a minute to reach the clearing where the whole town was waiting. A man with about 6 different pokemon runs up and pulls you towards him \"come on kid there''s something over there\" he says. You pull back, \"chill it's just my pokemon\" you say, the man stares at you for a second and begins to laugh, \"you've gotta be kidding me, a pokemon would have to be like a thousand feet tall to make that much noise\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia, come here\" you yell. Everyone freezes as the ground starts to shake a bit and you can hear a tree or 2 crashing to the ground, \"note to self tell her to watch her step, like a lot\" you think. The man who grabbed you stands there in shock as it takes only a few seconds for Cynthia to walk up, she bends over and pokes you're back, \"you called\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wanted everyone to meet you\" you say walking up and petting her muzzle as Brianna lands beside you. Turning around you say, \"everyone i'd like you to meet my second pokemon Cynthia, Brianna the Zubat to my right is my first\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was eerily quiet until someone asks, \"she doesn't eat meat right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she did, but we can just substitue it with pokefood, and no before anyone says it she doesn't eat people\" you say. Brinna gave off a small whimper behind you, \"they actually think i'd eat them?\" she whispers to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hope not but i'm just telling them if they do\" you reply rubbing her cheek to get her to calm down. The man from before steps forward, \"she's harmless right?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go up and pet her and see for yourself\" you reply stopping to think for a second, \"but be sure to ask her if it's ok. Cynthia by now was lying out on her stomach with her feet gently pressing against 2 trees. The man slowly walks up, \"um...can I pet you?\" he asks probably not used to asking. Cynthia nods and moves onto her side which suprised you, the man walks up and slowly starts petting her stomach, Cynthia sighed and fully rolled over onto her back thankfully without damaging anything. The man continued rubbing her side, and she started sighing, you climbed up onto her stomach and just sat there, \"anyone else who wants to pet her can, but be sure to ask first\" you say. Soon the whole town was petting some part of Cynthia except her chest and nether regions. Brianna flew up beside you and by now Cynthia was pretty much purring if you could call it that, Brianna grabbed you're arm and hugged you, \"hey since Cynthia's getting all the attention can you pet my head?\" she asks. You nodded and started to pet her head, Brianna sighed and snuggled close, \"i'm so glad you caught me\" she says. \"Me too\" you reply, you get up after a few minutes, \"ok that's enough\" you say and thankfully everyone seemed to have gotten used to Cynthia in these few minutes and stopped backing up. You walked across her body to her face, \"hey Cynthia you ok?\" you ask. She didn't respond she was in complete bliss as she had pretty much just gotten a fully body massage but every part happened at the same time. Finally she's able to lift her head, \"i'm...i'm ok\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez maybe I should just let the whole town take care of you, you really seemed to be enjoying that\" you say sitting down. You were thrown backwards and you landed in her lap as she quickly sat up, she looked down at you sternly, \"what...what'd I say\" you ask sitting up. Cynthia stares down at you for a bit before picking you up, before you knew what was happening she had opened her mouth and thrown you in, you landed on her tongue and she shut her mouth. You froze in fear and her tongue wrapped around you and started rolling you around...almost like she was tasting you or acquiring you're scent, you were suprised as it not only felt like you were rolling but also that Cynthia was rolling around. She opened her mouth after about 5 seconds and you fell out onto the ground, she looked down at you and you turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" you yell at her, she moves her head forward and looks at you, \"master\" she says before gently rubbing against you. You were confused for a second till the smell hit you, you smelt like slightly charred wood, \"I have claimed you as my own just as you have claimed me as you're own\" Cynthia says. Brianna flies up, \"hey what about me\" she says, thankfully everyone was just watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you just mark me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, believe me that was a lot more pleasent then the alternative\" Cynthia says, you were startled as Brianna grabs you and bites you're neck before letting go, \"there now you have my bite mark\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww.... thanks I guess\" you say. Everyone was now staring at the 3 of you, \"they're all crazy let's get em\" someone yells. Cynthia growls and stands up, but you step in front of her, \"look all I want to do is be able to take my pokemon home and live in peace, is that ok?\" you ask. There was muttering through the group before the village elder, a spindly old man with white hair walks up to you. He looks up at Cynthia and Brianna, \"how long have you 3 known each other?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Less than a day, maybe a day\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirecting the next question at Brianna and Cynthia, \"do you 2 trust this man?\" he asks. They both nod and Cynthia gives you a quick lick for reassurance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I see no problem, although Matt why don't you take the old Miller estate, there's plenty of room and easily enough room for Cynthia\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..but I thought we were saving that for someone who deserved it\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and the person who's able to tame a 1000ft typhlosion isn't special?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't tame her, I beat her at a riddle contest, with the riddle you taught me\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder chuckles, \"good I was wondering if someone would finally find use for that old riddle, never the less the estate is yours, although we'll be expecting you're help with a few projects\" he says smiling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as it doesn't hurt or degrade my pokemon you have a deal\" you say. The elder nodded, \"welcome to the village you 2 this kid's kind of stupid but he's got a big heart he'll take care of you well\" he says to Brianna and Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, i'm really not sure if that's a compliment or an insult\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both\" the elder replies chuckling before hobbling away. Cynthia gently picks you up and rubs you against her cheek, \"sorry for ya know having to stick you in my mouth thing\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the alternative was what I think it was, apology accepted\" you reply. The group parts to let you through and you guide Cynthia to the miller estate with Brianna happily following. The old miller Estate was huge with about 5 acres of land surrounding it and a quite nice 2 story house in the center. It wasn't anything extravegant but it had 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a living, kitchen and even a porch. You had always wished to live there as a kid as you imagined just riding on the back of a rapidash over the property. Cynthia walks to the back of the property and lays down in the grass, \"ahh now this is a nice place, although what do I do if it rains?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I mean couldn't you just like flamethrower the clouds away or something?\" you ask jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah this place needs rain, oh well i'll just let my fur burn and it'll turn the rain to steam\" Cynthia says.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You just laid around for a bit, Brianna wanted to have you fly with her, by which she meant carry you around while she flew but you had to decline since well you honestly weren't sure how her small wings could lift her up yet alone both of you. Suddenly you hear the sound of screeching tires and you run around to the front of the house with Brianna in tow while Cynthia just sits up and looks over the house. You were surprised at what you saw sitting on the road outside the house, there was what looked to be a trailer truck like the ones that carry the produce to stores as well as a limo. Out of the limo steps a very short man with a gigantic bald spot in the center of his head and he was wearing a business suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man walks right up to you and shakes your hand \"pleasure to meet you, I am Zacharius Sliph and I heard you own a very.....unique typhlosion\" he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia there's a man here to see you\" you shout, She just stands up and steps over the house her paw landing right behind you. Mr. Sliph just looked up shocked \"wow there really is a typhlosion that big\" he says the look on his face almost making you fall over in fits of laughter. Mr. Sliph composes himself and walks over to the truck and lifts up the back and this time it was you was left gaping. Every inch of the van was filled with dollar bills \"they're all 100s, i'd prove it but it's kind of hard to move them\" he says. You were left entirely speechless, Mr. Sliph walks up and smiles \"i'm glad my offer seems to be going over so well, so do we have a deal, you'll trade me that typhlosion and I'll give you the money, think of what you can buy with it\" he says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what to do, every one of your dreams could probably be fulfilled with all that money.....except having Cynthia by your side. You look Mr. Sliph in the eye and say \"no deal sir, Cynthia's worth more to me then all the money in the world.\" Mr. Sliph glares at you angrily then sighs \"son you really seem to love that pokemon so I won't force your hand, although if you ever need a job come find me\" he says before getting into the limo and it and the truck drive off. You were pulled backwards and warm fur covered flesh surrounded you as well as something warm and wet pressed against your back. Cynthia happily cuddled you in her chest and she licked your back for a good minute before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh Matt thank you, thank you, you are the nicest trainer ever\" she say pushing you further and further into her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't just abandon you now could I, what kind of trainer would that make me\" you reply petting the wall surrounding you. Cynthia licks you again and turns over hugging her chest so it compacted around you sealing you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never letting you go Matt, not now, not ever\" she says happily rolling from side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what about me\" Brianna says fluttering over the 2 of you. Cynthia opens her arms for a second and Brianna dive bombs in so she's face to to face with you before the walls of flesh close around the both of you. \"Hehe if I didn't know that we were laying in Cynthia's chest this would be pretty romantic\" Brianna says moving up and gently kissing you. You slowly returned the kiss and the walls moved a bit so you could move your arms and wrap them around her. You weren't sure why Cynthia was letting you do this but you weren't going to complain. You gently move the hair out of Brianna eyes and you can finally see them, she had beautiful purple eyes that stared into yours lovingly and she kissed harder and harder. You felt her tongue enter your mouth and start to explore. It was strange as you honestly expected an iron taste as she was a bat but you didn't really taste anything. Finally after a minute the kiss broke and Brianna just snuggles her head into your shoulder. Even though this was the second time in 2 days you did this you felt asleep like that with Cynthia's and Brianna's bodies wrapped around you, there was just no greater feeling of warmth and security then what those 2 gave you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up slowly, somehow you as well as Brianna and Cynthia had slept through the rest of the evening as well as the night, thankfully it didn't rain as the three of you were asleep. You slowly removed yourself from Brianna's hug and you smiled as she whispered \"I love you master\" and laid her head down where yours had been. It took a bit of doing but you were finally able to pull yourself out of the fleshy prison Cynthia had created. You looked at her sleeping face and you couldn't help but smile, even though she took up the whole front yard she still looked cute and honestly kind of vulnerable while sleeping. You walked up over her body and stood on tip toes near one of her ears. \"Cynthia, come on sexy get up\" you whisper. Cynthia gently stirs, you hoped it would wake Brianna up as well as you knew if she woke up first you'd probably be stuck in Cynthia's cleavage for a whole week as Brianna wouldn't want to let go of you. Cynthia sighed and gave off a murmur \"little master, safe forever\" she mumbles in her sleep. You couldn't help but smile and gently stroked her cheek \"come on beautiful get up\" you whisper again into her ear. She stirs and her eyes open, her head turns so she's smiling at you \"good morning master\" she says sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Cynthia\" you reply, she reaches over and gently pushes you closer and holding you between palm and muzzle she gently kisses you for a second. You honestly didn't want the kiss to break as quickly as it did as her lips were so soft and warm, you looked up at her and actually gave off a small whimper \"could you....kiss me again?\" you ask Cynthia. She smiles at you gently and kisses you again gently pushing you against her paw her tongue even snuck out for a little bit and you stroked the warm wet surface, this kiss lasted around 5 minutes before it broke and Cynthia smiles at you \"is that better master?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really like having them call you master but they seemed to like it so you nodded \"thanks Cynthia\" you reply. She nods and starts feeling around in her cleavage before she pulls out a yawning Brianna and places her down on the ground near you, She sits up as Brianna walks up and pecks you on the cheek \"good morning master\" she says hugging you tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Brianna\" you reply gently petting her head. This time Cynthia whimpers and she lifts you up and puts you down on her head \"me too please\" she says. You nod and get to work stroking and petting your beautiful typhlosions head spending extra time on her ears as she seemed to really enjoy having them scratched. Finally she pulls you down and gives you a big lick \"thank you master\" she says. You pet her nose \"anything for my girls\" you say getting a smile out of her and Brianna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna flies over and just hovers in front of you \"oooh you said anything, are you sure about that?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod \"anything\" you reply and she smiles, \"although can we save the requests till after breakfast\" you say. </span></div></div>",

I turn my head as I heard some rustling in the bushes, and saw a anthro braxien come out. I was a little disappointed she was small only 5 foot 2 with no curves to speak of. Some anthro pokemon are huge and busty growing into the hundreds. She looked at me with her bright eyes and started blushing with a face full of glee.<br>\r\n\"Your a human aren't ya? I never seen one come here no big ones around here in fact I am the biggest anthro here.\" She said<br>\r\n\"Well your still a anthro and a cute one at that and are you positive your the biggest one. how many more anthro are there here.\"<br>\r\n\"I think I know myself and my friends and other then me there are five more anthros here and they are all close friends of mine. Well what are you here for?\"<br>\r\n\"I heard there are anthro here and came to look for one, I spent a lot of money to get one pokeball to catch just one.\" I said taking the pokeball out.<br>\r\n\"Well we can be panthers if you want me, I may not look like much but, I can just tell will make a great team.\"</span></div></div>",

You're pretty deep into the forest, you must be tired and could meet my friend we were planning to do something special tomorrow.\" and then still in my arms she leaned in and licked my face and kissed me, and jumped out of my arms. I heard anthro grow close to their trainers very fast, I'm kind of getting worried how close this little fox will get. \"By the way you can call me Wix.\" She said skipping off into the woods. \"Come on slowpoke or you will be left behind, my cabin is this way.\" Wix said calling me to her. During the walk I tried to put her back into her ball, but she keep coming back out \"Don't worry I'll go back in the ball and be a good girl when where around more humans, but since we're here I want to be out while I'm at home, who knows when next i'll be here.\" Wix said.  After about 20 minutes of walking we got to a small wooden cabin in the woods.<br>\r\n\"So this is where you live Wix.\"<br>\r\n\"Yup my home and now yours I guess when ever you want to use it.\" She said winking at me as she opened up the door. It was a small cabin with just four rooms a bedroom a livingroom with a open kitchen a guestroom and a bathroom.\"They brought it.\" Wix screamed with glee as she picked up a pitcher of clear water from the kitchen. \"My friend must of brought it while I was away.\"<br>\r\n\"What is it you seem happy to have that water.\"<br>\r\n\"OH nothing just something to put in my bathwater to help my skin, so how do you like my house and me so far.\" She said trying to change the subject.<br>\r\n\"Well your house is cozy and your really cute and fun to be around.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, hey do you mind if I call you honey.\" She said putting the pitcher down and jumping back into my arms, but this time as she kisses me she sticks her tongue down my mouth and jumps back down.<br>\r\n\"Well I guess.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks honey.\" she saids smiling.<br>\r\nWe talked for a few hours talking about ourselves like how she loves fighting, running and eating. <br>\r\n\"Well its getting late I should get freshen up and take a bath and its kind of cute to hear I was your first kiss.\" She say winking at me as she grabs some PJ's and the pitcher to her bathroom. A while passed till I heard the door open.<br>\r\n\"Sorry it took me so long had trouble putting this on.\" My jaw droped as a saw her. Wix Grew a foot now making her Six foot two making her taller then me. With her breast growing from a smaller A cup to a full C cup with a ass grown to match. Wix starts to walk to me and pins me to the wall breasts first causing a button to come undone causing her to show some of her new cleavage to show as I look down. Wix then grabs my hand and then places it on her ass. I had to look up to her now She's four inches taller then me.<br>\r\n\"How do you like me now Honey.\" She says rubbing her breasts on me feeling her hard nipples and soft ass.<br>\r\n\"What happen to you Wix.\"</span></div></div>",

She weighed a ton now' but as I got a good grip on her I noticed my hands was cupping her ass, I can feel her fur on her butt since her bottoms has small holes because of her growing bottom. With a lot of effort i lefted her and brought her to her bed and layed her down. As I started to walk away Wix grabed me and used me as a body pillow to sleep with. No no no honey we need to rase some friendship between areselfs.\" Feeling her breast pressed into the back of my head I drifted off to sleep. \" Morning honey i made breakfast come eat.\" I came to eat something and saw Wix was back in her normal outfit witch grew with her. \"After we eat i need to put on my swimsuit and  meet my friend at the spring to grow some more.\" The swimsuit she had was a plain navy blue one piece swimsuit. She went to her room to put it on.

Wix and roxy entering the water and start treading water. as soon as they entered the water they started growing and fast. growing about a inch every another second. At the 7 foot mark Roxy tackled Wix and Draged her under water, After about 20 second under the water I started to get worried till a huge splash from the water happen as the two now giant Pokegirls came up.<br>\r\n \" Stop Roxy I nearly drowned.\" Said the now 20 foot Wix to the 18 foot Roxy. They Where both still treading water but I can still see there huge growing Breasts Wix had to be a H cup by now and Roxy a G cup and shredded swimsuit. Now they where growing even faster about a foot every 5 second, Plus I cant tell about the rear but their boobs are growing faster then the rest of their bodies. \" Come on Roxy if you wanted to drag me under let see who can get to the bottom first see you soon my little honey.\" Wix said as she started swimming towed Roxy and pressing her bare growing tits into Roxy's slightly smaller growing bare tits to show of to me that I was still hers as she pressed into her harder.<br>\r\n \"Fine and fair Wix lets go on.\" And both of them disappeared into the water. A little time pasted and a giant head emerged from the water, it was Wix and Roxy the where both 50 feet tall at this point and from how much they where rising up they must be growing 2 to 3 feet a every second and its getting faster. 'What we didn't swim up.\" <br>\r\n\"No Wix Your Just huge now.\" I said  As the girls starting raising higher something I didn't notice before hand the water level was lowing as they grew. Roxy Started now walking in the deep water behind Wix and grabbed her boobs that where now at water level and as big as her head with Roxy not that far behind.<br>\r\n\"Come on Wix where the same size now but your girls just so huge.\" Roxy said has she started fondling Wix growing breasts bouncing them up and down into the water as their whole bodies grow lager and  lager at a faster rate. Roxy started having a harder time grabbing her boobs as Wix boobs stopped be sizes that can be measured in cup sizes and reached the size of volleyballs and Roxy's became slightly larger then her head and pressing into Wix's back pushing her away as they both grew. As the pokegirls grew and the water level lower I could see more of their body and how they developed as they grow. I could start to see their abs now, Wix had a smooth belly and a four pack and a fit  body, while Roxy was toned with a six pack and some biceps. More and more of them showed up I could see their widening hips and ass. Wix also had Roxy beat and that area to with hips wider then her shoulder and a big growing bubble butt giving her the softest seat where ever she goes, But like with her breasts Roxy was not that far behind with strong thick leg on both of them. At this point the water was at their knees giving me I good look a Wix pussy. Roxy was having trouble lifting Wix breasts when they reached basketball size and Roxy grew to larger then a fully pumped up volleyball close to popping causing her to push Wix into the water face or rack first.<br>\r\n\"Ow that hurt Roxy' As Wix tried to pick herself up from the water its was disappearing and fast as Wix body expanded and all ways one last time as the last drop of water disappeared. Wix finally picked herself up and she was a bigger then Roxy now, Roxy only reached her shoulders. I looked them Wix was 150 feet tall with breasts as big as basketball with hips wider then her shoulders and a huge ass and firm legs. Roxy was 125 feet tall with Breasts in-between volleyball and basketball with hides as wide as her shoulder and a toned body with a sexy six pack. Wix then bend down picked me up and planted a kiss that toke up my whole body. 'I love you honey.' Wix said as she planted me in her cleavage.                       </span></div></div>",

These owners tell rumors of what happened to past travelers where they never come back after their first trip. Not believing on their credibility, you pursue this new piece of farmland for you to call home and be connected to nature. Though you may be no trainer, you have hopes of meeting your first partner pokemon one day. Opening your GPS through your phone, you set the map and set<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you guide your boat to this northern current many pokepelago owners had been avoiding, thick whit fog surrounds your boat.<i> \"My. This fog, can't see so well.\"</i> Checking on the sail, a medium gust of wind blows your boat further north. Amidst the fear of being stuck on the ocean surface, there is this unexplained tension and anticipation on where you will be brought. Looking at the sea, you see illuminating lights most likely coming from the antenna of the chinchou. Uncertain if these things could be friendly or not, you take a moment to pray for safety. With a breath of hope, you guide the sail following the chinchous sailing you in various current pathways.10 minutes past, the fog quickly disappears and the skies open with a bit of clouds on the sky. Finally, you come across an island with two hills and a mountain on a medium island. <i>\"Whoa. What the ... where am I?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the winds continue to bring your boat to the shore, the tropical breeze and the scent of the trees hits your nose easing out the stress you obtained from the sailing. Upon getting down from the boat ad landing on the sandy beach, a giant shadow covers your view of the sky. Lo and behold, you find yourself under the presence of a Ribombee gliding down next to you. Unlike the few Ribombees you saw at Ula-Ula Island, this ribombee you see is 9 times bigger in height and possibly 12 times heavier, \"bbbeee. Hello. Hello young human...\"</span></div></div>",

Last thing is I have gotten rid of the Character name Matt as one story line has made me think its time to let others pick the name, if you want to keep using it thats fine as I made this a 8 years ago.
