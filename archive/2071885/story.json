But I\u2019ve really been here 20 minutes waiting for an unusual date. At a place he picked, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than a few of my ex-boyfriends would describe the wood panelling in this Applebee\u2019s as hideous (and be right about it) but from my vantage point at the central bar, the view is fantastic. At my 3 o\u2019clock is a booth with two extra frat guys stuffed in. They might have fit comfortably, 30 lbs ago, but that only applies to the skinny redhead, wedged between two chubby blondes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA table in the back has just two guys -- and 20 plates. The endless app special is truly a magical thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender brings me my second drink -- a shot of scotch on the rocks -- and I start to wonder why I\u2019m still here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep my Grindr account active out of\u2026 I don\u2019t know, social obligation? Gun to my head, I honestly couldn\u2019t put a reason to it. I\u2019m a Grommr guy when I can, Growlr when I have to. I love guys who love carbs. I love to cook a man steak and watch him savor it. To cook a man a stack of pancakes in the morning and have him eat faster than I can get them off the griddle is my idea of an ultimate breakfast. I can NOT get enough of a good belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I got the telltale ding of a Grindr message one day and opened it up. The profile pic was a cute enough guy, WAY too skinny for me, but his opening message was the ultimate bait. Like many a nerd, I had an obscure quote begging to be decoded in my headline, and he responded with a call and response joke -- from another of my favorite shows. So I messaged back, and we got to chatting, and we hit it off. We like all the same shows. He gets my dry sense of humor (even through texting, which is tricky) and he\u2019s nice -- like he actually wants to know how my day went the next time we talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I\u2019m trying not to be shallow, because here real boyfriend material just drops into my lap and I\u2019m cautious because he\u2019s 60 lbs and 5 years shy of anything I would have searched for. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m still here, even though he\u2019s now 25 minutes late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when I feel a tap on my shoulder.</span></div></div>",

That was this Grindr date. I'm waiting for him, specifically, and it still takes me a minute to recognize him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, I think it's good etiquette to have a photo less than a month old on there; at the least it should match your current hair style. This guys profile pic was at least a year old, and it had been a heck of a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on his face as he quietly says \"hi\"is a sheepish grin, the only thing in common with his profile pic. The look on mine, I'm sure, is shock, which I try to hide because it's immediately clear why he hasn't updated his pic in a year. He's put on 60 lbs since it was taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy fantasies have come to life. Sometimes I'll get onto Grindr and Scruff and imagine what all those headless torsos and skinny boys would like like with some extra meat. In front of me is a Grindr boy that did just that. His face is round, his belly sticks out even though he clearly intentionally wore his loosest clothing; his untucked button down shirt hangs an inch or two in front of his pants, and I just want to reach up underneath to touch the belly supporting it. His pants are too tight in so many of the right places. His chestnut brown hair is a little longer, cuter and mussed up clearly from recent fidgeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo much time passes without me saying anything. My heart's beating wildly, my blood is all headed south, and the scotch and my impossible fantasies having come true have left me speechless; but that's clearly not what he's reading from my expression. His grin is fading and the fear it was covering up are showing themselves. He doesn't apologize for the lateness; a growing quiver in his lip makes me think he's not sure what would come out if he opened his mouth. I manage a \"Hey\" but it doesn't stop the turning tide. He's clearly been working up the courage to come in and say hi, and it occurs to me that's probably why he was so late. As he takes a step back, almost trembling, I put a hand on his shoulder gently and say \"I think we can still get a table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fear recedes, at least a little, and I wave to the hostess. There was a lull earlier, and she and I had a 5 minute conversation when he was 10 minutes late, and she actually persuaded me to wait for him. She led us to a booth in the corner, normally meant for 4. She sat us down, gave us menus and the usual speeches, and as she walked away, she mouthed \"told ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still looks flustered, and buries his head in his menu. I decide to...</span></div></div>",

When she asks if we're ready to order, I stammer a bit and ask about the specials to stall for time.
