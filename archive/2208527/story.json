FINE! I WON'T!\" You complained, crossing your arms over your chest. Not liking your friend's constant refusal to let you do what you want, you walk over to the corner to silently pout. Or, well, loudly pout. Every few seconds you give out a loud groan, hoping to wear down your friend by being annoying. Sadly this doesn't seem to be working all that well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaaaaaaaaamie....\" Finally, she reacts to your whining! Though not in the way you were hoping. Your friend now openly glares at you, her lab coat barely covering her rather impressive bust. Her fiery orange hair only adds to her intimidation... even if she does stand a full head shorter than you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut. Up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare down at her, giving a silent nod in agreement out of slight, very slight, fear. With a huff, she turns away back to what she was doing before you so rudely interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long for her to return to... whatever it is she's doing. You give a soft sigh, now turning your eyes back to the object you desire so much. The only reason you're sticking around, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor days it's been your goal to press that button. To see what mysteries it holds behind it! To finally piece together why your friend has been avoiding you these past few weeks! To enjoy whatever prize is just a click away! Jamie knows all of this. It's why she's here, keeping an eye on you to make sure you don't anything stupid. Like you normally do. But if there's one thing you, in all of your infinite stupidity, have learned, it's how to get past people keeping you from what you wanna do! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this is no exception! You have a goal, you have a need, and now you're going to see it through to the end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow again?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You, my friend, are an idiot. You were specifically told by the scary scientist girl to NOT do the thing that got you shrunk! But no, you did the thing and now you're in a world so much bigger than you were ever prepared to handle. Constantly getting into life or death situations, becoming an object of affection for many rather... unique women, and being forced to survive your stupidity. Well, at least the normal-sized women around you are smart enough to know that you can't be trusted by yourself anymore. Too bad not all of them are exactly nice about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, my little idiot, are you prepared to try and survive at this diminutive size? Or are you just going to ruin things for yourself more and more until you're eventually overwhelmed? Well, I guess that's why we're here to figure out. So get ready bite-sized, this is going to be a trip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Rules:</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: Don't kill the main character. You're allowed to hurt the MC, but no killing.<br>\r\n2: Men are okay in passing, but don't have them actively interact with the MC. This is focused on Giantess, after all.<br>\r\n3: I'm fine with most forms of domination, but no scat or piss. No unbirth either, for that matter.<br>\r\n4: Keep the story at hand rolling people. Don't jump out of a storyline and into another just because.<br>\r\n5: Show some effort if you add to this story. Bad grammar I can excuse, but not 1 sentence chapters. Those are just... lazy.<br>\r\n6: The main character is a dumbass, please write them like one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from these rules, you guys have free reign over most of the story! I'll be adding my own chapters every now and then, but I'm mostly depending on you people to get this story nice and big one day! So go on, add, it'll be fun!</td>",
