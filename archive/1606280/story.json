Inside was as any other building except for two unfamiliar looking items that sat on a decrepit table. A syringe with a strange brown liquid like Nuka-Cola and a slightly glowing box of Fancy Lad Snack Cakes.

She opened the package cautiously and took a bite of the snack cake and noticed nothing wrong before finishing the treat. She became aware of her stomach gurgling and felt a pang of hunger, but she soon put it down to not having eaten anything for a while. She explores the building further to discover a back room that is filled with snack cakes and more of the unknown cola bottled in green and yellow bottles. She thinks back to the larger raiders outside and realizes why they were so big. While doing so, a noise catches her off guard and she looks around to notice that it's her stomach gurgling again, albeit much louder than before. She feels hungrier than she did mere minutes ago and sees that her belly has swelled with a little fat. She remembers the snack cakes and thinks of two options...</span></div></div>",

The wanderer was surprise at the thought of this vault wasn't found or that could be people still inside.  Then the wanderer heard the noise of beeping and screeching of metal.

Ever since she and the Brotherhood of Steel had wiped out the majority of the Enclave presence and a good chunk of the super mutant infestation, all that there was to fight were scattered raiders and mutated animals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo boring. Oh well, not as if there was anything else to do. She made a mental list, deciding on stopping by Craterside Supply for a few microfusion cells for her rifle and perhaps a bit of Rad-x antiradiation chems. Heading around the corner of her home and down a ramp towards the commons, she worked her way through the cluster of residents and visitors, nodding towards Sheriff Simms as she passed him, and barely containing her urge to beat down that sleazebag Moriarty, proprietor of the local bar, as he tried to once again trick someone out of their hard-earned money. The smell of crispy iguana-on-a-stick, as always deliciously prepared by Jenny Stahl, wafted across the breeze. For what it was worth, the Brass Latern (megaton's local eatery), was pretty damned good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short walk later, and she was upon Moira's store. Opening the door with a creak, she trotted inside, glancing at the security guard the ever-cheerful Ms. Brown had hired. \"Heeyyy there! How are ya today?\" the red-headed shopkeep piped up. The wanderer shrugged. \"Same old, same old. Less and less for me to do. So, you got any MF cells today?\" With a nod, Moira reached behind the counter and pulled out a few. \"Here ya go.\" Handing over the cash necessary, and a nod of thanks, 101, as she was known by the wasteland's resident newscaster Three-dog after her Vault's number, placed them in her rucksack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how's the survival guide I helped you with going?\" Nearly cringing at the memories, she recalled assisting Moira with a book, being a \"field researcher\", which more often then not involved risking her neck (if she had to go into a mirelurk nest again she'd jump off a cliff) or injuring herself accidentally or (in two cases) intentionally in the name of <i>Science!</i> (which she had now realized was different from the generally accepted view of science). <i>Science!</i> was very much a thing the energetic Brown enjoyed. The crimson-haired merchant smiled warmly. \"Darn good, in fact, it's already sold 500 copies in the past month! It's a tidy little profit AND I'm helping people.\" Of course, the occasionally clueless scientist-wannabe was a bit misinformed, if well-intentioned, although 101 had gently nudged her in the right direction. \"Good to hear. Say, Moira, I barely ever see you outside of here, why don't I take you along to see the sights of DC sometime?\" She gestured over her shoulder with her thumb towards the door of the shop. \"Now that the Brotherhood and I have cleared most of it out, it's much safer. You could use a break, and I could use something to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a hand to her chin, Moira let out a little hmm. \"Well, I suppose it could be fun!\" 101 smiled a little bit, odd for her normally serious demeanor, hardened from a good year straight of fighting. \"Well then, how about after lunch? I'll just be over by the Vault for a while, Dogmeat ran off chasing radroaches again, he usually hangs around there if we get seperated.\" Her trusty canine companion had a habit of doing that, but c'est la vie. \"Sounds nifty. Deal!\" With a wave, 101 walked outside, her bespectacled, brunette self realizing that for all the people she knew, none, bar Fawkes (one of two non-barbaric super mutants she had ever met) and Three-dog, were really <i>friends,</i>having had no time to truly make them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever absentminded, eccentric, and sometimes mind-bogglingly gullible she was, Moira would would be a good friend, she mused. Proceeding out the gate of the township, she hummed along to a catchy little number about some guy named pete that gently played from her radio on her Pip-boy wrist computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like every day. </span></div></div>",

She'd always wanted to find out what life in one of those was like, but nobody ever answered when she knocked on the door.  Oh well.   She was still humming and wiping when Two-Bit Tommy walked in the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery trader in the Wasteland knew Two-Bit Tommy--or if not him, then someone like him.   When Tommy walked in the door, you know you were about to do a fair bit of business, but it was going to take you all day to do it.   Tommy picked up every bobby pin, clipboard, and hunk of mole rat meat he came across, no matter how rank or battered; if it was worth a single bottle cap, he wouldn't leave it behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy, Moira,\" he said, smiling broadly.  \"Need to pick up a few things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I don't suppose you're payin' in caps this time?\" Moira asked, smiling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you knew me better that that, darlin'.   Got the caravan waitin' outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, then, you start bringing it in and I'll start sorting it into piles.\"  Moira waved a finger at him.  \"But I'll have you know, I've instituted a sorting fee, Mister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed.  \"No need for that.   Only brought you item.  Just brought a lot of it, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom!   I sure never thought I'd see the day you made things easy on me.   What's the catch?  Did you bring me ten thousand teddy bears?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like ten thousand boxes of Fancy Lads, give or take a hundred or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-really?  Now how on Earth did you pull that off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A man has his secrets.\"  Tom winked.  \"First of all we'd better dicker on what exactly I'm gettin' in return for all that sugary goodness.   F'its all the same to you, I prefer t' be paid in lead.   Only currency pretty much everyone accepts, regardless of their inclination t' do so--if you get my drift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can manage to scrape up some ammunition,\" Moira said.   \"Now, I assume you're offering a bulk discount?  After all, it won't be easy for me to move that many of a single item--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, I never saw the day when sweet little Moira Brown would utter such a bald-faced lie!  It's no secret that you've got quite  weakness for Fancy Lads yourself.  We both know your only problem will be resistin' the urge to eat your profits.\"<br>\r\nHe reached into his pack and drew out a familiar red-and-white package and tossed it on the counter.  \"Go ahead.  Check the quality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoira opened the package and sunk her teeth into the spongy cake.   Either these little lumps of chemicals and creme were as delicious as the day two centuries ago when they were first extruded, or they had at one point truly been the food of the gods.  She slurped out the creme, they stuffed the rest of the cake in her mouth.  She'd always eaten them that way, ever since she was a little girl and she'd been given her first package.  She remembered that day...she'd been badly stung which trying to train bloatflies to carry letters, and the doctor gave her one so she'd stop crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good?\" Tommy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoira swallowed.  \"Good,\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, shall we discuss the matter of my compensation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\"  Moira licked a few stray flecks of creme from her lips.  \"But while we do that, bring a few loads in and I'll test a few more packages.  Just so I'm completely sure I'm getting quality goods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy smiled.  \"No problem at all, my girl, no problem at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go over this again; now I've got a claim on your full stock of ammo, thirty-five hundred in bottlecaps, and five Chinese assault rifles in exchange for nine thousand boxes, an' that's settled, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoira folded her hands over her pleasantly creme-filled midsection.   \"Right you are, Mr. Two-Bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy looked offended.  \"Please!   Mr. Two-Bit is my father.  And you're seriously tellin' me that the remainin' thousand boxes--and change, I remind you--aren't worth slappin' a new hose in my generator?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That generator is on its last legs.\"  Moira stifled a belch.  \"Well, it doesn't have legs, but you know what I mean.   It'll take a week to fix!   And if you think you're going to get special favors out of me by walking in here and pumping me full of creme, well, you'd better have another look at the chapter in my survival guide on not getting suckered in a deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, all right.\"  Tommy held up his hands.  \"I know when I'm beat.   I do need that generator looked at, though.  Tell you what; how about I give you a certain choice bit of information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what might that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothin' much.  Just--\" he lowered his voice \"--the location where I happened to acquire my present cargo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoira's ears pricked up.  \"I'm listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy picked up a discarded wrapper.  \"What if I told you I knew about a certain warehouse in the DC ruins--a warehouse untouched by scavengers and Super Mutants, a warehouse nobody but me knows about--and that what I brought you today is barely the beginning?  I'm talkin' pallets of Fancy Lads, stacked floor to ceilin'.  A glorious sight.\"  He let the wrapper flutter to the counter.  \"You mark my words; you lay claim to this warehouse, and you'll be able to stuff yourself with Fancy Lads until the wasteland blooms.  But, now, if that doesn't interest you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"  Moira said.  \"I mean no.  I mean... it does!   As a matter of fact, I was planning a trip to the ruins anyway.   If you can give me the coordinates--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a deal, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"  Moira shook his hand.    Tommy nodded and handed her a folded-up scrap of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's the location.  I'd keep it under wraps if I were you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoira nodded and slipped it into her jumpsuit.  \"Pleasure doing business with you, Tom.  I'll leave first thing tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, hold on, girl!  What about my generator?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that?\"  Moira shrugged.  \"I'll get that for you now.  Won't take more than five minutes.\"  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amata Almodovar wasn't having a great day. In the forty-eight hours since she chose to sneak out of Vault 101 in search of her wandering friend, she had been shot at, burned, poisoned, nearly whipped by some raider with a fistful of bike chains - It hadn't been going well, to say the least. And now, hunched behind some rock, bullets ricocheting all around, she found it getting even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping up for a split second, she sprayed 10mm bullets in the general direction of the raiders, who answered back with another well-aimed volley, and she had to duck as bullet fragments whizzed past her ears. One caught her cheek, tearing a gash that only stung, but from which blood trickled at an irritating rate. Swearing in pain, Amata reached for her  her canteen for a sip and found - Nothing. The last of the clean water, purified by Vault 101's indestructible chip, was finally gone, and with it, easy mode. Radioactive water was downright dangerous, and even what the wastelanders pretended was 'purified' was barely better than sipping from a puddle in downtown Hiroshima. She'd have to return to the Vault and resupply, assuming they'd even let her back in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait, she did have one other drink. Reaching into her pack, she pulled out a heavily scratched, unopened bottle of Nuka Cola. It was hard to believe this bottle would survive for over 200 years unbroken, unopened, unevaporated - It was almost a crime when Amata used her knife to pry up the seal, the c02 hissing out. It still smelled like Nuka Cola, though there was a certain tangy aftertaste, which so many spots in the wasteland exhibited, indicating a higher-than-average rate of background radiation. But her throat was so dry... Another crackle of a nearby bullet, and her throat felt so dry, she couldn't help but take a good, long sip. The soda still tasted like the bottles from the Vault, albeit a bit sour from years of sitting around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the bottle aside, she let out a small burp, then stood up and fired a burst. One raider seemed to have grown sick of the game and tried to charge - Her bullets caught him mid-strike, and his sawn-off shotgun fired uselessly toward the sky. Another few rounds kept the other raiders under cover just long enough for her to duck again, her ass hitting the ground with a thud. Ugh, her stomach wasn't feeling well... She groaned, rubbing her middle; That soda was really stirring things up, with nothing but the remains of this morning's protein bar to keep it company in there. She could feel it churning, bubbling, her belly starting to bloat... Letting out another, louder belch, she caught the attention of the nearby gentlemen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, what was that? A yao guai?\" One asked, and Amata's eyes focused on the rusted out, overturned hulk of a car. She had just the thing for it. Pulling the last grenade from her belt, she hurled it at the car. The little steel potato bounced off the roof and through the broken windshield, settling in the footwell just as the timer wound down. The explosion was immense, knocking Amata from her feet and raising a dustcloud that stretching up into the sky. As it slowly settled, the overseer's daughter was aware of two things - Body parts were raining from the sky, some still twitching, and her belly was bloating against her vault suit, the blue polyleather growing taut around an equally tight midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting, Amata quickly unzipped the suit to her waist, letting her breasts and belly heavy in the hot desert air. The capital wasteland was usually swarming with huge, biting flies, but not today, for which she was infinitely grateful; She had enough to worry about with her stomach bulging out, making her look five months pregnant, and aching terribly as the tight skin stretched out. Pumping out another belch, Amata felt her insides churn and slosh. Perhaps these were the effects of gamma radiation on carbonation, or simply the result of a pure human's digestive tract meeting foul wasteland food for the first time. Either way, she had no way of treating it, aside from rubbing her aching stomach, which elicited frequent burps and not a lot else. Groaning, she got to her feet, kicking someone else's foot out of the way, and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Courier had never felt the way she did about Sunset Sarsaparilla before she was shot in the head. That checker-suited guy and those good-for-nothing Kahns stole her package, put a bullet in her brain, and left her for dead in a shallow grave. You all know the story: a for sure deadly encounter narrowly saved by a cowboy robot and an extremely capable surgeon in the right place at the right time. Even the most capable surgeons, though, sometimes can't put the brain back together 100%. Luckily, the Courier's lingering side effects from the attempted murder weren't THAT bad, were they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Sunset Sarsaparilla. A sugary, carbonated beverage that was very popular in the Mojave region before the war. Not nearly as popular now, of course, but it's got a dedicated fanbase. The Courier never saw the appeal. Why should she drink some fizzy desert-hot swill when there's plenty of purified water and alcohol to go around? What's the point? At least, that's how she felt before a certain gun went off into her frontal lobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thought that went through the Courier's mind after stepping out of Doc Mitchell's house into the familiar, humble dust of Goodsprings wasn't \"Who shot me?\" or \"Why did they take my package?\". It was \"I'm thirsty.\" The sunlight kissed her face like a flyswatter to a hornet. She squinted her eyes and took it in. Downtrodden houses with crappy Brahmin. Eh. General store. Maybe. Saloon. YES. That's the place to whet her whistle. Speaking of whistle, a farmer out in his little yard field gave a shrill, detuned \"WHEE-WOO\" with two fingers in his mouth as the Courier passed. Not batting an eye, she responded with a quick middle finger and carried on. The Courier was what many people would describe as a very beautiful woman. The kind of knockout gal your average wastelander could only see in pre-war pin-up drawings. She had short, black hair, vivid blue eyes, and pouty red lips. Her stomach was flat and smooth as could be, though it was difficult to be anything but thin in this nuclear wasteland and all. She had a feminine hourglass figure with heavy breasts, wide hips, and a bubble butt she was quite proud of. Her legs were long and lovely, with just enough meat on them to inspire thoughts of being crushed by her thighs. All in all, a picturesque figure that was being accentuated by the spandex vault suit the Doc gave her. She didn't usually like to wear such form-fitting clothing, but those bastard Kahns stripped her down before shooting her and the Doc didn't have any other clothing to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saloon was a dingy yet homey place, the kind of spot you might expect a middle-aged townie to come for a drink after a hard day of work. It smelled exactly like it did outside: like sand and weeds. The Courier wrinkled her nose. Yup, this was the spot. She ambled over to the bar and took a seat on one of the stools like she had lived there for 25 years, resting her elbows on the wooden surface. The bartender approached: a plain looking woman in a homely dress. Young, but with a wise look in her eyes. \"Oh, you're that girl the doc's been fixing up, aren't you? Nice to finally meet you. Welcome to the Prospector Saloon.\" She gave a shallow but genuine smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Courier smiled back. \"Well, I need a drink. What do you got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender turned around to look at what she had, even though she had the drink menu committed to memory. \"We've got beer, wine, whiskey, vodka, scotch\u2026 Nothing special, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme have a beer.\" The Courier slid a few caps over the bar. She was a woman of simple taste, and a beer sounded real good about now. The woman opened up a brown bottle with a satisfying *CRACK* and placed it where the bottle caps used to be. Wordlessly, the Courier grabbed it and took a big swig\u2026 and as soon as the liquid hit her taste buds she spat it out all over the floor. It was VILE. She exhaled and stuck her tongue out. \"Holy shit, are you tryna poison me? What was in that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender was dumbfounded. \"I, uh\u2026 Beer? Here, let me get you another one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's how it continued. Another beer: horrible. A whiskey: disgusting. Vodka: repulsive. Even a bottle of water tasted like sewage. By the end of her taste-testing, the Courier was exhausted, distraught, and thirstier than ever. The bartender felt nothing but pity for the poor girl. Something awful must have happened to the part of her brain that determines taste when that bullet got lodged in her skull. The Courier leaned back on her stool and looked at the ceiling. How is she supposed to even survive if she can't even drink water without wanting to hurl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, something happened. A sound from across the room: \"sssssSSSSS\". The Courier's ears perked up. Then, a smell. A subtle, tiny smell, but a smell that permeated her nostrils like a sledgehammer. What was that earthy, sugary smell? She turned her head like a dog in its direction, making some sniffs. She easily located its source: a man at a table, opening a bottle of\u2026 Sunset Sarsaparilla? She turned back to the bartender. \"Can I have one of those?\" She pointed to the guy with the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender put down the glass she was polishing. \"Oh, of course, dear. We've got plenty of those. They barely sell, really.\" She looked under the bar and grabbed a brown bottle of Sarsaparilla. \"Here. Free of charge. I hope it works out.\" She handed it to the Courier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if opening a buried treasure chest, the Courier twisted off the bottle cap with a pop. The insides fizzed. The heavenly smell hit her nostrils even harder. It was the best smell she ever did smell. Her jaw dropped. \"Fuuuuck.\" Then, she brought the bottle to her lips, letting the warm, foamy water rush past her taste buds and down her throat. *GLUG. GLUG. GLUG.* \"Ahhhh. urrp. Oh, excuse me!\" It was gone as soon as it was opened. And it was AMAZING. Everything that she had previously thought about the fizzy drink was WRONG. Sunset Sarsaparilla made her feel like she was on a fluffy cloud, or on a luminescent animal traveling through the depths of the ocean. It made her feel like she had transcended her mortal body into a realm of pure feeling. It was incredible. And she needed more. Much more.</span></div></div>",
