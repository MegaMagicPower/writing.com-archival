Your curiosity getting the better of you, you lift up the board and reach into the hidden compartment. Your fingertips strike glass, and you pull a glass phial out from the dark container. The phial contains a shiny gold potion. You decide to figure out what the potion is before you drink it, so you replace the floorboard, and open up your new potions textbook on your bed. You couldn't believe your eyes when you found a match. It was Felix Felicis; the Liquid Luck Potion. One of the rarest and most valuable potions ever. You closed your textbook and stared at it in awe before uncapping it and downing it in two gulps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to feel drawn out of the room, so you follow your instincts and leave the room. Where do you end up?</span></div></div>",

Her face was hovering over a saucer of creme, which she was lapping up with her tongue, and there were several balls of yarn within easy reach. You also noticed that there were whiskers decorating her cheeks, cat ears poking out of her hair, and a tail waving around above her ass. She had golden, slitted cat's eyes, and a blush on her cheeks. The second she noticed your presence, she shot up into a kneeling position and froze. There was a jingling sound, and in her new position you could see the bell collar fastened around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H- H- Harry.

So you led her out of her room and into Tonks' room. There was a beautiful leather catsuit laying in the middle of the floor, with a little leather band a few inches away from it. Ignoring the band, you had Hermione stand up, and handed her the catsuit. It fit her perfectly, and somehow it even had a hole for her tail in the right spot. But once she zipped it up, her body seemed to take on a life of its own. Hermione looked scared as her limbs flailed about. Then her left arm started gesturing at the band on the floor. Hermione's possessed body lurched towards it, but you collected it first. It slid onto your wrist and shrunk to fit. The moment it did, the catsuit was gone, and in its place was Tonks, holding Hermione's wrists. The metamorphagus released the cat girl and stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.

Parvati, you take the dominant potion, and Padma, take the submissive potion.\" you decided<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls nodded and collected their potions and drank them quickly. Their bodies became stiff. Parvati turned away from Padma, and Padma bent over at a 90 degree angle. She lurched towards Parvati, and they seemed to fuse together at the collision point. Still in that shape, their bodies melded into one: a beautiful brown furred mare with a black mane.

You climbed the stairs and found the open door to Lavender's bedroom. The blonde Gryffindor was kneeling on the carpet in front of a makeshift altar, performing some sort of ritual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I pray the goddess delegate,<br>\r\nMerge these dual parts of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here and now in this new shape,<br>\r\nMy only Master will be-\" she looked up, \"Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic of the ritual flared up, and she realized her mistake a brief moment before the magic overtook her. It covered her entire body in a bright light, before softly fading. Her new form had wolf ears, a wolf tail, gold coloured irises, and a naturally wild styling of her long blonde hair. Just as the magic finished fading, it coalesced and solidified into a collar around her neck. Looking at you, she crawled over to you on all fours. Once she reached you, she sat back and barked twice, her tail wagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetting her head leads to her licking your palm eagerly. Lavender was wearing a low cut top, Daisy Duke jean shorts, a brown belt and brown leather boots with a low heel. In a deft motion, you remove the belt from your new pet wolf girl's hips, and transfigure it into a leash, which clips easily to the O-ring on the front of her collar. Ready to leave again, a tug on her leash lets Lavender know it's time to get going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you still speak and stand up?\" You ask Lavender<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up and nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Master, though I prefer being in my place as your pet and acting as such.\" She replies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, I want you to show me what a good girl you can be by acting human around others that aren't mine.\" You told her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master.\" Said Lavender, her head bowed in submission<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and fix your gaze on the Patil twins. Your mind focused on what you need from them, the twins are pulled together by an invisible force suddenly, the surprise evident on their faces as they weren't expecting their magic to react to your will. They make contact with each other and merge back into Nimbus, their horse animagus form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb into the saddle and collect the reins that had formed from the twins' clothing. A simple knot binds Lavender to Nimbus by her leash. A look at your blonde pet transforms her into a golden furred wolf on a leash. A couple of notice-me-not charms ensure that any muggles that look at you will consider riding a horse as common as a bicycle, and that Lavender will be perceived to be a golden retriever, rather than the wolf she was. Your new pet in tow, you set out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where to?</span></div></div>",

For example, I could give any woman the compulsion that all snakes have to obey the commands of a Speaker. One such as yourself.\" said the snake<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a very useful power.\" you said, and opened the cage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou offered your hand and the snake coiled around your arm.

A few minutes later, Narcissa exited the ladies room and walked over to Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Master, you do have exquisite taste. This body is a work of art.\" said Narcissa<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snake?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Master.

Intrigued, you opened the book. Strangely enough, there was only one spell/ritual in the book, and the rest of the pages were just creative ideas of what to do with it. The ritual was designed to empower a man or woman to create a coven. They would draw women of all types who were strong and beautiful and bond with them. You decided to try it. It wasn't too hard to find the necessary ingredients. You constructed the ritual circle, and memorized the chant. Now all that was left was to decide on the theme for his coven, and picture it strongly during the chant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it!\" you said to yourself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone told you your destiny was to stop Voldemort and save the world. And who better to help you save the world than a harem of super heroines. You pictured all the gorgeous super powered women you could remember from TV and movies and comics, and chanted the incantation while standing in the middle of the ritual circle. The candles lit up, and you felt a great power building up. Then the power solidified, and a whirlwind put out the candles. You looked at the book and it floated over to you. You grabbed the book, and realized that the Ministry shouldn't have a ritual this powerful. With a wave of your hand, a gale force wind blew through and decimated the ritual circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your business at the Ministry concluded, you set out to begin building your coven of super heroines. But where to start?</span></div></div>",

Then suddenly someone opened the door and revealed a surprising sight. Gabrielle, Fleur, and their mother Appoline Delacour walked into the room. They were each dressed only in a matching set of lacy bra, panties, garter belt, stockings and high heels. Gabrielle's was white, Fleur's was red, and Appoline's was black. Their pupils were dilated, and their faces and chests were flushed. Also noticeable was the damp spot decorating their panties between their legs. You sat up on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, ladies. How can I help you?\" you asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Master. Make us part of your coven. As veela, we can feel your power radiating off of you.\" said Appoline<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, we need you, Master.\" said Fleur<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.\" begged Gabrielle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well who am I to deny three gorgeous women such a simple request.\" you replied with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Delacours smiled with relief. With a wave of your hand, the women started glowing until the light was blinding. The light faded and the Delacours passed out. You levitated them onto the bed before they hit the ground. The unconscious girls had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabrielle: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://imageshack.us/f/812/emeraldflightkara.jpg/\" target=\"_blank\">http://imageshack.us/f/812/emeraldflight...</a><br>\r\nFleur: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/Supergirl.PNG\" target=\"_blank\">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en...</a><br>\r\nAppoline: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://imageshack.us/a/img28/9659/karengs.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://imageshack.us/a/img28/9659/kareng...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared that Gabrielle's super heroine form was Supergirl, Fleur's was Matrix, and Appoline's was Powergirl.
