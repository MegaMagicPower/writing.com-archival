            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alexis was browsing through the newspaper, looking for a job that best suited her. She didn't want those \"easy money\" jobs like stripping or dancing but one that was within the line she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? This one looks interesting.\" Alexis thought to herself as she eyed a interesting post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need a babysitter! Will to work while carrying load. Inquire at this address. Don't worry the pay is good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Mine as well check this out.\" As Alexis wrote down the address. After a call, the female asked her to come immediately to her home. So Alexis changed from her tank top and shorts to a long, thin yellow turtleneck sweater with dark blue denim jeans and slip on shoes. She tied jer hair in a long ponytail and darted out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments she was at the house of the job she was applying. It was on hill, looking over the city, it also has a wide range in which seemed like a ranch minus the animals. She pulled up the driveway and parked her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! This is some place. But why would she need a babysitter if she could just hire a nanny?\" Thought Alexis as she walked up the marble pathway towards the door. As she rung the doorbell, she heard a voice and footsteps walking towards her. Just then the door opened and there Alexis met whom she was applying the job from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you must be Alexis! I'm Charlotte Balmer. So pleased to meet you!\" said Charlotte. She was a bit taller than Alexis with shoulder length brown hair. What was even more facinating that she was pregnant which she looked either overdue or is having twins. Her breasts quite larger and wide hips. She swayed as she lead Alexis to the living room. She was wearing a white polka dot dress that extended down past her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So glad you could make it! I was losing hope that somebody wouldn't see that ad I put up.\" Charlotte sighed as she sat down in front of Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries maam! I'm just interested in what job you have for me.\" saif Alexis as she put her hands on one knee with her legs crossed. \"If I remember right, you were in a hurry.\" Alexis looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes. Of course. Just one question. Do you believe in magic?\" Charlotte asked with a giggle, placing her hand on an old wooden box sitting on the table next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No maam. I believe things can be explained by science. Oh by the way. Who am I babysitting?\" asked Alexis looking around but seeing not a single child wondering about or making a noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. But this will make you believe in magic.\" said Charlotte as she opened the box to reveal several rings. Others smaller but with alternate colors like that of a rainbow. She handed Alexis one that had a large stone in the center that seemed like a diamond with two smaller ones that in circled the large rock, making a total of 8 small rocks. Alexis tried it on and for some weird reason, it fitted perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this for?\" asked Alexis pointing using her right hand on her left ring finger where she wore the ring. She saw Charlotte wore a red gemmed ring that was dark in color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is what you are babysitting.\" Charlotte gestured her hand with the ring on her belly as it began to glow. Alexis watched in awe as Charlotte's belly shrank along with her large breasts and wide hips. Unaware that one of the smaller stones on her ring began to glow red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis began to feel strange as her belly began to feel tight. She looked down to see it growing! She placed her hands as it grew. In a matter of minutes and the popping of her jeans button. She looked overdue with one. It filled her lap a bit. Alexis also noticed who tight her jeans were as her hips had widen and her butt grew. Then she felt warmth in her breasts and saw them grow too. Her chest began to feel extremely tight as her breasts grew from C-cups to E cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened? This is impossible!\" said Alexis. But then felt a kick as she rubbed the spot. Her sweater hid her belly well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is! Thanks to the rings of fertility and pregnancy. I saw them in some shop and had the urge to buy them. Who knew it worked!\" As Charlotte stood up with a new spring in her step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis was dumbfounded but felt it quite pleasuable to feel life within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry the pay is good. I'll pay you when I get back from my reunion!\" said Charlotte. Just then rhe doorbell rang. \"I'll get it!\" as Charlotte skipped to the door leaving Alexis to her new found borrowed pregnancy.</span></div></div>",

Alexis couldn't see from her angle but she's pretty sure it was a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! Standing before you now pregnant-less.\" said Charlotte as she did a little spin. She held her left hand and showed the woman the ring that she was wearing. It glowed bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the babysitter doing?\" asked the woman as she peeked around the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's still getting used to her new pregnant form.\" Charlotte said as they giggled. They whispered somethings that Alexis couldn't hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it,Ms. Balmer?\" asked Alexis as she struggled to get up. Slowly making her way towards the door but leaning on the back of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang! This is heavy.\" thought Alexis as she cradled her pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful! Your carrying my twins! Don't worry, you won't get miscarried or suffer from morning sickness. Just get used to the weight.\" As Charlotte made her way to Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear. But twins? No wonder you seem so big. I thought you were overdue with one!\" said Alexis as she cradled her belly. Then she heard a voice from behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well prepare because you've got another load comin' right at'cha!\" said a female voice from behinc the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" was all Alexis could say as she felt a familiar sensation like before. She looked up to see a woman who seemed spanish in decent. Having a latin complexion with long brown hair and dark brown eyes. She wore a pink maternity blouse with stretchable jeans and slippers. Well she wasn't pregnant anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Olivia Dela Cruz! I'm a single mom just like Charlotte here.\" as Olivia approached Charlotte and put her arm around her waist. \"We've been best friends since grade school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay... But you said you were a single mom so where's your child?\" asked Alexis as her belly started to grow. Her surprised eyes watched as her belly grew larger. She saw that a small gem next to the red one shined but it was purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not born yet. I was six months going to my seventh.\" said Olivia gesturing her belly. They all watched as Alexis's grew to twice its size. It wad noticable from behind as well. Her hips widen as her butt grew, ripping the seams if her pants. Her belly was now visible from underneath as her breasts grew 2 cup sizes more snapping her bra. Alexis panting and blushing bright red as her growth stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Your huge!\" said Olivia as both she and Charlotte came to see how Alexis was doing. Alexis felt uneasy and very heavy as they helped her sit on the couch. A bit of anger as she placed both hands on top of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I wasn't expecting this!\"  Alexis pouted as she felt several kicks from within her belly. She moaned a bit as she rubbed the places on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well your carrying quads now. We'll be back in 2 days time. Olivia here was coincidently pregnant with twins as well!\" said Charlotte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quads? I feel like I'm going to explode!\" said Alexis,looking worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. The scriptures that came with the box said that a woman wearing the ring will be able to carry 8 pregnancies. How do I know? I deciphered them.\" said Olivia as she placed her hand on Alexis's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for making you a guinea pig. But it worked out pretty good!\" said Charlotte rubbing her shoulders causing Alexis's breasts to quiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah, I guess your right. This will be a new experience for me.\" said Alexis as she rubbed her belly as the activity died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit. We'll get you into more comfortable clothes.\" said Olivia. Soon enough they got Alexis into a large sky blue maternity gown with a bra large enough to hold her breasts. They left soon enough as Alexis was left alone in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you guys wanna do?\" asked Alexis as she rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alexis tries to stand up but is finding it a little difficult with her new quad filled womb. She finally makes it to her feet and just then the door opens and in walks Charlotte again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alexis sorry to barge in again but I'm afraid that someone else is in need of your babysitting services as well. Quite francly she was sceptical and hesitant when I first told her my plan, but seeing both me and Olivia relieved of our burden for the reunion she has come around.\" Charlotte finishing telling Alexis this and heads over to help the girl sit down on the couch again. \"Well I guess since I'm already babysitting four what's one more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Charlotte went to the door to talk with her friend \"hey Sarah Alexis has argued to carry your children too isn't that just wonderful.\" Alexis looks up at the sound of the word 'children' just in time to see Sarah waddle into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was a beautiful Asian woman with EE breasts and black hair down to the small of her back. She was a little on the tall side for an Asian woman at 5'7\" tall, but the real shock for Alexis was the fact that she was massively pregnant she looked bigger than Alexis. After seeing this Alexis started to say \"on second thought I don't...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off by the familiar sight of Sarah's massive baby bump shrinking right before her eyes. Alexis decided that there was nothing that could be done at this point and decided to lean back in the couch and await her impending growth. Sure enough as soon as Sarah had a flat stomach her previous swell started to add to Alexis. Alexis ballooned out to almost 4 foot in front of her and 3 feet wide. Her hips started to widen as well as her ass plumped up, but she was shocked when she looked at Sarah and saw that her breasts had settled down to a small B cup. Just as she noticed all the changes on Sarah her body finished its transformation and her breast had settled at a FF cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you so much Alexis I was sceptical at first and seeing Olivia and Charlotte down their baby bumps just put my mind at ease. I'm so glad to get the quadruplets off my body for a weekend and just as I started the eighth month too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I'm now up to eight babies.\" Stammered Alexis placing her hand protectively on her new motherly swell. \"Well at least I've reached the limit of the rings power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you misunderstand me dear you can transfer eight pregnancies not eight babies. By all accounts you could hold five more mothers worth of babies. Too bad we didn't have any other pregnant friend we could have tested the limits of the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two woman left, Alexis still sitting on the couch her new maternity clothes just barely covering her breasts and her bra cutting into her new super sized mammaries. She decided to heave her self off of the couch and try to make her way to a bedroom to rest after her eventful evening. It wasn't easy but she managed to make it to a large bedroom with a king sized bad, she laid down as best she could to sleep the night away.</span></div></div>",

Slowly she put her feet on the ground, spread her legs and breathed in.  She got up and almost fell, losing her balance because of the great new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis went to the kitchen, she was very hungry. No wonder she was so hungry, she had to eat for 8 more babies besides feeding herself. During the whole trip she was leaning her hands on the wall to be able to support the weight of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo get to the kitchen she had to go through the living room, as she passed through the living room she realized that something had happened. There were things moving and finally he realized that the ring box had disappeared. The first thing Alexis thought of was to go out the door to see if she saw any suspects. Which she did as fast as her belly would allow her, her open legs making any step easy to take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he went out the door he looked at the street, it was very early and there were few people, he couldn't see anything suspicious so he went back inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he entered the house...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Babies, it\u2019s time for sleep.\u201d She cooed to her stomach, making wide circles with her hands. Alexis couldn\u2019t help but feel a little anger towards her employer. Leaving a teenager with eight children would be considered irresponsible; impregnating her was a whole other story entirely. Despite the flailing going on in her womb, and the massive breasts compressing her chest, Alexis couldn\u2019t help but drift off soon after her head hit the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A few hours pass.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Alexis slumbered, a darkened figure crept towards the house. Stooping near the front door, the figure turned and entered. A small light skewered the inky darkness, slowly approaching the living room. Stopping near the center of the room, a hand snaked out and grabbed a ring from the box Charlotte had left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d The figured hissed. It slowly made its way down the hallway, the sound of Alexis snoring growing stronger with every step. Pushing open the door, a strand of moonlight hit the doorway illuminating the intruder\u2019s face. Unbeknownst to Alexis Charlotte\u2019s neighbor and bitter enemy, Madelyn Remington, had discovered her neighbor\u2019s secret. With a hint of trepidation, Madelyn slipped one of the rings on her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026sorry\u201d Madelyn whispered, watching her huge stomach and breasts flatten and retract. Meanwhile, the ring that Alexis had failed to remove in her tired state lit up again, this time with an orange gem. Her breasts tore through the bra that had been given to her only hours earlier. Each larger than her head, they filled the capacity of the of her gown and kept going. Her stomach had passed her feet long ago but seemed to be reaching for the end of the bed. From Madelyn\u2019s angle Alexis was little more than feet, belly and boobs. Despite the massive growth, Alexis didn\u2019t stir. Her breathing was just as steady. Madelyn took one last look, stripped off her ring and quickly left.</span></div></div>",

The pregnant women varied in size but all had one thing in common they were all near the end of there pregnancy. \"How are you feeling Alexis I now that the twins can be a bit of a womb full sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honestly I'm kinda feeling good it's a lot to get used to but I think that I like having a pregnant belly.\" Alexis was absentmindedly rubbing the sides of her twin laden belly feeling herself get a little turned on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good because I have five other ladies from my mommy to be group that will be needing your services tonight. From left to right we have Sarah she's carrying twins around the same age as mine. Then we have Daphne she's in her eighth month with a little boy. Next is Gretel and she is almost nine months with a big girl. The big gal next to her is Suzan and she's in her seventh month with triplets. Last and certainly not least we have Mariah at a doctor stumping eight months with quintuplets. Counting my twins already under your care we have fourteen little ones that we would like for you to babysit for the weekend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the women smiled and waved as Charlotte ran off the role call of the group all the while Alexis was still rubbing her bell getting a little aroused at the thought of adding to her new belly. \"I'm not going to lie it does sound like it could be fun carrying fourteen babies for the weekend but with all of you ladies being almost due wouldn't that make it so that I could go into labor while y'all are out?\" Alexis asked her client hoping that she had a solution for this dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actual from what I can tell from the instructions with the ring set the holder of the surrogate ring, which is what your wearing dear, will be protected from any adverse affects on his or her body while still wearing the ring. You won't have a miscarriage or go into labor even if you fill your womb so full you filled a room. With the surrogate ring and the tranfer ring that I have combined we can transfer an unlimited amount of babies safely from unlimited people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok well you seem to be well versed in the rings so I trust in your judgement.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There is the red ring that can transfer a baby from an expectant mother that is wearing it to the person with the surrogate ring, that'd be you dear. Then there is the purple ring that can take a pregnancy from any expectant mother into the wearer of the purple ring. Next we have a blue ring that can be used with any other ring to double its effect. Then there is the green ring that can alter the age of a baby in a pregnancy either progress or regress the child. There is also a second surrogate ring so that two people can be transferred to at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that seems pretty complete but didn't you mention a bracelet as well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes the bracelet is supposed to make carrying children easier, and it's supposed to make sure that anyone wearing it can carry any number of babies to ten months. In fact Mariah is currently using it to help her quint filled womb stretch to accommodate healthy full term babies.\" Charlotte finished her very detailed description as all of the women seemed to be getting perturbed at having to delay there vacation any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on let's get this show on the road she's been hired to babysit not listen to a history lesson.\" Blurted Suzan seeming to be ready to dump her triplet filled belly on the poor girl. \"What is your rush Suzan you're the lucky one that got to carry triplets I'm only carrying twins.\" Huffed Sarah as a hint of red came to her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I'll take your children but I hope no one minds if I ask for a little something extra.\" Alexis states to the group of pregnant gals with a smile shining on her face.</span></div></div>",

As her belly become flat again she takes of the bracelet and puts it on Alexis as the tingling sensation in her breasts comes back as they shoot out to J cups and her belly starts to expand under her sweater. Soon she has stopped growing her massive stomach is bare as her sweater had risen up her dome of a belly and nestled itself under here boobs. The bracelet seemed to have worked like a charm Alexis didn't have any stretch marks and no discomfort in her midsection and she couldn't help but be relieved that her back and legs had magically been strengthened to hold her new motherly figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to need to lose the sweater and the bra if I want to ever use them again cause I'm only up to seven and they could rip apart at any moment.\" As Alexis finished her statement and pulled her sweater and bra off she felt a pressure in her but and hips as her pants exploded off of her as her body amused the rest of her increased fertility. \"Oops I'm completely naked infront of my new clients this is so embarrassing\" Alexis tried her best to cover her breasts and womanhood but it was simply impossible at her current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry dear I bought you a special shirt that is supposed to fit a woman of a rather large size.\" Charlotte reassured Alexis as Sarah took the ring from Mariah and then also added the blue ring to make her transfer into quads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout twenty minutes later and Alexis adding all of the pregnancies to her body bringing the total number of babies in her womb to sixteen and ballooning her belly to an impressive six foot infront of her and easily three feet on her sides. Alexis was a walking, thanks to the bracelet, example of fertility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I can't begin to tell you ladies how amazing this feels\" Alexis panted rubbing what she could of her large belly. Charlotte came in with a pair of huge maternity pants and a massive shirt. \"Ok sweetheart I have a special maternity outfit that I had made specially for you, well not you but the person that took your position, that is supposed to accommodated a woman that is pregnant to term with 30 babies. They couldn't see why I wanted it but I paid for it so it should work. It is supposed to stretch as needed but be form fitting.\" With that Alexis got dressed and the newly non-pregnant women left for there trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis waddled her way to the guest room that was set up for her and took a look in the mirror. She was huge her belly was six feet out and three feet to her sides, her breast were the size of watermelons and no bra could hold them. Moving down her hips were huge as well as her ass and thighs. Apparently the ring transfered the pregnancy to her and all the weight associated with it. \"Well I guess I should.....\"</span></div></div>",

'Charlotte was not completely correct about how this ring works I wonder what else she is wrong about. For that matter I wonder what the extent of the rings power is? How many children can I transfer, how large can someone that I transfer to get? How large can I get?'

How many would you like all together?\" Alexis grins evilly as an idea comes to mind. 'Why don't I use Lana as a Guinea pig to see what all I can do'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all together I don't really have a limit I think my husband has a great job I'm a stay at home mom to be, but I do know that the triplets are as large as I want to go.\" Lana states rubbing her large womb while entertaining the idea of being larger.

'Maybe it didn't work' as the thought finishes Alexis feels a familiar pressure in her belly and breasts. 'Dang it I transfered them to me, oh well I like sixteen anyway' with that she pushed out larger adding the twin pregnancy to her own. Looking up she sees another woman waddle into the store looking to be carrying twins as well. 'Let's try this again shall we' Alexis focuses on taking the twins and giving them to Lana but nothing happens again till she starts to swell again herself. 'Well this is weird how did I transfer the other twins to her then?' With that thought Alexis came to a realization. Maybe since she's wearing the surrogate ring the pregnancies automatically come to her first. 'Maybe with the surrogate rings magic il have to act as kind of an intermediary for the babies.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finishes her thought process she decides to focus on transferring the last four passengers to Lana. Just like before Alexis starts to deflate and Lana starts to grow right infront of her. Lana starts to swell to massive proportions for someone who was earlier just pregnant with one. \"I don't think I could possibly imagine being pregnant with more than septuplets. I know with how fertile I am me and my husband are going to have a huge family but seven at once is just killer on my figure. Oh but listen to me complain you're carrying double the load I am and you don't seem to complain.\" Lana finishes talking not seeming to realize she's up six babies in less than a hour of arriving at the mall. Her belly is easily a foot and a half out infront of her and she is a foot foot to a cross. Her maternity clothes she came to mall in are barely covering her now FF boobs and her stretch pants are low on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no worries not all women are built to carry as well as my family is it both a blessing and a curse.\" Alexis grins loving the fact that she can bend reality as she sees fit. As she talks with Lana the young woman finds a maternity shirt and pants built for someone carrying septuplets. \"Well I'll try these on Alexis why don't you take a rest and I'll come back out in a minute to model them for you.\" Lana grins loving having a woman bigger than her to shop with. Lana enters the changing rooms and starts to change out of her tiny clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut on a bench in the store right next to the changing room Alexis sits and looks around the store. More people have filed into the store since they started looking at clothes, there had to be ten other ladies perusing the isles looking at maternity wear. Alexis sees a huge woman that is carrying quads waddle past her to try on some clothes and giving Alexis an idea. She looks to a red head ready to pop with one and wills her baby from her. Next she sees a twin laden blond in her final weeks and takes her babies as well. For the next five minutes Alexis transfers all of the pregnancies she sees into her own massive mound of maternity. All told she has gathered sixteen more babies into her belly. She has swollen to a massive size her legs have been spread out infront of her and her belly hangs seven feed out as well as five feet a cross. Her belly has also had to expand up and down to make room for her brood. Sitting her belly rests softly on the ground infront of her and she has to look to either side of her belly to see past it. Her clothes are stretched tight against her body hugging her mountain of a baby bump. Her breasts have swelled to large watermelon size and her hips thighs and ass have ballooned to proportional amounts as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alexis rubs her sides the lady that was carrying quads exits the changing rooms and Alexis steels her belly too bringing her to thirty four passengers as well as causing her special maternity clothes to ride up her belly and her pants to lower to her hips. Lana walks out of the dressing room and smiles at her massive new friend. \"Whatcha think it covers my bump pretty well.\" Lana squeals with excitement. Alexis grins as she wills the recent quads into lanas full belly bringing her total up to eleven. Lana swells to almost double her size and causes her shirt to ride up to sit just under her HH cup tits. \"Oh darn I thought it fit. Oh well I'll just see if I can find anything to cover my eleven little ones.\" Lana seemed none the wiser to her recently acquired new babies. She struggles to the racks to try and find a large size her body not being used to carrying eleven children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thought Alexis decides to....</span></div></div>",

Alexis just finished her last class of the day taking up Commerce. Her college was nearby her home since she didn't want to leave her younger siblings. She had 2 younger siblings Aaron and Abigail. She also had a older sibling who was 25 years of age whose name is Alice. Since their parents were always away, the two older sister had to watch over their younger siblings. Though she couldn't enjoy hanging out wih her friends as much due to her sister's busy work schedule. She didn't mind it at all. Alice sometimes makes up for it during her day offs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alex! Wanna go catch a movie? Theres a new one today!\" said a brunette. She had blue eyes but was a bit shorter than Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that would be....\" Alexis said as she was cut off by her cellphone ringing. She answered the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Okay.. No don't have any plans. Yeah be home right away!\" Said Alexis as she turned off the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister? So you have babysitting duties? Thats such a bore.\" Said the brunette pouting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Alice always makes up for it. Besides I enjoy being with them, Aubrey.\" said Alexis smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should spend time with us more Alex. Its not healthy always being with your family.\" Aubrey said teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well maybe next time Aubrey! See ya!\" Said Alexis waving to Aubrey as she got on the bus. Aubrey just shrugging as she was approached by several of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis arrived at home in less than 10 minutes. She unlocked the door to be gretted by the youngest of the siblings, Abby or Abigail. Aaron was playing upstairs as she heard footsteps coming from there. She knew it was her sister and seemed to be in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here, Alice!\" Yelled Alexis as she saw her sister appear walking down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was just like Alexis but her hair was shoulder length. She had a higher nose but all in all a carbon copy of Alexis except she was more work oriented. She worked for a buisness firm in the city. She had a buisness attire on which was a brown coat with matching brown skirt. She had a gray blouse with a white tie on as she was in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sorry, Alexis. I know you probably wanted to hang out with your friends but this out of town meeting was such short notice.\" said Alice. There was a stroller bag waiting at the side of the door. Alice had  a meeting that would take the weekend. Not like Alexis had anything to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I'll leave you some money for the entire weekend. Don't worry I'll make up to you when I get back.\" She kissed Alexis. Aaron ran downstair as both he and Abby hugged her. There was a honk of the taxi outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and Alexis, lay off on the sugar. She'll keep you up all night if you eat too much.\" Alice said. Alice was 9 months pregnant with her daughter which she named Isabel or Izzy for short. One night stand during one of her buisness trips outside the state. She was excited to be a single mother but she needed to hide it for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well its now or never, Alexis. The cabs waiting outside!\" Alice said. Her belly stretching her blouse as bits of skin could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Izzy get ready for the leap!\" Alexis teased as she closed her eyes. The siblings watched Alice belly shrink as Alexis moaned a bit. Her T-shirt pushing outward as her belly expanded till it reached a full term. Alice breasts, butt and thighs began to shrink as her hips became smaller. Alexis grew accordingly till it had been fully transferred. Alice adjust her clothes as she kissed Alexis's belly before going out the door towards her cab. The three watched the cab go off before closing the door. Alexis carressed her belly as her niece kicked benath her hands. Her bra a bit tight as well as her denim shorts. Abby and Aaron went back to their rooms as Alexis waddled to their living room and plopped on the coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis had this ability though only a few months ago when she first discovered it. She accidently took Alice's pregnancy during a party where the whole family was invited. Curious to what Alice would feel being pregnant thus she became what she wanted to experience except for the two older sister freaking out a bit. Their mother explained this ability since her mother (thier grandmother) had the same ability but seemed to skip her and Alice and went to Alexis. They were from a secretive family called as the \"Unwanted Surrogates.\" Why? Since they took in pregnancy that nobody wanted and gave to those who needed. They disappeared during the Crusader Era since the church banded them as witches. Alexis is the only one with this ability and their family kept it amongest themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis enjoyed carrying her niece. It was a pleasant feeling of experiencing motherhood without the hassles of making your own. Though she knew her time with Izzy in her was shorter and shorter. She knew that Izzy enjoyed being in her as well. Alexis ordered chinese as the female delivery girl was a bit curious over her pregnancy. Alexis made up cover stories to hide her ability. Her sister Abby lover putting her head to her belly when Izzy was inside her. But for now she would enjoy this for the time being...</span></div></div>",

Alexis finally getting up, slowly made her way to the front door. Seeing Abby open the door slowly as an old woman opened the door. It was their grandmother Colleen. The one who had the same ability as Alexis though she doesn't use it anymore due to her old age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its grandma! Its grandma!!! She's here!!\" Abby screamed as she hugged her jumping up and down. Aaron ran downstairs and huuged their grandmother as well. Alexis stood their leaning on the sofa, making sure she wasn't seen outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh its so good to see my grandchildren so full of energy and spirit!\" She smiled as she kissed Abby's and Aaron's forehead. She waved to Alexis only to see her very pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Babysitting Isabel again?\" Colleen said looking at Alexis's pregnant form as she approached her and hugged. Colleen then looked at Alexis's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't wait for my great grandchild to come out soon.\" Colleen teased rubbing Alexis's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seems excited to meet you too grandma!\" Alexis said feeling Izzy kick about. They made their way to the living room where Alexis sat on the recliner while Colleen, Abby and Aaron sat on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice has another buisness trip doesn't she?\" Colleen asked as they all nodded. \"She really needs to relax. It unhealthy for her and her baby. Lucky you gained my ability for who knows what might be of Isabel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well she does make up for it.\" Alexis said as she cradled her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brings you here grandma?\" Abby asked Colleen as Colleen stroked Abby's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course to visit you but to ask Alexis something.\" Colleen said as a imaginary question mark appeared above Alexis's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it grandma?\" Alexis asked as she saw a look of concern on their grandmother's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what. Let's go out. I'm going to take you to a place where I need Alexis's help.\" Colleen said as she looked at Alexis. The two younger siblings jumped for joy as they got dressed while Alexis fetched her coat. Not only cause its cold but to hide her body. Their grandmother will drive as they made their way first to a restaurant and ate dinner. Making their way back to the car. Alexis couldn't help wondee what was up. As they drove off, Alexis asked their grandmother as the two played at the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need my help with grandma?\" She asked as Colleen looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you when we arrive. We're almost there.\" Colleen said. Alexis noticed they moving into the next town...</span></div></div>",

She parked the car as all four made their way to inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are doing here grandma?\" Abby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we get our booster shots.\" Aaron said teasing Abby as Abby looked at their grandmother with a scared look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it true what Aaron said? Huh grandma?\" Abby said tugging her grandmother's jacket. Their grandmother stroked her hair and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Aaron stop teasing your younger sister.\" Colleen said as Aaron chuckled to himself. \"Of course not. We're here to visit a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what kind of friend.\" Alexis thought as they made their way towards the I.C.U. ward of the hospital. There stood a man in a brown sweater. He looked to be in his early thirties had a clean look as well as his hairdue. He turned to see the four as he went to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So glad you could make it, Colleen.\"He said hugging Colleen. Aaron and Abby went to the both sides of Alexis, one in each of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise Steven. Oh these are my grandchildren. The eldest had a buisness trip to attend to. The two younger ones are Aaron and Abby and the older one is Alexis.\" Colleen said introducing th three to Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! I'm Steven Rauser. Pleased to meet you.\" He said with a smile with his right hand sticking out. Alexis shook it while the other two hid behind Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The two are a bit shy when meeting people.\" Alexis said rubbing the back of their necks. Steven then noticed something about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're pregnant? So Colleen you mean to say she is...\" Steven said looking at Colleen who smiled and nodded. Alexis looked at Steven then Colleen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.. Mr. Rauser knows about our secret?\" Alexis said furiously as her two younger siblings held her back. Colleen walked in between Steven and Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes he knows. Thats what I came to talk to you about.\" Colleen said, calming Alexis down. Colleen asked Abby and Aaron to go with the nurse on standby to the canteen,, leaving the three in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this about, grandma?\" Alexis asked with her arms crossed between her breasts and pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I can't use my ability only you can. Thats why I brought you here. Check behind that curtain and see for yourself.\" Colleen said shaking her head and sighing. Alexis walked towards the curtain and pulled it aside to see a very pregnant woman on the bed with a respirator. She had long golden blond hair and red lips. Beautiful in everyway but was asleep. Her belly seem to exceed her own a bit making Alexis estimate at least in the woman's late stages of her pregnancy...Her breasts larger than her own despite the gown she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with her?\" Alexis asked Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's been in a coma for at least 7 months. It was a few months in when we noticed she was pregnant. I watched it grow and now according to the doctor's its either I save her or her unborn children.\" Steven said as he started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horrible...\" Alexis said as she felt her grandmother's hand on her left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I brought you here. I need you to take her pregnancy until she awakens.\" Colleen said looking eye to eye with Alexis. Alexis was flustered. It was so sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how will I explain how I got pregnant so quickly? Its scientifically impossible and how did he know our secret?\" Alexis asked her grandmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it was Steven who wass the 1st time I used my powers on and his mother was my best friend told him about it. Now that she is gone and her son came to me for help. We just need you to carry her pregnancy. That's all there is to it.\" Colleen said blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gawd knows when she'll wake up!\" Alexis blurted out. Steven came to her, bended down on both knees while holding both of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please I beg of you.. I don't want to lose my wife and my kids. So please, I'll help you out with anything you will need!\" Steven cried to her. This was the first time anyone had done this to her. It was only brief time when she discovered her powers and now she needed to decide to save a life or not. She pondered as she stood there, looking at Steven and at his comatose wife...</span></div></div>",

She was worried how she suddenly got even more pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a cover up ready.\" Colleen said as Steven nodded. Alexis took a seat on the lounge chair near the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it heavy?\" Arron asked as both he and Abby sat on opposite sides of Alexis. Alexis could feel the two move about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is! The baby that Valerie had is bigger than Izzy!\" Abby answered. The cover there mouths as Alexis and Colleen made quiet gestures at them. The two siblings bickered quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll take the back door out. Call as soon as she has awakened!\" Colleen whispered. Steven nodded as he silently said thank you to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis had a hard time moving about but luckily they were able to make it back home. Alexis went to her room, leaving her two siblings with their grandmother. Alexis sat on her bed in awe in what she just did. She lifted her shirt which covered only half of her belly. Her breasts now at E cups in which dug into her D cup bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As always, no stretch marks.\" Alexis murmured as she drew circles around her shiny, round belly. The feeling of bliss with life swimming inside of her caused her drowsiness as she laid on her pillow, sleeping on her right side and slowly went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

It can't get any more normal than having a scientist for a neighbor. Her name was Ms. Jackson, she had two year old girl and had the next one on the way. Ms. Jackson's husband left 9 months ago, when he learn she was pregnant again. Guess he couldn't handle two kids, Ms. Jackson was down for a while but got back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Jackson worked at the research center in the center of the town. It was average sized. What was strange were the rumors of the experiments that they did there. She must've been paid well for she owned a large or medium sized house in the country, about 2 hour drive from work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis had known her for most of her life, from when she moved in to when Alice began high School. She was kind hearted but when she talk of her work, she seemed like a mad Scientist. Ms. Jackson stood at 5 ft. 9 in, and has weight in the right places. Also she had a busting G cups breasts from her breastfeeding her two year old and making more for the newcomer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in a while, she would ask Alexis to babysit for her as she rests from her shifts at work. Alexis guessed it was hard for her and felt like she needed to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne rainy day, when Alexis returned from school and began her Christmas break. She just opened the door of her house when she heard the phone going off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis's family owned a large house, not like a mansion but bigger than a normal house would be. It was a light gray and blue on the outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the phone and answered, \"Hello?\", she said, \"Hey Alice! Ms. Jackson here, I was wondering if you could watch my daughter for a few hours. While I sleep, I had a late shift again plus my baby isn't making it easier\". she finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I'll be right over\", Alexis said, \"Thank you so much for this, I'll be laying down by the time you get here, see you soon.\" She ended the call. Alexis thought, \"Well, lets go!\" as she puts her stuff in her room, leaves and locks the door. She walked about 5 to 6  minutes to get to Ms. Jackson's home. When Alexis enters it is quiet,except for the light snoring coming from up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, she's out.\" Alexis thought. She'd better check on the child. She walks up the stairs, passing photos of Ms. Jackson and the others. She reached the top and looks down the hallway. To the left is Ms. Jackson's room and to the far right is the nursery. Walking, Alexis hears the snoring and opens the door to the left and enters quietly. Seeing Ms. Jackson laying on her bed, the room was larger then most bedrooms she been in but it was nice. At the far corner was a work table with many devices that glowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking, Alexis looks at Lisa, Ms. Jackson first name. The blanket was over her feet, Lisa was only wearing underwear with no top at all. Feeling embarrassed, she starts to leave but Lisa moved her legs as she stopped moving and waited. Alexis sighed in relief that she was not awake. Moving closer, she looks at Lisa's large pregnant belly and breasts. \"Maybe I can touch it\" Alexis thought as she placed her hand on Lisa's belly and feeling the unborn move a bit. Alexis smiled and took her hand off. Alexis looked back at the table and went towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the devices was a small circle with a button in the middle, curiously she pressed it. A wave energy flows into her hands. Pulling back quickly and seeing that the device is dead and it no longer had its glow to it. \"I better not mess with any of her stuff\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis walked back to Lisa sleeping and place her hand on her belly. But suddenly she feels the energy in her hand again and watched as Lisa's pregnant belly deflates until it was gone. \"What?!? How?!?\" as a strange feeling comes to Alexis as she leaves and goes back into the hall, \"What happened?\" she whispered. She felt her belly and breasts expand slowly as it quickly speeds up to the point of 9 months like Lisa had as it rips her shirt and shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her shorts fall off, now she was half naked and pregnant. \"What am I going to do?\" she thought while rubbing her belly. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Her professor was able to get her to be an assistant to a popular scientist who was working on a method of teleporting live beings using an artificial wormhole. This was Dr. Denise Pointdexter, a medium brown haired woman who was in her mid thirties expecting her first child soon though a single mother. She had the money to support her but the time would be something else. She had an amazing crew as well as the government's finance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis wore a light blue turtle neck sweater with dark denim pants and slip on leather shoes. She had to wear a hard hat and protective goggles like the other scientist. She was assisting Dr. Pointdexter with the large CPU that was in the dead center of the compound. On each side were two what seemed like landing pads with grids top and bottom. There was a lot of large wiring and large cables about. The professor had been on work on this project for at least two years when a breakthrough came when they were able to transfer a potted plant from one pad to the other. It was unaffected by the wormhole and other effects that would cause it to stand still like the chronosphere. This one was more compact but had several safety features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis give me the tablet connected to the main CPU.\" said Denise as Alexis did so. They were going to experiment using a live sheep as the guinea pig this time around. Everyone was excited as Alexis. Denise signaled the start up as she pressed a few things on the digital pad. The machine sprang to life as the turbines hummed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All systems go on this end.\" said one male scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All go here!\" said the other male scientist on the other side of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm lucky to have this job and to be with you Dr. Pointdexter. I've learned a lot and am grateful from the bottom of my heart.\" Alexis said beside Denise who smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm lucky to have you as an assistant. One who enjoys this field of work and I hope I can hire you after you graduate from college.\" said Denise as she wrapped her arm around Alexis's left arm. Alexis smiled knowing she would have a job after she graduates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has the distortion bracelet been attached to the sheep?\" asked Denise \"Its important so that it doesn't become affect by the jump it will perform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it so important, Dr. Pointdexter?\"\" asked Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will protect it from particles that will freeze it since it disturbs time itself. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the teleportation is successful as our theory dictates.\" said Denise as she pointed it out on the tablet she was holding towards Alexis. Denise saw the thumbs up by one of the female scientists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!! Commence the test!!! Real Live Jump!!! Initiate!!!\" said Denise as the turbines increased as electric currents could be seen surrounding the pads where the sheep were in. The sheep panicked but are unable to get out. Just as the teleportation was to take place....</span></div></div>",

People started running around trying to shut off the machine but a large debri hit both the CPU and the control switch for the power as it started emitting a high pitched scream. Nearly everyone was capasitated by the scream, covering their ears. No one could her who as the machine vibrated violently.<br>\r\nAlexis struggled towards Dr. Denise who was with a couple of her team but on accident, was bumped by one of the larger engineers into the teleportation pad. There were no sheep but the system had initiated the program. Denise tried to scream at Alexis who was struggling to get out but then a large EM pulse erupted from the main CPU knocking everyone out causing a large power outage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a few hours since the catastrophic earthquake hit. The city had been devastated as Red Cross and the National Guard were deployed to help the city. Cries and yelps were heard all around. Helicopters, jets, trucks running about as well. The group had been successfully rescued as their building was able to withstand the quake were all at the mini hospital that the government had set up. Many of them had bruises, cuts, broken arms but all nothing serious. Dr. Pointdexter was waiting for Alexis to awaken from her slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis groaned as she opened her eyes to see a dark green colored tarp above her. Still dazed, she saw a dextrose attached to her and saw Dr. Denise above her in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God your alright!\" said Denise as she broke into tears. \"I thought you were going to be comatose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" said Alexis feeling dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its best you don't move Ms.Kingsley.\" said the female doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I seem fine doctor.\" said Alexis feeling unusually heavy for thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may be but we're still observing you.\" said the female doctor patting her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis startled with the unusual jolt she got when the doctor patted her belly. With that she uncovered her sheet to reveal the unexpected. She looked near full term with her breasts which have grown to full E cups. Dr. Denise adjusted her bed so she could sit near upright. Alexis explored her body as even her butt and hips have grown a lot as well. She was knocked out of her trance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels good doesn't it Alexis?\" said Dr. Denise as Alexis looked at the professor and was shocked to see she wasn't pregnant! Its like they switched bodies during that time when the machine exerted a EM pulse knocking everyone senseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But how can that be? It should transfer live beings not a woman's pregnancy.</i>\" thought at Alexis as she looked at Dr. Denise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you?!? Are you hurt, Dr. Pointdexter!\" said Alexis grabbing her hand as Denise rubbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Alexis. I'm was worried about you as was the whole team. We luckily got it out with minor scratches and bruises but no casualties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... about this.\" asked Alexis worried as she rubbed underneath her belly.</span></div></div>",

Her mother's side had the ability to see and communicate while her father's had the ability to be possessed by ghosts who want to communicate. She had both though she chose to ignore it to her best. She wanted a normal life. Luckily her 14 year old brother didn't get neither of their parents ability. How she wished she was in her brother's shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a winter day. The snow covered the streets. She wore a white turtle neck sweater with brown pants and black boots. She wore a scarf around her neck as she walked home from college. But as she reached a pathway which had a large footbridge above. It was quite dark but nothing she should be afraid of as she continued walking. Hoisting her bag over her shoulder. She fixed her hair into a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached the halfway point of the path. She began sense something strange. She knew her sixth sense was kicking in as he turned around to see what it was. One thing , it was sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've walked this path several times but why do I sense a ghost now?\" Alexis thought. As she turned once more, there she saw what looked like a girl about her age. She had short brown hair had a long white maternity gown. What stood out most she was heavily pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've always ignored me...\" Said the ghost.. This startled Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I really don't like using my....powers...\" Alexis said in a irritated tone. She felt more sadness from the ghost. Curiously she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me... But who are you? And why do you haunt this place?\" Alexis asked blantly. The ghost looked at her with a sad expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I don't know who I am.. How I got here or how I died.\" The ghost said as she kneeled and covered her hands on her head as she cried. Alexis now felt sorry for the ghost as she approached it and kneeled before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should help this one... Just this one..\" Alexis said. Alexis's parents had always taught her how to use their abilities knowing she would inherit one of their gifts. They just didn't realize that she gained both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help you out.\" Alexis said. Stroking the head of the ghost as it looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\" Asked the ghost in a confused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uh... Just enter my body. Its called possession. But I should be able to probe into your memories. I'll be in control though of my body. If anything comes into mind then tell me in my head.\" Alexis said as she and the ghost stood up. Alexis opened her arms as the ghost nodded and walked into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis felt the ghost possess her as she closed her eyes. She tried to probe into its memories but came in blank. This puzzled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird.It should've worked.\" Thought Alexis as she heard a voice in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What didn't work?\" Asked the female ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probing into your memories... Its either you've been dead for quite so time or something else.\" Alexis thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\" Asked the ghost in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have to research on anything that might tell something about you. I don't want my parents knowing what I'm doing. I'll never hear the end of it.\" Alexis pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... If anything comes into mind I'll tell you.\" The female ghost said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you do that. It'll help a lot.\" Alexis said as she opened her eyes. \"Mine as well get this done and over with.\" She thought as she took a step forward, only to stumble by her new center gravity. She put her hand on the wall to keep her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gives?\" Alexis yelled as she looked at her body, only to be in awe to see she was pregnant! She seemed to be...</span></div></div>",

Unless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Unless?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Alexis creased her brow in thought. If they had no reliable leads on which to gather information, and her parents weren't home, then they had only one option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to my dad's study!\" Alexis declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh? Your father has information about me there?</i> The ghost asked, a bit surprised that a medium like Alexis's dad would devote a page in any of his compendiums for such a common spirit as herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite.\" Alexis giggled, amused at how the ghost seemed almost embarrassed at having a medium record data on her, \"I think I may know something that can help us though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe excitement of her epiphany was so great that Alexis had nearly forgotten that she was pregnant when she tried to take off running. This worked for about half a step before she nearly fell over for a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right...\" she muttered dryly, \"pregnant with twins...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Once again, I apologize...</i> the ghost meekly chimed in with a nervous chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no biggie...\" Alexis sighed, before taking a few tentative practice steps, only to find that she was now reduced to a slow waddle, \"just gotta get used to this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long trek back, Alexis finally made it back inside her house, though not without the toll of exhaustion due to her new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, and my mom did this twice? She-\" Alexis groaned, arching her sore back before she felt a satisfying <i>pop</i>, \"-ah there we go- is completely nuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>To be fair, she did have nine months to adjust, and was only carrying one each time.</i> The ghost pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touche...\" Alexis snorted, before placing her hands on her belly' \"I'm still saying she's crazy though for doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh come now Alexis it really isn't too bad once you become accustomed to it!</i> The ghost defended, before giggling, <i> besides, I think the maternal look suits you quite well!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blech! Thanks but no thanks!\" Alexis blanched as she continued down the hallway into her dad's office that connected to his study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter passing through her Dad's office, she finally came to an ornate doorway through which Alexis knew lay what she was looking for. As intimidating as the door looked, Alexis was a woman on a mission and went right on through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter passing through, Alexis and her passenger came to small room that gave off a comfortable vibe, containing nothing but two leather lounge chairs, a few shelves filled with books, and a painting or two on the wall that Alexis paid no heed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My, how quaint!</i> The ghost cheerily chimed in, <i>I suppose you know what you're looking for in here then?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...sort of.\" Alexis hesitantly admitted, \"I know my Dad talked a few times before about using a more advanced technique called the 'soul union' or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Would that technique be able to help us here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe so, since Dad usually used it whenever he needed to find out more about the ghost but didn't have time to do research on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Splendid! I suppose we should start looking for it then!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Let's get looking!\" Alexis cheered confidently, before waddling towards the first bookshelf nearest to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour of searching...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'The Union of Souls,' yup! This should be it!\" Alexis smiled, before sitting down to give her tired legs a desperately needed break from the action. \"Let's see...warnings, warnings, blah blah blah...\" Alexis muttered as she skimmed through the pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Are you sure you shouldn't read the warnings?</i> The ghost advised anxiously, <i>this is an intermediate technique after all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, I'm sure the warnings are just saying not to use it with multiple ghosts at once or something.\" Alexis scoffed dismissively. \"Besides, Dad did this before without the manual and he was nust fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I suppose if you are sure...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I'm sure!\" Alexis tried to say confidently, but couldn't help the sense of unease that was starting to form. \"Okay, so all we have to do is draw this double rectangle symbol on both my arms...\" she paused, before getting a piece of her chalk attached to the manual and drew the symbol as instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, it says we both chant the words sirce tet el thum at the same time...\" Alexis finished, before setting the book down. \"Well, I suppose that's simple enough! Ready ghost mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I am still uncertain that we might be taking a risk here, but I suppose so.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the ticket!\" Alexis smiled, \"okay, on the count of three! One! Two! Three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sirce tet el thum!\"<br>\r\n<i>Sirce tet el thum!</i> They both shouted in unision. Alexis braced herself for something, anything to happen as soon as they finished the chant. However, after a few moments, she unclenched her jaw and looked around awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...I guess it didn't-Woah!\" Alexis suddenly clutched her head as a wave of intense dizziness hit her, blurring her vision considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Alexis!</i> The ghost cried out, <i>are you-Oh!</i> The ghost stopped midsentence as she too felt the effects of the union taking place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. Is. This?!?\" Alexis tried to scream, but only managed a pained whisper as she tried to get up, but lost her balance and fell on her knees, eventually flopping to on her back on the cold wooden floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs moments felt like hours the two could only describe the sensation of as one of being pulled apart, and then suddenly feeling as though two beings were forced inside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And not in the same way as before!</i> Alexis thought ruefully, before blearily looking at her belly with concern to make sure she hadn't hurt the children when she fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments the pain, dizziness, and blurred vision finally subsided, giving way to a feeling that gave both girls a sense of clarity, as though their body was whole once again, though in a more...complete sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Is it over?\" Alexis asked herself shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I-I believe so...however that was...quite the experience...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no kidding...\" Alexis groaned, \"now if it's okay with you a nap sounds great right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Agreed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then, night night.\" Alexis groaned one last time before she almost passed out, but not before giving her belly one last loving rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok...\" Alexis cooed reassuringly, \"it's ok...Mommy is r<i>ight here...</i>\" Then, Alexis felt her head drop as she finally passed out, exhausted from the ritual she'd gone through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, had Alexis stopped to read the warnings in the book about the ritual, she would have found some jarring phrases in the third chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne read: <b>Warning: May cause a loss of consciousness if medium is not fully prepared or has practiced the gradual unionization of the souls to be merged.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second read: <b>Warning: If the union is not canceled within one hour then appearance and personality changes may begin to occur, and will continue until the soul is put to rest.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final read: <b>Warning: If soul is not put to rest withing 5 days then any and all transformations to the body and mind will be <i>permanent!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after an hour or so of unconsciousness, Alexis awoke to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking around groggily, she noted that she was still in her father's study, the manual that was previously used lying closed on the ground next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I sure hope that worked...\" Alexis muttered, gritting her teeth as she shakily rose to her feet, \"otherwise we gained nothing from this headache.\" Bending down slowly, she picked up the manual and placed it back on the bookshelf she had initially grabbed it from, and slowly made her way out of the room. After entering the living room and finally falling with a huff on the couch she looked towards a nearby window to see that the sky was already tinged with a dull pink glow, signaling that the sun had almost set completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Weird</b></i> Alexis thought to herself, <i><b>mom and dad are usually home by now, what's keeping them?</b></i> Alexis pulled out her phone and sent a quick text to her mom asking where they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ohhh...what a dreadful experience that was...</i> Alexis jumped slightly, before remembering that she still had another passenger in her besides the ones currently contained within her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I agree, but welcome back I guess.\" Alexis chuckled sympathetically as she heard the fatigue laced within the ghost's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, did the ritual work as intended?</i> The ghost inquired, making Alexis frown as she realized that she hadn't really thought of a way to test if the ritual had worked or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...as far as I know my dad always used the ritual to fill in any memory gaps while looking for information, so let's start there.\" Alexis decided, \"do you remember anything about who you were or what happened to you before you died?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Faintly, it's faint, and very hard to put together, but I can remember something,</i> the ghost replied, <i>I remember that my name was Maria Castillo, and that's the only thing I can clearly remember for now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not much, but it's a start.\" Alexis muttered, \"but where do we go from here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe we could try looking for my name at different places where records of citizens are kept?</i> The ghost suggested, <i>there should be a few places like that nearby no?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a stretch, but we could try the library or city hall, we've got time left in the day for either one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, I'll leave it up to you then, after all, since it's the weekend we can try the other location tomorrow.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then, in that case let's get dressed first, after all this outfit doesn't fit me much anymore...\" Alexis looked down at her t-shirt, which left her bare twin-filled belly exposed for the world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What's wrong with this outfit? I don't think showing your belly is that bad is it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...no,\" Alexis paused, scratching her head in embarrassment, \"but if someone I know sees me with a huge pregnant belly out of nowhere that'll attract unwanted attention for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good point!</i> Maria hummed in agreement, <i>well if I'm correct, then your mother should have clothes that fit right? She's your size after all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that?\" Alexis grunted as she heaved herself up off of the couch with a herculean effort, one hand pressed into her back as she stretched, \"ugh, God how did you handle this back pain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You get used to it,</i> Maria giggled, <i>but as to how I know? Well I'm able to see your memories, just as you are able to see mine, which I suppose is an effect of the soul link.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense.\" Alexis shrugged as she entered her parents' bedroom. Once in their she searched through her mother's clothing meticulously, her frustration mounting as she realized her mother, while close to her size, didn't carry anything baggy enough to hide her gravid form. Eventually she ended up deciding on a pair of gray sweatpants, one of her mother's maternity shirts she had kept from her own pregnancies, and one of her father's hoodies, which with her belly ended up fitting just fine while mostly hiding her swollen stomach from any passerbys. After putting on everything, Alexis took a second to check herself in the mirror to make sure it looked okay. However, as she studied her form, she noticed something odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd...I'm a natural blond...\" she muttered, taking a few tentative steps closer to the mirror, \"so how did <i>those</i> get there?\" She grabbed the offending strands of hair at the front that were colored jet black as opposed to the rest of her hair, which was a golden blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I concur,</i> Maria thought, <i>after all, your little brother couldn't have done this since he isn't home, and nobody else came in either.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, questions for later I guess,\" Alexis sighed, letting the black strands fall back into place as she exited the room and made her way outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So where to Alexis?</i> Maria inquired as her host waddled down the street towards the center of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...let's go to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Her breasts wobwobbled as she tried to regain balance. Putting her left hand on her lower back while the right was on the table. She grew irritated by the balancing act she had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is annoying...\" She mummbled to herself as she slowly walked out of her father's study and went to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, Alexis. You are going to have to get used to it. I might be here inside you for a while.</i>\" said the ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to remind me....\" Alexis mummbled once more. \"I need to change my clothes first.\" As she did so. She grew even more fustrated as none of her clothes fit. Despite being in her underwear,which was granny panties and a sports bra,  she slowly walked to her parents bedroom. There she picked out from her mother's closet, stretchable black denim pants, a large white sleeved T-shirt but wore a hoodie sweater. She took her father's large brown trenchcoat to cover herself. Satisfied with her look, she grabbed her stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What about your younger brother?</i>\" asked the ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just text him to stay at the neighbor's place till I get home. His best friend is our neighbor. I'll pick him up if we cane get some information from the police.\" Alexis said as she exited their home and locked it. She text her brother as she approached the bus stop. She got on the bus and it didn't take long for her to reach the police station from her bus stop. What seemed like a short walk, somewhat drained Alexis of her stamina as she walked up the steps to the police station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so much work...\" She grumbled. She heard the ghost giggle with a cheery mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police station was like any other police station. Help desk, the prison was at the back, detective desks were at the right of the entrance. Uniformed police wandered about. Alexis one where to go. So she went left. It didn't take long for her to reach the missing persons division. It was there she saw the man her father helped with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Officer Rick Dante. A cacausian male who was bald. He was a good friend of her father's long before she was born. He was surprised to see her there as she slowly sat down. Her trenchcoat covering her pregnant form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Alexis! What bring you here?\" Rick asked as he turned his attention from his work to Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle Rick, I need information on missing females. Its part of my father's case he left me with apparently.\" Alexis said as she rolled her eyes, hoping he would bite her lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing! I owe your father a lot for those unsolved missing people.\" Rick said with delight. Alexis sighed in relief as he presented her a laptop with what she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are all the cases, new and old. Knock yourself out!\" Rick said in a joking manner but noticed Alexis was already at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime flew by as he bought her some snacks and hot chocolate. She grew more and more frustrated with the searches became more and more fruitless. It was already late when she finished as she thanked Uncle Rick. And exited the police station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn that was pointless..... I didn't find anything that fits you.\" She pouted. She rubbed her belly slightly as she slowly walked towards the bus stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Why not try those techniques your father uses? It might just work.</i>\" the ghost said with enthusiasm. Alexis only sighed as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my second option. I'm sure I'll get results with that.\" Alexis smiled.... As she approached the bus stop..</span></div></div>",

Curious, she went to her bed where her bag was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Better not be a rat.</i>\" Alexis thought bending over as she emptied the contents on the bed. Then like a heavy weight lifted, it landed on the bed. Alexis stared at it in disbelief and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Green in color. It didn't have any eyes but it looked like a shuckle without its shell from Pokemon. Her younger sister Alice, plays Pokemon most of the time. It was quite large that by Alexis's estimate, if it curled up it would be a bit bigger than a basketball. The creature stood up on all fours. It had twin tails and what seemed like a head looked up at her curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Where did you come from?\" Alexis said as she looked at it too. They seemed to stare eye to eye. She slowly petted it with her right hand. It was cold and somewhat slippery. It seemed like a timid creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way you're an octopus. And there are no known tentacle animals that live on land. A new species or alien?\" She asked as the creature nodded in response. Alexis found it interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! You can understand me?\" Alexis said as it nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>An animal that can understand the human language easily.</i>\" Alexis thought. Just then she heard a door slam shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis? We're home!\" Said voice which she knew was her mother Jenny. She heard a lot of footsteps which she knew was her two younger siblings, Alice and Baron. Baron was 12 while Alice was 10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's probably in her room!\" Alice said as the footsteps came closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" Alexis said as she looked at the creature.\" If they find out your here. Who knows what they will do to you!\" As the creature tilted it's head at her. Alexis rushed to the door and took a quick peek as she saw the two coming towards her room. Alexis bent over<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hide!\" Alexis yelled. As she seemed back at her slightly opened door. The creature nodded and turned into a geltin-like snake and slithered towards Alexis as Alexis was at her door. From the bed to the floor it's slowly coiled up her thigh. Alexis with a question mark on top of her head, wondered what it was doing. Then the unthinkable happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature slipped past her panties and into her womanhood as she gasped and slammed the door shut. Putting all her weight on the door. She bit her lip as she face became best red. She could feel her belly push out as the creature continued to enter Alexis. Bigger and heavier her belly got as her knees wobbled to keep balance. Soon enough the creature was fully inside Alexis as she was in shock at what had just occurred. She slowly turned and leaned on her door as she looked down at her large belly. Putting her hands on it, she found it firm, taut and smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a pregnant belly.\" Alexis said. \"It didn't just make me pregnant...\" As she heard a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis? You in there? Let me in!\" Said Alice as Alexis was knocked out of her stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm changing, Alice. Wait in your room till I call you!\" Alexis said. She heard a faint okay as she sighed. She took a step forward only to stumbled at her new found weight. She felt really heavy as she stumbled to her closet. She picked out a large t-shirt she uses for sleep and nylon shorts. She arched her back as she looked at her full length mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Damn, I'm huge!</i>\" Alexis thought as she turned to measure herself. Her belly totally stood out of her body. It look like she was way overdue with one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Great, How am I gonna explain this?</i>\" She thought as she had both hands behind her back while looking at her humongous belly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only annoying thing is her male co-workers hitting on her. Though her parents are rich, she refuses to ask money from them. Staying at her maternal grandparents place which is located in the farm area of the country. She had gotten used to this farm life, disliking the city life she once lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver has two younger siblings Jared and Ruby who are on vacation somewhere in Europe with their parents. Her father is a well-known astronomer and her mother an expert on biological life forms that can exists on the other planets. Silver had always had this fascination with aliens ever since middle school. Watching alien movies, both horror and other types. Believing that there is life in space, she will soon get her encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 9 p.m. Overtime due to inventory at the place she works. Silver was driving along peacefully along the 2 lane road. Missing her siblings but rebellious to her parents, she began to ponder if she was satisfied with what she was doing. She took a break along the highway and parked her car near a tree and did some star gazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really wish there was some proof that there is life besides us in the universe.

Boy am I lucky to see this!\" as she gazed at the white ball of rock, flying across the atmosphere.It seemed to be coming closer and closer towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That's odd defense should've shot it down by now. Either that or it should've burned in the atmosphere.</i>\" Silver thought looking at the meteorite coming down. It was quite large and it was quite apparent it was coming if not towards but near her!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Crap!\" yelled Silver as she jumped to the side of her pickup truck, hands held above her head, praying that she'd survive this impact as the scream of the meteorite could be heard. But for some strange reason, it curved and landed a few feet away from her. The impact was strong but it didn't seem to disturb the cattle nearby. Baffled Silver checked herself to find she's still alive but felt a cold essence coming from the other side of her truck. She peeked around the corner to see what looked like a white glowing, silver spacecraft the size of a small car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my G*D! Its an actual UFO!\" said Silver as she grabbed her thin white sweater to put on as she approached the spacecraft. It was like a teardrop shape, complete with what seemed like afterburners as it was still humming. It crashed landed from the looks of it. Silver slowly approached it as it made a strange noise and opened up. Nothing but a yellow light and fog coming from it. Curious Silver approached it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this is for real. This can't be a hoax! Who cares what space sickness I get. I have to see what kind of alien this is!\" said Silver. Too bad her cellphone was out of battery in which she cursed in secret. Silver was now at what seemed to be the cockpit as she heard a moan. Her heart pounded as she looked into the spacecraft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Will it attack me? Is it hostile? Will it understand me?</i>\" thought Silver as what she saw was unlike whatever movie she had seen. It was a tan colored humanoid that seemed to be liquid or slime. It had curves what seemed to be like eyes and a mouth but it seemed to be injured somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay? Can you understand me?\" said Silver looking at it. \"<i>What are you thinking, Silver? Of course it wouldn't understand you! It speaks a language unknown to us!</i>\" she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\"><i>Yes I understand you. But.. I cannot speak, only through telepathy I can communicate with you clearly.</i></span>\" it said. Silver startled but knowing aliens may have this ability, she began to speak through her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Where are you from? What are you? You seem hurt... are you okay?</i>\" Silver asked the alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\"><i>I am from a galaxy, much older than yours. I am what you may call a humannoid slime. Our true name cannot be spoken in your tongue. I have no name and Yes I am badly wounded. No medicines can help me from your planet. But I am here to save my kind.</i></span>\" said the alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Save your kind? Are you guys extinct or something?</i>\" Silver asked in curious of her new found friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\"><i>We are a peaceful kind till another alien race came to our planet and harvested us and took over our planet. It is as beautiful as this one. They made us into delicacies and we were few left, made us into trophies for alien collectors like the one I had escaped from.</i></span>\" said the alien in a sad tone. Silver could not help but be sad as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>So you escaped here, seeking refuge?</i>\" Silver asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\"><i>Yes, but I know human will experiment on me though I don't have much time left. I must escape this planet before any hunters find me.</i></span>\" it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You mean the one's that imprisoned you? I can hide you here with me!</i>\" Silver said hoping she could now have the alien friend she had always dreamed of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\"><i>I'm sorry but I am badly wounded, beyond help but seeing you as a kind human unlike others I have heard about. I will ask you a great favor.</i></span>\" it said seemingly what was like a dying breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Anything! I'll help you out. Just tell me.</i>\" Silver said in tears. This is the least she could do for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\"><i>You humans have the ability to incubate eggs in your body. I have whats left of my family in me. They need a fertile womb in which you humans have which is ideal. May I ask you to carry them till one of my kind finds you. They cannot survive yet in this world but if others like me find you then it can be possible.</i></span>\" it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Its okay by me! It will be an honor saving your kind and giving them a new home.</i>\" Silver said in tears. Feeling a calm pleasant aura from the alien in what seems to be a smile from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\"><i>Then let us begin the transfer. It will only hurt a little.</i></span>\" it said. Silver saw within its body many orbs as it came out of its ship. The height only up to her belly button but somewhat transparent. Silver had to take off her pants and underwear in which she blushed a bit but noticing the thick fog the spaceship was creating she began to relax a little.Then it began its transfer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver winced a bit as the alien created a tentacle, slowly entering her womanhood, past her cervix and to her uterus. The next sensation was something attaching to her uterus. She never felt pain whatsoever. Looking at the alien, the orbs seemed to be the size of ping pong balls. In a slow stream being pumped into her uterus. She felt aroused as she placed her hands on her belly as it slowly grew, larger and round with each pump. Soon enough the alien had pumped all the eggs into her. Silver a bit dizzy as she slowly put her underwear and pants back on, watched as the alien slowly crawled back into its spaceship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What are you going to do now?</i>\" Silver asked holding her baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\"><i>I will lead them away from here so they can't find you. I hope others like me who survived will come in contact with you. Till then be safe. It was nice meeting you.</i></span>\" it said as it's spaceship closed. Silver could only watch in tears as it disappeared into the cosmos, leaving the crater it had created. Waddling back to her truck, she began to explore the eggs she now carries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver lifted up her sweater and shirt and noticed how the eggs made bumps across her belly. Sensitive to touch as she felt somewhat \"pregnant\" as her belly looked at least 6 months pregnant. She must've at least be carrying 100 of them. Driving away back to her grandparent's home, she was able to get back safe and sound where she was soon fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile there were police, military, and news people at the crash site. The scientist on site baffled why there are no traces of meteorite. Some theorize aliens and others a military weapon gone haywire. Only Silver knew what really happened as she lay to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile somewhere in outer space, hunters had captured the alien spacecraft only to find the humanoid dead. A slam of metal could be heard as what seemed like toad-like alien in royal clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is its eggs? Those are what cost a fortune to the Maktuhms!\" said the toad-like alien as he was carrying a staff of sorts. They were riding a large spaceship. Two armored clad aliens walked forth and bowed before the toad-like alien. One was like a lizard with a human body and the other a boar with a human body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better explain yourselves,Dranzer and Dozer. You aren't the best monster hunters are you not?\" said the toad-like alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Sir Exselor!\" We didn't expect to fly this way. Its other siblings what you may call have flown in different directions. We decided to follow what seemed to be their leader.\" said Dranzer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You found it alright! Without the eggs! How am I to profit without the eggs! Find out where it landed and search there.\" said Exselor. As they bowed and teleported from sight. The toad looked at the empty display case in anger.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been exactly a week since the whole ordeal. She met an alien and got impregnated by one in turn to save an alien race from extinction. She was now officially pregnant. Her breasts had grown to a full E cup. Her belly, once riddle with bumps was now a firm sphere. Even her butt, hips and thighs gained as well. Silver had to wear long clothes in the summer heat to hide the bump. She would say \"she had gained some weight\" but it was an understatement on her part. She had gained at least 20 pounds since then. Silver now waited for the alien's surviving siblings to come and get it from her though she knew she would be giving birth to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver wearing a long red t-shirt with stretchable denim pants and low cut shoes. Pondered when she would see aliens again and hopefully stay here and become friends with them. Daydreaming till her work buddy Katherine knocked her out of her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her Silver! Wakey wakey! Can't do that on the job.\" said Kat a 20 year old brunette whose hair extended past her ears. She stood about 5'2 and was Chinese. They had been friends since Silver was little and played around the farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your such a bore. No customers so far.\" Silver said with a pouty face leaning her left hand which was on the table. Kat could only laugh at Silver's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! Lighten up! Customers or none, we still get payed! Its either your in a bad mood or you're really pregnant!\" said Kat as she sneaked behind Silver and grabbed her belly. Silver immediately swatted her hands and moved away from Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'm not pregnant! Its fat! Stop asking me.\" said Silver. As she wondered around the store with Kat side by side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay sorry! I'll drop it. Hey why don't we go to the star gazing festival tonight? Who knows? We might see some aliens!\" Kat said rubbing her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please! Like what are the odds in that?\" said Silver as she leaned her right shoulder on the wall, crossing her arms across her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a KJ! You know that. I'd like to believe your hiding an alien inside you!\" said Kat eyeing her belly. In which Silver flustered as she hid her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's gotten into y-you? Stop dreaming!!! Okay I'll go with you to the festival!\" said Silver as she went to the cashier's table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Just kidding! Don't be a spoil sport! being impregnated by aliens? Pffft. Who'd believe that?\" said Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If only you knew.</i>\" thought Silver as they finished their job and soon enough it was night fall. A lot of people in the open field where the crash site was. Canvases of \"UFO this, Aliens that\". Gov't owned mini learning center that explains the universe, meteors, asteroids, and if there is life outside of Earth. Silver knew she had living proof right in her belly. Kat talked and talked as Silver looked up at the starry sky. Hoping that they would she get in contact with someone like \"it again.\" Soon enough it was late, Kat had left home early leaving Silver who dozed off at the back of her pickup. Wearing a jacket, white t-shirt, denim shorts and flip flops. She yawned as she slowly got up and saw nearly the whole area devoid of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine as well pack up too.\" she said as she jumped from her truck and looked up at the sky once more to see.....</span></div></div>",

Staying calm and cool, she watched it as it came closer and closer. It was glowing white and seemed a lot larger than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This must be its siblings.</i>\" thought Silver as she patted her belly a bit sad as they will be carrying their kind for such a short time. Unfortunately unlike before, it came in with a bang! As Silver was knocked back to her truck, landing on her butt. Still conscious, she rubbed her neck and her back as she slowly stood up. The plum of dust and the mystic fog covered her surroundings. Her heart racing, her wish had come true. But was it the same as before or a new race that had run away from that mean collector and its cohorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing from the plump of smoke, she could see a shadow form in the cloud of dust...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\"><i>Are you Silver Paxson?</i></span>\" said a voice she heard in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes I am who are you?</i>\" thought Silver as they were contacting once more through telepathy.

She seemed to see a large mass as big as herself. Her heart paced faster as she took deep breaths to calm herself. It was just like the last one that she met. The alien that was slime humanoid. It was a bit more tannish in color but the same but twice as big. It approached her as it emitted a kind, gentle aura just like the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Yes, you are as the elder described.<i></i></span>\" it said glowing as it now stood before her. Silver noticed it had a lot of glowing orbs inside of it. If not twice or thrice the amount in her. Rubbing her belly, not wanting to part ways with them. She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you here for the eggs of your Elder?\" she asked out loud knowing that it would reply back to her telepathically. It took a long pause. Still glowing, emitting the kind aura. Getting nervous once more, she began to ponder what it was thinking then it answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\"><i>No, Silver. It is quite the opposite. I'm sorry to say the Elder didn't make it but he died before getting captured.</i></span>\" it said as there was somewhat of a sad aura. She sighed as she patted the large slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay. No worries. I'm carrying the Elder's family in me. I'll do my best to protect it until you make the choice to either stay here or find a more suitable planet.\" said Silver touching the alien. It was cold due to the change in mood since mentioning the death of their Elder. But its reassuring that there are survivors that escaped the grasp of the collector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess that means... You're the new leader?\" Silver said. But the alien made no gestures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\"><i>Maybe if that is what you call it. But until his family is born, I am what you call a substitute.</i></span>\" its said, its aura changing to a kind aura once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you're here for the opposite reason. Aren't you guys hiding at the moment? And whats with you carrying so many of your kind.?\" Silver asked a bit puzzled but feeling that she knows why it is here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\"><i>No need to hide for the moment since the Elder sent them quite far. Its the bounty hunters that are the problem. I am currently finding other survivors that had escaped. We all escaped but went different ways. It should take some time but I'll find them as it is my duty.</i></span>\" it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\"><i>You already feel the reason why I am here as it is to leave some more of our kind. If it is not too much of a burden to you.</i></span>\" it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm going to get bigger. Well I kept my word to your Elder so let me get ready.\" Silver said as she struggled stripping her shorts and underwear. She shivered for a bit as the slime once again did the same procedure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\"><i>This may hurt a bit.</i></span>\" it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that. I'm ready.\" answered Silver as it's tentacle slithered through her womanhood, pass her cervix and connecting to her loaded uterus. Silver watched as one by one the orbs entered her. Feeling them pass her womanhood, she tried her best to keep her arousal down. Cradling her belly. She watched as her belly increased in size. Like a water balloon, it grew heavier and heavier. Soon enough it was done as the alien contracted itself from her. Silver panting, trying to catch her breath. She rubbed her belly from underneath. Now more sensitive belly as she felt more satisfied. Not only she had more of them but she helping them out. She struggled to put her clothes back on as her belly could be seen a bit from underneath her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long will you be gone?\" she asked the alien. As it checked on her then slowly made its way back to its ship. It seemed to look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\"><i>Do not worry Silver. I will be back. I will gather my kind as we will live on your peaceful planet. Hoping that \"they\" will not find us here. There maybe other races who may seek your help if you can do help them out.</i></span>\" it said as the ship closed then slowly hummed and in a blink disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I will.\" she said as she rubbed her belly. Looking down she noticed that she now looked ready to give birth to twins. Lumpy once more as pressed on some of the lumps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep bringing them, I now believe life out of this earth and they are kind and I wish for them to stay here.\" Silver said as she struggled into her driver seat, noticing that her belly now touch the steering wheel. Driving slowly but surely, she would now get some rest.</span></div></div>",

She was glad she had managed to find herself an apartment that was relatively near a forest like this one for her evening jogs. She stretched her arms up over her head and slowed to a stop as she reached a split in the path and looked around a bit. Normally she went to the right since the left was a dead end but today she felt like having a bit of a shorter run that normal. She turned and started down the left branch of the path until she came to the little grotto that lay at the end.<br>\r\nSilver smiled a bit to herself and walked up to the water's edge stooping down and dipping her fingers into it. She should really come here more often. With the tree settled in the middle of the small pond there was something just tranquil about the place. A few fireflies danced lazily overhead as the sun dipped lower on the horizon. She was just about to go when she noticed a soft glow at the base of the tree. </span></div></div>",

She slowly rubbed the top against her nether lips taking deep breaths as she began to push it more and more in. Eventually she had managed to work the entire egg inside of her self. She felt it move up into her womb before sliding her clothing back on and starting to wade over to where her shoes were sitting on the shore. She brought a hand down to her stomach running her fingers over the four month bump the egg had created and feeling the way that it stretched her shirt.

Silver could forget all her problems as she looked at the stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver worked with her father at the large observatory the top of the hill which was outside the city they lived in. Her mother was a plain housewife while she had two siblings, Stephen who was 16 and Sarah who was 12. Silver had always been a smart girl. Studing astrology at the nearby university than some big time though accepted she decided no to since she wanted to be close to home... and she couldn't stargaze with the big telescope her dad uses. She gazed at the big dipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are theories that there us life where the big dipper is. I hope i'm the first to discover it.\" Silver thought to herself. Just then she saw two meteors from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is quite rare. Defense should've shot them down.\" Silver thought. One was dark red whilebthe other was bright white. The dark red crashed into the nearby city as the white crashed in the nearby field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow! Those will fetch a bundle.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Silver figured that she could always check out the crash site of the white meteorite on the return trip home anyways. So she headed towards the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Besides,</i> she thought to herself, <i>a white light I can understand, but a dark red...</i> She shook her head and looked back up at the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of driving she finally reached the city limits, and curiously despite it being relatively late at night, Silver would have thought that people would have  least heard the meteor impact the ground or feel a quake of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was about to pull into the city itself, noticed a cluster of red dust forming to her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo!\" She grinned, eagerly rotating the steering wheel as she frantically parked her vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be cosmic dust of some sort,\" she mused, \"I must be getting close if it's this thick.\" As she walked onward the red dust started dissipating more and more until she finally stood in a clearing where a visible trail of dirt denoted that something had landed in the immediate area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange...\" Silver muttered, \"there is evidence that the meteor must have crashed here, but the only thing left is all that dust...\" Suddenly she heard the snap of a twig behind her. Silver quickly whipped around as she saw a flash of red jump at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Silver managed to dodge to the side as the entity flew past her and ended up tumbling to the ground. As it landed on the ground in a heap Silver heard it let out a hiss of sorts before it sneakily tried to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh! Stupid...human!\" It growled to itself before wearily turning towards Silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Silver could tell that this creature was certainly not of Earth, she noticed that aside from its skin tone and eye color, both of which were a blood red, it bore a striking resemblance to a human infant in terms of looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're...an extraterrestrial life form!\" Silver breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and your point?\" The creature growled back, narrowing its eyes in defiance, \"if you're planning to take me home as some sort of trophy then you can bet I won't make it easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver about to respond, noticed that the red alien was breathing quite heavily and looked as if it had sustained multiple scrapes and bruises all across its body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you...injured from the crash?\" Silver asked sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and if I wasn't, I could easily take on a lower life form like you!\" It shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a bit rude,\" Silver pouted, \"I'm offering you help here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well forgive me if I'm not so trusting of strangers from other planets.\" The creature growled, rolling eyes, \"for all I know your 'help' could mean bringing me back to a lab and dissecting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Absolutely not! That's horrible!\" Silver cried, appalled at the notion of such a thing. \"I simply see that you are quite injured and want to help you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature paused and looked over Silver, who held her breath as its eyes studied her intensely, likely looking for any signs of dishonesty that she could be displaying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, the creature sighed and hung its head before looking up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fine,\" it conceded, \"I'll accept your aid, but don't get me wrong, the second I recover I'm gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fair enough!\" Silver said passively, inwardly holding back her glee at the creature's acceptance. \"Let's head back to my vehicle and I can let you ride in it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need.\" The creature stated, \"I've got a better idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Silver asked, her look of confusion turning to shock as she saw the creature transform into a translucent red orb and float towards her within a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright hold still, this will only take a second.\" The creature declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait-\" Silver tried to protest before the orb entered her body, making her shudder as a warm feeling ignited within her. She couldn't place why, but she suddenly felt far more...aware of her surroundings than she previously had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Alright, let's get moving human!</i> Silver jumped at the sudden declaration as she frantically looked around for the owner of the voice. \"Relax! It's just me communicating through your thoughts, man you humans are so high strung!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well excuse ME for not dealing with extraterrestrial beings on a daily basis!\" Silver huffed in annoyance before starting to head back to where her truck was located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she turned to walk away, she heard the sound of air being parted, as if something had been thrown, before a pure white blade embedded itself directly in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver gasped as she turned to face her assailant, only to find that the blade belonged to another alien. However, this one seemed to be the size of a fully grown adult, with the difference being that its skin and eyes were comprised of a pure white tone similar to that of the blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt human, I am afraid I can allow you to go no further!\" It called out to Silver with a hostile glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crap!</i> She heard the creature nervously curse in her head, <i>didn't think he'd find me so quickly!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are you?\" Silver shakily inquired as the alien formed another blade in its hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name does not matter, little human.\" The being replied evenly, \"what matters is that the being you aided must die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can't let you do that, I'm afraid.\" Silver gulped anxiously, \"I promised to help them, and I won't betray them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not wish to kill an innocent life form, but if you stand in my way you shall be destroyed.\" It warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Human, I can't believe I'm saying this, but you are gonna have to fight him.</i> Silver heard the red alien sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But how?!?</i> She cried, beads of sweat beginning to form as she saw that the white alien was beginning to lose its patience. <i>This guy is in a league of his own, and the only fighting I've done was in the kendo club in school!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I know, and if it wasn't for the fact that he's injured from the crash like me I wouldn't even be suggesting what I'm about to say.</i> The alien growled in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And that is?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can give you some of my power to fight this guy, but...</i> the alien trailed off. <i>Even with what little power I can give you, It could make your mind very...unstable.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough stalling! Last chance human, will you relinquish my enemy, or will I have to destroy you both?\" The white alien declared to Silver, who snapped out of her thoughts and looked back towards her aggressor with gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, do it.\" Silver muttered to herself. As soon as the affirmation left her mouth she felt the feeling of warmth return from earlier as she felt it intensify more and more into pure burning sensation that engulfed her body as she emitted a blinding red light that forced the white alien to cover its eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human! You are making an egriegous error!\" It shouted to her. However, Silver paid no attention to its threat as the burning feeling finally settled and the red light faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at herself to see that her clothes had been replaced with a set of red armor that reminded her of a knight's steel plating from the medieval era. In her left hand she held a broad axe, but contrary to its size, it felt almost weightless in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other thing she noted was that she felt as though her muscles had become much stronger and had much more energy to spare than she'd ever recalled before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Human?</i> she heard the alien call to her, <i>you alright? How do you feel?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver opened her mouth to say something, when a feeling of something that could only be described as a pure rage engulfed her thoughts. Her face twisted into a snarl as she eyed her opponent and brandished her axe towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I want to tear this guy apart!\" She growled in a lower, more threatening tone than she'd ever heard from herself. \"But otherwise...I feel...amazing!\" She finished, a manic grin washing over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh, I'm impressed, not many species out there can handle my kind's innate level of bloodlust without going insane! Unless you're just a special sort of human?</i> The alien chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably the latter,\" Silver chuckled darkly, before flashing her opponent a predatory grin, \"though if you don't mind I'd like to shut up and beat this guy to a bloody pulp with this axe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are so eager to fight, then come at me human.\" The white alien calmly stated, before taking its previous stance of aggression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case...hehe...\" Silver giggled madly, \"time break this thing in!\" No sooner had the words left her mouth when she leapt towards her opponent at an inhuman speed and brought her axe down all too eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxe met blade in a clash as Silver furiously swung her axe in a frenzy at the white alien, who grunted as it deflected each blow. Finally, Silver's relentless onslaught managed to pierce the defense and connected a blow as she tore a gash in the alien's side, who jumped back as it yelled in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...human...\" it said, stumbling back in shock, \"I will not let it end like this the next time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver growled and leapt once more at her foe, but was met with thin air as the being teleported out of her sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coward, next time you won't be walking away...\" She hissed, before a feeling of nausea and dizziness made her fall over. \"Crap, guess I pushed myself too hard....\" she groaned, before she faded from consciouness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Guess I'd better get her out of here.</i> The alien sighed as he teleported Silver into the driver's seat of her truck. <i>She can rest here until the morning. Still...who could have thought that a human would bond so well with me...</i> The alien hummed to itself, before falling asleep itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Sore...</i> Silver groaned internally as she started to come to. <i>Why am I so sore?</i> As her eyes fluttered open, she instantly regretted the action as she received a face full of sunlight. Shakily holding an arm to cover her eyes, she blearily scanned her surroundings. In addition to the soreness, she noted that she felt oddly heavy and lethargic for some reason, but couldn't quite place why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truck?\" She muttered, \"why am I-\" She froze, the memories of the previous evening flooding back. \"Oh god, the meteor!\" She sprung into action, her hand instinctively reaching to unbuckle the seatbelt, but halted immediately as her hand lightly brushed her stomach at a distance much further out than it should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the <i>HELL</i>!\" She shrieked, finally figuring out why she'd felt so much heavier as she stared down what looked to be a belly that protruded out from her and looked big enough to be in month 9 of a pregnancy and approaching full term shortly. Poking it lightly with a finger, as if it were some foreign entity and not her own torso, she pulled her shirt up enough to reveal pale expanse of skin underneath. Timidly placing a hand on the mound, her mind slowly started coming to term with the discovery. \"Okay...calm down Silver...breathe for a moment...nothing to get too worried about, you're just inexplicably pregnant with no idea who the father is.\" She shakily reassured herself. <i>Just how am I supposed to explain this to ma and pa? They're gonna be furious!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">I wouldn't worry about it too much human?</span></i> A voice spoke to her suddenly, making her jump at the sudden intrusion of her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who the- wait...I recognize your voice!</i> Silver recalled in surprise, <i>you're that alien from yesterday.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">Guilty as charged.</span></i> The alien retorted, <i><span class=\"cred\">though I'm willing to bet you have a lot of questions for me.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Naturally, and I suppose you're responsible for... my current condition?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">You mean getting you knocked up?</span></i> The alien chuckled, making Silver frown at her anxiety not being taken seriously. The alien, noticing her distressed thoughts, sighed and adopted a more matter of fact tone. <i>Look human, like I said, relax for a bit, I'll explain mostly everything to you now, and if you have any questions you can ask me after I'm done.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fine...</i> Silver sighed, fishing out the keys from her pocket and starting the truck, giving the gas a few presses to make sure the vehicle was revved up and ready to go. <i>Talk to me while I drive I suppose.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">Well okay, to start off with some good news for you.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh? Do tell.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">Well for starters you won't have to worry about giving birth or anything like that since you're not pregnant in the conventional sense.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could have fooled me with this.\" Silver growled, patting her belly for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">Geez, here I thought you were a bit more mild-mannered...anyways, I know it may seem like you are pregnant, but a couple of species out there in the galaxy, when injured, revert to a more defensive form like the orb that I turned into when I bonded with you yesterday.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense I guess, you were pretty injured when I found yo- <b>HEY! Look at the road you neandertha</b>l!\" Silver shouted, mashing her horn as a car cut across her lane without warning. \"God, I'm usually not this irritable.\" She huffed through clenched her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>That actually brings me to my next point. That irritability is a temporary side effect of my bond with you. My species as a whole is naturally prone to a bit of bloodlust and a thirst for battle, and so any hosts we bond with usually experience these kinds of symptoms.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, I do remember flying off the handle yesterday when you formed that armor on me.\" Silver hummed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">That surprised me as well,</span></i> the alien chuckled, <span class=\"cred\"><i>but it's a sign of a host with potential, because the more compatible a host is, the stronger our bond is, and the more our emotions are linked and affected by one another.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting, anything else I should know before we arrive home since we're about to pull up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>Well, just a couple more things, most importantly on your end as an added means of survival I can alter others' perception of you so that you appear normally to everyone else.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that at least takes care of having to hide from my parents.\" Silver cheered with a relieved smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">The final thing, is that in my current state I'm healing back to my former self. so it could be a while before I get out of your hair.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, considering you've taken care of most of the inconveniences, I can't really be mad I guess.\" Silver sighed, before getting out of her truck and heading towards the front porch of her house. As she drew nearer, a black Labrador perked up and craned its neck to look around. As the dog spotted Silver, its tail began to wag as the canine leaped up before running over, letting out a few barks in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boy!\" Silver cooed, \"how's our little Chief doing today?\" The dog responded to the affectionate words by leaping up and placing its paws on Silver's stomach, Silver crying out in surprise, only to pause as it the appendages meet a solid surface a lot sooner than expected. Curious at this event, Chief paused, tilting his head in confusion before sniffing the area underneath his paws. The moist feeling of her dog's nose made Silver shiver at the weird sensation until Chief had finished his investigation. As if shrugging, Chief simply let out a snort before heading back over to his spot on the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought no one could see my pregnancy?\" Silver hissed at the alien, now worried that her parents would discover their daughter in a very compromising position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I said I could alter other <b>people's</b> perception, not pets.</i> The alien reminded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...right, sorry.\" Silver sheepishly grinned as she opened the front door and headed inside. \"Ma, Pa, I'm home!\" She called out as she entered the living room and sat in a heap on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here sweetie!\" Silver heard her mom call from behind her. Turning her head, Silver saw her mother, Lisa, approaching with a plate of scrambled eggs and pancakes in hand. \"And where were you last night young lady? Your father and I were worried sick when you didn't come home all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uh...well I saw a couple of shooting stars and wanted to investigate.\" Silver sputtered out hastily, \"I-I kinda lost track of time and ended up falling asleep in the truck.\" Her mom hummed and gave her a scrutinizing glare, searching for signs of a lie for the briefest of moments, before sighing in resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you never could stop yourself from studying the night sky, just be careful next time alright?\" Her mother chided with a pat to Silver's head, \"plus you have classes tomorrow so don't pull this again too often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\" Silver responded, before digging in to her breakfast. She hadn't actually thought about how hungry she'd been until her first plate of food came, then her second, and then her third...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh...\" Silver groaned, massaging her belly as she let out a burp, \"I -<i>urp</i>- can't believe I ate so much...\" suffice to say, after four plates of her mother's cooking, Silver having to be helped to her room and onto her bed was an expected outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">Heh, sorry kiddo,</span></i> she heard the alien chuckle, <span class=\"cred\"><i>I didn't wanna be a parasite and leech all your nutrients from you so I had you eat a little extra.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you're being honest about it.\" Silver yawned. \"Say, I never did get your name by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">Well considering my name doesn't really have a pronunciation in your tongue, you can just stick with calling me Crimson for now.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crimson...that's a good name I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>Glad I have your approval.</i></span> The alien chuckled teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, I could just as easily let you back out on your own.\" Silver growled playfully, sticking her tongue out in response to the jab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>You don't know how to do that.</i></span> The alien pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I- whatever! I'm taking a nap!\" Silver declared in defeat before turning to her side and pulling the covers over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs day turned to night Silver eventually woke up and came down for dinner, where she greeted her dad and explained where she'd been the previous evening. Though he was a bit mad at first at, he was happy that she'd arrived back home safe and sound. Luckily, neither of her parents pressed the details, and true to Crimson's word neither of them had noticed anything different about her, and after eating a hearty meal and helping wash the dishes Silver headed back to her room for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>So you got school tomorrow eh kid?</i></span> Crimson questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, every week for the next few months until summer break.\" Silver told him as she changed into her sleep-wear. With a yawn she turned out the lights and got into her bed. \"Man I'm not gonna be this tired everyday right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">Not really, but since I knew today wouldn't be too strenuous I used a little more energy than usual to heal up.</span></i> Crimson explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't mind this time but run that by me next time you do that, I don't wanna fall asleep in the middle of class or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">Got it, good night kid.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night,\" Silver whispered, looking down at her protruding belly and placing a hand on it before looking to her window. The stars twinkling in the sky made her wonder what was to come, and where the other alien she'd encountered was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Guess I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.</i> She thought as she drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Fighting the urge to slam on her horn in frustration, Silver instead began tapping her foot impatiently. The source of her current frustration was a traffic jam that had occurred on the main road she normally took to school. She noted that several lanes had been allegedly closed off due to construction that had been declared overnight. \"I wonder if the meteor could have been the reason for this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">Possibly,</span></i> Crimson replied disinterestedly, <span class=\"cred\"><i>though after we left yesterday the only thing any other humans will find will be nothing but a couple of barren rocks and dirt, after all, we don't need any native species interfering on missions if they aren't quite space-worthy.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which...\" Silver said, furrowing her brows, \"what <i>is</i> your mission here? All I've gotten out of this so far is a late night, a lot of extra weight, and an alien that we don't know the location of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>Well...</i></span> Crimson hesitated, knowing that mission critical information shouldn't be revealed, even to his host, <span class=\"cred\"><i>I'm not authorized to give you the long version...</i></span> Silver growled frustratedly in response, her blood pressure rising almost instinctively, <span class=\"cred\"><i>but I can tell you that my target is the being you fought before.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he do?\" Silver questioned, relaxing slightly from the information, however minuscule it had been. \"I'm assuming it had to be something pretty bad if he's got some bounty on his head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>Also classified unfortunately,</i></span> Crimson replied, shutting down that line of conversation, <span class=\"cred\"><i>sorry kiddo, but I just can't tell you too much about mission related data.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what <i>can</i> I know about?\" Silver asked as she ran a hand through her dark ebony locks.

Sound good?</i></span> Crimson offered, trying to cheer the girl up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly...yeah, that sounds pretty awesome actually!\" Silver replied, allowing herself a small smile despite a tiny ember of annoyance remaining within her. \"I guess we can do that back home in the shed so we don't scare Ma or Pa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>HONK!</b></i> The loud blaring of a horn behind her snapped Silver into focusing on the more important task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay I'm going...\" Silver muttered, a blush growing in her cheeks out of embarrassment. Stepping on the gas pedal, she once continued on her journey to her campus until finally arriving in the parking. Fortunately, as bad as the traffic getting to the school was, she managed to quickly find a parking spot and planted herself in it without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to be back at college after Spring Break,\" Silver sighed in contentment, equipping her backpack and walking away from her car after making sure to lock it. \"Good thing they let freshman own cars, otherwise riding the bus here would be the worst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>So what's on the agenda here?</i></span> Crimson wondered, <span class=\"cred\"><i>hope it doesn't take too much time, we really need to be looking out for that other guy.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for one, not going to school would raise some suspicion amongst my teachers, and we wouldn't want that.\" Silver pointed out, \"also since you're probably going to head out once your mission is over I don't want to screw over my education in the long run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>Fair enough I suppose,</i></span> Crimson relented with an impatient huff, <span class=\"cred\"><i>I guess while you're taking care of your classes here I'll keep thinking of a way to track down the target.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, I only go til' the early afternoon today so that leaves us plenty of time afterwards.\" Silver agreed, pushing open a door to the building she'd been heading towards. \"Ah, the science building, how I've missed you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>Neeeeeerd...</i></span> Crimson chuckled, before receding back into Silver's mind to begin planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm gonna get him back for these verbal jabs one of these days...</i> Silver vowed as she planted herself in one of the seats. She was a little early to her chemistry class, but she knew firsthand that even though the lecture hall was huge enough to seat over 200 people that once all of the class arrived finding a seat was highly unlikely, at least if you wanted any good place to sit at. Normally she was one of the student's who liked to sit at the front row, but since she was dealing with a bit bigger...circumstances currently she figured she would sit a couple rows back, even though no one would be able to spot any differences in her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt about two minutes before class started a mass of students trudged in, as Silver expected them to, and seats quickly filled up. Shortly thereafter the professor made their entrance and went through the schedule for the rest of the year. The class went by normally, Silver dutifully took notes and nothing new came on the agenda except for a test in a couple of weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the professor dismissed the lecture Silver perked up as her next class wasn't too far from her current location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, I get to hear more Astronomy lectures!\" She cheered, pumping her fist in anticipation. Unlike the chemistry hall, the room for astronomy took place in a planetarium or observatory every other day, but since it was the first day back from spring break it would be in the normal lecture hall. Silver took her seat in the middle rows this time, as she knew it held the best view for anything the professor put on the projector, and was still a good spot to hear the lecture since the room was designed for about 40-50 students and was a lot closer together because of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon sitting down however, Silver felt an odd feeling of anxiety wash over her, making her shudder involuntarily. Frowning, she scanned the room, looking for anything out of the ordinary, until she looked at the front of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is that...Vanessa?</i> Silver's eyes widened as her emerald orbs made contact with a pair of chocolate ones from across the room. Vanessa, as Silver remembered, was a junior who was a teaching assistant for a few of the entry level astronomy major courses for freshman, and so she'd seen her around somewhat frequently. With golden blonde hair and a figure that many guys found themselves getting shot down for, Silver often found herself envying the girl's outgoing and friendly nature, especially since Silver was much more reserved and hardly knew anyone on campus. There was one thing that caught Silver's attention as she exchanged a shy wave to the other girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked about 9 months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crimson!</i> Silver hissed in her mind, <i>Crimson! There's something I need to ask you about quic-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>You're thinking the same thing then huh?</i></span> Crimson cut her off with a serious tone, <span class=\"cred\"><i>that girl wasn't pregnant before you left for your break was she?</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not in the slightest,</i> Silver affirmed, before pausing, <i>you don't think...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>Only one way to find out kid...we have to confront her. Either after this class or later if you don't feel prepared now, but I'd say the sooner we get it out of the way the better.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hm...</i> Silver thought to herself, but before she could reach a decision the Professor, Mr. Inarya, had already begun the lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Silver would have participated in the lecture by asking questions and taking detailed notes throughout the lesson, however, her mind was still deliberating on how to handle the situation with Vanessa, and before she knew it class was already letting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>Well kid, what are you gonna do?</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I...</i> Silver paused, looking at the entrance of the room to see Vanessa walking into the hallway and turning around the corner. She knew she had to make a decision quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second of thought she decided to...</span></div></div>",

The pregnancy look suits you.\" Silver stated. \"I know you weren't pregnant when Spring Break started, and I know you didn't have that belly when I spoke to you last week at the star-gazing festival we went to, to watch the meteor shower.\"<br>\r\n\"I could say the same about you.\" Vanessa said, getting defensive.<br>\r\n\"I'm not trying to judge you or anything, but I just want to know, did you take in a white glowing orb a couple nights ago, and suddenly wake up the next morning to find yourself pregnant?\" Silver questioned, rubbing her own belly.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">'Silver, what are you doing? Don't be so direct with the question.'</span> Crimson nearly shouted in her head.<br>\r\n\"Yeah actually. She was injured, and needed a place to heal, so I became her host, or surrogate mother, you could say.\" Vanessa stated, rubbing her belly, feeling movement from her tenant.<br>\r\n\"She? When I encountered it, I didn't see anything that identified it as a female, it didn't even sound female.\" Silver stated.<br>\r\n\"She says that's a side effect of the armor she wore. Even the helmet she wore made her sound like a male. They don't really do anything good for the female warriors besides, help them with weight loss, due to how heavy the armor is.\" Vanessa stated. \"She says your the host of the red being, and that you attacked her.\"<br>\r\n\"She attacked me first.\" Silver sighed. \"I helped Crimson because he was injured. But she suddenly started to attack me, so Crimson let me use his power to defend myself.\"<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Vanessa said, getting closer to Silver. \"So, you've still got that big heart of yours. Despite having the bloodlust of a red, inside you.\" Vanessa stated, their bellies now touching.<br>\r\n\"V-Vanessa that's a little too close.\" Silver said blushing, her heart pounding.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">'Silver calm yourself, I can hear and feel your heart pounding like a drum.'</span> Crimson stated.<br>\r\n'I can't help it. I'm bi-sexual, and I have an immense crush on Vanessa. Having her this close to me with our bellies touching is almost a dream come true.' Silver cried out mentally.<br>\r\n\"Silver, I got a question for you.\" Vanessa smiled, their breasts pressing together as she leaned in closer to Silver. \"Would you like to try and help the two aliens try and resolve whatever they're at war for?\"<br>\r\n\"Stop a war?\" Silver asked, feeling dizzy from how close Vanessa's lips were to hers. \"I mean, I would certainly be up to try and come up with a peaceful solution to end the fighting between the two races we carry now. I honestly do like it when I'm in my red form, it makes me feel more confident about myself, but I'm also scared of losing myself to the bloodlust.\"<br>\r\n\"Then let's fix that.\" Vanessa smiled, kissing Silver on the lips.<br>\r\nThe kiss took Silver by surprise as she wasn't prepared for his. When Vanessa broke the kiss, after what felt like forever, which was only five minutes of kissing, Silver's face looked a little dreamy as she had a fantasy of hers come true.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">'Hello Silver, we meet again.'</span> A feminine voice rang in her head.<br>\r\n\"Who said that?\" Silver asked looking around.<br>\r\n\"Luna. The race I'm carrying. She told me to make a mental link with you and your alien, she used some of her power to make it, while I just handled the physical contact part.\" Vanessa smiled.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">'Though the kiss wasn't necessary.'</span> Luna's voice rang in Silver's head again.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I get to have my fun to Luna.\" Vanessa smiled, playfully smacking her belly.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">'Aw great, now I gotta put up with my host being a two way radio.'</span> Crimson complained.<br>\r\n\"Relax Crimson, it'll be fine. We're doing this to try and make a peaceful solution to the conflict on your planet.\" Vanessa smiled.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">'Vanessa, could you please separate from Silver? You're still crushing your bellies together.'</span> Luna requested as both she and Crimson began moving around to get some more room.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">'I have to concur with Luna. It's cramped enough inside Silver's belly as is. Oh I can't believe I just said that.' </span>Crimson stated.<br>\r\n\"Hmph, well if you don't like it you can just leave.\" Silver grumped, wrapping her hands around the small of Vanessa's back, to keep them from separating. \"I actually like the way it feels.\"<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" Vanessa smiled, putting her hands on the small of Silver's back.<br>\r\nThe two aliens inside their wombs began to thrash about even more, causing Vanessa and Silver to coo as it shook them with pleasure, as they began rubbing their bellies and chests together in a haze of lust.<br>\r\n\"S-Silver I'm about to...\" Vanessa gasped, sweat glistening down her skin.<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah me to.\" Silver stated, before they both screamed out in immense pleasure, unaware that the energy of the two beings they carried, was unleashed in a wave, over the entire country.<br>\r\nSilver and Vanessa gasped and leaned against the wall Silver was on, with Vanessa now by her side.<br>\r\n\"That was amazing.\" Silver sighed, catching her breath, putting her hands on her still writhing belly.<br>\r\n\"I agree, that was the best I've ever had. That's saying something, since you were my first.\" Vanessa smiled, putting one hand atop her belly, as Luna was still thrashing about as well.<br>\r\n\"You're my fist to.\" Silver smiled.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">'Silver, you and Vanessa need to run and hide now.'</span> Crimson exclaimed.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">'He's right. You both need to get as far from the school as possible.'</span> Luna added in.<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Silver asked, as they helped each other up.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">'When you both had your, big finish, you released a wave of our combined energy onto the entire country. Because of that...'</span></span></div></div>",

Silver moaned a bit and grunted as she shifted to her right side, near the edge of her bed. Crimson began thinking of what had happened to his adversary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\"><i>This human is quite an interesting one. She gets aroused when I move around even though she finds it annoying.I wonder where my enemy is hiding now.</i></span>\" Crimson thought to himself. A bit worried as he was still healing and Silver lacked training for using his powers he granted to her. \"<span class=\"cred\"><i>It'd be dangerous if she can't control my powers and run amok.</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then he felt a familiar precense approaching them. The aura then phased straight through and into Silver's room. He recognized it's aura as the one they fought before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Hey! Silver! Get up! Our enemy is here!</span>\" Crimson said as he thrashed about. Silver only moaned once more as she rubbed her belly. Being full and tired finally taking its toll on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Damned human! Sound asleep at a time like this!</span>\" Crimson said as he continued his movement, hoping he'd awake her. The white orb went and settled in the center of Silver's room. There a form similar to when Silver found Crimson which was a size of a full grown fetus kneeled before them, covered in a white aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpteal\">Interesting host you have there.</span>\" It said in a feminine voice. Giggling at Crimson as his anger grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">If you're here for a fight, now's not the time!</span>\" Crimson yelled at the white being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpteal\">I agree. Though you may have wounded me. I've met \"Them\" just recently. Luckily I was able to get away though much weaker now than after our battle.</span>\" it said to Crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Them? You don't mean!?!</span>\" Crimson said as it nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpteal\">I'd like to offer a truce in the meantime Crimson. Until we dealt our sworn enemy.</span>\" It said as it floated onto Silver's bed, at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Fine by me. In our current state, we can't win against \" Them\". But if you need a host, go find your own! This one's taken!</span>\" Crimson said to it. It only sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpteal\">Didn't have the time as I was attack by \" Them\" and besides she has the highest appitude to be a host compared to other humans I've come across as with. Oh and humans are capable of holding more than one fetus mind you so scoot over.</span>\" It said mockingly as it approached Silver turning into a white ball as it approached Silver's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">No! No way in hell I'm sharing a room with you of all our kind!</span>\" Crimson yelled thrashing as much as he can but to dismay Silver was fast asleep, oblivious to what was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpteal\">Ha! You said it yourself! You can't do anything with your current state. I have a bit of power left to perform this feat!</span>\" It said as it began to enter Silver's body. Her belly grew even larger causing her bed to creak a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpteal\">Ah! Nice and comfy!</span>\" it said as it got into a comfortable position only to be kicked by Crimson. \"<span class=\"cpteal\">Ouch! What was that for! You should really learn to share!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Screw you! You wanna continue our fight? Then let's have it!</span>\" Crimson yelled as Silver's belly thrashed about, movement visible from her belly as she groaned and carressed it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Silver made her way towards the crash site of the white meteor. As she neared the crash site, a thick mist surrounded it. She got out of her truck and approached the site by foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be a comet. This seems like cosmic dust coming from it.\" She thought as she approached the site. Silver noticed that the glow from the meteor was gone. When she reached the crater, she found not a single debri left of the meteor. She sighed in dsimay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its either the goverment's reallly quick or it truned to dust on impact. Either way, pretty much a waste of time for me to be here.\" Silver thought as she started going back to her truck. Just then she heard a moan. Looking around for the moan she yelled,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone there? Are you injured?\" Silver said but all she could hear was a moan. She approached to where it was coming from cautiously. It was in a bush nearby as she rummaged through it to see a being that emmitted a white aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow! Is that an extraterresstrial!\" Silver yelled in shock. The being seemed to be in a fetal position. All white as it seemed to be the size of an infant. It looked human except it seemed naked. It had hair that seemed to stretch just above its neck. It also seem to have a tiara of sorts on its forehead with a pearl white gem on it. It moaned once more as it opened its eyes to see Silver looking down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this planet Earth?\" It spoke weakly. Silver was surprised it can speak its language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this is Earth. Where do you come from?\" Silver asked blantly. Its eyes went wide as it quickle stood up and floated but fell down. Silver caught it with both hands and rested it on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright.\" She asked worriedly as the alien grasped its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry about me. The enemy draws near.\" It said as it looked at the sky. Silver also looked to see a dark red flare coming towrds them. It looked the same as the meteor or alien that cane down with the white alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enemy? That?\" Silver pointed to what was coming towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how to fight ?\" It asked looking at Silver with its bright white pupils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I studied kendo when I was in middle school. But why? We could just run away!\" Silver said to it. It shook its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must defeat it here so it cannot contact the others.\" It said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theres more of them?!?\" Silver asked worridly as the red flare landed nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will explain kater. I will lend you my power. Use it to fight it.\" It said as it turned into a ln orb and enter Silver. Silver felt its energies surge into her as a white suit covered ber clothes. Silver now looked like the alien complete with a tiara. Her hair turned silver as her eyes turned dark blue. Just as a red being appeared before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you lent your power to a mere human. Well I'll just kill it and forcibly take you!\" The red alien said. The red alien had a broad axe that glowed with it. It looked like a human as well except for eyes that were red with no pupils and pointy ears. It had a heavy red armor and cape. Silver backed as it charged at ger swinging its giant axe. A light sheild blew her back protecting her from harm as she tumbled backwars till she stopped. Rubbing the back of neck, she looked at it with one eye as she soothed tbe pain. It kept coming at her. Knocking around the area near the crater. If it weren't for the light sheild, she'd be dead by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That hurt. Hiw am I supposed to fight it?\" Silver asked as the alien spoke to her telepathicly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think the object you wish to fight Crimson with. A swird perhaps. My power is limited to that for now since I am injured. Time it well as he too is injured from decent.\" The alien said. Silver imagined a samurai sword as a sword of light materialized in her hand. Taking her stance she waited as Crimson laughed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no hope of winning child. Its best you give it to me.\" Crimson said witb a hand out gesturing Silver to surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I'll protect it from the likes of you.\" Silver said panting as she seemed out if breath. \"I just need one strike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a fool. Your life if forfeit to me.\" Crimson yelled as it heaved its axe and flew towads Silver with great speed.  Silver ducked at its attack and struck with her own as a pulsating white light came from the cut she had formed. Crimson knelt on one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Insolent human. I will return for you.\" Crimson said holding its wound she inflicted. Disappearing in a flash of light. Silver fell.on her knees as she sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it over now?\" Silver asked the alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now it is.\" It said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'm so tired.\" Silver said weakly as she fell to the ground and slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must recuperate as we have a long journey. I thank you for your kindness but I will still need your help.\" It said and in a bright light it engulfed Silver and teleported her home, on her bed as she slept soundly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I just teleported you home with the ounce of my power left after the battle with Crimson.\" The alien said using telepathy once more. Shocked Silver looked around to see where it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where life begins for you, humans.\" It said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where life begins?...\" She thought as she undid her bed sheet to discover thought she still had her light red blouse with a white jacket, denim pants and red sneakers. One thing that stood out was her belly. Silver struggled to the side of her bed as she sat in an upright position. Placing her hands on her belly, she could feel warmth emanating from the alien within her. Snapping out of her trance, she screamed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pregnant?!?\" Silver yelled at her overdue belly. It poked out of her body as it stretched her blouse. Her breasts were larger as her hips widen too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically, I impregnanted myself into you since I need to heal. I'm sorry if I am a hinderance but I cannot leave you in my current state.\" It said in a sad tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver calming herself down sighed as she leaned on her bed, patting her belly, \" I was hoping for a heads up but don't be sad. I just wasn't expecting this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am too wounded to move around. My name is Polaris and I come from a galaxy where what you call the ursa major is. I was on the run from a group what you call the Dark Dawn who wanted my power as well as my siblings.\" Polaris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Silver. I guess that guy Crimson is a part of this group. What power and where are your siblings?\" Silver asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When my siblings and I are together we can summon the way to the Creator. My siblings and I got separated during our run from the Dark Dawn. I made myself the bait so they can escape.\" Polaris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I hope you get togther again soon. I'll do my best to protect you from them.\" Silver said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is good to hear. You may borrow my power if they come. But we cannot use it right now.\" Polaris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need to recharge? Its okay. Its not like were in danger or anything. I have a lot of explaing to do with you and how I got pregnant.\" Silver sighed as she stroked her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need not to worry, Silver. Just act like you normally would do as will they. I must rest now.\" Polairs said. Silver could feel it move within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest easy. We are friends now, Polaris.\" Silver said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is nice to hear, friend.\" Polaris said as Silver felt an aura of warmth. She got up and took a bath, changed into more loose clothing. Which was a large blue t-shirt, knee length black pants. She wore a white turtle neck sweater as she dried her hair and fix it in a long ponytail. Satisfied with her look, she made her way downstairs for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone acting normal. Like she wasn't pregnant as she ate pancakes with her two siblings. Their father already left for work as their mom had errands to do.

Beside her lay her latest conquest; a good looking, eighteen year old guy she had met last night and taken back to her family's mansion. Her parents were rarely home, always away on business, which meant she had the run of the place. She smiled and kicked back the white sheets of her luxurious bed, exposing her naked body to her lover; she was gifted with incredibly good looks, a shapely body, big firm breasts and a cute bubble butt. Her long red hair tumbled about her shoulders, straightened and shiny in the morning sunlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she looked down at her perfect figure; if there was one thing she prized above all else, it was her figure. Sex was her favorite hobby at the moment, and there wasn't a single guy in this town who didn't want to be with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince finishing school last year, Rose had decided to take some time out of full time education. Her Dad had promised to show her the family business, but he had been away in London for the last three months, so Rose had been using her time to go shopping, meet guys and party all night long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey baby,\" her companion said, slowly opening his eyes to see Rose lying naked beside him. He reached over and stroked one of her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" she replied in a bored voice, pushing his hand away from her nipple. \"Get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got to stay the night, that's more than most guys get with me,\" Rose said, sitting up and swinging her legs off the bed. \"Now get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I thought we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had a connection? Yeah, yeah, heard that before,\" Rose said as she stood up and grabbed a robe from her wardrobe before throwing it on and fastening the sash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy shot her a glare and grabbed his clothes from the floor, hurriedly getting dressed and slipping out before Rose had even turned around to see him out. In the corridor outside her bedroom, her lover scowled at the closed door. \"That bitch messed with the wrong guy...let's see if I can teach that spoiled little rich girl some responsibility.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began chanting in some sort of arcane language, his hands started to glow and a green energy filled the hallway. \"May your belly swell, may your breasts bulge with milk, may new life fill you. <i>Rose</i>.\" The green energy died away, as he walked out of the house, smiling in satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her room, Rose suddenly felt a little light headed. She sat down on the edge of the bed for a moment...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...before a wave of hunger hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could even stop herself, she made her way to the barely-used kitchen. The room was pristine and glamorous like the rest of the Bennett mansion. Ultra modern gadgets were sprinkled throughout the large room that could easily work for a large family, and not for just Rose and her parents - not that she saw her parents much as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose's father was constantly travelling for business, coming home for only a few days at a time before heading off to another state or country to do business with royalties and politicians all over the world. No one really knew what type of business he did, but there had been gossip going round for a number of years about affairs and secret families. Rose knew not to ask, merely shaking off the comments of some of her father's apparent scorned lovers when they turned up at the house demanding money and answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother on the other hand, did not always take it well. She was only 19 when she'd met Rose's father, who was almost ten years her senior. As soon as the divorce from his first wife came through they'd had a lavish wedding at seven months pregnant with Rose. She'd hated her life since the day they'd said 'I do' feeling trapped in a loveless marriage, but too afraid to leave him after signing a strict prenup. Much like her husband, she'd had a number of affairs throughout Rose's life, all crashing and burning as quickly as they'd started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir relationship was one of the reasons she'd sworn off commitment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the Bennett ladies rarely cooked in the kitchen, it was always fully stocked to keep up appearances for the few dinner parties and afternoon teas that her mother hosted. She'd never cooked, always bringing staff in to cater for her friends and passing it off as her own. A few martini's in, she'd confess to not cooking anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose opened the pantry, pulling out all the 'off-limits' foods that her mother used to keep for her the days after her break-ups where she'd stuff herself silly with grief. She'd gain 10 pounds and then work out like crazy for a month, or get liposuction. Rose swore to never let food take control of her life and had, up until this point, eaten what her nutritionist made her, or simply brought premade salads or low-carb meals, not caring for the taste of food so she could keep her killer bod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, however, she had actually felt a real hunger for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no less than an hour, Rose had devoured three pound cakes and some twinkies, washing it down with a 2L bottle of cola. She lay on the cool floor of the pantry groaning as she stroked her swollen belly, surrounded by wrappers. The hunger had gone, but the haze in her head crept over her more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere eyes fluttered, exhaustion coming over her as she slowly passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lay there, the first slight changes came over her body. A soft layer of fat developed over her midsection as her breasts gained a little more padding. Her hips spread out a little wider, her thighs growing with it. The <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Rose woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer light head had gone, replaced with nausea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely had time to get to one of the many bathrooms in the house before she heaved. When she was finally done, one hand moved the bedraggled strands of hair from her face while the other came to rest on her tight stomach. She looked down at it, not caring about the slight softness as she'd never been athletic, focusing more on the face it curved out slightly and felt rock hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. I must be really bloated today.\" She shrugged it off, suddenly feeling tired again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way back up to her boudoir and curled up under the covers, not noticing the cursive note that had appeared on her dresser as she slowly drifted off to sleep.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back in her room, Rose suddenly felt a little light headed. She sat down on the edge of the bed for a moment before a sharp pain went across her abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rose awoke, she felt heavy, like she was being weighed down by something. She slowly opened her eyes and tried to manoeuver herself into a sitting position, but she was struggling, breathing heavily even after a few moments. Confusion briefly swept over her, wondering how she'd got into bed and why she seemed to be wearing pajamas in bed when she always wore her 'birthday suit' to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat dripped down her forehead as she finally managed to get into an upright position, and that's when she noticed that the weight that she felt was actually her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, her belly to be more precise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose stared at it wide-eyed as shock came over her. The round dome was straining against the buttons of her tatty sleep shirt, something she'd never dream of being caught in. She looked around the room in panic. Something isn't right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't her bedroom. Sure, she recognised a lot of the furniture, but the layout was different and the room was a lot smaller. The one thing that really stood out was how tidy it was - usually the only way the floor was usually clean in Rose's room was when the maid came in and gutted it once a week and left it pristine, only for Rose to mess it up in a few hours by dropping clothes and accessories all over it as she tried on a number of outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this room had been tidied recently, and not by the maid. Things weren't put away exactly as they should, but whoever had tidied had at least tried. Stuffed toys that Rose never remembered owning were overflowing in a basked by her regal armchair, which had relatively neatly folded clothes on. There were flat pack sets sticking out from behind her open door, a few boxes piled up between them an her dresser that seemed oddly make up free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose struggled out of bed, waddling over to the full length mirror on the bathroom door, eyes half-closed, as part of her wasn't ready for the sight she was about to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath and opened her eyes and screamed at her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone was the beautiful girl she'd been what felt like only hours ago. In her place was a chubby (and very pregnant) teenager. Her once luscious red locks were now dull and slightly greasy, as if they hadn't been washed in a while and were pulled into a tight but messy ponytail on the top of her head. Her once model-like cheekbones had disappeared under fat, replaced with two chubby cheeks and the makings of a double chin. Her skin was 'glowing' with one or two zits dotted on her cheeks and chin, something she'd never had to deal with before, and as soon as she noticed them her face felt itchy, a need to scratch and pop them coming over her. The only feature that was left unscathed were her pouty lips - the rest of her face looking like she'd thrown out her skincare routine months ago with a dash of crazy hormones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her eyes travelled down her body, Rose saw that she overall seemed wider and her arms felt heavier and thicker under the plaid material of the shirt. Her shoulders were broader, with her chest almost bursting out of her top as her sensitive nipples moved against the restrictive material. Her belly seemed to be carrying most of her new girth though, sticking out in front of her like a beach ball. Rose's chubby fingers moved to touch it, feeling an initial softness that gave way to a hardness under the thick layer of fat. If she didn't know any better, Rose would think she was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as that thought entered her mind, she felt something inside her move, the shock of it unsteadying her a little before she managed to catch herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" She gasped as she shook her head. \"This can't be happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled back again a few steps her footing heavier than she remembered underneath her on the plush carpet as her thick thighs rubbed together. This was yet another totally alien feeling for Rose as she'd always been proud of her thigh-gap. Suddenly a pair of arms wrapped around her, catching her before she stumbled anymore, slowly guiding her to the end of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened her eyes, she was shocked to see that it was one of the guys she'd slept with months ago. He was a little older if she remembered correctly, and a little dull, but she'd been able to look past his lack of personality (and his chubby frame) because she knew he had money and she'd never have to see him again. Clearly she'd been wrong on that front. He looked almost the same only now he had a five o'clock shadow and looked a little more dishevelled with a little more weight around his middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, sweetheart?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed him away. \"What the <i>HELL</i> are you doing here?\" She yelled, losing her balance and almost sliding off the bed, still not used to her her girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe steadied her once more, looking at her confused. \"What do you mean baby, I've lived here for the past few months, since you found out you were pregnant.\" He put his hand on Rose's knee, and that's when she sees the wedding band on his left hand. She immediately looked at her own left hand and was relieved to not be wearing any rings, sighing with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I put it in a safe place, remember?\" He cooed as he made his way over to the nearest nightstand, rummaging in it. That's when Rose noticed the two frames on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first picture was of two people in a registry office. She couldn't make them out, but from what she could see the bride and groom were a little chubby, a significant bump sticking out of a beachy maxidress on the bride while the guy was in an ill-fitting shirt and khakis. The second picture was also black and white. It was a baby scan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose's eyes went wide as the guy<i>...Cameron? Was that his name?</i> pulled out a small pouch, bringing it over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, there's your ring...\" he pulled out a simple looking wedding band that matched his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose whacked his hand away and the ring went flying. \"I am NOT your wife!\" She shouted, stopping herself from moving so she didn't need his help again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. \"I know the baby wasn't planned. Hell, we both freaked out when you found out you were pregnant, but we've been making it work. We got to know each other and fell in love and got married so we could be a family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memories replayed in her head that matched up with what he was saying. His name was Cameron Waverly, the only son of one of his father's friends. When she found out she was pregnant she'd freaked out and planned to get rid of the baby, thinking she was too young but had bumped into Cameron on the way to the appointment. She'd told him she was pregnant and what she was about to do, but he'd managed to persuade her to think about it a bit more. He'd taken her to a local diner and they'd gotten to know each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their love grew, so did their waistlines (Rose's in particular) and as Rose's pregnancy went on she rapidly outgrew clothes. Most days she cried as she discovered a new stretchmark, or when she couldn't fit in her clothes anymore, even though she'd bought them only a week ago, and when she had one of her 'fat' days. Each time, Cameron was at her side, telling her she was beautiful and that he loved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they couldn't hide the pregnancy or their relationship any longer, they moved into the Waverly guesthouse where they lived in their own little world. Cameron went off to work at his dad's company a few times a week while studying for his degree, while Rose nested and nibbled. When she got to six months pregnant, they'd decided to get married and start their happy every after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow at seven months pregnant and having gained almost 70lbs, Rose had started to feel more insecure, so Cameron worked from home in the study that would later become their baby's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cameron?\" She whimpered, cupping his face as tears fell down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, baby?\" He mumbled back, kissing the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled \"I love you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple embraced, but there was something niggling at the back of Rose's head. Part of her was so sure this was what her life was now, while the other part was screaming at her that this hadn't been the case a few hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething wasn't right, and she knew she had to figure out what was real, and what wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the baby inside her kicked...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rose Witmore trudged up a large flight of stairs in her family's home.  \"Dammit,\" she said as she struggled to negotiate the stairs in a set of shiny black high heels her parents had bought for her, \"If I break these things I swear to god I'm making daddy buy me another pair,\" Rose said sternly as she huffed and puffed to the top of the tall, narrow staircase and stood before an old wooden door.  She opened the door, which gave way only with a loud creek, and she stepped into the room, flipping on a light switch as she did.  Dusty lamps scattered about the room hummed slowly to life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room Rose stood in was one of many in her family's home--Witmore Manor, a large, even castle-like edifice situated upon Witmore Point--an impressive rock formation jutting out over the ocean.  The whole estate was in Winchester Cove, a small fishing village in New England right on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean.  Several generations of Rose's family had lived in the manor, and it was without doubt the biggest house in town, complete with its own gates, its own security, several luxury cars, a pool, and all the bells and whistles of a lifestyle fit for those who never had to worry about money because they'd always had plenty of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Witmore family's fortune had not been lost on Rose; in fact, it had been lavished upon her, and that much showed. Rose was a beautiful young woman of seventeen years who stepped into the room at the top of the stairs in $500 high-heeled dress shoes.  The glimmering of the lights revealed a young woman who was self-assured to a fault.  Rose stood at about five feet eight inches tall with a body to die for.  Long, fiery red hair cascaded down from her head and framed a beautiful, fair-skinned face with a smile that could light up a room.  Upon Rose's chest there sat a beautiful set of large, jiggle-prone breasts jutting out from her and jiggling just ever so little with each step.  These wondrous orbs defied gravity, being large and jiggly and yet somehow firm at the same time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose's figure as a whole was--well--full.  She wasn't fat, not at all, but she certainly had curves, curves like real, full-bodied women are supposed to have.  Her belly had around it a slight bit of flab.  It wasn't enough to be sloppy, but it was there.  Her ass jutted out behind her and was on display as her wide, child-bearing hips swayed from side to side as she walked.  She had muscular and meaty legs that seemed to go on forever.  Today, this sexy, voluptuous physique was encased in a set of form-fitting black pants that hugged her luscious curves and a white silk blouse that, while not intended to be form-fitting, struggled to contain the wonderful globes protruding from Rose's chest as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose trudged into the large room at the top of the stairs.  The lights she had turned on revealed a quite large library, but one that no one had been in in ages.  Dust covered the many rows of books that filled the book cases along the walls.  There was plenty of furniture in the room for any would-be reader to plop himself down in, but the furniture was old and dusty too.  \"What a dump,\" Rose commented as she made her way into the room.  Her mother had sent her up here to find an old family photo album that had been shoved up here among the other dusty tomes, but Rose couldn't even figure out where to start in a room of this size.  The place was nearly the size of a basketball court, lined with more books than anybody could ever read.  \"This place could be nice if Daddy would tell Mona to get her ass up here and clean,\" Rose said, referring to the family's housekeeper who apparently had not visited the library in some time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose walked about in the room, her heels echoing on the floor of the big empty place as her hips swayed sexily about. She glanced at a few of the books in the hope of seeing one that didn't look quite as old as the others, but, alas, nothing.  As Rose stood in the corner of the room farthest from the door, she saw something that caught her eye.  It was behind a big couch, seemingly shoved back there in a rush.  \"What is that . . . \" Rose began to ask herself as she walked in the direction of the mysterious thing, her heels clicking about on the wooden floor.  Rose reached the wall and peered behind the couch.  What she saw was a great big package wrapped up in what seemed to be plain brown paper covered with dust.  \"What the hell is this . . . \" Rose mused as she reached behind the couch, grabbed the top of the dusty old thing, and pulled it out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small cloud of dust emerged from the item's resting place as she removed it.  She took it with both hands and guided it into the light.  The thing appeared to be about four feet by six feet, large enough to be awkward to lift.  It was covered in brown paper wrapping that looked like it had been there for a long time.  Rose removed it from behind the couch and set it against the wall.  \u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d she asked herself as she poked the brown paper, making a small hole.  Rose then put her hand into that hole and began to rip at the paper, kicking up still more dust as the contents of the paper were revealed.  After a few seconds, Rose removed the last of the paper and looked upon an old painting seeming to depict a woman from another time, another world even.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d Rose mused as she stepped back and looked at the picture.  It depicted a woman probably in her mid-forties.  The woman had long black hair and beautiful skin.  She stared at the viewer of the painting with penetrating green eyes.  The woman appeared to be rather curvy, with a beautiful dress and a plunging neckline that left little to the imagination about the prominence of her boobs.  Farther down, the woman\u2019s belly protruded out mightily, stretching the confines of the beautiful dress that struggled to contain her voluptuous frame.  The woman was in a sitting position with a fireplace behind her in what appeared to be a small but well-appointed cabin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Rose asked the absent figure in the painting.  The afternoon sun shined through the window, casting its rays upon a small plaque with some writing on it toward the bottom of the painting.  Curious, Rose bent down her boobs dangling beautifully as she got on all fours to read the inscription.  \u201cWithin is the soul of Lady Switham, with her reputation stained and spotty.  Take care if you should find her here, for she may leap to your body,\u201d Rose said as she read the inscription on the painting.  She chuckled a bit at it; it was a weird thing to say.  Rose absent-mindedly drew her fingers over the small inscription, and suddenly she recoiled as she felt a shock run through her body.  \u201cOuch!\u201d she said as she suddenly pulled her hand back.  At the same time, the light in the room shifted as clouds darkened the sky outside.  The crack of thunder roared over the water as the clouds swirled ominously.  Rose looked out the window and cocked an eyebrow.  \u201cIt was sunny a few seconds ago,\u201d she said to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the temperature in the room dropped.  Rose looked before her and saw a tine cloud exit her body\u2014she could see her very breath.  The nipples on Rose\u2019s bouncy breasts hardened as cold swept the room.  Rose spun around as a gust of chilly wind blew through the cavernous room.  \u201cWhat the hel\u2014\u201c she began.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeautiful . . .\u201d  came a thin, feminine voice that echoed through the room as the wind somehow continued to blow about the place.  Rose cocked an eyebrow, sure she was hearing things now.  Rose looked around with worry.  \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d she demanded, seeing no one.  \u201cOutta here,\u201d she said with fear creeping into her voice as she began to walk quickly and powerfully toward the door.  Suddenly, a gust of wind blew the door closed with a sound that echoed through the big room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast dear,\u201d came the same voice again.  Rose spun around, determined to find the source of the voice.  \u201cWho are you?!\u201d she demanded as her eyes darted around the cavernous room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she beheld something that defied all explanation.  In the middle of the air, probable ten to fifteen feet off the ground, there appeared an apparition\u2014a woman.  The woman appeared as if from another world, another plane of existence, her clothes remnants of another time.  She wore an old dress of the kind that might have been worn in the 1600s with a plunging neckline and frilly bodice.  The figure\u2019s hair blew about as wind continued to whirl around the room.  A large bulge protruded from her belly, and her entire form was surrounded by a kind of glowing green aura.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.  My.  God.\u201d Rose said as she gazed, her jaw on the floor, up at the woman.  \u201cNot quite dear,\u201d the woman replied with a slight chuckle as she gazed down at Rose.  The woman waived her hand as if too beck Rose toward her, and suddenly the curvy red-head felt her voluptuous body being lifted off the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201c Rose began as she simply floated upward.  She tried to kick and jerk about but somehow found her body being kept still by some unseen force.  Up she went until she reached about the same level as the figure she gazed upon.  \u201cOh my,\u201d the woman said as Rose came to her level.  The woman reached out and drew her hand across Rose\u2019s face briefly.  The woman felt cold and, in some way, wet.  It was as though her body were some sort of ghostly ectoplasm, a sort of viscous fluid that was, in some sense, the body of a spirit.  Rose stared straight at the woman, transfixed.  \u201cYou . . . \u201c she began, \u201cyou\u2019re Sw\u2014Sw\u2014Switham . . . the lady from the painting.\u201d              <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rose looked down at the woman\u2019s belly, barely contained even by the large dress she wore.  \u201cHow . . . I mean . . . wha\u2014what are you?\u201d Rose asked.  The woman smiled again.  She came even close to Rose, so that she was just inches from the young woman\u2019s face.  \u201cFor now, I am you,\u201d the woman declared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rose dropped to the floor with no warning and landed flat on her back, getting the air knocked out of her and hitting her head hard on the ground.  Rose\u2019s vision blurred as pain wracked her body in several places at once.  Rose lay on the ground for a few seconds as she struggled to catch her breath and wait for her head to stop throbbing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier if the host is disoriented,\u201d declared the still-floating woman, \u201cnow make room for Mama!\u201d said the woman as she simply dove down through the air toward the open gullet of the curvy Rose.  The woman\u2019s ectoplasmic ooze simply forced its way inside Rose\u2019s body through her mouth.  Rose gagged and jerked and spasmed and fought, but it was no use.  The woman flowed into her, her liquid-like form filling every crevice in Rose\u2019s body.  After a few seconds of shaking, it all ended, and Rose lay unconscious on the hardwood floor as night fell.  Her eyes glowed a bright green just before they closed.            <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alissa then thought about her mother and her new swollen belly, while Nicole seemed rather unphased by it considering her belly had just inflated like an especially large party balloon, but Alissa still was incredibly worried about it and didn't want her friend seeing her mother now that she looked ready to pop with triplets, her belly almost on full display. \"Just a second,\" she said closing the door and running to find her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa managed to find Nicole as she was just about enter the kitchen possibly to make another look around for food. \"Mom can you go up stairs?\" Alissa didn't  wait for answer and swivelled Nicole around and started pushing her towards the stairs.

Alissa wonder why she hadn't brought in with her but quickly became alarmed when she saw Christine making her way to the stair case.<br>\r\n\"No no no no no no,\" she said dragging her friend to the couch and forcing her down, \"why don't you take a seat her and we can talk about last night.\"<br>\r\n\"I feel I should be up...\" started Christine in the vague voice that Alissa was only now starting to pick up on.<br>\r\n\"Did you hook up with anyone last night,\" she interrupted only to be interrupted herself by some footsteps coming down the stairs, she groaned knowing it was her mother and turned to see she was right and her mother was ponderously making her way down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole had at least changed out of her pyjamas and was now wearing a green sweater which, whilst covered mover of her, only came down to just above her navel, and a pair of jeans. It has been noted before that Nicole hips were quite wide in proportion to her body, this meant many of pants and jeans were quite baggy in the seat as she didn't have the bottom to fill them, and they were still slightly baggy there but not as much as there once were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa went to say something to try and explain the appearance of her mother but Christine had already gotten up and crossed over to Nicole and started to fuss over her, \"oh my you are simply huge, you must be so worn out,\" she said rubbing the swollen mass of her Nicole's belly. Alissa was nonplussed, Christine had never shown this kind of interest in a pregnant woman (the only thing  she could confused her mother with) before and always referred to her mother as Ms Sterling but now. \"You shouldn't be moving around in your state, let me help you.\" <br>\r\nNicole wordlessly accepted and then Christine, despite being two-thirds the height and probably a third of the weight of Nicole, helped her down the last step and over to the couch where she help lower her down on to it before sitting next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa watched completely confused and ignored as Christine rubbed her mother's belly and ask Nicole questions, who only slightly confused why her daughter's best friend was so interested in her.<br>\r\n\"How have you been holding up?\" asked Christine.<br>\r\n\"Ok, but my clothes are have trouble fitting me,\" Nicole replied gesturing to her sweater's hemline.<br>\r\n\"Just move of your beautiful form to see,\" said Christine beginning the belly rubbing again. Alissa watched as her mother was some what taken a back by this and blush at Christine's statement.<br>\r\n\"Have you been getting enough to eat?\" Christine asked.<br>\r\n\"Definitely, I cleaned out the kitchen and was about to go out and buy some more food.\"<br>\r\n\"What!?\" exclaimed Christine standing up, \"you can't be moving about in your condition, let me go shopping for you.\"<br>\r\nNicole hesitated then said...</span></div></div>",

However, a lot of the questions her daughter raised were things she was wondering herself. Why couldn't they remember the night of the party? How was she suddenly so pregnant? Why was Christine acting this way towards her? Most of all however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I feeling this way about her?\" Nicole muttered, \"I haven't felt this way towards anyone since Alissa's father...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felt what way?\" Nicole gasped, and looked up to see none other than Christine, holding about five bags of groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Christine!\" Nicole stuttered, \"I um...I didn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-sh-sh, it's okay!\" Christine shushed Nicole with a finger on her lips, before giving her a flirtatious look, \"I think I might know what you're feeling, however, just in case I'm wrong...\" Christine paused, and set the groceries down before sauntering over to Nicole and leaned towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Christine wha-Mmph!\" Nicole was silenced as she suddenly found herself being kissed by her own daughter's best friend. Her mind screamed at her to do something, anything, and that the current situation was completely wrong by all accounts. However, for some reason, she just couldn't muster the will to break the kiss, and soon simply accepted and fully returned the kiss with renewed passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity, the two women broke their lip-lock, panting feverishly and staring at each other in a new light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Christine giggled, \"Was I right in my answer?\" Nicole, still in shock from what had just happened, nodded dumbly. \"Good!\" Christine chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hang on!\" Nicole shook her head, \"just what is going on Christine? Have you always felt this way towards me or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not since yesterday,\" Christine answered with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, tell me how this feels first off?\" Christine placed a hand on Nicole's belly, and began to gently rub her hand along its surface, making her breath catch and Nicole shudder once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels...amazing...\" Nicole whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because the children know their father's presence.\" Nicole's head snapped up at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? Their father? How are you...that's not possible!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this human body wasn't the original progenitor persay,\" Christine chuckled, \"but my mind is currently housed within her, and the children can feel it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh...\" Nicole remained silent for a few moments before speaking once more, \"so what do you plan to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, unfortunately, even though you proved to be one of the most prime carriers for our next generation, it's still not enough.\" Christine's face hardened into a look of frustration, \"we just might need your daughter to carry some of our young-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Nicole replied sternly, \"making me carry your children is fine, I'm used to it, but not Alissa! She's already scared enough as it is! She doesn't need some alien's creatures within her making her more stressed out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg to differ my dear Nicole,\" Christine shot back, \"you've already seen how calmly <i>our</i> young behave when I'm around, and how you felt towards me. Alissa would be the same case, and not only that, this would bring you even closer together as mother and daughter, which is something you've wanted for a long time, am I correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well...\" Nicole tried to argue, but couldn't deny that she was right on all points, \"still...I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Nicole,\" Christine whispered, kissing her once again, \"just trust me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well...\" Nicole looked down, before replying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She was happy to be out of the house and away from her mother, the drab woman that she was always working and worrying and never having any fun. Nicole had been a variety of secretarial and administration jobs since before Alissa was born, currently she was employed by the local tv station. Alissa pulled out of the driveway and made her where to Christine's place, she switched on the radio just in time to catch the last couple of horoscopes. <br>\r\n\"...expect to find love in your life if you play your cards right, Virgo; Big changes are coming your way so prepare for the unexpected, Libra; You may find your life turned upside down in coming week but it won't be forever. That is all of your news from the stars back to you Roy,\" finished the psychic in her breathy voice. <br>\r\n\"Thanks, Julie,\" said the DJ, \"If you're interested in that you may interested in hearing that last night there were over a dozen reported UFO sighting within the state making it the highest number on record since 1972, the government has issued a statement saying 'it will look into as many as these reports as possible but does not expect to find anything', what do you think Lisa?\" said the DJ directing the question to his co-host. <br>\r\n\"It was prom night for many schools in the are last night, sounds like a few people were hitting the 'fruit punch' a little too hard,\" said Lisa before continuing, \"so in honour of all you kooks out there, we're now playing Sneaky Sound System's 'UFO', followed by David Bowie's 'Starman', you're listening to Roy and Lisa's Midday Madness brought to you by, Palvo's Dairy.\"<br>\r\nAlissa turned off the radio as the opening note to the song began, 'Life turned upside down in the coming week,' she thought to herself, no surprises there she was graduating in a few days, her mother was a Virgo and Alissa was planning to move out as soon as possible after graduating, so that was probably the big change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack out the house Nicole had finished off the last of the food and getting ready to head out to restock the fridge, she couldn't believe how much she ate. She really couldn't, she kept telling herself things like 'there was less food than she thought to begin with,' or 'that most of the packets or food were nearly empty to begin with.' Nicole knew she had eaten a lot, more than anyone thought possible, and it showed, a significant swell in her lower abdomen now bulged over her jeans that she had put on and her button up shirt she had put on was straining to cover it. Nicole had no idea what had gotten into to make eat so much, whatever it was she hoped it didn't happen again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Christine\u2019s features were a blend of her Korean mother\u2019s and American father\u2019s, both were quite conservative. This was probably why Christine was less out going then most girls her age and why she was one of the few people in her and Alissa\u2019s grade that actually wore a proper school uniform, even Nicole let Alissa get away with only wearing the uniform\u2019s shirt leaving Alissa to choose what else to wear with it. Though through teenage rebellion and encouragement by Alissa, Christine began making some bolder decisions, in a way. She developed a taste for heavy metal music, which Alissa herself wasn\u2019t particularly fond of and Christine\u2019s parents were certainly not pleased with and whilst she was allowed to put band poster up in her room she couldn\u2019t listen to the music without headphones, something that Christine assured Alissa ruined the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alissa knocked at the door it was answered by her Christine\u2019s mother, who automatically said \u201cshe\u2019s upstairs with her headphones on listening to that ungodly racket.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Mrs Allen,\u201d said Alissa making her way to the staircase.<br>\r\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d a newspaper in the livingroom appeared to ask.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Christine\u2019s friend Alissa, dear,\u201d replied Mrs Allen.<br>\r\n\u201cTell her that she\u2019s upstairs with her headphones on listening to that ungodly racket,\u201d said Mr Allen turning a page to the newspaper that was concealing his upper body.<br>\r\n\u201cI already have dear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter knocking on Christine\u2019s door twice with no answer, Alissa opened the door to reveal her friend was indeed at her computer, leaning back in her desk chair, with her eyes closed and headphones on. Alissa tapped her on the shoulder causing Christine to jolt which unplugged her headphones from her computer. There was a brief sound of a couple of guitars and a drum kit being tortured before Christine hastily turned it off. \u201cAlissa you should texted me to let me know when you\u2019d be here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI did,\u201d said Alissa smiling and sitting on the edge of Christine\u2019s bed.<br>\r\nChristine looked at her phone and the three unread message on it, \u201cOh.\u201d<br>\r\nThe petite girl now automatically sat with her legs together with her hands clasped on her lap, the image contrasted greatly with her room, with its pastel pink walls mostly covered by dark band posters and her black quilt cover with a skull motif, making it looked like she was sitting in the room of an older sibling rather than her own.<br>\r\nChristine produced Alissa\u2019s shoe from behind her chair, \u201cHow did you get home without it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I was so wasted I hardly remember anything since we arrived at Jessie\u2019s after the prom.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou looked that way,\u201d did you hear what happened to Paul?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOnly bits and pieces,\u201d said Alissa, \u201cWeren\u2019t the police called in?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I heard.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you and Lee?\u201d asked Alissa.<br>\r\nChristine blushed and looked down, \u201cYou remember that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHard not to, you two were inseparable all night,\u201d said Alissa laughing before asking in a whisper, \u201cSo you did you two do it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! No,\u201d said Christine shocked, Alissa shook her head even when drunk as a skunk Christine still followed her parent\u2019s ethics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a beep from Christine\u2019s computer, letting her know that she had an email, she swivelled round to see what it was, \u201cIt\u2019s just a daily newsletter on local news,\u201d she said dismissively, \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s nothing\u2026oh no.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Alissa craning to see what it was, \u201cnothing to with what happened with Pau\u2026oh that,\u201d as she saw a headline mentioning the high number sightings of flying saucers last night.<br>\r\nThat was another thing about Christine she had this strange interest in aliens, she didn\u2019t go out looking for it, Alissa wasn\u2019t sure if Christine owned a telescope, it was like part of her knew that aliens didn\u2019t exist but every time there was a sighting or a story about a crop circles it was all Christine could talk about. She once asked her father if he could take her to see area 51 but was disappointed when he said \u201che wasn\u2019t in that part of the military,\u201d before adding rather lamely, \u201cnot that the place exists.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it, the highest number of sightings in one night in my lifetime and was too drunk to notice,\u201d said Christine.<br>\r\n\u201cThe people who did see them probably were drunk too,\u201d said Alissa stopping short of actually saying aliens don\u2019t exist, she had argued with Christine about it once before and didn\u2019t want to do it again.<br>\r\n\u201cWho knows if they\u2019ll be back,\u201d said Christine wistfully looking out a gap in her curtains at the sky.<br>\r\nAlissa decided to change to topic, \u201cAre you ready for our summer trip?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNearly, I still need a swimsuit,\u201d replied Christine tearing her gaze back inside.<br>\r\n\u201cChristine we\u2019re going to Florida, you going to need at least three,\u201d said Alissa picking up her things, it was going to be tough to find a swimsuit that looked good on Christine as her friend lacked any curve what so ever, but Alissa the challenge was going to be half the fun, \u201ccome on lets go get you some, I\u2019ll drive.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was strange as she still felt stuffed from breakfast and her taut stomach occasionally groaned in discomfort, but somehow she was also incredibly hungry and needed to eat. Every item she passed called out to her and body demanded to consume it. Even now it took every bit of self-control she had not to tear open the packets and start eating now.<br>\r\n\u201cThat will be $384.95,\u201d said the cashier, Nicole produced her card wordlessly. \u201cDo you have a Sho\u2026\u201d began the cashier.<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d snapped Nicole much more harshly than she intended.<br>\r\n\u201cJust swipe or tap your card,\u201d said the cashier slightly taken aback.<br>\r\nNicole finished the transaction as the cashier loaded the bags into the trolley.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Nicole in an attempt to make up for her tone before, but she didn\u2019t wait for a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole pushed the trolley across mall towards the doors leading out as fast as she could, she was nearly there all had to do was get to the car and then she could start eating, all she needed to do was hold on for another couple of minutes. But between her and the doors was the food court and as she passed through the concoctions of aromas stopped her in her tracks, her belly moaned as her unbeknown brood demanded sustenance, she needed food NOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the nearest food outlet without a queue, a burger joint named \u2018BurgerTreat\u2019 and headed to counter. The employee behind the counter, a young headed woman, took an unconscious step back as Nicole barrelled down on her, grabbing the counter with both hands letting the trolley veer off hitting a table nearby.<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to BurgerTre\u2026\u201d began the employee.<br>\r\n\u201cGive me food,\u201d barked Nicole as her extra-terrestrial unborn screamed at her to eat.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat food would you like,\u201d said employee somewhat perplexed.<br>\r\nNicole scanned the menu above the counter before pointing at the picture of the biggest thing she could see, \u201cThat.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAn Ultimate Burger Meal Dealtm?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo two,\u201d said Nicole before clutching at her belly which groaned louder than ever.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok ma\u2019am?\u201d asked the employee touching Nicole\u2019s arm.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, just need food,\u201d said Nicole.<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026so two Ultimate Burger Meal Dealstm?\u201d<br>\r\nNicole\u2019s belly groaned again, the bottom button popped of her shirt with a 'ping' revealing the lower curve of her swelling abdomen, \u201cMore.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Alissa and Christine enter the mall they noticed there was small ring of people around one of outlets in the food court, many had their phones out and were taking pictures or videos of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are there so many people around BurgerTreat?\u201d asked Christine, \u201cIt\u2019s not even the best burger place in the food court.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a celebrity like an actor or singer dining there,\u201d said Alissa drawing out her own phone in preparation.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure,\u201d said Christine doubtfully following, \u201cwhich celebrity would go to burger treat?\u201d<br>\r\nThe pair pressed their way into the ring of people and were shocked to see the sight that met their eyes.<br>\r\nIt was Nicole, Alissa\u2019s mother, but something seemed strange about her, several things really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly she was eating like there was no tomorrow, seeming to shove entire burgers into her mouth. Alissa didn\u2019t know how long Nicole had been there but guessing by the remains of numerous food packets that surrounded her it was probably quite some time but then again given the speed Nicole was consuming food at maybe it wasn\u2019t that long. <br>\r\nThe other strange thing were the changes in Nicole\u2019s physique, these changes were partly due to the sheer amount food she consumed and the other reason unbeknown to anyone (including Nicole herself) was changes her body was making to carry the interstellar brood developing within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole\u2019s hips, already larger than usual had widen since Alissa last saw them, and she now had a vast backside to match, with each perky cheek noticeably curving from her frame like a pair of volleyballs and were straining the fabric of her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore concerning to Alissa (and Nicole had she not been so focused on eating several time her own ever increasing body weight) was Nicole\u2019s belly. All but the top few buttons had burst open on her shirt and the orb of flesh the size of an over inflated basket ball that was Nicole\u2019s belly was on complete display. The skin of her bulging abdomen was paler that the rest of her body and whilst Nicole\u2019s clothes were stained with sauce, mustard and other condiments, her belly (along the rest of her body) was clear of such things, though a thin layer of grease coated her belly giving it a reflective sheen. Alissa overheard people in the crowd saying Nicole\u2019s belly seemed to be visibly growing, and to Alissa's mind it also appeared to be growing before her eyes. Though she wasn\u2019t sure as her mother\u2019s bulging abdomen churned as Nicole forced more and more food inside herself, one thing that Alissa clearly saw however was Nicole\u2019s belly button go from an innie to a proud and prominent outie with an audible \u2018Pop!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa looked around in embarrassment at the crowd who were staring in silent amazement at Nicole\u2019s feast. Christine was also silently staring at Nicole like the rest of the crowd with the same look of shock and awe as the rest of the small crowd but Alissa didn\u2019t pick up on the additional desire and wonder in her friend\u2019s eyes as Christine gazed at Nicole\u2019s swollen middle with its now protruding nub of a belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole seemed oblivious to her surroundings, including the crowd of people, as she drained a jumbo sized drink in a matter of second and gave large belch before giving a stretch causing her chest to stick out prominently showing a pair of swollen breasts, noticeably larger than Alissa remembered, straining the remaining few buttons on Nicole\u2019s shirt, with one the button pooping off and giving a glimpse to a lacy black bra that was not fairing much better than the shirt in containing Nicole\u2019s increasingly ample bosom. Nicole found burger within the pile of cups and containers that covered the table, she leaned back in her seat and took a bite out of the burger not bothering to unwrap it first. As she did this one hand absentmindedly reached down and undid the button on her pants, there seemed to be a sigh of relief that came from Nicole\u2019s body as the pants were undone and despite not being restricted by them Nicole\u2019s belly bulged out even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa couldn\u2019t bear it any longer and signalled to Christine to leave.<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026?\u201d said Christine dreamily<br>\r\n\u201cI said lets go,\u201d said Alissa grabbing her friend\u2019s hand and dragging her towards the clothing shops.<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2026want\u2026\u201d started Christine feebly before complying and accompanying Alissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour after the two left Nicole was still eating but she pretty much ran out of food from the several orders she made, she wasn\u2019t how many burger meals she ate as she lost count after twenty. The cashier who had served her earlier came up to Nicole looking down at the seated older woman with a look that was mixture of concern and disgust \u201cAre you alright ma\u2019am?\u201d<br>\r\nNicole\u2019s gut answered first as it gave a bubbling groan followed by Nicole belching in the face of cashier who wrinkled her nose. Starting to become aware to her surroundings Nicole blushed in embarrassment, \u201cSorry, no I am fine just a littl\u2026ooof,\u201d she said. Nicole\u2019s hands flew to her swollen stomach and she gave a loud gutful groan as her digestive system let her know that it couldn\u2019t handle more than a month\u2019s worth of food for an entire family in one sitting and made its discomfort known in full. \u201cUUUUGGHH! I\u2019m just... so full,\u201d she said as her innards felt like they were close to bursting open.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want me to call an ambulance?\u201d said the cashier.<br>\r\n\u201cNo!,\" fear sweeping over her as she began to realise what she had done, \"I just need to \u2018oooooh\u2019 get home,\u201d said Nicole getting to her feet ungainly not used to her new weight.<br>\r\nEveryone in the small crowd watched still in complete silence as Nicole waddle to her trolley still filled with food and using her now substantial weight to push it, walked towards the exit all the while with Nicole moaning and her belly groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cashier watched the lumbering figure leave, she said under her breath \u201cwas her ass always that big?\u201d referring to Nicole\u2019s increasingly generous rear. Just then the cashier\u2019s own stomach gave a rumble a wave of hunger swept over her.</span></div></div>",

Something was wrong with her and she needed to find out what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe now sat in the doctor's waiting room somewhat embarrassed by the fact the lower buttons on her shirt could not be done up giving the world a view of the swollen mass of her belly, her stomachache had subsided but her belly still throbbed dully constantly reminding her of the inordinate amount of food she had consumed. Nicole couldn't sit still, she occasionally tugged at her shirt in the vain hope that it had become larger and could be done up, her pants, already a problem due her large hips, were stretched to their limit in an effort to cover her also growing rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was so preoccupied with her clothing that she was shock when she felt a hand on her belly, she turned to see the old lady sitting next to her, who had reached out and was now rubbing Nicole's swollen lower abdomen. \"Not far off hey dear?\u201d she said.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No?!\u201d said Nicole instinctively recoiling away as best she could.<br>\r\nThe old lady who looked fifteen years Nicole\u2019s senior, though good for her age, looked surprised at her response said, \u201cNo need to be upset, I\u2019m here with my one of mine who is expecting her first, but she insists I wait out here as she wants the gender to be a surprise but everyone in my family has started off with a girl, last check up the general doctor, I must say she left it a bit late for her first child but better late than never,\u201d rambled the woman before asking, \u201cthis isn\u2019t your first is it?\u201d<br>\r\nNicole didn\u2019t want say it was her second because she was still hoping that the doctor would tell that her swollen stomach was just a retention of water or a build-up of gas and would give her something for it that would make it go away as fast as it came, but she didn\u2019t want to argue the fact with this woman especially given the way Nicole appeared. \u201cI have a teenage daughter,\u201d she said, deciding on a technical truth.<br>\r\n\u201cLooking forward to becoming a big sister is she?\u201d<br>\r\nNicole was then froze in fear, she was not aware that Alissa had seen her like this, not since she had balloon up, how would she react, again Nicole hoped again the doctor would be able to help her so she had an explanation for her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole cast around in her mind for a technically true answer to tell the old lady when the door to the doctor\u2019s office open and a dark hair beaming woman in her mid 30s came out. The old lady stood up and made her way over her daughter and asking, \u201cEverything ok Jacinta?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course\u201d the daughter nodded her name and complexion giving away her and her mother\u2019s Mediterranean ancestry, she looked at Nicole. The old lady went to help Nicole up, who wave it away as politely as she could, she did want act as though she was pregnant in the hope that this would help her not look pregnant, but as she heaved herself to her feet Nicole felt that it made no difference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJacinta this is\u2026\u201d the old woman began saying, \u201cWhere are my manners I didn\u2019t get you name?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNicole,\u201d panted Nicole still winded from standing up.<br>\r\n\u201cand I am Rosemary and this is my daughter Jacinta who as you can see is expecting as well,\u201d said Rosemary as though Jacinta\u2019s pregnancy needed announcing again<br>\r\nNicole cringed internally as Rosemary described her as \u2018expecting\u2019, Jacinta practically rushed forward until her rounded belly, that was covered by a long dress was touching Nicole\u2019s exposed one. \u201cLook at you,\u201d Jacinta said, \u201cso far along and with twins?\u201d Nicole would have stepped back were the bank of chairs not been right behind her. Nicole wondered how big she must really look for Jacinta to ask that, but she was distracted by another concern. Though it was difficult to tell from this angle and especially as Jacinta\u2019s belly was covered but as far as Nicole could tell Jacinta was only a week or so from being full term and as far as she could see Nicole\u2019s own belly seemed to be the bigger of the two.<br>\r\nNicole sort for a response that would return the compliment to Jacinta that would also allow Nicole to extricate herself from touching bellies, but just then Nicole\u2019s belly gave an audible gurgle and a second later Nicole loudly burped in the face of the two women, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d said Nicole hoping now more than ever for a reason to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hopes were answered as the doctor appeared in the doorway to her office and called Nicole\u2019s name out. \u201cIt was nice to meet you both,\u201d she said before making her way to the doctor, she felt the eyes of the other two women on her as she tried not to let her walk become a waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the door snapped shut behind Nicole, Rosemary said, \u201cDid you see the culo on her,\u201d referring to Nicole increasingly generous behind.<br>\r\n\u201cMother!\u201d scoffed Jacinta at the fact her mother even knew such a word little lone use it, before putting a hand on her belly, \u201clet\u2019s get something to eat on the way home.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut we stopped for food on the way in,\u201d replied her mother but Rosemary too now also felt surprisingly hungry.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But he couldn\u2019t find either and all the staff had been saying that woman had come in and ate it all. The store manager knew that it was impossible for one person to eat all that food in one go, not without them bursting and leaving bits littering the surrounding food court; no doubt someone was stealing supplies, and the store manager had made a note to check the security cameras later. <br>\r\nHe was checking the freezer in the back when Peter, the greasy teen who manned the equally greasy fry machine came up to him.<br>\r\n\u201cUh sir, we have problem.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d began the store manager sarcastically, \u201cthe woman is back and has taken more of our supplies?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh um err,\u201d stuttered Peter who was not trained with dealing with this much sarcasm, \u201cNo it\u2019s Samantha, she um uh, you better come and take a look for yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two came up to the sundae machine where Samantha the twenty something red haired woman who had served Nicole earlier now with her head under the nozzle of the soft serve machine and was pouring a constant stream of artificial dairy product into her mouth. The store manager watched in silence as short woman with a few strands of hair escaping her bun whilst engaged in tablo that looked like it belonged in a cartoon. \u201cI saved her burning herself as she was trying to eat handfuls of fries straight from the trough,\u201d said the greasy youth as though the company awarded medals for such acts.<br>\r\nThe store manager gave a vague grunt as he thought, Samantha had only applied for the job to help pay her way through college and was quite against the food sold a BurgerTreat, to the stage where the store manager had received complaints from several employees and even a couple customers that Samantha had lectured and chastised them about the food they were eating and how it was bad for their health. <br>\r\nThe store manager wasn\u2019t sure how long she had been there for but given the way her shirt had pulled back unable to cover a bloated and taut belly that made Samantha look like she was 20 weeks pregnant it had to be for some time. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d asked Peter, \u201cI tried to stop her, but she pushed me away, I could unplug the machine if you want?\u201d <br>\r\nThe store manager gave a vindictive grin, \u201clet her finish then ask her to pay for what she\u2019s had.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And that was only the beginning I later went shopping to restock the food I had eaten and before I could leave the shops I felt hungry again and order and consumed a dozen burger meals, I ate all of them. It was all I could do not to each the groceries I just purchased, my brain was telling me to stop but my kept telling me to eat.\u201d<br>\r\nNicole finished her list, \u201cuh huh,\u201d said Vanessa Porter, clearly not believing Nicole, \u201cthat seems a bit unbelievable.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know didn\u2019t think anyone could eat that much.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHave you noticed any other changes?\u201d asked Vanessa and nodded towards Nicole\u2019s engorged breasts.<br>\r\n\u201cWell yes\u2026but it\u2019s not like that,\u201d said an increasingly flustered Nicole.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d the doctor without really meaning it while marking something off on her clipboard.<br>\r\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t be though,\u201d bemoaned Nicole, \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex in over a year,\u201d she added.<br>\r\n\u201cI know this is troubling to you, but can I get you to stand so I can examine your\u2026you,\u201d said Dr Porter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole heaved herself clumsily to her feet and the doctor produced a measuring tape slung it around Nicole. For a second Nicole was afraid that it wouldn\u2019t reach around her, but it did and Vansessa wrote something on her clipboard which Nicole couldn\u2019t see; The doctor bent down and place a stethoscope on Nicole\u2019s stomach and start to examine it.<br>\r\nNicole felt increasing self-conscious as Dr Porter examined her swollen abdomen, the doctor\u2019s cold hands seemed incredibly small against the mass of her belly. The belly itself kept groaning and bubbling as though something was brewing inside it, what was worst is seemed to be getting louder.<br>\r\nWhen she had finish measuring and listening to Nicole\u2019s bulging stomach she straightened up and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to ask y\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cURRRPP!\u201d for the third time that day Nicole loudly belched in the face of someone, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d in a voice that seemed like a whisper after the volume of the burp.<br>\r\nThe doctor waved it away and continued, \u201cCould you please stand on the scale,\u201d she said gesturing to the scale in question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole tentatively hopped on the scales which felt awfully fragile under her, Dr Porter crouched down to write down the wait as Nicole was unable to see it through her protruding belly. \u201cone\u2026one\u2026 seven point eight,\u201d said the doctor as she wrote down the weight on her clipboard.<br>\r\nNicole inadvertently stepped off the scales, this information shocked her the most, while she didn\u2019t weigh herself regularly she didn\u2019t yo-yo diet, so if she weighed 117.8kg that would mean she would gain over 45kg since she last checked her weight, most of it in the past few days, the cold hard fact that she now weighed more than she ever had in her life that drilled home the fact how much her body has changed, and changed it had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer spherical looking belly looked like the textbook definition of pregnancy though larger, whilst her pants which normally saggy in the seat, as Nicole often had to buy a size up to fit her hips, were now stretched to tearing point as they tried to contain the growing mounds of flesh that were Nicole\u2019s butt cheeks, and her breasts felt imprisoned by her bra. It was strange that she gained weight exclusively in these places, her arms and legs actually seemed thinner than before, she wasn\u2019t sure if that was really happening or if it was an illusion in comparison to the swelling parts of her body. It was like said body was trying to make itself look as fecund as possible. Meanwhile inside Nicole\u2019s womb a multitude of things floated, attached to their unwitting mother there were several things that set this apart from a normal pregnancy, first was the offspring itself whilst they looked vaguely like an early fetus they also seemed to be tadpole like, the other was the number of them over fifty of the things were attached to Nicole they were sending out signals to their host, making it produce hormones and change. Nicole\u2019s body was being reconfigured to be a \u2018baby\u2019 factory, its primary function was now become to grow and contain what was growing inside her womb. Her offspring would need to do a lot more growing and as such Nicole would need to do a lot more growing a whole lot more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you are sure that you are not pregnant but could you take a test,\u201d said the doctor drawing out pack of pregnancy tests from the bottom draw of her desk and gesturing to the door to her office\u2019s bathroom. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a string bikini, Christine was not the kind of person to wear such a revealing piece of clothing, normally going with a swim shirt and board shorts when she went swimming, but as Alissa had said \u201cyou don\u2019t go to Florida to cover yourself up.\u201d It didn\u2019t help that said bikini was white with a sparse collection of colourful shapes rather than the black with skulls that Christine had wanted, \u201cIt makes me look like a child,\u201d said Christine putting the offending item on her bed and going over to her computer.<br>\r\n\u201cChildren don\u2019t wear that kind of swimming clothes,\u201d said Alissa, sitting down on the bed \u201c\u2026or least they shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake a look at this,\u201d said Christine.<br>\r\nAlissa leaned into to look at Christine\u2019s computer expecting to see a swim suit design, but sighed when she saw it was one of Christine\u2019s alien conspiracy websites. The website oozed with late 90s/early 2000s in its design and had a black background and bright green text that was painful on the eye.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is not the most accurate website,\u201d said Christine scrolling through the page.<br>\r\n\u201cNot the most accurate?\u201d said Alissa rolling her eyes, \u201cI thought you used the highest quality crack-pot sources on alien encounters.\u201d<br>\r\nChristine either didn\u2019t notice or at least pretended not to, \u201cit does however have this,\u201d she said clicking on menu option saying \u2018Mother to the Stars: Alien Pregnancy\u2019<br>\r\n\u201cSeems legit,\u201d said Alissa just as sarcastically as before, \u201cgot a colon, only official websites use punctuation like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake a listen to this,\u201d said Christine opening up an option, \u201cSusie Daisy,\u201d read Alissa, \u201cbecause that\u2019s a real name, claims she was abducted by a UFO while on the family farm and later gave birth to a pair of aliens.\u201d Below were a pair of pictures of what was presumably the same redhead woman, the first one had her posing next to a fence, in a flannel shirt and daisy dukes, it seemed so cliched Alissa found herself looking for watermark from a stock photo company. The second photo seemed much more natural with the redheaded woman now looking tired, in a cramped kitchen, wearing a pair of overalls covering a large pregnant belly that suggested twins. <br>\r\n\u201cThis proves nothing, it\u2019s just a picture of woman and another picture of similar looking pregnant woman,\u201d said Alissa dismissably, \u201conly the text says it has something to do with aliens, and that could be added to any picture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then,\u201d said Christine going back to the list of options, \u201clet\u2019s go with a one that is harder to explain.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not start with that one?\u201d asked Alissa.<br>\r\nChristine, again, either didn\u2019t hear her or pretended not to as she click on another link.<br>\r\n\u201cSofie Hjejle,\u201d read Alissa, unaware if the name was as silly sounding in its native tongue as the last one was, \u201cage 24, a member Swedish national volleyball team, was abducted by aliens when she was vacationing at a cabin in the forest, over the next few days she found herself eating an enormous amount of food, and putting on weight particularly in the belly, making her look extremely pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\nBellow was a pair of pictures; the first of was of a team photo with an arrow pointing to who Alissa assumed was Sofie, the second was the same player now standing in front of a snow covered log cabin, and wearing a large brown coat, looking even larger as it concealed an unbelievably large belly which if to be believe would be the size of an exercise ball.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s clearly fake,\u201d said Alissa, \u201cshe\u2019s probably stuck a blanket up under there.\u201d<br>\r\nChristine scrolled down to reveal a third picture of the same woman, now inside coat off and belly on full display. Alissa was so astounded by the large pale orb that it took her a moment to notice that she was wearing her volleyball playing outfit (or one very much like it) from the first picture, though it now seemed to have trouble fitting over a large pair of breasts and an enormous set of buttocks that she hadn\u2019t had in the first picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cOk, this clearly photo-shopped, look at the way she is standing side on that would make it really easy for someone to morph it, right?\u201d she wasn\u2019t too sure if that was true, but it made sense and was more plausible than the alternative. \u201cBesides we would have heard something about this if it were real, remember how much news there was on octomom and this woman is clearly larger than her.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was slightly worried earlier that I may have had to pull out because this morning when I woke up I was sick as a dog, but I\u2019m feeling much better now. I also had trouble with my outfit,\u201d she stepped back to show off her skin tight dark grey dress before continuing, \u201cNot so much with the dress but more with the bra, my umm\u2026 well breasts are slightly swollen today, not sure why, but I am planning to see a doctor tomorrow if they haven\u2019t gone back down by then, hopefully they haven\u2019t, well hopefully they haven\u2019t and there are no problems with it, though it would mean I would have to buy some new bras as this is the only one that currently fits and it\u2019s far from comfortable.\u201d She said trying to adjust a strap as she stepped back towards the camera. \u201cSo yeah, but otherwise everything is all good and ready for my speech, so fingers crossed and wished me luck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video ended, \u201cyep, that was really convincing,\u201d said Alissa sarcastically, \u201cthat contained so much indisputable proof of alien life,\u201d she continued, \u201csurprised the media hasn\u2019t got their hands on it yet.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s important we go through to full process,\u201d said Christine as she selected the next video in the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that could have gone better, not the speech, the speech went off really well, except my stomach was growling the whole way through it, no one else could hear it but it quite off putting at times, but not enough to ruin the speech. No it was the reception afterwards, for some reason couldn\u2019t stop eating, I know I was sick this morning I had a particularly large lunch though, but for some reason it was like I hadn\u2019t eaten in days. I was meant to catch up with a lot people but couldn\u2019t tear myself away from the buffet except to sit down at the table to eat, and when someone came up to me I was barely able prevent myself talking with my mouth full. Oh yeah\u2026\u201d she covered her mouth with her hand and reddened as she suddenly remembered something embarrassing. \u201cSo when Professor Annie Day, my mentor, came up to congratulate me on my speech I\u2026\u201d she trailed off before continuing, \u201cI burped in her face, like really loudly too, like everyone around me heard and turned to see, my god I was so embarrassed, she must of thought I was some sort of pig,\u201d she said covering her face again remembering the incident. \u201cBut yeah when I wasn\u2019t embarrassing myself in front of my superiors I was eating, a lot, and I was eating things I normally wouldn\u2019t have, like am not normally a fan of quiche but tonight I couldn\u2019t get enough of it, and it wasn\u2019t just that, I ate a lot and it shows.\u201d She stood back from the camera, to reveal a significant pooch in her lower belly, that hadn\u2019t been there before, clearly visible under the dress, \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sticking it out either, I\u2019m really not, see I can stick it out further if I try,\u201d she said demonstrating pushing out the curve of her belly which she ran her hands over. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not the weirdest part either,\u201d she said stepping back towards the camera, \u201cI\u2019m still hungry, like really hungry, I\u2019m planning on getting some take out delivered, so yeah, hopefully this is just this evening, but I guess we\u2019ll find out in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyeeeah, still not convinced,\u201d said Alissa as the second video ended, \u201call I see is just a woman with a food baby.\u201d Christine was scrolling down to the third video as Alissa continued \u201cChristine, I know you like to build the suspense, but can\u2019t you show me your \u2018indisputable evidence\u2019 if there really is any.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust keep watching,\u201d said Christine as she started the next video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I normally don\u2019t do this many videos in the same day but I really feel that I should show this, you know how I said I\u2019ve been really hungry and was going to get some take out despite eating a lot at the reception, well I did and I order a bit more then I normally would,\u201d she gave nervous laugh, \u201cwell not really a lot more, I was just so hungry, what was surprising is I ate it all, there was like a half a dozen family buckets,\u201d she said briefly stepping aside to give a view of the remains of them on the table in the background, before stepping back in front of the camera, \u201cI know it sounds crazy but I did eat it all, I couldn\u2019t believe myself either but look.\u201d She stepped back from the camera to give a better view of her, revealing that what had been a small bulge was now a fully pronounced pregnant belly barely covered by the dress the woman was wearing. \u201cI look like I\u2019m pregnant, which we know can\u2019t be the case,\u201d she quickly added with a nervous laugh, \u201cand it\u2019s all gone into the belly, and the bust, but yeah it\u2019s like real see you can see my belly button protruding,\u201d she said fiddling with the obvious nub clearly visible underneath the material, \u201cand I had an innie before,\u201d she said putting her hands on her hips, \u201cI can feel\u2026movement going on in there,\u201d she said her hands going back to her belly, \u201cagain can\u2019t be pregnant, it is probably just digestion going on as I did have a lot to eat as you can clearly see.\u201d She walked back closer to the camera, \u201cbut the thing is, I know I sound insane but I am still hungry like hungrier than before, I felt like I was close to bursting before but now I can\u2019t stop thinking about getting more as you can probably hear this,\u201d she prodded her swollen abdomen, \u201ccalling out for more, so I\u2019m going to go now and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow and we\u2019ll see how I feel then, bye.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment silence before Alissa said, \u201cIt\u2019s a prank, like a \u2018gotcha video\u2019, the videos are really made months apart and just uploaded at the same to create the illusion of it all happening in one night.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not married though,\u201d said Christine, \u201cthere was no ring, so who\u2019s the father?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cChristine you prude people can have babies without being married,\u201d said Alissa exasperated at her friend\u2019s cloistered values. \u201cLike I said before this is a prank, she gets pregnant does a series of videos designed to look like a series of vlog videos from the same night all to get attention or funding or likes and subscribes\u2026\u201d continued Alissa but stopped as Christine started the next video.</span></div></div>",

She turned to face the camera again, \u201csomething crazy is happening to me, I was going to wait until the morning but this,\u201d she gestured to the swollen parts of her body, \u201cis not normal, so I\u2019m going to call the hospital,\u201d she reached over towards the phone but was interrupted but a loud moan from her engorged abdomen, which caused her to shudder, \u201cmaybe I should get some more food first,\u201d she said cancelling her first call and dialling another number. \u201cSo yeah, if I don\u2019t put a video tomorrow it\u2019s because I\u2019m in the hospi\u2026hello Pizza-2-Go? I would like to place an or\u2026\u201d she said as her hand not holding the phone turned off the webcam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is wrong with that woman?\u201d said Alissa as the video came to an end, \u201cwhy isn\u2019t she going to the hospital?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo I have convinced you then?\u201d ask Christine with a grin on her face.<br>\r\nAlissa paused before saying, \u201cI\u2019m not say that it is alien, I\u2019m just saying that if that happened to me I would go to a doctor.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she was a particularly outgoing person, I watched a few of her vlogs before these and she really focused on her work,\u201d said Christine<br>\r\n\u201cHer belly was the size of octomom\u2019s! She said it herself, even you would know something was up if that had happen,\u201d said Alissa.<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026well,\u201d said Christine pausing for suspense, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s like a parasite, like those ones that makes mice not afraid of cats or the ones that makes caterpillars climb onto exposed branches so the parasite can get into a bird.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you saying that the al\u2026\u201d began Alissa before stopping herself, \u201care you saying that what ever is inside of her is controlling her mind?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo but influencing her,\u201d said Christine, \u201cevery time she thinks about going to the doctor\u2019s it distracts her desires.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWith hunger,\u201d said Alissa \u201cevery time she thinks about getting examined \u2018it\u2019 makes her hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI mean the alien probably is already making very hungry to make her eat enough for her to grow it inside her, you can\u2019t grow something without nothing,\u201d said Christine, \u201cbut yeah they probably evolved a mechanism to demand more food anytime they sense some fear hormone in its host so they can\u2019t get found out, plus the more she eats the bigger and faster the aliens grow.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt they would get big though,\u201d said Alissa.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christine didn\u2019t say anything and just started the next video.<br>\r\nThis time Sonakshi was standing side on to the computer\u2019s camera, \u201cOoh,\u201d she winced in discomfort before talking, \u201cme again, I know I normally don\u2019t yahdy yah, I haven\u2019t gone to the hospital yet but I was just sooo hungry I need to eat and, so yeah I grew somewhat again,\u201d she said blushing slightly. She shuffled back from the camera and Christine gave a small nod as Alissa gasped, Sonakshi\u2019s belly was just as large as Sofie\u2019s (the volleyball player from Christine\u2019s previous example) and while Alissa was able to convince her self that the Swede\u2019s swollen exercise ball sized belly was some sort of computer trickery, seeing the archaeologist waddle around with an abdomen was hard to be sceptical at, Alisa felt kind of sorry for the woman, her massive belly with it\u2019s large protruding navel seemed so tight, there were surprisingly no stretch marks on the swollen hazel coloured orb but it seemed so taut and heavy it looked like it would burst like a balloon at any moment, Alisa was surprised that the woman was able to stand without it touching the ground. Her belly was so big it could fit the rest of her inside it\u2026possibly, definitely her before she got\u2026pregnant but Sonakshi\u2019s belly was not the only thing that had been growing, her bountiful breast free from the bra were only a bit smaller than the woman\u2019s head, whilst buttocks had grown so large and round that it appear as though she expecting a set of twins in her rear with one baby per a cheek, it was surprising that the woman\u2019s underpants (stretched as they were) had not snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m speaking a bit louder not only because I\u2019m so far away,\u201d Sonakshi said as she slowly turned around to give of a full view of her swollen body, \u201cbut my belly keeps making noises,\u201d she fell silent and Alisa could hear it, what she had thought be either a whir of the computer, traffic outside, or a washing machine in another room was in fact a low near constant moaning emanating from the woman\u2019s engorged middle. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised it is so loud,\u201d said Sonakshi side on to the camera again, \u201cI have had a lot of food, I should probably check to see if it is more than anyone in one day,\u201d she said side stepping slightly closer to the camera, \u201cand it\u2019s working overtime to digest all of it,\u201d she continued her hands lightly caressed the taut skin of her belly. \u201cAll of the food in my massive bell\u2026\u201d she trailed off as a small peak temporarily formed on her belly, near where she was rubbing, as something from inside her kicked.<br>\r\nFor the first time Alisa saw true horror on the woman\u2019s face as she tentatively prodded where the mound had just been, a few seconds after she did her offspring kicked again, then another kicked appeared on the sphere of her belly, then another and another. Sonakshi clutched her belly and winced in discomfort as whatever was inside her erupted in a frenzy of movement, an animalist moan of pain escaped the woman\u2019s lips barely audible over the groaning of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as suddenly as it had begun the movement from within had stopped. Sonakshi looked panicked, she had clearly had forgotten about the blog as when she turned and rushed to the phone, her belly slammed into the side table, that the laptop must have been sitting on, like a wrecking ball. Surprisingly the computer survived the fall as the table it was on keeled over and even gave a view of Sonakshi (though now from the ground up and at a slight angle) as she crossed over the phone and hammered the emergency number in frantically, but as she went to raise the phone to her head a trance seemed to come over Sonakshi and instead of placing the phone on ear she put it into her mouth and took a bite out of it, Alissa covered her mouth and watched in horror and the woman chewed the plastic and wiring before swallowing and taking another bit, as her belly wobbled slightly and began to bubble happily, then the video ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201care you sure this isn\u2019t part of some independent horror film project,\u201d said Alissa, \u201clike a found footage thing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t found a film containing this,\u201d said Christine scrolling down, \u201cthere\u2019s one more video,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa prepared herself for what she would see but she still what taken aback when she saw the person in the final video.<br>\r\nIt was possible to see woman of Sonakshi, her arms, shoulders, back, faces and lower legs all appeared unchanged by her ordeal, but that seemed like a small thing compared to the rest of her body. Like cell infected by a virus Sonakshi\u2019s body main purpose seemed to have been changed from its own survival to being a host for the constant reproduction of its invader, and like an infected cell she seemed close to bursting.<br>\r\nHer breasts had now surpassed the size of her head and barely contained by her dress which now resemble a sports bra, her hips had widened and bottom looked like it was carrying sextuplets on its own with each cheek being the size and approximate shape of a small beachball, needless to say her underpants had already snapped.<br>\r\nBut all this seemed trivial next to Sonakshi\u2019s belly, Alissa didn\u2019t know how many the woman appeared to be having, 30? 40? 50? She looked ready to give birth to a hippotumus, a fully groan one. Alissa had thought the woman\u2019s apartment looked small to begin with and now most of it was taken up by the pulsating sphere that was her belly.<br>\r\nThere was so much movement from within her belly it looked to Alisa like a tent with several people moving around inside of it, but unlike a tent which went from laxed to stretched Sonakshi\u2019s belly went from taut to even tighter.<br>\r\nThe movement and sounds coming from her belly were not uniform either, some parts wobbled and bubbled, other parts groaned as it received kicks from within, while other sections merely seemed to \u2018bloop\u2019 in both sound and movement, it was as though her belly was a factory with different activities taking place in different areas of her expansive belly.<br>\r\nWhen she had gotten over the shock of incredibly swollen fertile state Sonakshi\u2019s body Alisa noticed other strange things. Several bottles littered the floor, one was a drain cleaning product, another was a bottle shampoo, all of them have had their lids taken off\u2026bitten off, corrected Alissa herself as she noticed the bite makes on the bottles, and their contents drained. The sofa in the apartment seemed to have one arm rest torn open and the other one gnawed away entirely.<br>\r\n\u201cDid she\u2026\u201d Alissa began to ask but Christine held up a finger to silence her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonakshi\u2019s had picked the computer up from the floor, how she had managed to do such a thing was anyone guess, her belly seem to be too large and heavy to move. She rested the laptop somewhere on her swollen abdomen and started to make a panicked plea to the camera but was barely able to get her words out between her burps and moans of discomforts all the while her belly was making threatening groaning noises so loud it threatened to drown her voice out.<br>\r\n\u201cIf anyone is currently watURRRP, if anyone is watching I need an ambulOOOORRRH,\u201d Sonakshi made such a gut-filled moan it sounded like she was trying pass out a small car, which for all Alissa knew she was.<br>\r\n\u201cI need an ambulance now, there is something growing inside me, making me eat and it\u2019s feels like it\u2019s trying to OOOOOOHUUURRP\u201d she said as a moan of pain became a burp.<br>\r\n\u201cI need anything, I\u2019m at numbOOOOOORRH,\u201d as she gave another moan a bright light seemed to fill the apartment and then the video finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence which was even more poignant after the organic cacophony that Sonakshi was making from the video.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to her,\u201d asked Alissa carefully, afraid of what the answer would be.<br>\r\n\u201cOh she\u2019s alive,\u201d said Christine opening up another tab and finding a picture. It showed Sonakshi at what looked like an excavation, she seemed much like she did before her ordeal her belly was gone though\u2026 \u201cShe got a promotion afterwards, I\u2019m guessing going up several cup sizes would do that,\u201d Christine said with only the smallest hint of bitterness. Alissa looked back to the picture, Sonakshi\u2019s breasts while not as large as they had been in the last video (or the second last one for that matter) were still much larger than they were beforehand. Her bottom also was larger than it was before her experience, while not the monstrous thing it was by the end Sonakshi\u2019s rear was the size and shape that would make it stand out in most rap videos.<br>\r\n\u201cDoes she remembered what happened to her?\u201d asked Alissa.<br>\r\n\u201cNone of it,\u201d replied Christine, \u201ceven when people sent her the vlogs,\u201d she continued going back to the home page of the website, \u201cshe ended up stopping her vlogs because she was so annoyed with people asking her about it.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why hasn\u2019t the government looked into this?\u201d asked Alissa in a final attempt to remain a bit sceptical<br>\r\n\u201cWho says they haven\u2019t?\u201d replied Christine.</span></div></div>",

Alissa told her friend that she didn\u2019t need her to come but Christine insisted on providing support, even if that mean she needed to get a taxi or uber back to her place. There were some lights on, suggesting that Nicole, or someone else, was already there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she crossed the threshold of her house Alissa\u2019s determination broke.<br>\r\n\u201cLook Christine, I appreciate you coming to help me with this but after all that you showed me today I\u2019m not sure if\u2026, I mean I still need to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDigest it all,\u201d finished Christine looking around eagerly for evidence of aliens.<br>\r\n \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to sleep on it, maybe it will all be sorted out by morning\u201d, Alissa making her way to the staircase.<br>\r\n\u201cOver by tomorrow\u2026\u201d said Christine to herself, lost in thought.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, like it is all a bad dread or something,\u201d said Alissa not noticing her friend\u2019s reverie, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know how it goes tomorrow at school, just remember to lock the front door on your way out, night.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRight night\u2026\u201d said Christine as Alissa went to her room upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine waited until she heard the door to Alissa\u2019s room, open and then close again, before moving. Alissa probably didn\u2019t want her to look around, though she hadn\u2019t directly forbidden it. Christine made her way to the kitchen first, based upon Nicole\u2019s behaviour earlier it seemed the most likely place to start looking.<br>\r\nNicole wasn\u2019t in the kitchen though it was pretty obvious she had been there at some point; the discarded remains of food packets and containers littered the floor (all of course empty). No attempt to prepare or cook anything seemed to have been made though. While there seemed to be no pattern to detritus on the ground, Christine imaged how ravenously hungry her friend\u2019s mother must have been to leave such scene, a small trail was leading out of the another doorway at the other end of the kitchen.<br>\r\nFollowing the trail Christine saw that it led into what she knew to be Nicole\u2019s room, and the door was open. Creeping up to the doorway she peered into the room, the light was off, but she could see Nicole or something else was on the bed. <br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t know if Nicole was asleep or awake but she had come too far to back out now, Christine turned on the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike with the kitchen the floor of the bedroom was littered with empty food packets, there were also quite a few on the bed but they were overshadowed (both metaphorically and literally) by Nicole.<br>\r\nNicole was lying on her back roughly in the centre of the bed, she was gently rubbing her belly had grown noticeably since Christine had last saw her, the same size and shape as a small beachball, the round mass towered over the rest of her. Nicole had taken off her shoes but still wearing her sock, she was also still wearing (as best she could) the same pants as earlier, though her button up shirt had been removed leaving her top half uncovered except for a lacy black bra that seemed to be having a tough time containing Nicole\u2019s now rather ample bosom. Nicole must have been awake as she sat up (with some difficulty) to see who it was. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s you I thought you might have be\u2026ooh,\u201d began Nicole before clutching at her belly as wave of pain swept across it, presumably from it being packed to bursting point with food again.<br>\r\n\u201cMrs Sterling?\u201d said Christine hesitantly, slowly making her was closer to the swollen woman.<br>\r\n\u201cI can expl\u2026ooorrf,\u201d Nicole began before once again being stopped by the discomfort that her body was experiencing.<br>\r\n\u201cMrs Sterling it\u2019s alright,\u201d said Christine now on the bed and slowly reaching out to Nicole\u2019s bloated abdomen.<br>\r\nNicole not seeing this tried to say, \u201cYou should g\u2026ooorrgh,\u201d but once again was unable to.<br>\r\n\u201cHere let me help,\u201d said Christine and began to rub Nicole\u2019s belly. <br>\r\nThis seemed to do the trick as the pain in Nicole\u2019s stomach went from intense waves to a constant yet dull throb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Nicole sitting back against the headboard of her bed, as Christine continued to gently rub the sphere of her belly.<br>\r\n\u201cNo probably,\u201d said Christine.<br>\r\n\u201cToday has be one crazy experience.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI expect it has been.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe how much I have eaten,\u201d she gestured to the packets of food around the place, \u201cand this is only a tiny fraction of what I have eaten today.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, your body needs a lot of sustenance given what you are carrying,\u201d said Christine. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m car\u2026\u201d Nicole began to ask, but at that point Christine\u2019s thumb clipped the large protruding nub that was Nicole\u2019s navel causing Nicole\u2019s entire body to blissfully shudder as a tingle shot through it, wiping Christine\u2019s last statement from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two remained there for several minutes, Nicole feeling more relaxed then she had all day, while Christine greedily rubbed the older woman\u2019s massive middle, eagerly taking in every detail. She particularly enjoyed feeling the movement from within Nicole\u2019s belly, not sure if it was to poor woman\u2019s digestive tract trying in vain to deal with all the food stuffed into it or the extra-terrestrial brood growing with in her.<br>\r\nA fainting bubbling started inside the depths of Nicole and Christine excitedly leaned forward, placing an ear to Nicole\u2019s vast bump her caressing increasing in intensity in her excitement. The faster and more vigorously she rubbed the louder the bubbling got, causing Christine to get more excited and her to rub Nicole\u2019s belly with even more force. Nicole winced in discomfort as whatever was making the noise inside her seemed to become dislodged, \u201cChristine dear maybe you could,\u201d she started.<br>\r\nChristine looked up partly in response to Nicole talking but mainly to follow the noise travel up Nicole\u2019s body to her head and\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cURRRRRRPPPP,\u201d Nicole let out the loudest belch she had all day, right into the face of Christine.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Nicole her face turning red in embarrassment, \"That keeps...happening.\"<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d said Christine, slightly light headed from the strength of the belch, \u201cyou have a lot going on inside you as your body wouldn\u2019t be used to carrying such a burden,\u201d she said patting Nicole\u2019s belly and accidentally brushed the woman\u2019s outie causing Nicole to once again shudder in bliss as a tingle coursed through out her. Christine thought it might be a good time to leave, in case Alissa came down stair looking for what made the noise. \u201cI should get going,\u201d she said, Nicole just moaned in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Christine left the Sterlings' house (locking up as she did), she thought about how best to record the information she had gather currently unaware that she was leaving with more than just data\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had only recent taken the job and moved from Japan to America, to her family's mixed feelings. <br>\r\nA shy girl since moving Ayano hadn't made any friends and only had regular communication with her boss; the middle aged, pale blonde haired and elegant, Mrs Emily Rochen Co director to the Atarash\u012bdesu Pharmacy West Coast American branch. The only other person she regularly communicated to was her landlord, who Ayano had never even met and just paid rent into and received letters left in front of the door to her cramped apartment. She saw other people; work colleges, baristas and other people from her day to day life but felt so nervous talking to people that she hadn't struck up even an acquaintance, little lone a friend. She several friend before, school sort of forces people to mingle but they were all back in Japan or had moved somewhere else, she occasionally talked to some of them on the internet via video chat, but this was happening less and less now as her friend were getting married and having children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyano wanted to be a mother so much, she had picked names and clothes out for her future children, she knew which parks she would take them to and which hospital to have them at, she was so ready to become a mother, except she lacked a father for her children. A father wasn't mandatory for raising the children, she could provide more then enough love them by herself, but a father was kind of necessary for the having the children in the first place. She had considered just receiving a sperm donation but shuddered to think what her family would think, her grandparents already disapproved of her move overseas and whilst her parents were more supporting of her transpacific move they would die of shame if their only daughter had children in such an unconventional manner. So despite her pretty face the she had always been single since moving as a result of her shyness unlikely to achieve her dream of motherhood.<br>\r\nIt was also as a result of her shyness that she was leaving work late tonight, on Friday there was often a hepatic and loud rush to leave which Ayano always wish to avoid so she would often wait a few hours before leaving as to avoid it, it also had the added bonus that she avoided all the rush hour traffic jams but it had the drawback of it was often nightfall before she left, as it was tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the petite young woman crossed the deserted dark car park... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The lecture hall broke into whispering as Professor Kun Lin walked into class, mainly for the way she chose to present herself to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKun was always rather formally dressed, but when she went into the field, she dressed mainly for comfort. So, it was a shock to her students to see her walk into the class with her blouse tied up, her stomach exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can hear all of your whispering, and I\u2019m going to explain why I\u2019m dressed like this: I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d Kun declares in front of her desk in the lecture hall, leading to the whispering to grow louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKun takes a microphone, hooking it to her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, in the field of archaeology, you\u2019re going to make some strange discoveries. And I must inform you all: the baby isn\u2019t human.\u201d She puts a hand to her still flat stomach. She reaches into her bag, pulling out a jar with a thin rectangle cut out of the lid. \u201cNow,\u201d She puts it down on her desk, \u201cI must inform you that I\u2019m bearing an egg, and it may or may not grow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA student toward the front of the class raises her hand. \u201cUmm\u2026 Professor? What do you mean it\u2019s an egg? And what\u2019s the jar for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Kara, while on the field, we discovered a small, undeveloped egg. And long story short, I\u2019m the host for the time being. And the jar, well\u2026 I know that in public, people like to touch pregnant stranger\u2019s bellies, so I\u2019m going to set something up. Here is a jar, and you will put money in it, and the proceeds will go to the children\u2019s hospital.\u201d She turns the computer on the desk on, the projector hanging from the ceiling whirring into life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen gradually lowers, showing a price chart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, if my belly should grow, then you must pay a quarter to touch it, and it can be for no longer than ten seconds. Pay fifty, up to a minute. A dollar will get you ten second belly-touching sessions for the period, while two will get you full minute sessions for the whole period. However, these sessions cannot be while I\u2019m lecturing. But, I\u2019ve got a lot of silent study prepared for you all so I can monitor the egg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same student raises her hand again, \u201cUmm\u2026 why are you letting us touch your stomach, again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause strangers feel the need to believe pregnant women are like Buddhas. But if you pay, then I\u2019ll act like a Buddha for you, however, there\u2019s more payment options: three dollars will get you a single ten second touching session, bare bellied. Pay less, you get a clothed belly. Five dollars, full minute of bare belly touching, but you also have the option to rub. By the way, all options that are five dollars are more allowing rubbing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKun presses a button on her projector remote, more payment options available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould the egg hatch and the creature within start to move, for ten dollars, I\u2019ll declare it if you wish to feel it, but it will be brief. For twenty, you can feel longer. However, you do take a backseat toward people who pay more, as people who pay thirty, for the week, I will actively seek you out to let you feel for ten seconds first. But you\u2019re second in line for people who pay fifty, as I will seek them out first, letting them feel for up to a minute. A hundred, and for a full month, should it even take that long, you get to randomly approach me during silent study to rub my belly, assuming I\u2019m not having an ultrasound done. You also get to instigate movement, assuming the egg hatches inside my body. And finally, for two hundred, for the remainder of the pregnancy, you can interact with my belly whenever you feel like, and you even get to kiss it, but there\u2019s one rule to this: if I find out you actively seek me out to do so, and only to do so, I will not hesitate to report you for stalking. However, should we randomly bump into each other, or you seek me out for academic reasons, rub away. Any questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara raises her hand again, being the only student to do so thus far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Kara?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we allowed to speak to the egg in your womb?\u201d Kara asks out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuietly, yes. Silent study is called \u2018silent study\u2019 for a reason, but you can still whisper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one in their seats raised their hand, until once again, Kara did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes anyone besides Kara have a question?\u201d Kun observes her students faces, every single one completely dumbstruck, as if they could not comprehend a single word they heard. All but one: Kara. Sighing, \u201cYes, Kara\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get pregnant with an egg?\u201d</span></div></div>",

As we approached it, the lips opened, and before I knew it, something jumped out and clung to me for dear life. After a few minutes, it fell off and died, and when I was examined, we discovered it had planted an egg in my uterus. I initially wanted it removed, but\u2026 I was persuaded with\u2026 let\u2019s just say some rather generous grants to carry it to term.\u201d Kun places her hand over her navel, clicking the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn image of a pregnant woman with her belly exposed it up on the screen. \u201cIs anyone disgusted by this image?\u201d Kun asks the class, only to have silence respond. \u201cNo?

Now, I have readings assigned to you all, pages two hundred to two-twenty.\u201d Kun turns off her microphone, sitting at her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith tunnel vision taking over, Kun picks up the transducer connected to her classroom computer, quickly jabbing it into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the screen, a small round object sits perfectly still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 it\u2019s a bit bigger than the last time.\u201d She whispers to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean last time?\u201d Kara suddenly whispers to her professor, making her jump in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou scared me, Kara!

Her shirt clung to her body and no amount of tugging or rearranging would prevent it from quickly resuming that uncomfortable situation. Doing her best to dislodge her hair from her forehead, Jasmine weaved through the still bustling sidewalks until she eventually reached her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlopping down in the seat, the snowy haired woman instantly yelped and regretted her haste; the seat was nearly blisteringly hot after baking in the hot sun. Gritting her teeth, she eventually managed to get the fans to vent the interior enough that she wouldn\u2019t fry herself. Only after she settled down in the still unpleasantly warm seat did she notice the little paper wrapped box sitting on the passenger seat. It looked like it might have been slipped in through the cracked window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking it up, she pulled the string off and opened up the wrapping, and saw that there was a note written on the inside: <i>Just a little gift to help you with your dream</i>. It was only signed as being from a secret admirer. Despite the rampant heat, Jasmine felt a chill go down her spine as her head snapped up and looked around for anyone notable, but couldn\u2019t find anyone out of the ordinary. She had never told anyone about <i>that</i> dream, surely this note couldn\u2019t be referring to that\u2026could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuppressing a shiver, she hesitantly opened up the box, not sure what she was going to find inside. After all that she had running through her mind, it was actually a bit of a letdown when she saw a worn silver ring within. It wasn\u2019t too bad to look at, especially with that odd etched design running around the outside of the band, but the age was apparent with the wear and tear on the metal. Most of her fear left her and she chuckled to herself as she plucked the ring from its box; she got all worked up over nothing, someone just gave her a ring with a vague cryptic message, that was all. It might not even have been meant for her to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind more at ease, she slipped the ring on and stared at it for a second before turning her attention to getting out into traffic and back to her home. With her attention focused elsewhere, Jasmine never noticed the pale glow within the metal that quickly spread into her finger before fading away. The rest of her night passed almost completely uneventfully, any misgivings about the odd ring she had been gifted fading away. The only somewhat odd occurrence was that she ate more than she usually did, but that was easily shrugged off. After a cool shower to wash away the remains of the hot day, Jasmine dropped onto her bed leaving the covers off to combat the still lingering heat and drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",
