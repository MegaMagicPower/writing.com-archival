As you inspect your cockroach filled house, you can't help, but feel angry at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were once proud and mighty Darius Edwards Vil, villain known as Devil by underground. You were all powerful crime leader, controlling thousand of syndicates with just one move of your hand, hacking into any computer system without even a drop of sweat. Soon you would have been elected for a president as richest, most powerful and most generous man in the country, were it not for some meddling brats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive brats, it took only five brats to bring down a billion dollar empire and to defeat thousand of mobsters. How you ask? Not even you know. As your strings went deeper into the scheme for controlling the world you tangled and irritated them and as they climbed up, unseen by your mighty eye, it was too late for reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were captured by Interpol and you went to jail, but still having good connections you spent only one year in jail. Now you were almost at rock bottom, without penny and with only one thought in your mind. Revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor that reason you moved to the neighborhood closest to your archenemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat at your boxes, finally shaped as your ex throne, you try to remember their faces and basic description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Chelsey, the leader of the group. This petite brown headed girl was the smartest foe you found around and wasn't easily tricked by any of your traps. She was always one step ahead of you, but not even she could hide her information from you. She was fourteen now, president of chess club, computer club and vice president of student council. With you seemingly out of picture she is rushing toward the future, college and finally carrier of her choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext ones were twins, Sofia and Mathew. This blond pair always confused you, for although identical in appearance, and almost impossible to differ them out, their personalities were incompatible. Sofia, although fairly beautiful for thirteen years old, was the tomboyish and absent minded persona, brute by nature which came just fine in her quest to become Martial Artist. So far you know she is master in Karate, Judo and boxing, but you dared not to find out more. You would have to defeat her with your mind not your muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMathew on other hand was a mechanic wizard, making anything from scraps and junk. He is calm and calculative person, often letting others lead the way due to his inability to speak up for himself, but his skills were good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourth one was Ashley, the beauty of the school and rival of Chelsey's. Although she seemed more like a villain to you she joined side of good for one reason only. To prove she is better than Chelsey. This black haired brat was most annoying and most useless, with no apparent skill, but her father was a politician, meaning she had power behind the scene. Last thing you heard was that she was posing for some teen magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast, but not the least was Elizabeth, the girl who had the least with your capture. She was the brats babysitter, a goth with no will to live, but on few occasions she saved their hides. This seventeen rock girl was working many part time jobs, along with babysitting and working at local dinner to save her money for something. Who knew what...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose five, yes those five cost you the dream of ultimate power with world as your toy. As you grabbed your forehead you couldn't believe what kind of idiot you were. Still now was time for revenge. You will take your revenge on the brats and their families, even if that means this will be your last villain quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill you knew nothing of their locations and you couldn't just tie them and kidnap them in open space, nor can you just as easily break into their houses. You had no drug, no binding material except some duct tape, you were without resources. Careful planning was needed. What will you do? </span></div></div>",

Not your smartest move you admit to yourself, because besides the duct tape and just duct tape you have no material and you really don't have any info on the brats, but who cares! Your smartest moves were foiled before and with that you concluded that your most stupid would be rational enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no matter how much you wanted the revenge hot you had to recollect few info. You take the list from one of your boxes, seeing the addresses and family members of the brats before the incident with your fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsey lived alone with her father in small house in the neighborhood, but she must've been relocated due to witness protection program. Anyways you knew she was still in the same school so she couldn't be far away, you just have to find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMathew and Sofia lived with their two lesbian mothers in the house just down the block. Along with their mothers a newly born baby was brought to the family. You never understood their family, but you don't care much about that do you? Only thing on your mind is revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was easy to find, she lived in mansion. There was only one mansion in the area so you could easily find find it, but proportionally it would be harder for you to get to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout Elizabeth you knew nothing, and didn't care much actually. She wasn't related to your capture that much so you just passed along with her, leaving the sleeping lion in its den.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the choice was easy, Chelsey's family, Mathew and Sofia's Family or Ashley's mansion with dozen or more maids and bodyguards?</span></div></div>",

Her ex house wasn't far from your current location so you decided to get there and try to get some info.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dress up for the night and get ready for the meeting with destiny, finally content with yourself as villain. Waiting was for idiots and you wanted to start your revenge now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you walk down the street, carefully eying the street signs until you get to the desired location. Still on the way there you had the feeling that someone was following you. Maybe the police? You had a parole officer and a pride one at that, trying to frame you at your every step out of the prison. By the time you got to your home you were captured by police three times with false accusations and to make matters worse they forbid you the usage of computers. Tough luck, but you still had other skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing that idea out of your head you approach the house where Chelsey used to live and knock, once, twice, three times before an elderly woman opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening madam I hope I am not intruding, but may I ask you few questions?\" you ask gallantly, but something was not right about woman's glare at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want a cat?! Take a cat!\" She screeched as she raised two cats toward you. You just waved in decline and tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to ask you about previous owner of this house. You see my brother and his niece...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take the cat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want no frigging cat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then take two frigging cats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going nowhere and you could see it.

Just your luck. As you take the cats and get the info from the old lady you take another road toward your target. The irony was that Chelsey lived just two blocks away. She probably wasn't that stupid, but police sure was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your first steps toward your new location with your three new pets, Satan Jr., Marshal Mayhem and Doom and you decide to... </span></div></div>",

You had scarce resources so you had to think carefully.

There's a crinkling, crunching sound somewhere in the distance. As you jog toward it, you see someone's billfold in the middle of the street. Picking it up, you notice the knot of cash inside, as well as a photo ID. Kelvin Nevels. It's the guy you're after. You could take the money and run, but the exchange back there intrigued you. Is this merely a punk, wallet fat with stolen money, or is there some stranger explanation for his behavior?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceed on instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Nevels?\" you say, cautiously approaching. The shameless thug has seated himself at a bus stop to munch his Lay's Classic 'Family Size' bag of chips. At six dollars for fourteen ounces, there's some question of who was robbed. \"You've dropped your wallet, sir. I am returning it. Hold your fire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just being impulsive,\" says Nevels, the gun nowhere in sight. \"I always wanted to try that. Want some of these chips? 14 servings per container, they say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Nevels,\" you say, passing him his wallet, \"you seem to have rather a weak grasp on reality. Have you indulged this evening? Are you intoxicated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Treece,\" Nevels says to you, which you interpret as some preferred nickname. \"I look drunk, but I don't drink.

Never mind the complete name! It's to be marketed as KTN. Shenanigans back at the lab over patent rights led to an associate seeding bags of familiar chip brands modified with KTN among area shops, and I was sure I'd cracked his convoluted distribution scheme, this time. He always uses that store, but he adjusts the backstock and shelf order according to some algorithm based on sales volume. We're sure he has help, but we have no idea who his accessories are. More than a few people are on pins and needles, waiting for the balloon to go up when some civilian gets the first modified bag. This was just a regular bag of chips, sadly. Yes, I brought the antidote along, in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for your rather unscientific investigation, you go in blazing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The clerk's harpaxophilic. He knows what I'm after, and he's promised not to bring in the authorities or notify that sneaky associate I mentioned... so long as I make every stop at the store a robbery when he's on shift. I'd promised to shoot tonight, to raise the thrill. I didn't notice you in there until the last moment, which cut short my usually thorough assay of the snack aisle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Treece, I have a proposal for you,\" you tell him, describing your own goals as concisely as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be torture, all right,\" Treece agrees. \"They'd be desperate to stuff their faces at the same time they're tied up and getting tickled. Imagine trying to laugh with a gut full of potato chips!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's imperative they not be physically harmed,\" you say, making that point again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we can manage without any violence,\" says Treece, sure of himself. \"That one kid, Ashley? I know her dad. He's on the city council. That guy's been a real thorn in our side straight along... flagrant corporate disregard for municipal bylaws, tighter oversight of R&amp;D, all of that.

It's as good as mind control, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, to put paid to this particular rogue bag of chips, you'll need a lookout to free you up for a thorough search, because the clerk will be too busy being ecstatic at being robbed and no help at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we?\" Treece says, starting back down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow along. Not your normal m.o., but imagining the look on the pretty brat's face when you shove a handful of chips in her mouth gets you moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lie quietly, or I will permanently disrupt your circadian rhythm,\" you tell the clerk. He's on the floor behind the counter, doing an excellent job at looking terrified. Until he admits he's a little thirsty, so you bring him a bottle of Perrier. Other than that, it's very therapeutic to have someone whimpering and at your mercy. It's also good practice, if your revenge plays out as you're hoping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he moves, shoot him in the face!\" calls Treece, adding to the atmosphere as he waves something complicated over the chip rack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk blubbers about having a wife and child. You keep your eye on the parking lot, hoping no one comes in. Even if it's a pretend robbery, you'll still go right back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, Treece's gadget beeps. He shouts and runs up to the counter, bearing a bag of chips gripped in a pair of lab tongs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so!\" he says. \"Our man used an unadulterated dosage, which interacted with the packaging to produce some discrete outgassing. There's only one batch this sample could have come from. He's finished. I won't even bother with the surveillance tapes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew industrial espionage could be so exciting,\" you say, though your excitement is more like nervousness from drawing down on a convenience store clerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still don't believe me, do you?\" Treece asks, the narrow grin not fitting well with the drunken face. \"If we could get some service... up! Stand up! On your feet, before I hide a clip in you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk bounces up, having a swig of Perrier. You press the gun to his jaw on impulse, and he clearly appreciates the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTreece carefully works the bag open, using another set of rubber-coated tweezers to offer the clerk a chip. There must be something to his claims, because the smell is heavenly. Potato chip perfection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk looks at the proferred chip curiously, knowing the supposed effect, before crunching it down. From where you're standing, it resembles a bizarre communion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catch hold of him!\" Treece cries, the clerk leaping over the counter and grabbing for the bag. \"Get him by the belt loops! Manhandle him, damn it! He'll gobble up the evidence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a struggle. The clerk doesn't look imposing at all, but you can barely hold him back. Treece runs backward across the store, juggling out a spray bottle of clear fluid. He spritzes a chip twice, again being careful not to touch it directly, and thrusts it at the clerk. Who eats it and chills out at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And all along, I thought it was nonsense!\" the clerk says, amazed. And shaken. \"A man with potato chips such as these could conquer the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not get ahead of ourselves,\" says Treece. \"We have business in town, first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relax a little. You'd been afraid Treece would forget all about you and your revenge once he had what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you discuss the ramifications of such a powerfully compelling taste for several minutes.</span></div></div>",

He introduces you to the other punks, and you know better than to ask about their names. \"Aunt Pete\" and April Park (is that her real name or a street moniker?) were the two clinging to each other earlier. \"Puny Ruben\" and \"Wump\" were the two who decided to slug it out. The leader himself just goes by Paul. You give your name as well, trying to look relaxed but ready to brawl as needed. It's an exhausting pose to maintain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've all gathered around a precast concrete picnic table where the gang begins to lay out goodies, once April Park has spread a black tablecloth with tiny pink hearts on it. She brought a gas lantern with an attached stove, along with the makings for tea, requisite tableware, and a huge jar of marrow and ginger jam. Aunt Pete had fetched a wheel of Stilton under a cheese dome as well as a large loaf of Schwarzbrot. Puny Ruben found three bottles of Offley's tawny in his father's sideboard, and Wump dug up a box of Sancho Panzas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am humbled by your collective larder,\" you tell them. The town had a higher class of punk than you counted on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe punks' 'hideout' was nothing more than the large table and associated benches under a dense stand of lindens. At night, backlit by SOX lamps, the area had a sort of eldritch cheer to it. With the addition of jam-and-cheese sandwiches over a dry port, it was the closest thing you could expect to a welcome home party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, yes, I spent some time taking my mail in the town of Bitucker,\" you say, answering Paul's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were up in Liselotte?!\" he asks, and the punks now eye you with respect. You've never understood why the prison has such a fearsome reputation. Most of the perps were harmless, and even the worst had some exploitable eccentricity that kept them in line. You spend time telling them about it. For every detail that doesn't impress them, you offer another that astonishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you're puffing on a Dulcinea, you feel comfortable enough with the young people to hint at your immediate designs in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you should be jumped in as a Pinkheart!\" April Park shouts, leaping up. She'd been quiet through most of the 'food and fellowship' palaver, but a suggestion that your favorite brats needed to be tortured by tickling caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys weren't amused, heads down as they tried not to look at you. You imagine that having an awkward nickname would only be more embarrassing if you were associated with a gang known as the Pinkhearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril Park relates the gang's history... and how, after joining, she took over once she beat the four guys up. They'd been deceived by her petiteness and hadn't considered her feistiness! Prevailing, she'd imposed a name change and was working on a new gang code. Paul's switchblade caper might have been the last gasp of the prior headbusting arrangement. Perhaps he resented being left as nominal leader after getting slapped down by April Park. No wonder Puny Ruben and Wump had exploded into fisticuffs, given a moment's disorder! The young men were bursting with repressed belligerence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" April Park asks. \"I know you're a little mature, but I can tell you've got the instincts. Then we can help you with those pesky kids.\"</span></div></div>",

Instead, they start humming a tune. You are familiar with the song, but can't place it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna fly now!\" sings a young girl, accompanying the hummer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can start rooting through the foliage, a familiar face jumps out at you, all smiles. You manage to stop yourself from dealing it a punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turk!\" you say, surprised. It's your former cellmate, a gentleman with the unlikely name of Rickert Deloit. But his yard name was Turk, and that's how you best remember him. He had been pulling a stretch for torturing his relatives in a very specific way, and had been the one to suggest a fitting course of action for Chelsey and company. In a vague sense, he was your mentor. Turk's still as ginger and willowy as he was last year. And reserved. It's hard to believe he tracked you down <i>and</i> hummed a tune, given his trademark timidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beelzebubba!\" Turk greets you, guiding his hand into yours for a diffident shake. \"I went before the parole board not two weeks after you processed out. I wonder... that business we talked over, all those nights... are you still going ahead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see how I spend my evenings, Turk? Those brats will have a reckoning with me! The score must be settled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I <i>did</i> hope you'd say just that!\" says Turk, lifting his arms in triumph and running in place. \"I've even brought that secret weapon I promised. Tasha, come along!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young girl darts out of cover and stands near Turk. Her brown hair is in tails with black ribbons, and she wears a matching black choker and wristbands. Her blue skirt and blouse look like castoffs from a child's production of \"The Lass That Loved A Sailor,\" and you'd thought that particular material for stockings had gone out before World War II. Her shoes look contemporary, and might even be trendy for all you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the one?\" you ask, curious. Turk had always claimed he had a hypoplastic fantastic 'assistant' back home, but it had seemed a tall tale. The woman in the body of a girl, without the slightest ticklishness. Turk claimed they were a perfect team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natasha Belisle,\" says the small person, offering her hand. \"Though I prefer 'Miss E. F\u00fchrer,' out on the street. If he gets to be 'Turk.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belial?\" you boggle, navigating through the pleasantry of a handshake. \"Missy Furor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close enough,\" she says, and there is a hardness to her tone that is not like any young girl you have ever known. \"Rick told me all about you. The revenge you had in mind, after your release? I can get next to Sofia and Mathew. There's no question of it. We took care of school enrollment today. Tomorrow, I'll work out a schedule to be with one or both of them in every class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what is your interest in this?\" you ask Missy. You deal with her as an adult, knowing that she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To help Rick, of course,\" she says, like an innocent child. And then, with a nasty smirk, \"Or <i>maybe</i> also... because I enjoy watching people get tickled. Since I'm certifiably unticklish, I feel better when I see others squirm with a vulnerability I don't share.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fascinated,\" you tell Missy, which is about all you can say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trouble is, Bub, we've got no place to stay in this town,\" Turk tells you. He states it as fact, without sounding as though an importunate oboe should play behind his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a quick decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you may both stay with me,\" you tell Turk and Missy, \"though the accommodations may prove not to your liking. There is a problem with insects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we must squash them,\" Missy says at once, smirking nastily once more so that you take her meaning.</span></div></div>",

You'd expected to find he'd roadtripped in with a run-down Escort, not a cherry convertible like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a 427 under there, 7-litre!\" Turk promises, once you've taken shotgun and Missy's slid into the back seat. \"If these brats of yours want a race, we'll blow their doors right off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can tell him that, to your knowledge, none of the kids drives, Turk's bursting into tears over a song that starts with the car. Missy leans over the seats to grab for the iAudio propped on the dash, but Turk holds the player out of reach and keeps weeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been on about this song since Canton!\" Missy complains, scowling at Turk. \"'I'll drive so far away! I'll drive so far away!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Missy mockingly sings along, Turk keeps cranking the volume until she has to scream to be heard. Meanwhile, you're doing your best to tickle her under the arms, which she ignores in favor of expressing her frustration with Turk's playlist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, no one is in the ampm parking lot as you roll in. Turk cuts both the engine and waterworks as he pulls out his wallet. When the credit card holder flops down, you glimpse a parade of very shiny cards. Casey's General Store. Sheetz. White Hen. Couche-Tard. Aha! ARCO. You've never seen such beautifully designed credit cards before. They're more like jewelry than plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can get as much as we want of anything in the place,\" Turk promises. \"I've never hit a limit on any of these, and I'm never charged. My cut from that really big job I was in on with those governors' daughters. Getting popped for the family business was just bad luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we can travel the entire continent and never want for anything,\" says Missy, \"as long as it's available at a convenience store. That we have a card for.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wants to seem scornful, but you can tell she thinks it's a fine setup. Even you can see the advantages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack out in the car, you can see Missy bought many sensible things. You and Turk were less discriminating. The trunk is full. The back seat is full. Missy is entombed by fridge pack sodas and bags of Smartfood popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Sofia's the fighter, and Mathew's the tinkerer?\" Missy asks. \"I'd prefer trying the boy first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might easily woo him,\" you tell her, which idea you find amusing. She frowns at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Between the two of us, Bubba, we should be able to beat up a girl,\" Turk says, having given it some thought. \"Really, Missy's the muscle on most of these capers. But I don't mind helping with the abduction part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps Mathew could be enticed to admire the engine in this vehicle,\" you suggest. \"Eight cylinders, all yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't have him touching the idle!\" Turk says hastily, defensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How well do you think Sofia handles going to the ground?\" Missy asks. She's thinking out loud. \"My clinch work's rusty, but maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go take a look at their place,\" Turk suggests. \"See if we get any brainstorms.\"</span></div></div>",

With a nod I indicated the direction and went, Turk and Missy trailing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I refreshed with a shower the unlikely pair made significant noise in my place, turning it pretty much upside down. Coming back properly clothed I still saw them swatting and squashing away. Shrugging my shoulders I went into the kitchen and prepared a meager cold meal. We ate quietly, everyone with his minds on the task. My own thoughts circled around resources, plan, and again dwelling in the thoughts of having the brats helplessly strapped, but I brushed this aside. How could this girlish looking woman be not ticklish at all? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence held long. Our eyes met repeatedly, which made Turk chuckle. \"You don't believe it, eh\" he said. I just stared at him, but confimed. \"She will strike a deal. You against her, for any time you agree in advance.\" I looked alternately between Turk and Missy, who both seemed to be amused. They had negotiated this before, simply assuming that I would insist on the proof. Swallowing a bit too hard, I said \"One minute. Feet. Just fingers. No mercy.\" The girl just smiled and offered me to start. I declined and told her to go first. If she really was hardly ticklish then I would have to put in a cruel assault, which I would not want before my own feet were touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was horrible. In spite of her saying that she was not ticklish, she knew her way around to elicit the torturous feelings.

It serves you now, since all of the nicer parts of town are uphill from where you live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake Court is just off of Shelley Drive, sandwiched between Hemans Place and the mysterious L.E.L. Lane. 8 Blake itself is the best midget version of Fallingwater that dad Toshishai could manage, save that there's no water evident. Which evokes a strange sort of Hogtown garrison mentality that you can appreciate. And you'd been expecting a Queen Anne with Tudor elements!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spot a window box that weeps ailing Veilchenblaus and start scrambling up cantilevers. Not much of a scramble, since Elizabeth's bedroom is on the second floor - which is fortunate for both you and your tux. You wish you'd occasionally bought some casual clothes or activewear, back when the world was your oyster. A wardrobe of expensive suits isn't going to be a good fit for your current lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking in through the window, you see Liz has fallen asleep on her bed, books stacked around her. She's sprawled like Chatterton, wearing black hot shorts with little white bats along with a Cthulu t-shirt (no tentacles in sight, but you can just spot a \"fhtagn\"). She kicked off her platform flip flops hours ago, and her striped socks drool halfway down her legs. You notice she's cut her black hair into an Akane Tendo bob since the last time you saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the room, her personal space is displosively purple. She doesn't mind parking Escher next to Giger. \"To Here Knows When\" is playing at a sleepable volume, and you're shocked she's got any music you recognize. There's an ancient Hello Kitty lunchbox, splashes of voodoo kitsch, and a series of empty spots that suggest a recent purge of items Elizabeth considered too faddish to flaunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there's her system which, if you're quiet, you'll have direct physical access to. It could be a gold mine.</span></div></div>",

If you can get to her computer, who knows what you'll find out? Addresses, physical and virtual? Screen names? Perhaps even some revealing diary entries?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first, though. You need to get inside, and you need to do it silently as a ghost doused in mineral oil and wrapped in cotton with three other ghosts standing around shushing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth's left her window cracked, so you're not worried about setting off any alarms. Working the screen out of the frame, you prop it in the window box of moribund roses and gently slide the window open enough to allow you entrance. It's easier said than done, and you take it very slowly. Any noise is, at the moment, swallowed by the whisper of lush guitar chords, and Elizabeth is very deeply under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lower yourself into her room, take a deep breath, and immediately walk to the bedroom door. Out in the dark hallway, you steady yourself and plan exactly how to proceed. Walking quickly through a target area and thinking it over has always worked wonders for your focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're in that cold zone of composure, you mentally game things out. You decide to check the rest of the house first, still keeping things quiet. There isn't anyone else home, and no dog. Both of those contingencies had you worried. With free access, you give the place a quick once-over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, you're back at the door to Elizabeth's bedroom. You're still financially embarrassed from pie and pseudo-cappuccino, but Elizabeth's dad <i>used to have</i> a decent Sager tucked away in his study. You're out for revenge, after all. You'll more than likely mail the drives back to him, so he'll lose nothing but the machine itself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nConcerning your return to Liz's bedroom, you: <br>\r\n<br>\r\npeek in, she's still asleep, over to her desk, system on, good, put Sager brick on the floor, no password, no encryption, you're right in, very little security, she's already owned, speedily unown as best you can, you didn't bring any of your own tools, spur of the moment job, you grab a copy of Nookular BAT from a site you remember, install it, get things looking proper, grab dad's brick of a notebook, out the window, screen back on and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth shifts in her sleep, but that's all. You check your time. Roughly fifteen minutes, from her window screen off to back on. Not bad. You haven't worked at this level in years, but it still feels good. In fact, you pulled it off so fast that it seems surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

You attract no heat, and are surprised to find you feel paranoid. What a man gotta come to when he loses a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRearranging a few boxes from your improvised throne, you fire up Elizabeth's dad's notebook, booting from a medium of your own design. It's a year out of date by now, but still performs flawlessly. A quick skim of the notebook's contents shows nothing of interest. The pater Toshishai is an architect, and everything he has on the laptop relates to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then connect to a neighbor's unsecured access point and BAT up Liz's system from the questionable comfort of your own home. Once you're on and checking through her files, you discover it's going to take longer than you'd thought. There are saved emails to hunt through, the daily confessionals you'd expected, plenty of pictures, and so on. You regex along, looking for something about your primaries, but you're unsurprised to find that Elizabeth doesn't breathlessly report about the kids she once babysat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you hit an entry that catches your eye. It's a relation of the events from just over a year ago, concerning how Elizabeth (with a little help from Chelsey and the others) took you down. Elizabeth has exaggerated her role in the proceedings, and the way she describes events from her point of view makes you chuckle. The strangest item is her conviction that you had the assistance of another boy in the neighborhood, a Geoff Tobyn, who served as your loyal lieutenant! This is the first time you've ever heard of him. Back then, he might have been useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth carries on about Geoff for several paragraphs, belittling him repeatedly as a \"foot fetishing boy\" and \"pervy lamo,\" and it's evident she's protesting too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run a search for 'Geoff' and find several more entries. Elizabeth still has nothing but bile for him, building a conspiracy theory that has Geoff communicating with you in prison! You can't help roaring with cultured laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth then took the additional step of trying to break Geoff's will by... tempting him with her feet? In hope that he'd snap and admit his involvement in your old empire! She'd let Chelsey and Ashley in on the plan, and they'd been unimpressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was prudent of you to make Liz's system a long distance project. You wouldn't have been able to resist laughing out loud if you'd stuck around to toss her system on the spot. You try to tone it down before any of the neighbors wonder who's laughing in the darkness at 4 AM in that rundown house next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou transfer all of Liz's interesting files so you'll have access to them later, and then spend most of an hour hardening her system so that you'll be the only one with remote access to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat task done, you shut everything off and go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, some time after noon...</span></div></div>",
