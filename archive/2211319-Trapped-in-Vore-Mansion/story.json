Reluctantly, you awaken to try and find it. You are rubbing the sleep from your eyes when you realize you're no longer in your bed. In fact you are no longer in your home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wha?\" You squeak as you observe your new surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You are in the court yard of a massive mansion. In front of you is fountain and beyond that is the mansion itself. The mansion itself is at least five stories high and a hundred kilometers in length. It has a typical front entrance and a massive door to the left of it that goes up all five stories. The sight of the mansion gives you an uneasy feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A cool breeze reminds you that you are only dressed in the pink silk night gown you fell asleep in. You feel taking shelter in the mansion would be a mistake though. So curling the toes of your barefeet you turn around to leave and quickly spy the front gate of a brick fence that surrounds the property. Making your way over you find that gate and fence tower about five feet above your head. Then when you attempt to leave you discover the gate is locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"HEY! LET ME OUT!\" You shriek as you began to panic. \"PLEASE LET ME OUT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You shake the gate and cry for help and to be let out to no avail. After about ten minutes of this you step back and attempt to calm down. That's when you notice the plaque next to the gate. Upon inspect you notice it reads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Welcome to Vore Mansion. If you wish to return home navigate the mansion while avoiding being eaten by the inhabitants. Just about everything in this mansion will attempt to eat you. Attempts to leave with out navigating the mansion will result in immediate consumption. Good luck on your journey.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Upon reading this you feel your heart sink. If what this plaque said was true than you now prey. But what would you do now?</span></div></div>",
