What happens to the project do they lock it up, or just throw it away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell anyway the government had just invented a prototype device named the \u201cReducer.\u201d It was a device that could reduce anything down to a fraction of its original size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever human test subject was all that was left to complete it's testing, but with no volunteers the higher ups got tired of waiting and the funding was cut. The only thing left to remember was the Prototype gun which was lost in an accident is space. The gun was being used in deep space testing when it was lost in a meteor shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the gun itself is made of in indestructible metal. It was presumed lost in earth's gravitational field. It actually had crash landed some where on earth, and that's where this story begins at the home of...</span></div></div>",

It was his last year at his high school, and he wanted to leave is mark on it forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile practicing after school one day he saw a shooting star fall from the sky and land just outside the football field. Wanting to gloat about being the first one to see it to the school newspaper, he left his team and went to go search alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-ha! There it is.\" he said as he rushed toward the fallen object which was, now inside a crater. When he looked inside he saw there was a gun shaped object inside. He took no caution and picked it up, and took a quick look at it before aiming it at a large tree. He was amazed when he saw the tree dwindle in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing can shrink things!?\" he exclaimed out loud. It was hard to believe something like this existed in the real world and not in movies. His head swelled with ideas of what he could do.</span></div></div>",

So he switched it to enlarge and fired it at the tree he just got done shrinking before. It was restored to its original height, but Sam held down the trigger longer and if grew bigger that it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing is awesome!\" he said out loud. He turned and walked back to the field, his football practice was over and the cheerleader practice had begun. This was perfect because he wanted to test the device on human beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this works he said.\" as he made his way behind the stands careful to be noticed by anyone.

She shrunk so much that the grass around her were as tall as trees, and she could barely make out anything beyond the first few blades in front of her.  All she could see was the blue sky above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried, she began to walk forward and noticed a cool shadow hovering over her and everything around.  She looked up through the hole in the canopy and saw a pair of enormous legs, as high as high-rises on on either side of her, and as she continue to lift her head, the crotch, abdomen, and visage of Sam, the one responsible for doing this to her.  He didn't appear to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she felt the ground shake and saw the bottom of Sam's foot hovering in the air.  He was about to accidently step on her.  She tried to make a break for it as the vast foot descended over her and made it.  His foot came down, loudly crunching the tall grass blades behind her.  She looked up again and saw him examining the ground with a grin.  She waved her arms.  Anything was better than being stomped into jelly by a careless, self-involved senior.  </span></div></div>",

Suddenly the thought that he had stepped on her occured to him.  He stood back up, lifted up his feet one at a time, and checked them for a flattened girl stuck on the bottom.  Upon doing this, he spotted Rachael hanging on to dear life on the shoelace of his right sneaker.  He grinned wickedly, took off the sneaker, and held it it over his head so that Rachael holding the lace was directly in front of his eyes.  He then brought his palm underneath the lace and let her drop off gently into his vast hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky I didn't crush you,\" he said playfully.  </span></div></div>",

She just confessed to the cute jock that she had occasionally entertained the idea of being small and now it was really happening! She didn't dare scream, for fear of what Sam would do to her. Sitting in the pocket she heard a loud noise and figured it must be his car starting. Jumping, Rachel could just reach the top of the pocket and when she pulled herself up she saw Sam messing with the radio while driving. Figuring she had a little bit of time before he remembered her she swung up and out of the pocket landing first on Sam's thigh then jumping down to the seat. Cautiosly looking up at the wall of muscle behind her she realized that Sam hadn't noticed her disappearance. Yet. She now had two choices, should she jump to the ground and hide under the seat? Or try to get into Sam's backpack, maybe he has a cellphone and she can call for help?</span></div></div>",

The girl was quivering on top of Sam's desk, looking around nervously at her surroundings.  \"What's your name woman?\" Sam bellowed.  The girl merely cupped her hands over her eyes and broke down on her knees.  \"Answer me!\" the Sam yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sarah.\" The girl said quivering, still quite shaken up by the whole ordeal. Her dismay doesn't even affect Sam the slightest. He displays his sense of power by slowly moving his left hand toward her body. Sarah knowing what this action would lead too tries desperately to push the hand away from her, but her tiny size barely gave her the strength to shove a single finger much less the whole hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay away from me, you psycho!\" Sarah cried, as she slowly stumbled back to the edge of the desk. Sam didn't reply to her, he simply moved his hand at even greater speeds toward her body and succeeded in grabbing her. Then with his free hand he start to slowly undress her, while carefully inspecting each bit of skin that slowly becomes visible. Sarah starts crying out in fear of what will happen next. Just as her shirt was almost fully removed some calls out from another room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samuel, you get down here this instant!\" An older woman's voice (who was most likely his mother) called from downstairs. Sam left loose a scoff and dropped Sarah back on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll finish this when I get back.\" Sam said following with a deep almost sinister chuckle while he hastily left his room. Sarah looked around at Sam's gargantuan room. On the bed she noticed a gun like object sitting on the bed right next to where her captor was sitting moments ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the thing he used to shrink me?\" She said to herself, while she put her clothes back on. She very sure about it, she just remembered sitting in her car and then giant fingers hoist her right out of it. Sara took another moment to look around and she spots a cell phone sitting on the desk near her. Perhaps she could contact the police or just someone she knew personally? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA decision had to be made, was she going to use the phone to get help or would she go after the <i>Reducer</i> sitting on the bed? Either way she should probably decide on a plan of action before you know who comes back.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly he heard a light humming coming from below him.  He peered down at his feet and right in front of them, just inches away from where he had stepped, he saw the car he shrunk, with its engine on and the tiny woman inside facing toward him.  She was leaning her head forward, awestruck at the enormous legs towering over her.  A sly grin spread across Sam's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the girl in the car saw that grin and hit the gas in order to go between Sam's feet.  The tiny car began moving over the gravel at a snail's pace and it didn't even make it past his foot before Sam lifted it up and simply stamped it in front of her car to block her path.  She stopped lest she crash into his shoe.  She climbed out of the vehicle and began running.  Sam closed his eyes and laughed.  He looked down again but saw she was gone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked all around him but didn't see her anywhere.  How did she get so far, he wondered.  Then he looked down at his feet again and saw her climbing the shoelace of his right sneaker, using it as a rope to hop up and kick off the side of the sneaker in order to get higher.

What the hell is she doing in my room?\" Sam said to himself as he avoided steps his sister made as she entered. She stopped walking for a second and almost as if she had heard his question Tara spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam where the hell are you? I need the CDs I let you borrow back.\" Tara said in rather annoyed tone. She even when as far as tapping her foot against the floor a few times. A  few minor taps for Tara were small scale earthquakes for her older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it I've had it with her. I'm going to shrink her down to the size of a speck and see how she likes being so tiny.\" Sam thought. He reached his hand in his pocket ready to withdraw the gun. It was then that Sam realized he had made a fatal error. When he stupidly shrunk himself it never even occurred to him that the <i>Reducer</i> didn't shrink along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah crap.\" Sam said. He then noticed the <i>Reducer</i> sitting on the floor next to Tara's left foot. It was normal sized and way too large for him to operate. This meant that he needed a normal sized person to enlarge him back to normal sized. Before he could even begin to think of a solution Tara spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He are my CDs.\" Tara said grabbing a try of CDs from the desk. Sam quickly came to the conclusion that Tara was his best chance at retuning to normal. She was already in  his room and the only one home at the moment. Of course she was about to leave which would leave him stranded if he didn't grab her attention immediately.</span></div></div>",

Out of the two possible outcomes the worst had occurred. Tara now had the gun and if he didn't somehow get her attention, he could end up tiny for the rest of his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course he and Tara weren't exactly the best siblings since the two of them were constantly at war with each other. If she found him at such a small size she would take advantage of it and abuse him in ways to horrible for him to imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way it looks like I lose.\" Sam thought but Tara seemed like the only logical choice. Sam yelled his sister's name several times but of course Tara's normal sized ears just couldn't pick up his shrunken voice from the floor. Sam was running out of options and running out of time. Tara was sure to move again any second from now and if she closed the door Sam would be trapped in his room till who knows when.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam approached Tara's large sandal clad foot. His plan was simply to hitch a ride to Tara's room and try to get her attention in there. So began to climb his sister foot, the whole time he climbed he thought about how gross it felt. Reaching the top of the biggest toe he noticed all 5 of her toenails were painted pitch black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is such a freak.\" Sam said completely disgusted by the sight. Before he could make any more comments Tara's foot jostled, knocking him off balance. She was about to start moving, which was bad news for Sam who didn't have to time to properly secure himself. One step and Sam could be sent flying to his doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo does he manage to hang on?</span></div></div>",

Your mom's feet were getting so big that they were starting to move up to your neighbor's houses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, I better move to the street\" Your mom then steps over to the street, her feet each twice as wide as the street, the ground quakes, and the asphalt cracks from her massive weight. The neighbors come out to see what all the commotion is about. Some when they see your mother dash back inside and lock their doors (like that will help), but most just came out and congregated together to just stare at your titaness of a mother. Your mother blushes slightly but seems to greatly enjoy the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring down out your mother's nostril, you try to see what is happening, but unfortunately can't see past her enormous breasts. Then you notice as your mother's growth starts to slow and then stop as she tops out at the height of 500 feet. She stood above the small town that you lived in, her perfect and tanned body rising above everything in sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her hand up to her nose you mother voice booms, \"All right sweetie you can come out now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing down her nostrail you then jump down to her hand. Looking around her hand you see that it is over 50 feet long. She moves her hand close to her face to get a good look at you. \"Oh you look sooo cute at this size!\" she exclaims. Gazing at her enormous billboard sized face, you almost faint, you just can't believe your mother is this big. \"All right my little trooper, what do we do now? You made me grow so you get to choose.\"</span></div></div>",

What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'll explain, sis\" Kelly replied.  \"Could you let me in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Of course\" Jen shook her head, not entirely certain she wasn't dreaming.  Kelly cautiously entered Jen's living room.  Although the room was familiar, with her reduced scale it all looked strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs Kelly looked around her, she heard a childlike voice behind her.  \"Aunt Kelly, why are you so little?\"  Kelly turned around and saw Jen's daughter Katie.  She had to move her eyes slightly upward to look at her niece.  She guessed that Katie was now taller than her by an inch or two.  Kelly showed Jen and Katie the devise and explained how she found it and how it shrunk her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I wouldn't have believed you, Kelly\" Jen said when Kelly finished, \"if I didn't see the evidence\"  She patted her very little sister on the head and smiled.  \"You sure this can be reversed?\"<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t\"I think so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Do you want to return to normal?\" Jen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKelly thought for a moment and answered ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now Kaino had the answer to getting them back in her grasp. A sick smile creeps across her face as her eyes shift to the side to lock on the three girls. Had she noticed them after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much fun we will have you three. To show you the poetic beauty of being bigs at my feet, whether you be Ants or the size of a beetle.

With a thunderous crash, she slammed the jar of peanut butter next to the box containing the three equally terrified ant sized girls and twisted the lid open. Using her own index finger, Kaino scooped up a rather large glob of peanut butter and began smearing it into the gap of the celery stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls had no idea what was going on right now. It simply looked like Kaino was just making herself a little snack in front of them in the mean time. Kaino brings her peanut butter covered index finger into her mouth and sucks all of the peanut butter clean off her finger tip with a disgusting slurp before shifting her eyes back onto the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now.....for the most important ingredient...\" Kaino said and begin reaching into the box! Upon hearing those words, they now knew what exactly Kaino was planning now! The tiny girls scream and scattered, but they just could not escape the massive oncoming hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Kaino picked up all three girls between her thumb and index fingers and lifted them out of their prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaino no! Are you crazy?! We are human beings!!!\" Jen squeaked! Of course Kaino didnt hear a word Jen said and even if she did, Kaino wouldnt care. They were too small and insignificant to even be considered people anymore. They were just ants and nothing more. Their lives didnt matter and they were going to pay for all the grief they put her thru!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing her grip, Kelly and Jen fell blindly until landing in the thick mud like surface. Denise managed to grab ahold of a hanging dead skin fake on Kaino's index finger! Kaino frowned,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you dont.....\" Kaino said wiggling her finger up and down until Denise to lost her grip and landed in the peanut butter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you three have the privileges of enjoying a favorite snack with me. I love Ants on a Log hehe.....\" Kaino said as she watched the girls frantically struggle within the gooey thick peanut butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen! Denise!!\" Kelly shrieked! Jen was only about two feet away from her, but Denise fell much farther back towards the end of the celery log. Denise tried to navigate her way thru the sticky surface to her friends, but it felt like she had 100lb anvils tied to her ankles! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaino grinned at their futile attempts to move in the peanut butter. But now she wanted to enjoy her snack and prepared to take her first bite. Denise looked back at Kaino's incoming opening mouth, then back at Kelly and Jen, her arm reaching out for them with tears in her own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No don't!!\" Kelly screamed before....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CRRRRUUUNCH!!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaino takes her first bite, her teeth sinking into the Celery stick and tearing off a large portion of it. Sadly, a long with Denise to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No......Denise.....\" Kelly and Jen hugged each other, crying as the deafening sounds of Kaino crushing the celery between her teeth were all they heard. This went on for about 20 seconds until Kaino finally swallowed. She then squinted her eyes to focus on the celery stick so far. She could only see two little people, but the third was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooops....looks like I ate Denise. Don't you two worry tho. You will be joining her in just moments.......\" Kaino said before suddenly thrusting the celery stick towards her mouth! One again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CRRRAAACCKK!!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaino's teeth ripped into the celery, even closer to their miniscule bodies! Kelly and Jen cried out in terror even louder, still clutching each other tightly as Kaino chewed her snack, smacking her lips in the process!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yum!\" Kaino said, looking at the remaining celery between her finger tips. There was roughly only about 2 inches worth of celery left. So Kaino decided to just place the rest of it into her entire mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo!!!!!\" Kelly and Jen both screamed as they were now headed towards Kaino's wide open mouth.....</span></div></div>",

She had been wanting to destroy these girls for a long time now, and now that her dream was on the verge of coming true, she wanted to really savour the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Kaino's mouth, Kelly managed to dislodge herself from the peanut butter that had been holding her prisoner and had tumbled free of the celery as it rolled around. Jen hadn't been so lucky and she was getting dizzy from being tossed around back and forth. \"Kelly, help!\", Jen cried to her friend. \"Stay calm Jen!\", Kelly called out. \"We'll figure out a way to get you out of there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen without warning Kaino brought her teeth down right on top of Jen, tearing her to pieces along with the celery. \"No!\", Kelly screamed. First Denise, now Jen. Kelly wanted to cry for her dead friends but she fought it off. She had to find a way out of here first. She began rushing to get under Kaino's tongue and ride this whole thing out until she could escape. Unfortunately that's when Kaino swallowed and a gob of peanut butter flew back, entrapping Kelly again and sending her screaming all the way down Kaino's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kaino finished her snack, she beamed in triumph. \"I've waited so long for that\", she said. She then pulled out the gun that had granted her revenge and examined it closely as she pondered her next move. On the one hand, she had a whole list of people who had wronged her the way Kelly, Jen, and Denise had. With this gun she could get revenge on them in all sorts of wicked ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, she noticed the gun also had a growth button. If she used it on herself, she could become a goddess, the likes of which this world had never seen. It wouldn't be as personal a revenge on all who had wronged her, but it'd be just as satisfying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do, what to do? Kaino pondered this all night. The next day as she arrived at school, she made a decision.</span></div></div>",

Her hair colour was constantly changing; today it was orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaino was not exactly friendly with Paulina, but the two didn't hate each other either. Their interactions mostly consisted of cordial greetings in the hallway. Of all the people who could have found this gun, Paulina was probably the best-case scenario. She was picked on as much as Kaino and while she didn't outwardly express the same rage that Kaino wore on her sleeve, there was a good chance she'd be sympathetic to Kaino's cause.

She was captivated by the magic of this situation.<br>\r\n- It seems it can enlarge, besides shr... cough - the child jumped on her, then jumped to her feet on the bed. <br>\r\n- Really? That would be fun! Will you enlarge me?<br>\r\n- No, that's out of the question. Fun... that's the problem. As mischievous as you are, as clumsy as I am, we would be a public menace - Kelly replied, smiling sadly. She too would like to test it out.<br>\r\n- And growing where there's no one? Like... in those woods over there. - Megan implored, kneeling on the bed in order to cling to her sister's arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly didn't answer; she had just seen a little blue button in the device's belly which framed by the inscription \"Reversal\". Could it be what she had in mind? Megan's eyes followed her sister as she sat up and walked towards the corridor while she adjusted the Reducer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looked up towards the chalet's roof, then at the device, then played a bit with it; this was pretty exciting. Closing her eyes, she shot it at her face. She nearly didn't feel the process, as she immediately outburst her uniform, growing 13 metres tall in a jiffy. Not that she cared - the perspective was fascinating. Anyway, there would be time for enjoying it later - first things first. Kneeling, she blew into the air a few slates - one of them rebounding against the chimney. As she rubbed the tip of her nose she pressed the reducer -which had grown with her-'s blue button - and the roof was immediately fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly sighed delighted, and flopped down on the floor, turning towards the opened dining room's glass doors - her eyes meeting Megan's. She had a half amazed, half na\u00efvely upset expression which she would later find funny painted in the face. Kelly sat up, feeling a bit awkward - there was obviously a misunderstanding. Well, she would surprise her - she sat up, and as soon as Megan appeared in the threshold she fired the device against her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Megan just stand still for a second.\" Kelly commanded her former little sister. Megan was still busy looking at her sister's things and marveling in her perspective change. The girl was wearing blue jeans with rhinestones shaped to form a butterfly on the back pockets. Her light pink blouse had a picture of a kid sticking out her tongue, with the words little brat under it, and as they had when she shrank her clothes had grown to fit her 8 foot tall form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had turn the switch to reduce and aimed at her sister. Megan was now going thru her sister's underwear giggling like this was the funniest thing she could think to do. As Kelly took aim, Megan decided to get up and knock over her now little older sister. With a smile on her face a mile wide she charged her sister. Kelly's finger slid up flipping the switch hitting her sister with a full blast. Kelly could feel the weight of her expanding sister. Megan stood up again, hitting the 13 foot ceiling of Kelly's large room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you made a big boo boo. Kelly.\" Megan said looking down at her sister, she was still growing, and now the foundation was shaking, Megan crouched down still staring at her now dwarf sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan!\" Kelly screamed as her sister filled her personal space. Before Kelly had a chance to react Megan stood up, her head pushing the ceiling out of its way with little resistance, white dust and plaster hit Kelly's floor. Megan was now 20 ft tall and still growing. Kelly had been knocked down from the force of her sister. All Kelly could see of Megan was her now huge white and baby blue sneakers and her legs. If she wanted to look up to Megan's face she would have to walk under her, and Kelly knew that was a BAD idea. She looked down at the device in her hand. It was taking longer than before to charge. Now Megan was 42 feet tall, she was laughing out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be dreaming.'\" She exclaimed, and lifted her left leg high, stepping out of the hole she made in her sister's ceiling, and the roof it was attached to. Megan took no time in finding something fun in her own opinion to do now she was monstrously large. She picked up the family car with no real effort and was examining it, she sat down Indian style, she knew this was still her mom's car, so when she was bored, she carefully set it back down, got up and decided what she wanted to do, her best friend Jessica was her first thought, she was always talking about how much she wished things were like in movies and cartoons and this was too weird not to show her. So she got up and took off in the direction of her friend's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was under a large piece of ceiling it was not heavy but the sudden jolt of her giant sister leaving had sent a piece down on her head, Kelly was a chalky white from the dust, She got up and examined herself. No cuts, but she noticed what might become a bruise. She was furious; her brat sister had literally destroyed her room. It was not her room anymore, it looked nothing like it. Everything she called her own was now caked in white powered and tiny hunks of plaster. It would take days to clean. Kelly was kicking herself for letting this happen, but she still had the device and still could fix this. Kelly had two choices, she could use the thing on herself and chase after Megan as a giantess, but her friends might see her and she would be labeled a freak forever. Or take after her in her mom's car, she knew Megan would go see Jessica the two of them were best friends Kelly cared enough about Megan to know where she was most of the time, but what she had done had made Kelly very angry, her thoughts raced about what to do, She really did want to use the device and take her sister down, but she was also worried that if she tried to, other people might get hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tried to decide, Megan took no time getting down the 5 blocks to her friend's 3 story house. Megan excitedly ran into Jessica's yard and realized she was taller than her best friend's house. The realization made her go \"Whoa...\" a moment later; the hyperactive child had decided to knock on Jess's window. She knocked 3 times, shattering Jessica's window in the process. \"Oppses!\" Megan exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan?\" Jessica was awestruck. Megan used to be shorted than Jessica. Jessica was a 10 year old red head, with freckles. She didn't think of herself as pretty, and got made fun of at recess, but Megan would always stick up for her, Jessica knew Megan was more popular, and cuter then her, but that didn't bother ether of them. Seeing her friend now insanely bigger then her blew her mind, she asked the only thing she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan what happened?\" Megan explained everything in her own words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helly-Kelly got this weird remote that makes stuff big or small, and I accidentally got shrinked and then Kelly made me bigger again, but guess what? I got like way bigger than I was before~!\" she stopped to giggle. \"And then she tried to shrink me again, but instead it made me even bigger, and I totally killed Kelly's room, I went all attack of the 50 ft woman on her room's butt.\" Megan and Jessica were big movie fans and had seen that movie together at a sleep over when they were 6 and 8 respectively. Jessica laughed at the reference, and asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you going to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I wanted to come get you, and go hang out, I was thinking you would have some cool ideas.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I was as big as you I would go to like Wal-Mart and take all the toys and bikes and food and stuff I wanted.\" Jessica fantasized. \"Or we could go find those bullies that keep calling you rich bitch and get even with them, for all they did to you.\" Megan suggested.<br>\r\n\"Well while we decide, you should go in back and we can watch TV on the back patio.\" Jessica said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea\" and she went into the back yard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly knew she would be a outcast if anyone saw her big, but Megan could overpower her easily if she missed and was little. She knew her little sister was generally an ok girl, but she also liked attention, and mischief and that could be dangerous that her current size. So what should she do?</span></div></div>",

Kelly is embarrassed by her choice of panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, she's so cute!\"  replies Jessica, as she finishes dressing Kelly in the Tinkerbell outfit.

She looks up and is awestruck by what she sees: two giant faces beaming down at her tiny body.  \"AGH!!!\" she screams at the top of her lungs.  Megan and Jessica barely hear a squeak and peer down at this tiny teen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, tiny.\"  says Megan as she picks Kelly up by the arm with her index finger and thumb.  Kelly can't manage to say anything as she is brought up to her sister's gigantic eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if we can get more of these?  We can create our own little city!\" says Jessica joyfully.

She returns with the top of a water bottle.  \"Put her in here.  We can cover it up with some plastic.\" Megan drops Kelly in and they cover the container.  \"Oh man...\" Kelly says as she travels inside her tiny new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to?\" Jessica asks.  \"We'll drop by my sisters high school.

Just in case things went wrong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Megan,\" Kelly yelled up at her giant sister.  \"This has gone on long enough!\"  Her younger sister and Jessica turned around and saw Kelly pointing The Reducer at them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do, Kelly?\" Megan asked, placing her friend on the ground next to her and sitting up on her knees, to give Kelly her undivided attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know damn well what I'm going to do!\"  an angry Kelly said, pointing the gun towards her sister's head.  \"You destroyed my room, destroyed my things!

She really had no choice.<br>\r\n\"There Kelly! Aw, you look so cute!\" Megan said.<br>\r\nKelly got off her sister. She saw herself in a large mirror on the door. She never thought she'd see herself like this. <br>\r\n\"MEGAN!\" their mom's voice called out.<br>\r\nMegan came up behind Kelly and covered her mouth.<br>\r\n\"YEAH?\" Megan shouted back.<br>\r\n\"Is your sister up there?\" Mom asked from downstairs.<br>\r\n\"Yep, we're just playing!\" Megan said.<br>\r\nKelly tried to get out of her sister's grip, but Megan was too strong.<br>\r\n\"OK, well I'm going out with your aunt! She left Sara (their two-year-old cousin... probably as tall as Kelly is now) here so Kelly, you have to stay here! We'll be back later this afternoon. Bye girls!\" And with that, they were alone.<br>\r\nMegan grabbed Kelly by the hand and ran downstairs. <br>\r\n\"Maybe you could share clothes with Sara!\" Megan giggled.<br>\r\nKelly groaned as they went into the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly found that she was...</span></div></div>",

The two of them come into the living room and Sara is sitting in her play pen.  She is playing with a toy and making goofy noises.

Once Kelly is in the pen, she backs up to the nearest corner.  Everything inside the pen is huge.  The toys look big, so does the pillow, and even her cousin Sara.  The toddler stands up with poor balance and walks toward Kelly.  She puts out her arms for a hug.  \"Oh god, even Sara is bigger than me,\" says Kelly.  Kelly only comes up to Sara's shoulders.

Go get the dolly, Sara!\" Megan said, pointing out Kelly to her baby cousin. <br>\r\nThe 2-year-old looked over at Kelly and let out a giggle. Megan let go of Sara and she toddled towards Kelly. Kelly screamed and started to run. <br>\r\n\"Come dollwey!\" Sara said as she gained on the tiny teen.<br>\r\nKelly looked back as saw the giant toddler gaining on her. When she looked back, she neglected to pay attention to where she was going and she tripped over one of Sara's toys. The girl hit the ground and rolled for a moment or two before landing on her back. She froze as Sara stopped over her, giggling. Her giant pudgy hand came down and wrapped around Kelly's waist and hoisted her into the air near her face.<br>\r\n\"Yay you got the dolly Sara!\" Megan said, laughing.<br>\r\nSara giggled and shook her new toy slightly before returning to show Megan her catch.<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's a cool dolly!

She looked up at Sara, who was bringing her towards an open mouth.<br>\r\n\"Oh, GOD! Sara no!\" Kelly protested, but it was too late.<br>\r\nThe toddler stuck the tiny teen's head in her mouth and began to suck. Kelly's head was thrust to the roof of the toddler's mouth and pinned between there and her tongue as she sucked. The toddler sat down after a moment and pulled Kelly from her mouth with a *pop*.  Kelly coughed and sputtered as she tried to wipe the saliva from her face and took in a breath of fresh air.

Her chubby fingers enveloped the tiny woman's waist and, mistaking Kelly for a squeeze toy, she squeezed.  All the air was forced out of Kelly;s lungs, as she tried to push the fingers away from her midsection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly let out a little groan at one point, delighting the toddler, who pushed further in.  Kelly's face was blue at this point; she was close to blacking out.  All of a sudden, Sara dropped her new toy and Kelly went tumbling towards the ground, which from the shrunken woman's perspective was about ten feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she was released, Kelly sucked in as much air as she could, while she continued to plummet.  She hit the bottom of the playpen with a thud and roaned again.  Kelly looked down at her stomach and saw a huge bruise, from where the toddler was squeezing.  She stood up, painfully, her hand clutching her midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Kelly saw the giant body of her cousin lurch forward, in an attempt to pick her up again.  Kelly dove out of the way, as the baby crashed down next to her.  The shrunken woman  got up and ran away, trying to find a suitable exit before Sara could reach her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly soon reached the wall of the playpen. She looked up and saw that it was made out of cloth, with the material cossed together, forming a rope-ladder, of sorts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this being the only way out, Kelly began climbing, hoping that Sara woudn't stand back up and see her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelly got about halfway up the playpen, she could feel a large hand grab her by the ankle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the hand snapped backwards, sending Kelly flying in the opposite direction.  She landed  on top of one of the toddler's teddy bears, about twenty or thirty feet away, from Kelly's perspective.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head a few times, to get her bearings again, but before she could get up and run away again, Sara's hand was right above her, ready to pick her up again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toddler succeeded, and squeezed the midsection of Kelly once more, causing the 13-inch girl to cry out in pain.  Suddenly, her air was being constricted again.  She knew it was no use, but Kelly again tried to pry the humongous fingers of Sara off of her body.  They wouldn't budge an inch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove her, the toddler laughed, amused at the toy's attempt to try to free itself.  Sara then released her grip on the toy, and Kelly greedily breathed in as much oxygen as she could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few seconds, however, Kelly was in the same position again, gasping for air.  The lucky thing for her, however, was that this time, instead of keeping her stomach compressed for long periods of time, Sara would squeeze her new toy for a few seconds, then release it, delighted at the wheezing sound it produced each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few minutes this continued, with Kelly's air continually being forced out, only to be replenished a few seconds later.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, though, Sara grew tired of her new toy and, noticing her old Tickle-Me-Elmo in the corner of the playpen, tossed Kelly over her shoulder to retrieve her Seseme Street doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly landed against the same teddy bear as before, but this time, the force was too great, and she bounced off the stuffed bear and hit her head against the hard, plastic pretend phoe lying next to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly grabbed her head in pain, curling up in a ball, in the hopes that Sara wouldn't see her.  It hurt for her to breathe, and she eventually placed both hands on her midsection, to try to quell the pain.  She didn't dare look under her hands; she feared the bruise oher stomach was only that much bigger and a deeper shade of purple at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she  driftedd off to sleep, as Sara, the two-year-old toddler, who was now more than double the height of her own, thanks to her sister Megan, continued to play with Elmo...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours late, Kelly woke up, lying in the palm of someone's hand.

That really hurt, Kelly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Kelly responded.  \"In my defense, I was on my period at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan stared down at her older sister for a moment, blank-faced.  \"Okay, I don't even know what that means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, how about this,\" Megan continued, starting to choke up.  \"How about for the last two years, all I've wanted is to get closer to you, but all you've done is ignore me or talk mean to me.\"  She wiped a few tears from her face, sniffling.  \"All I want is to have a sister, someone to talk to, or to watch  crappy movies with on a Friday night.  Is that so much to ask for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not,\" Kelly replied, realizing for the first time just how much she had neglected her younger sister snce she had started going to high school.  \"I'm sorry for the way I treated you, about how I talked to you and stuff like that.  I promise to do better in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm sorry I hurt you,\" Megan replied, referring to her sister's bruised midsection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be okay in a few days,\" Kelly said, trying to stand up.  Megan saw her older sister struggling to stand, so she placed her hand next to her 13-inch body for support.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Kelly gasped, as she stood upright, still clutching her midsection.  \"So, what do you say you return me to my former height?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I know that you'll treat me any better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Megan replied.  \"Okay...\"  She picked up the device and adjusted the settings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kelly grabbed her midsection again, the sharp returning as she breathed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan made sure the settings were where she wanted them and then she fired.  Kelly closed her eyes, expecting to return to her original height, but was surprised when she felt the familiar sinking feeling again.  She opened herr eyes to see Megan growing before her again.  She turned her head from side to side to watch her sister's bed stretch out further and urther in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan!\"  Kelly yelled up, panicking.  \"What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, sis,\" Megan replied.  \"I enjoyed our heart-to-heart.  I really did.  But if I make you your regular size again, what would stop you from just snatching the gun away from me and then shrinking me down?  Or, you would probably tell mom what I did, then I would get in trouble.  So, I'm sorry, but I can't grow you back just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly watched as her world continued to grow all around her.  Soon, she was less than half her previous height of 13 inches, and still she shrank.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Megan?\" Kelly asked, a little worried.  \"Just how much smaller are you going to make me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" Megan responded, in a sing-song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to shrink, going from six inches, down to five, four.  Still, it dragged on.  Kelly wondered if Megan would ever stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the device shuts off and Kelly looks up a her younger sister.  She towered above her like a skyscraper. The vantage point Kelly was provided with made Megan look 70 or 80 stories tall.  he had to be no more than an inch tall at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery carefuly, Megan's thumb and forefingers descended upon her newly shrunken sister.  Kelly started running in the opposite direction, hoping to find someplace to hide.  But both girls knew it was fruitless, as almost as soon as she started running, Kelly was grabbed by one of her arms and hoisted up towards her larger sister's palm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was placed very gently on  the wide surface, the palm stretching for a couple of football fields. The fingers, off in the distance, like giant felled redwood trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry, Kelly,\" Megan whispered, so  her older sister's ears wouldn't hurt.  \"I had to do this.  But I promise, I'll take real good care of you.  I won't let anybody else harm you.  It'sjust until I can figure out what to do with you.  Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly started crying, knowing her life, as she knew it, was over.  At least for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan placed her shrunken sister back on her nightstand and stood back up.  \"Stay right here,\" she said.  \"I'l be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looked around, observing what her life had become now.  She was now no bigger than a pea, her toddler cousin used her for a squeeze toy, among other things, earlier in the evening.    Kelly had ran off to get od knows what.  Her life was officially over at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout that time, Megan returned, with whatt appeared to be their old bird cage.  It had been cleaned, but it still had rusty bars and the smell of musty bird seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your new home!\"  Megan said, excitedly.  She reached over and gently picked her smaller sister up by the arm again and, after sticking her hand into the door of the cage, placed Kelly on the floor of the cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan removed her hand and locked the door aferwards and peered inside, the enormous face of hers beaming from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you like it?\" Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looked upwards.  The cage stretched like a three-story mansion from her viewpoint  She also noticed the bars were just the right size, if she ever thought about escaping.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly smiled back,  \"I love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly couldn't sleep, and not just because her new bed consisted of an empty matchbox stuffed with cotton and a blanket from one of Megan's dollhouses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up and saw her younger sister asleep.  If she was going to escape, this was the chance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly weighed her options.  If she decided to escape now, she would probably be stuck at her current size for a long time, possibly forever.  Of course, she could always get the attention of one of her parents and tell them what happened, given they wouldn't mistakre her for a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, if she stayed where she was, Kelly would probably be well taken care of.  Well-fed, given exercise.  I mean, sure, her education would take a severe nosedive; she probably couldn't attend college, given Megan chose to keep her this size forever.  But it would be a very comfortable life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Kelly do?</span></div></div>",

Her little tussle with Megan really wore her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan where is your sister?\" her mother asked, \"Were you watching your cousin all by yourself?\" Megan thought a really quick lie about how Kelly had to go do something important, and how she watched Sara by herself. Of course both her mother and aunt believed every word of it. Meanwhile Kelly struggled to get free of her sister. Needless to say she didn't have the strength to escape, and just succeeded to wear herself out even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm going to take my toys upstairs now!\" Megan says as she climbs the stairs in her own bedroom.

Megan didn't say a word. She simply smiled a devilish grin and withdraws the Reducer form her pocket and began to mess with the controls. Kelly knew what was coming next and she didn't want to stick around. Pure instinct told Kelly to run away, even though she knew is was fruitless she made a mad dash for the locked door. She could hear the gun powering up just as she reached the door.</span></div></div>",

There was nothing Kelly could do, she was trapped against the side of the smelly, damp prison, as the giant sweaty toes of her little sister approached her, soon covering her, and pressing her into the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan adjusted her tiny sister, so Kelly was led flat under Megan's sweaty toes. Megan wriggles her toes, relishing the feeling of having her 'big' sister under her smelly toes. Kelly wriggles and squirmed, trying to push the giant toes off her, but they were too big. She hated the feeling of the sweaty, slick toes sliding over her tiny naked body, covering her with her little sister's foot sweat. She could taste it, as the sweat covered her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan grabbed her Nike's and slipper her feet back inside.

She has been held back three years so she is actually 12 years old.  She has recently hit puberty and has developed pretty quickly. She is 5'1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, she wants to show her teacher whose boss.  Ms. Jessica Flores is a 22 year old woman who has just recently gotten out of college.  She has short brown hair and is drop dead gorgeous.  Anne is curious as to how her \"bumps\" differ from Kelly's. She is 5'8 (with high heels).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lastly, she wishes to shrink down Jane.  Jane has been Anne's rival since the beggining of 3rd grade.  She, like Kim, has been held back 3 years and often makes fun of Anne for her lack of \"assets\".  Jane is quite pretty for her age, has long brown hair that's kept in a ponytail, and is short for her age at only 4'2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she has her hitlist...who does she go after first?

Kelly decided she'd be safer in Megan's room instead of risking getting caught by Sara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasually, Kelly began to explore her sister's room. She softly rubbed her arms, dress-up wasn't very comfortable. The doll clothes weren't either. Kelly would change into her old clothes, but Megan put them away with the other doll clothes. Her heart sank when she thought of her sister putting her clothes away with doll clothes. Kelly had a feeling that she was going to be Barbie-size for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly walked over to the dollhouse where 2 Barbie dolls and a Bratz doll were laying. <br>\r\n\"Hey girls, I'm Kelly and I'll be staying with you for awhile.\" Kelly said, pushing the Bratz doll off the bed.<br>\r\nKelly layed on the hard plastic bed. She found a doll blanket, set in on the bed and layed ontop of that. It was a little better. She looked over and saw a giant crayon, sucker and a penny. It was all so weird. In the corner was a baby doll pacifier. Kelly decided that she might as well return that while she was here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the large toy pacifier and carried it over to the baby doll crib next to the dollhouse. The rim of the plastic crib was taller than her by about a head and a half (at Kelly's scale). She managed to throw the pacifier into the crib. Kelly then jumped up and grabbed the top rail of the crib. She threw her leg over and climbed into the toy crib. Brushing her blonde hair out of her eyes, she picked the pacifier up with both hands and walked over to the head of the baby doll. Kelly couldn't help but notice how much bigger the baby doll looked up close. With effort, she climbed up on the baby doll's chest and put the pacifier into the doll's mouth. Satisfied with her accomplishment, Kelly was about to slide off, but the doll was actually more comfortable than that doll bed. Kelly layed on top of the baby doll, just to rest for a moment. Before she knew it, she had fallen asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is looking down at her when she wakes?</span></div></div>",

Kelly watched as the toddler's hand and the mesh walls of the playpen rose higher and higher until she landed on Sara's pink blanket. She rolled into it away from view. Kelly tries to crawl out from the blanket it time to call for her mom, but by the time she makes it out, her mom had left with Sara. It would be about 10 mins. until Sara came back. Kelly looked at the clock. It was only 10:21am. This would be a long day. Suddenly, her heart sank. Sara leaves with Kelly's aunt before Megan gets home. If she doesn't get away from Sara before then, Kelly may be spending some quality time with her baby cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly stood up and looked around the playpen in awe. She hadn't been in a playpen since she was a toddler and never imagined she'd be too small to get out of one at age 16. She walked over to some of Sara's stuffed toys. She remebered playing with Sara and seeing these toys much smaller than they are now. Kelly sat down and noticed Sara's pacifier. She picked up the giant pacifier and set in on her lap. Kelly couldn't help but smile, thinking of how cute she must look doing this. A doll size teen with a baby's pacifier on her lap. She'll have to bring a shrunken friend along next time she babysits... when she gets big again, that is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly flipped the pacifier off of her lap and stood up again. Kelly was getting a little restless. She looked over at the blanket and decided to check out what was under there. Kelly crawled under the pink blanket. She giggled. The soft fabric tickled her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Kelly heard muffled noises. She froze. Suddenly, the playpen shook. Then, she felt footsteps fade away. Kelly crawled out backwards,.. which probably wasn't the best thing. She turned around and froze. There was Sara, sitting infront of her in a diaper and pink t-shirt. Her hair was still damp and she was sucking contently on the pacifier Kelly had on her lap just moments ago.<br>\r\n\"Kelwy!\" Sara cooed sloppily through her pacifier.<br>\r\nThe toddler reached for her tiny cousin and wrapped her hand around the girls waist. Kelly let out a small squeel as Sara lifted her up to her face. The toddler sucked on her pacifier as she examined her toy-size cousin. Kelly gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Sara do?</span></div></div>",

When it was clear that she was asleep, Kelly struggled to get free but the 2-year old's grip was too much for her. She waited and waited but nothing changed. She couldn't see the clock so she couldn't tell if a minute or an hour had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is truly pathetic.\" Kelly said, \"I can't do anything but sit her and hope for a miracle.\" She then yawned a little; even though she only woke up about 30 minutes ago all her recent exploits had tired her out.

I asked you one thing, one simple task as simple as taking a breath of air, and this is how you respond?\" Field's grip was getting tighter and tighter around Kelly's hair.<br>\r\n\"L-let GO! I..it hurts...!\" Kelly writhed out. <br>\r\n\"Listen to me carefully miss Middleton: Hand over the toy\". As she said this she pulled Kelly's hair back so far that her nose was in the air. Her eyes were red and they began to tear. <br>\r\n\"You..b-bitch...\". The words carefully fumbled from Kelly's mouthe.<br>\r\n\"What did you say?! Did I hear you right!\" The professor was fire red in the face, she was using all her might to cause all sorts of pain in Kelly's head now. <br>\r\n\"Th-th-that was the l-last mistake...y-you'll ever..make..\". said kelly with a tremor in her voice. Miss Fields instinctively glanced down at the hand that held the device, and watched in some what disbelief as it was so intently pointed at her body. She was unable to think of what kind of damage it could do. Kelly must be bluffing she thought. Fields then gave Kelly a fierce and fearful look into her eyes, as Kelly gave back a satisfied grin. The stood like this for a moment. White light streamed from the strange device in Kelly's left hand, going strait into the torso of Fields. Field's grip began to weaken, and all the air in her body began to lift. A flying-freefall feeling overwhelmed her, and she quickly became disoriented and unable to discern the visual world. It all came back in seconds at a time. What she could tell, was that she was no longer her regular size, and that she was over a hundred feet in the air, still clinging to Kelly's hair.<br>\r\n\"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME!?!?\" Her little voice screached. Kelly reached behind her head, enveloped her hand around the professor and brought her to face level, the warm air from her mouthe surrounding the tiny teacher like hot water turning into vapor. Utter fear and complete bewilderness was all that could be read on the teacher's face. <br>\r\nKelly began to wisper \"I could so easily kill you, in a thousand ways.....\" Excitment and adrenaline began to run through Kelly's veins at the power she had over her once dominant professor. Evil and sinister thoughts began to flood her mind.<br>\r\n\"PLEASE PLEASE I BEG YOU!!! DON'T DO THIS PLEASE!!! I'LL DO ANYTHING!!!!<br>\r\nFields voice could just be heard to Kelly's ears. She was sympathetic towards, seeing as how she was still human. The power she held, on the other hand, wouldn't kill to exercised or demonstrated for once. Or would it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even though she was still quite steamed by at her teacher she still managed to show some compassion for Fields. Kelly\u2019s choice to shrink her teacher was purely out of self defense, after all professor Fields didn't have to pull her hair, that wasn't called for.  Kelly told herself this as she carried the shrunken teacher to the boy\u2019s restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, I promise I won\u2019t tell anyone what you\u2019ve done.

Kelly couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at the woman who was acting so superior moments ago, and Fields tiny squeaky voice only added to Kelly\u2019s amusement. She silently crept into the bathroom and to her good fortune there wasn\u2019t a soul inside. Kelly quickly enters one of the bathroom stalls, she places the toilet\u2019s lid down and places the tiny professor on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is where you get off. Good bye Professor!\u201d Kelly remarks as she turns towards the door. One last time Professor Fields begged for Kelly to restore her previous height. However Kelly didn\u2019t respond to her. Fields no longer existed, no one knew what became of her, and no one would miss her. Not her students, not the other teachers, and certainly not Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny professor couldn\u2019t possibly escape from the top of the toilet lid alive. She would probably have to remain there until she was discovered by another student and give her location she probably wouldn\u2019t be discovered by anyone who would help her. Either way the fate of the professor didn\u2019t matter to Kelly anymore. She sticks the <i>Reducer in her backpack and heads for her next class.</i></span></div></div>",

It gave off a blinding flash of light, and a light-speed beam which flew down the hallway straight at Kelly! The beam hit Kelly just as she closed her locker door.

She was a senior, like Heather, but unlike Heather, she was just as snobby as Angela.  Kelly thought the only reason was Brandy hangs out with Angela was to try and knocked her off her high horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the bell rang, but no one, not even Kelly paid attention to it.  In this short time, they had shrunk to nearly have their normal size and still they haven't notice how large their smoking items were.  Five minutes passed and there were about two, three inches and still shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it's just me or do this weed look like bigger?\" Mandy asked in air-headed way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just you,\" Brandy replied angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother five minutes passed and there were nearly a foot even. within 2 1/2 minutes and there were finally five inches tall, same as their leader.  Kelly then decided too... </span></div></div>",

They all looked up at the giant, but were to high to realized what was going on.  Before they could say a work, she had scooped them all up and placed them in her pocket, with their leader.  The action had woke the slumbering Angela up.  Kelly was surprise that all her moving around didn't wake her sooner.  Angela begin chewing out her pack for disturbing her beautiful sleep.  Again, Kelly was slightly anger that her first shrunken victim wasn't to nervous about this whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly hurried into the school, careful to avoid the hall guard.  She had decided to skip the rest of her classes for the day and \"play\" with her new toys.  She quickly and quietly made her way through the school.  Luckily she new this place like the back of her hand, so it was fairly easy for her to make her way to the second floor and then to the exit that would lead her to the roof.  She scanned the area quickly and then hurried unto the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, she made her around around the exit and saw her own little hiding spot.  Since no one come to the roof, she had brought a folding tray table and a lawn chair up there a few years ago.  This was the place her safe house when the packs' teasing was to much for her to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took out the shrunken pack and gently set them on the tray table as she took a seat.  Almost immediately the five shrunken school girls begin gossiping among themselves, paying no attention to the giant in front them.  Again this made Kelly anger as she listened into their mindless talk of dresses and stuff like that.  So, feeling like she didn't need to hold anything in anymore, she decided too...</span></div></div>",

She learned that when set to reduce, it couldn't shrink things beyond an inch.  When set on enlarge, it would only make things as big as 50 feet.  A wicked smile appeared on her face as an idea formed into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the device to reduce, she set the setting for two inches and highest power.  She then aim at Angela and Brandy and fired.  Instantly the two snob were smaller then their friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly then turned it to enlarge and set it to eight inches.  She fired it at Rose and watched her grow.  Finally, she set it for 12 inches and fired it on Heather.  She left the air-head Mandy at five inches, thinking it was prefect size for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened?\" the two, 2-inches girl screamed in surprise and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly giggle when she heard how small the two snobs sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but I think I liked it,\" Heather said, looking angrily down at the two smaller girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Don't get any ideas, I maybe small, but I'm still in charge!\" Angela stated boldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Heather then did something truly unexpected.

Thankfully that weird kid with all the pimples could get you anything you wanted for the right price. The blonde couldn't be more pleased that he had her favorite brand, 'noire'. Black ciggs that burn red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile most people would say the brand was ass, she would say otherwise. Now that she'd secured her favorite out of school activity supplies, she could join her girls for a much needed smoke. Right as she made her way to the back of the school, a bizarre sound caught her ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully poked her head around the corner to see her girls... Shrinking!? Her eyes bulged and she began to wonder if she'd somehow gotten high off Angela's supply again even though she hadn't seen her around today. Her body began to tremble as she instinctively put a 'noire' in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would've tried to walk over but an ominous whistling cut through the air. From the other side of the school came that girl she and the pack liked to mess with, Kelly, Liv thought her name was. She whistling ominously while waving some strange device in her hand. If her eyes weren't deceiving her it looked like a gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was she carrying around a gun!? Then she casually strolled up to her girls and scooped them up. She did this to them she realized. That girl must've shrunk them with that weird gun. It was the only answer that made sense. Liv watched in fear as Kelly dumped her girls into a pack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done she stared to look around as Live cowered behind the wall of the school. After a minute or two, Kelly mumbled something under her breath before walking off. She might've missed one member of the pack, but that didn't mean she couldn't find her later. Liv Summers was next on her list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Liv poked her head around the corner and saw the girl and her friends were gone. Without realizing it she had shakily lifted her gun lighter to her lips and lit her 'noire'. The nicotine did nothing for her as she slid down the wall and took a deep puff. That girl was out to get them. Get her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she hadn't run out of 'noires' then she'd be joining her friends in a bag. Her friends! She had to save them! She could call 911 and... No! They would think she's crazy. No one would believe her. Still, she had to save them. The pack had done so much for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to do something.</span></div></div>",

Right as she was about to start gloating at the teary-eyed blonde's misfortune, Kelly noticed something was off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer original plan was to shrink the girl and scooper her up. So why was it that said girl was getting bigger!? Liv should be shrinking not growing! Liv seemed to notice this too, her crying ceased and she looked down at herself to see the ground moving further away. How could this be? She'd been hit. Should she be bug sized... or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was getting kind of sacred now. This wasn't right. How big would Liv get? Kelly looked down at her gun and noticed some of the dials had been moved around in the scuffle. Their brief exchange had set the ray to grow. This was bad. Who know what Liv would do to her if she was bigger? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly began to sweat before regaining her composure. She could fix this. She still had the gun after all. All she had to do was flip the dials and shrink Liv down to size. Her plan could still work. Or maybe she could flip the script and make herself bigger. That also sounded quite appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before she could make a decision however, she felt a hand slap her across the face, forcing her to drop the size-gun. Before Kelly could even recover she felt the stinging pain of the hand that left a large red imprint on the side of her face. She looked up to see Liv had finally stopped growing and was now taller than she'd ever seen her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiv was normally 5'5\" but it appears the ray had grew her to a staggering 10' feet tall. Not only that, she was now holding the size gun! Kelly felt ill. This wasn't right. This was supposed to be her revenge against her tormentors. She was supposed to be the one in control for once. How could this have happened!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Liv... let's not do anything you'll regre--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friends! Now!\" Live interrupted harshly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't need to tell Kelly twice as the geek girl hastily dropped the ''Mini Pack'' onto the ground. Kelly did a quick mental count to see all her friends accounted for. They were too small for her to hear at her current size along with the rapid winds that seemed to be picking up. The mini group wasted no time running over to Liv's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's all you're friends, safe and accounted for. You're gonna let me go now, right? No harm no foul.\" Kelly pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiv thought about Kelly's words. She was only begging for mercy now because she didn't have the advantage anymore. She wasn't really sorry, just scared. Even though the pack had messed with her often they had never put her in a life threatening situation. The moment Kelly had power she didn't hesitate to them in one. This girl was clearly deranged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Liv could hear Angela right now she'd hear the sound of her shrunken leader begging her to shrink the nerd down to size she could have a crack at her. A sentiment the rest of the mini group shared. Liv still unaware of this stared Kelly down with a glare that would frighten even the bravest of souls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just so helpless. Groveling on the ground like the pathetic bug she was. It was disgusting. To test a man's character you give him power, and Liv had a clear understanding of Kelly as a person. The question was, was she even worth punishing?</span></div></div>",

They walk out of the dollhouse and are greeted by Angela sitting back smugly in a computer chair. \"Well that explains the sound we heard earlier.\" Kelly mumbles to the two other girls. They looked around and realized that they were on the teacher's desk. Art books thicker than they were all, paint brushes that dwarfed them, and a coffee cup as round as a swimming pool and 10 times as deep clued them in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a giant shadow looms over them, they slowly turn around and see Angela's face looming to get a better look at them. She began to laugh again, \"Look at you, just little bugs at my mercy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly couldn't take this anymore, shrinking her is one thing, but bringing her friends into it was too much for her. She needed to get them out of here, but how. She looks back up at Angela's face and gets an idea. And just as suddenly as she gets her idea, she spits in Angela's eye. \"AGH!\" Angela's face retreats from it's position and she begins to rub her eye. All three girls begin running towards the edge of the desk, their really light at this size so they should float down harmlessly if they jump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Slam!</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all run into a flesh colored road block.

Eventually it wears off. Kelly runs up to her friends \"Are you guys are ok?\" she asks. \"Yeah we're fine.\" Cindy replies. \"I am so sorry! I shouldn't of done that, now we're never going to be able to escape.\" Kelly apologizes practically on the verge of tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, there's no need for you to apologize.\" Cindy says while putting her hands on Kelly's shoulders to reassure her.

Slowly the girls step out of the dollhouse and onto the ground below them. They look around and see five pillars rising up towering above them, and the ground itself seems to go on endlessly, they also notice little lines that run throughout the endless plain. It didn't take the girls long to realize they were in Angela's palm, it also didn't take them long to realize just how small they were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you, how small are you now?\" Angela asks. \"Let's find out, shall we?\" Angela's moon sized face says, her breath threatening to knock the girls down. suddenly inertia hits them as Angela's hand descends from her face, when it's hovering an inch or two above the ground that is the desk she tilts her hand and the girls along with the dollhouse all slide off. The dollhouse lands right side up but the girls didn't transition as smoothly. As they begin to pick themselves off the ground they hear Angela's voice again. \"You know, I think we should take a trip to the science lab, I want to grab a microscope to see you guys better.\" She giggles. \"And...\" she picks up the reducer, which completely dwarfs the bug sized girls at this point. \"If anyone gets in my way, I'll turn them into a science experiment too.\" She laughs again. \"Now get in the dollhouse.\" she orders, eyes trained on the girls to make sure they don't try to escape again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing they have no choice Kelly, Jessica, and Cindy all get back into the dollhouse. As soon as the last girl got their world began to shake again as Angela scooped the miniscule dollhouse up into her palm, they girls are suddenly seeing black as Angela secures her catch by entrapping them in her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Angela's trip to the science lab go...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A red motorcycle is parked inside.  He gets on and says \"Buckle up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride to the school takes about 15 minutes.  He's guessing that Kim has already gotten there.  If she hadn't already stopped Angela then he'll have to be ready for anything.  Kelly pokes her head out of the bag, and then wind hits her face like a mallet.  \"HOW FAR AWAY IS THE SCHOOL?\"  asks Kelly as loudly as she can.  \"We should be there in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrive at the schools parking lot and see Kim's motorcycle parked next to a very tiny car.  \"I don't like this.\"  says Phoenix.  He takes the three girls out of the bag and places them on his shoulders.  \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the short walk to the school doors, a 2 inch tall woman waves frantically at Phoenix for him to notice her.  \"And I thought I was tiny.\"  remarks Kelly.  Phoenix bends down and picks the woman up.  \"Ms. Flores?!\"  shouts Kelly. Ms. Jessica Flores is Kelly's sister's teacher.  \"Oh is that you, Rob?\"  Ms. Flores sounds like a little squeaky bug.  \"Thank goodness, Angela Gwen has been shrinking everyone in school with some damned gun!  A special agent named Red was sent in earlier...but I don't know what's happened to her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.  Cindy, Jessica, I need you two to watch after Ms. Flores...find others like her, and help them out here and away from danger.\"  \"Yessir\" , they both say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly, would you come with me?\" asks Phoenix.  \"I'd be happy to.\" responds Kelly with a smile.  Phoenix puts Kelly on his shoulder and opens the glass doors to the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela Gwen is in one of the many hallways with the shrink ray-gun in one hand and a tiny black speck in the other.  \"So, you thought that you could beat me with your crazy kung-fu, did you?\" she speaks to her hand.  Agent Kim Red is the black speck, no more then 4 centimeters tall.  Red sits there, in Angela's hand, quietly, not even paying attention to the girl.  \"Answer Me!\" Angela shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix walks in and quickly ducks behind an overturned locker when he sees Angela...luckily, she is pre-occupied.  \"Kelly,\" Phoenix whispers \"I need you to distract Angela.\"  \"Will do.\"  She says with a salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are, all of you, vermin!  Thinking what?  That you might escape me?  You think that you are better than me because you're some gorgeous sexy special agent?!\"  Angela asks, annoyed.  \"Well, let's see how good you taste!\" Gwen says as she holds her hand up to her mouth and dangles Kim in front of it.  \"Ungh!\" Kim murmurs as she is held tightly between Angela's index finger and thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Angela, stop!\"  Kelly says from behind her.  \"Impossible.\"  Angela doesn't turn.  \"Put Agent Kim down.\"  Kelly insists.  \"Put her down?  I think I'll instead get you BOTH!\"  Angela shouts as she shrinks Kelly down to Kim's size.  She then puts the Reducer in her pocket as she pinches Kellys arm and brings her up to her face, opposite Kim.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what should I do with you two?\"  Angela asks, not expecting an answer.  \"Kill me or release me, Angela.  But do not waste my time with talk!\"  shouts Kelly.  Angela is annoyed by Kelly's feistiness.  \"Very well, I guess I'll just EAT you both!\" Angela yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" Phoenix says from behind her \"put them girls down!\"  \"Ah, another flocks to the slaughter.  She shifts Kelly over to the hand Kim is in and reaches into her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I will....\"  nothing is there.  Phoenix points the Reducer at her.  \"Hey, bastard, smile!\"  Phoenix says as he shoots.  Angela drops Kim and Kelly as she goes down.  Kim holds on to Kelly in mid-air and uses a grappling gun to hoist themselves onto a locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela shrinks down, cursing the whole way, until she is only 2 inches tall.  \"Such beauty, wasted by a bad attitude.\" says Phoenix, remarking on Angela's good looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix enlarges Kelly and Kim to their original heights.  And Jessica, Cindy, Ms. Flores and about 5 other tiny girls walk in.  He restores all of them to their original height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, everyone crowds around the tiny figure of Angela Gwen.  The perfect bodied babe now only 2 inches tall backed away in fear of all of her classmates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ple...Please!  Ju..Just leave me alone!\"  she pleaded.  The group of girls gave each other looks and, together, they decided on a punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Phoenix' house, the once-tiny trio say their farewells to Kim and Rob.  The three girls walk off into the sunset.  Kim examines the Reducer.  \"So, what's going to happen to Project Reducer?\" asks Rob.  \"Sorry, Rob.  Classified.\" responds Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...that was an odd day.\"  says Kelly.  \"Yeah.\" respond both Cindy and Jessica.  'Hey, you want to go watch King Kong?\"  \"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Three Months Later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very pretty young woman wearing a blue jumpsuit is scrubbing with a large mass of what looks like pale blubber with a sponge.  The girl has long brown hair that has been frizzled due to constant work.  \"Am I done yet, Ms. Flores?\" shouts the girl into the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera shifts out to reveal the blubber as Ms. Flores' toe.  \"Oh not quite yet, Angela.  Not quite yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"</span></div></div>",

The door she saw first was the girl's bathroom, so the reduced Kelly headed towards it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela watched as the shorter girl tried to escape.  She waited a few moments, just watching Kelly's shorter legs trying to carry her to a safe destination.  She was toying with her, giving Kelly a false sense of security, before she decided to use the gun again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelly approached the bathroom door, Angela set the gun at a lower level, only 10% this time, and fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's hands were wrapped around the knob of the bathroom door when a strange sensation swept through her body.  She knew what was going on.  She watched as the world grew around her once more, but still, Kelly managed to pry the door open and rush inside, in an attempt to escape Angela.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela walked confidently towards the bathroom, the gun swinging in her arms as she walked.  A grin of satisfaction crept over her face.  \"Oh, the things I could do with this thing,\" she thought to herself as she swung the bathroom door open and scanned the area for Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had ran into a stall and locked the door behind her, pulling her legs up onto the seat in the hopes of remaining hidden.  Kelly was shaking slightly with fear, afraid of what Angela would do to her if she found her and/or decided to shrink her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Kelly,\" Angela called out in a sing-song voice.  \"Could you come out here for a moment?  I have a 'small' problem I hope you can help me with.\"  Angela giggled slightly at her remark.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrinking Kelly was feeling had long passed.  if she had to guess, she had to guess she had lost about maybe six inches, bringing her up to her rival's waist area, more or less.  She was surprised she hadn't lost more.  Apparently, Angela decided to make this whole thing into a game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, what's this I see,\"  Kelly heard Angela say in a playful voice.  \"This thing also makes things grow?  Well, that's neat.\"  Kelly heard a few clicks of the dial on the device she had found earlier that morning, followed by the familiar hum of the machine powering up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly watched Angela grow from inside her stall.  It was only a small increment, lasting no longer than 3 seconds, before the process stopped.  \"Ah,\" Angela sighed afterward.  \"I've always wanted to be 6 feet tall.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller girl paused a moment, before speaking.  \"You know, short stuff, this is getting kinda old.  So either come out from where ever you're hiding, or I drive over to your house and shrink your entire family down to ant-size.  And then, I'll get started on those loser friends of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly knew she had no choice now.  To have herself shrink down is one thing, but to have her family and friends threatened was another.  She placed her feet down on the ground, before opening the stall door.  She looked up at Angela.  The top of Kelly's head would barely reach the crotch of the taller girl now, given the two were standing side by side to make a comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walk over to me,\" Angela commanded.  The smaller girl obeyed, stopping a few feet in front of her.  Angela was busy fiddling with the controls on the device as she spoke again.  \"You know, you really are a stupid bitch.  Thinking that you could somehow teach me a lesson by shrinking me down.  Then, when you DO shrink me, you follow that up by restoring most of my height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that, by the way,\" Angela continued, looking down at Kelly, both literally and figuratively, with a predator's glare, a slight smile on her face.   \"I mean, I couldn't have taken the gun from you if you hadn't helped me, so again, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly heard the device hum again, followed by Angela pointing the device down at her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today's lesson,\" Angela continued.  \"Is to have the backbone to follow through with your plans.  Like me:  I'm going to shrink you down to a few inches tall, take you home and...well, I haven't decide exactly what to do with you yet.  Maybe I'll sell you to one of my friends. Or give you to my younger brother.  He's 8 and really needs a new toy to play with.  It seems all of his other toys break too easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or,\" Angela concluded.  \"Maybe I'll just keep you for myself.  Can you imagine yourself being my slave for the next 60 years of my life?  Because I sure can.\"  Angela laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly knew she had to do something. Running wasn't an option anymore.  It's what got her in this mess to  begin with.  Besides, the door was too far away now.  She'd never make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Kelly could try to take the gun away from Angela.  She was a little less than half of her tormentor's height, but she could use her bodyweight to plow into Angela's body, hopefully causing the bigger girl to drop the device in the process.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was running out of time.  Angela had her finger on the trigger of the gun.  Kelly decides to...</span></div></div>",

She hit busted through the roof with little more than a slight discomfort and continued shooting up.

She had always been fairly average in terms of build and form, but her increasing scale made all of her curves more noticeable and her modest C cup breasts were beginning to seem massive<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all was said and done, Kelly looked around. Even the tallest building around was much lower than her knees, even her ankles. Indeed, she stood at around 3,000 feet, not that she knew or cared. All the giant girl that was Kelly cared about was reveling in her new size. The view was unreal, she could see for miles and all around her, were tiny dots that she could only guess were people. Kelly squated down to get a better look, and indeed, the specks began scurring away. This new power was intoxicating and Kelly was drunk with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do now,\" The titaness wondered aloud, her voice a deafening boom to the people near her, \"Should I play with you little ones, or should I find out what the rest of these buttons do?\" She waved the now massive device so that all could see the source of her new height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions, decisions...</span></div></div>",

Kelly giggled, ready to let the moment get the best of her as she held the trigger, aiming the Reducer right into her chest, the tip nuzzled atop her breasts. \"I would say, 'see you later' but you'll all be seeing alot of me, I'm sure.\" She smirked and gave the gun ten pumps of the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach press came with a flash of light, her body tingling with static. She knew now that this had a delayed effect, so she wanted all that size to happen at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing that Kelly didn't take wholly into account, however, was exponential growth. Each blast was an additional x100, and she was already 3000ft tall... she slowly lowered herself to the ground, laying her entire, massive body down, resting on her back. She placed the Reducer down atop her stomach, moving her hands back.to support her head as the goddess to be reclined. She reveled in how the ground shook as it bared her weight, buildings and people crushed under her bulk. She couldn't wait for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly gasped, her entire body tightening as the growth began taking effect. Every last inch of her body filled with burning pleasure that caused her to moan and squirm, her toes curling and back arching. She grew. Kelly grew. Kelly grew alot. Faster and faster, everything a blur as clouds parted around her face, her body growing incomprehensibly fast, bulldozing entire cities as miles and miles were added to her frame, the planet shaking as a whole, the ground cracking from her weight alone. Her vision was blurred, her mind simply unable to process the sheer speed at which she grew, not that she cared. She was more interested in the numbingly intense pleasure the shook her body, floods of fluid leaving her slit as she orgasmed again and again, entire countries succumbing to the tides. Soon, the planet was unable to keep her on the surface. Her body floating free as still she grew. The moon was smashed to pieces as her bulk rammed into it at the speed of size, still growing faster and faster without sign of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer moans ruptured the planet of mars as the vibrations shattered its crust, her body swelling with end even now. Kelly was on the verge of tears, her mind unable to process so much at once. She blacked out, floating amongst star sized globs of her own cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit later, she finally came to, her eyes filled with a field of stars, one particularly bright star just before her nose. She froze up. It was the sun. Kelly looked around, biting her lip. She was incomprehensibly massive, her body just short of the length of the solarsystem. She looked around, noting each tiny speck that were the remaining planets. Earth, miraculously, was still intact. A glance further to the right gave a wave of relief, the reducer, easily larger than any star she knew of, floated lazily next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, kelly grinned. She was a goddess now.</span></div></div>",

She still had her C cup breasts that bounced lightly as they heaved under their own, several ton weight, a small waist, and a decent set of hips. She really had nothing to complain about. However, she couldn't help but feel like she could always be a bit prettier, hoping that she'd attain higher beauty as she aged. But with the Reducer, she could skip the weight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin spread across her face as she rose to her full, massive height, flexing her toes into the ground, pushing up massive, mountainous mounds of dirt and concrete. \"Get ready for a little show~\" she said, winking down to the mite sized people at her feet. She set the reducer to its thin beam, aiming specifically at her chest. She took a deep breath and pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped, the beam casting a warm light over her chest, her flesh tingling. The sensation was amazing, her flesh rising like dough in a speed up video, growing evenly in all directions, hardly sagging at all, despite their increasing size! It was almost too good to stop! A powerful moan shook the ground around her, shattering windows as her C's rose through the alphabet, rising up to D's, DD's, and even E's! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, she decided to stop as her massive tits bounced at an impressive F cup, their own weight causing them to bounce with her every movement. She looked down and grinned, unable to see anything before her toes, only the tips of her painted nails showing past the Crest of her heavy breasts. She tentatively ran her fingers along the enhanced flesh, moaning as even the lightest touch sent shivers up her spine. \"Mnnnn fuck~ this is alot better\" she chuckled, speaking to noone in particular, but also to everyone in town as the specks could only look up in awe. Kelly giggled, thinking of the view for the ant sized bully down below, hardly even a germ to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's even things up, shall we?\" Her voice purred out, low and seductive as she slid her hands down from the sides of her breasts, tracing her curves down to her, comparatively, unimpressive hips. Her ass, by any definition, was not unimpressive, the largest in the world, in fact, but compared to her new tits... it was looking small. Kelly smirked as she pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another flash of light, the beam causing her hips and ass to glow under its warmth. She purred, enjoying the sensation as her flesh billowed out, swelling and growing organically, bouncing under new weight. She moaned, swaying her widening hips, her bones popping as her center of mass shifted around. The massive cheeks surged up to the size of cantaloupes, settling it to the size of watermelons before she finally released the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Now I'm looking like a proper titan.\" Kelly chuckled, smirking down at the little ones below her. She raised a hand, winking down to the bugs below before swinging it downwards. There was an earsplitting explosion of noise as her palm slammed into her ass, causing it to jiggle and shake from the recoil. The shockwave traveled outward, knocking over anyone caught in its radius from sheer force alone. She moaned, her newly acquired flesh jiggling and shaking, \"mnnn~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kelly,\" Tom called out as he walked toward her. \"I don't know what happened. One minute Biscuit and I were the same height going out for a ride, the next he's as big as the house and I'm half his size, and I can't figure out why,\" Kelly immediately said. \"I promise I won't break or hurt anything, but I don't think I could stop Biscuit if something spooks him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's actually why I came here,\" Tom admitted. \"You see, I found this gun, and I wanted to know what it did.

Down he went, from house sized, to Kelly's height, and finally down to his normal size. Next up was Kelly, and she was soon shrunk back, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better,\" she said. \"Being tall is nice and all, but not when you're too big to fit inside your house.

Unlike when you had this, I won't be making anything building sized,\" she said upon receiving the gun. Next, she went over to Biscuit to take off his saddle and stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Biscuit's a little short, don't ya think?\" she said, and promptly fired at the horse, causing him to grow a foot and a half. \"And I need to be able to see eye to eye with him,\" she continued, now using the gun on herself and matching Biscuit's height. \"See this? This is how to responsibly use the thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I get it. I might not have been thinking about the consequences earlier, but you don't need to keep reminding me,\" Tom answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just want to make sure you've learned your lesson. Now, let's go see if we can find April and May\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril and May were their twin younger sisters, 11 years old. They were identical except for one thing: their hair wasn't the same color. April had blonde hair, while May's was a light shade of brown. Otherwise, the two were exactly the same and almost inseparable. They had cheerful personalities, and were well-liked by most people they knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, you're not seriously going to use the gun on them, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you can stalk your sister and make them taller without them knowing it, so can I,\" Kelly shot back. \"If it means anything to you, I promise to keep the small enough to fit in the house and large enough to not get stepped on by anybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom shut up after that, and let Kelly do what she wanted without questioning her. Kelly walked through the house looking for the twins, and inside found a note from her parents that said they'd be gone for a couple days, and that she and Tom were in charge while they were gone. This gave Kelly plenty of time to use the gun for her purposes, and there was a lot to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was looking out her window when she found the twins in the front, playing on the tire swing that was set up in the biggest tree near the house. April was on the swing and May was pushing her, both seemed to be enjoying themselves. Kelly took aim at May, checking the gun to make sure it would grow her younger sister. She then fired at May, who quickly shot up in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that were now two major differences between them, May stopped pushing the swing, and April got out to see what was wrong. By the time Kelly took her finger off the trigger, April eyes were level with her twin's stomach. As they marveled at May's sudden growth spurt, Kelly fired at April, growing her until she was the same height as May. Even though Kelly had grown herself some, she was sure that the twins would have at least a head on her if they were measured side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins appeared to be overjoyed at their fortune, completely unaware of who or what caused them to grow. They didn't seem to be too keen on finding out that cause, either, and were content to compare themselves to things that they used to look up at. After getting tired of that, they agreed on something and started walking towards the house.  </span></div></div>",

April and I were just out front playing on the swing when suddenly-OW!\" May's story got interrupted as she hit her head on the door frame running into Kelly's room. April wasn't far behind, but she ducked under the door, laughing at her sister's misfortune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What she's trying to say is just got a lot taller for no reason and now we want to show you,\" April finished for May. \"Speaking of things to show, what's that you got there,\" she added, referring to the gun still in Kelly's hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This? It's a really cool toy I found that can do some really cool stuff. Like this,\" she said as she used it to grow May, who had recovered from hitting the door, until her head was touching the 9 foot ceiling. \"Or this,\" she said as she shrunk April until she was barely up to her twin's waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean you did this to us?\" May asked, towering over her older sister. Kelly nodded while April whined, \"I don't wanna be short, I wanna be tall like May is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you two be big if you promise to be good, otherwise you're gonna stay short like you were when you woke up. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing \"Yeah!\" in unison, Kelly grew April up to the ceiling, then gave herself a smaller boost, now 7 and a half feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry. I'm gonna get some food,\" April anounced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" May said as she followed her sister to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kelly got to the kitchen; she found the twins staring at a plate of cookies, looking glum. \"What's wrong,\" she asked them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wanted cookies, but we didn't realize they would be so tiny. I could eat all of these in, like, two bites,\" April complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know what to do, just don't touch the cookies for a minute,\" Kelly said. Aiming at the plate of cookies and making sure that the gun was set to grow, Kelly shot at the cookies. The twins watched in amazaement as the cookies and the plate grew and grew, until they were all 3 feet in diameter or more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! You're the best, Kelly,\" they exclaimed, then set to work on the cookies. Even with giant cookies, the twins made short work of their snack. They then looked to Kelly eagerly as they told her what they wanted to do next. </span></div></div>",

Kelly, however, was not giving in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not,\" she said. \"You two are big enough right now, and if you get any bigger you're just gonna cause a lot more trouble than it'll be worth.\" Despite being a full foot and a half shorter than the twins, Kelly knew they wouldn't try to argue with her about it. As she expected, the twins deflated when they heard their sister's denial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you're no fun,\" May complained. She and April gave up on the puppy dog eyes and had now switched to pouting, but Kelly wasn't changing her mind anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you think this is all a game, but this thing's not a toy,\" Kelly said, gesturing to the gun in her hands. \"We barely know what this thing does or how dangerous it is. And since we don't know anything about it, it's not a good idea to keep messing around with it. I'm not going to shrink you back to normal, so why don't you go do something somewhere else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins thought it over for a second, shared a glance, then came to a silent agreement. \"Ok, we understand,\" April said. \"Thanks for letting us stay big.\" With that, she leaned over and gave her older sister a hug, moving aside to allow May to do the same. Although they were outwardly accepting that they weren't going to be able to convince Kelly to make them any bigger, the twins had decided that they were still going to find a way to get their hands on the gun, it was just going to take a little more patience than they first expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the twins headed out the door, Kelly sighed, reflecting on how crazy the day had already been. She was distracted from her thoughts by her phone ringing, a call from her best friend Jennifer. Answering the phone, she quickly got absorbed into the conversation and went to her room, forgetting the gun on the kitchen table in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, April and May were going over their game plan to get the gun back. They decided that after pretending to play outside for a while, April would go inside to find the gun. If Kelly asked what she was doing, April would lie and say she had to go to the bathroom. Once she found the gun, she would take it to the bathroom and toss it out the window to a waiting May, and then they would get free reign to use the gun as they saw fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they decided it was time to put their plan into motion, April walked into the house and nearly started laughing out loud at how easy her mission was. Luckily for her, she kept quiet just in case Kelly was nearby, and quickly took the gun back outside to a waiting May.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was too easy, Kelly just left it on the table,\" April explained to her twin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome, that means we can get to using it even faster,\" May replied. \"Since you went and got it, I'll  make you bigger first, then you do me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy passed the gun to May, who took a second to look at it to try to figure out what everything did. The design made it look like a sci-fi ray gun, with a switch on the side that had two options, \"Grow\" and \"Shrink\". Since the gun was already set to grow, all May had to do was point and shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big do you wanna get?\" she asked April<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me big enough to look over the house, that would be so cool,\" the other twin responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it. Get ready!\" May called out as she began to fire. Instantly, a beam shot out and hit April square in the chest, and not long after that she began to rise. Steadily, April could see her perspective getting higher and higher. Within seconds, she was tall enough to look into the second story windows on the house, and shortly after that she had to bend down to see into them. After less than a minute, April's head poked out over the top of the house, and she gave a thumbs up to May to signal her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the weather up there?\" May called up to her now gigantic twin. Despite being nine feet tall herself, she felt absolutely dwarfed by her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's great! You should come on up now,\" April answered, and May needed no further invitation. Turning the gun on herself, May pulled the trigger, rising to meet her twin. As she got closer to April's height, she had an idea. Instead of matching her sister, she was going to outgrow her. Not by a ton, but enough that it would be easily noticeable between the two of them. Upon matching April's height, she held down the trigger a little longer, until she was about half a head taller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril quickly noticed the difference. \"Hey, that's not fair!\" she cried at the injustice of being the smaller twin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you get for going second,\" May said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me that,\" April said, lunging for the gun. She and May struggled for it, and in that struggle, the gun accidentally fired again. A shadow fell over April as the target of the blast grew.</span></div></div>",

She could even shrink her all the way down to normal. However, neither of those two really appealed to her since she never held a grudge towards her twin. With her mind made up, she pointed the gun at April and fired, watching as she rose up to meet May's height. Instead of stopping when they were equal, May kept growing April until the latter was a whole head taller than the former.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" April said as she wrapped her sister up in a bear hug. \"But why did you make me so much bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you might wanna be the bigger one of us for longer than a minute,\" May told her. \"Besides, I have an idea for something really fun we can do.\" She paused as April raised an eyebrow at her. \"You shrink me and I'm gonna go back inside and get our swimming suits. Then we can go swimming in the lake as giants! Doesn't that sound fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril's eyes lit up at May's suggestion. There was a secluded lake a ways from their house that only their family ever went to. Swimming in the lake was one of the twins' favorite things to do when they were normal sized. At their current sizes, who knows what amazing adventures could be had?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea! Give me the gun and I'll shrink you.\" May passed her the gun, which expanded a little to match April's larger hands. April checked to make sure it was set to shrink, then fired at May. She watched as her sister dwindled in size until she saw May give her a thumbs up, then she released the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom May's perspective, everything had become much larger. Looking at the house on one side of her, then over to April on the other side, she realized just how huge they had made themselves with the gun. The house, which she estimated was around 30 feet tall at the roof's peak, wasn't even half as tall as her sister. May herself was only a little bit taller than April's shoes, on account of April shrinking May almost down to her original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back out of her thoughts, May waved to her sister as she started walking into the house. \"Be right back! Don't go anywhere!\" she teased, which made April giggle. Inside the house, May didn't see either of her older siblings. When she passed by Kelly's room, she could hear her older sister was still on the phone, so she was still too distracted to notice anything that was going on outside. May grinned as she opened her door and started searching for her and April's swimsuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay emerged from the house a short time afterwards, and was greeted by a sitting April. \"I got 'em,\" she announced to the giant. \"Also, I don't think Tom's around and Kelly's too busy talking on the phone to notice what we're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Now, stand still so I can get you up to size,\" April said as she stood up and adjusted the dial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs May saw her sister, she had another one of her (in her mind, brilliant) ideas. \"Wait, wait, wait! Before you shoot me, I have another idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril paused. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay motioned for her sister to come down to her level. Once April was lying on her stomach, May began explaining her newest plan. \"Instead of making me big and us both walking to the lake, what if you make yourself super big and carry me to the lake? Then when we get there, you can grow me and we can go back to our regularly scheduled programming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril gave her sister a confused look. \"Why would you want to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it. Wouldn't it be so cool be like King Kong and carry me around?\" May gestured wildly with her hands as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril considered her sister's idea. On one hand she didn't understand why May was so insistent on this crazy plan. What if she fell or April dropped her? It would be a long way down, and May would get seriously hurt at the least. On the other hand, May seemed really passionate about this, and she had done a nice thing for April earlier when she didn't have to. If this was what she really wanted, April figured this could be her way of paying her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant twin began standing up, her decision made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, we'll go with your idea. <i>But</i>,\" she said, interrupting her sister's cheers, \"you have to be extremely, super-duper careful, and I'll be careful too. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" April sighed, preparing herself. \"Here we go.\" She made another check that the gun was set to grow and turned the gun on herself, pulling the trigger. May watched as her already enormous sister began rising once again. Up and up she went, each second forcing May to crane her neck farther and farther back just to see her sister's head. After what seemed like she had gone up a mile, the beam finally stopped glowing and April stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! You're even more huge than I thought you would get! That's so awesome!\" May shouted up to her sister. Using the house comparison she made earlier, the house was about a quarter of the way up April's legs. The house hadn't gotten any bigger or smaller than before, so that meant April was probably eight times as big as the house, which made her somewhere in the neighborhood of 240 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom April's view, watching May jump around by her feet reinforced how small May was compared to her. She thought she might have overdone it, but she knew that May wouldn't accept her shrinking at this point, so she slowly kneeled down and reached out her hand for May to climb up on. She brought her hand up to her face to get a better look at her sister, noting just how tiny she looked even up this close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay was unfazed in the eyes of her giant sister. She knew April would never hurt a fly on purpose, and May was a lot more important to her sister than a fly would ever be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put me on your shoulder, I can hold on to your hair as we go,\" she told April.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it'll be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril placed her hand at her shoulder and May climbed off, grabbing fistfuls of April's blonde hair in the process. \"I'm ready!\" announced. \"Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, April steadily began walking towards the lake.</span></div></div>",

Soon she passed her sister's 250 foot stature and began to creep even higher, eventually leaving herself at about twice April's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  No fair!  You did it again!\" laughed April, and then playfully tackled her sister to the ground.</span></div></div>",

Soon, the gun was once again firing at April, boosting her size even farther.  She soon met up with her sister at 500 feet, and then stopped to take in their surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah...\u201d May whispered.  The lake was about the size of a swimming pool to the sisters.  \u201cHow about we calm down with the gun for a moment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d agreed April.  The two girls set the gun down and began to wade into the lake.  Fortunately for them, the lake turned out to be quite deep, allowing them to swim freely around the body of water.  They playfully splashed around, drinking up massive amounts of water and losing all sense of time.  Soon, the sun began to go down, and the girls decided to head back home before it got too dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould we shrink back down?  If Kelly even catches sight of us at this size she\u2019ll flip out!\u201d asked a concerned April.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay agreed, \u201cI think you\u2019re right.  She doesn\u2019t even know we have the gun.  She still thinks we\u2019re 9 feet tall!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls laughed.  It was incredible how tiny 9 feet sounded now, after they\u2019d gone so far into the sky.  But now was the time to come back to earth.  The girls shrink back down to 9 feet tall and return home.</span></div></div>",

Tom took a quick shower, climbed into his pickup truck, and drove the whole way there, the gun bouncing on his lap all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery once in a while at a stop sign or stop light, Tom would pick up the gun and look it over. It felt heavy and metallic, with strange dials and a few light bulbs that were sure to flash. It definitely didn't feel like any kids' toy he'd ever seen, but what else could it be? It wasn't as if science fiction devices like the ones he'd seen were real, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom shrugged it off, tucking the gun back into his belt loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, Tom arrived at the hallway to his campus housing at Biggers State. His roommates had all gone home for the summer, and since summer classes hadn't started yet, the hall was mostly empty otherwise. He'd been lucky that no one at the school had decided to inspect his room before now; he was supposed to have moved out by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom opened the door to his room, slipped inside, and found the shirts he'd left behind hanging in the closet. He piled them all up and turned to carry them out before suddenly finding himself running headlong into someone else in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" a female voice shouted. Tom fell backward on his rear end and heard a loud clang--the gun had dropped off of his belt loop! Before he could reach for it, a hand snatched it from in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked up at the figure whom he'd run into. Long, slender white legs ran into a tiny plaid skirt. A red halter top bulged with curves atop a flat stomach. A face--short blonde hair cut in a kinky bob framing big blue eyes and red lips curled downward in a frown. It was Ashley Parvis, the floor's residential adviser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, what are you doing here?\" she asked. \"And what is this weird thing you have?\"</span></div></div>",

I just came by to pick up some clothes I left and that toy for my niece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley turned the gun over in her head, running her long pink nails over the various dials. \"It's awfully sturdy for a kid's toy. It looks like one of those shrink rays from a sci-fi movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom laughed. \"Yeah, that's Braydon, all right. Loves those sci-fi movies. So if you wouldn't mind handing it back to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of handing the gun back, Ashley points it at Tom with a fake, exaggerated sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, put your hands up, space pirate!\" she shouts. \"You're under arrest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom freezes in his tracks. \"Ashley, please--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too far!\" she interrupts, and she squeezes the trigger on the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a flash of light. Tom feels a sinking feeling deep in his gut, and amid the strange swirling of his air, he hears the laughter of Ashley... getting louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" she cackles. \"Now you're shrinking... down to... OH, WOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the light fades, Tom can see it as well. He had been just a little taller than Ashley a minute ago; now, he was down to her chin. Then her chest. The gorgeous figure of the RA was ballooning to incredible proportions, and she stared down at Tom with an aghast look on her face. At least for a moment. As Tom shrank further and further, dropping down past her skirt, past her knees... her look of terror changed to a strange smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley!\" Tom shouted. The shrinking had at last stopped, and Tom took stock of his own size. He was about twice as tall as her big toe--probably only about two inches high! He looked up into the sky, past the long legs, trying his best not to divert his attention to the tiny white panties that he could now clearly see, past the chest that now rose more massive than his entire body, up at the curious face that now regarded him with a strange smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW,\" she said breathlessly, and her voice shook Tom to the core. \"THAT... THAT'S A REAL SHRINK GUN, TOM.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding?\" Tom screamed back at her, trying his best to propel his tiny voice as best he could. \"You've got to do something, Ashley! I can't just stay tiny like this forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY,\" Ashley said, twirling her hair in her fingers. \"OKAY, I MEAN. YEAH, WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. BUT... ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ASHLEY!\" Tom hollered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY, FINE, GEEZ,\" she said, and before Tom could even get his bearings, she scooped him up in her hand. The speed at which he was rising was incredible, and he fell backward into a palm that was larger than he was as it carried him hundreds of feet in the air. Ashley held him in front of her face, cocking her head to one side, turning him around. \"I MEAN... WOW, YOU'RE SO SMALL... I'M SORRY, BUT...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't--don't be sorry,\" Tom stammered. He suddenly realized that his entire fate was in the hands of this coed from down the hall, and he was determined not to exacerbate the situation. \"Let's just make things right, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RIGHT,\" Ashley said, as if snapping out of a daze. \"BUT FIRST, LET'S GET YOU OUT OF HERE. I'M SORRY, I CAN'T HAVE YOU OUT IN THE OPEN IN THE HALLWAY, SO YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO GO IN HERE FOR NOW. BUT I THINK YOU'LL ENJOY THE RIDE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom wanted to protest, but it was too late--the giant fingers had already closed around him. He felt himself rising again, then a bit of shuffling, then at last he settled in between two large, soft walls of flesh. When the hand released him, Tom saw it move upward, then caught a glimpse of the face of Ashley overhead, smiling down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T GET TOO COMFORTABLE, LITTLE GUY,\" she said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had put Tom in between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few steps were nearly unbearable; Ashley's chest, which was impressive at normal size, now surrounded Tom like a pair of twin houses. They shook with each step, driving Tom further and further between Ashley's breasts. However, the discomfort soon gave way to a stupor as Tom realized exactly what was happening, as his fantasies were stretched out before him in IMAX proportions. He relaxed, leaning back against Ashley's warm breast, letting himself be carried away to...</span></div></div>",

When Ashley plucks him from between her breasts and holds him up before her face, she smiles at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOOKS LIKE YOU ENJOYED THAT, LITTLE MAN,\" she said, and with a stray finger she poked at the tiny erection tenting Tom's shorts. \"THAT MIGHT BE A LOT MORE IMPRESSIVE IF YOU WERE BIGGER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the touch, Tom finally snaps out of it. He looks around and finds himself in Ashley's dorm room, which has expanded to unbelievable proportions. His tiny eyes can take in little beyond the huge woman holding him, but he soon finds himself gently placed on a bed. Tom winces as he touches the sheet--he's so small that the threads of the bed look like tied-together ropes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley, you've got to make me big again!\" Tom begs. \"I can't live like--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OUT OF THE QUESTION,\" Ashley interrupts. She leans down close, strands of her blonde hair falling across the side of her face. \"I MEAN, LET'S BE HONEST HERE, BUG: IF SOMEONE WERE TO FIND OUT THAT I ACCIDENTALLY SHRUNK YOU LIKE THIS, IT'D COMPLETELY RUIN MY REPUTATION.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't tell anyone!\" Tom shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH YEAH, LIKE I'M GOING TO TRUST THAT,\" she answers, rolling her eyes. \"NO, I THINK IT'S BEST JUST TO GET RID OF YOU AT THIS POINT--ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. YOU'RE FINISHED, LITTLE MAN. NO ONE'S GOING TO FIND YOU AGAIN.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my truck--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOUR TRUCK WILL BE YOUR SIZE SOON,\" she says. \"BUT DON'T WORRY. I'LL MAKE IT WORTH YOUR WHILE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here the giantess leans back on her knees, running her hand through her hair. Slowly, seductively, she pulls her shirt over her head, and Tom stares transfixed as her incredible breasts emerge. Licking her lips with a slow, sensual wink, she unclasps the back of her bra, easing it off before uncovering her bare breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley, I--I have a girlfriend,\" Tom stammers as she leans forward, positioning her breasts right in front of Tom's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND AS SEXY AS ME,\" she says. \"I THINK I'LL KEEP YOU AS MY LITTLE TOY. YOU CAN EXPLORE EVERY INCH OF MY BODY, KEEP ME COMPANY, AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU AND FEED YOU. BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA LIE, LITTLE MAN...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans forward and plants a kiss on Tom half the size of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...BEING THIS MUCH BIGGER THAN YOU KIND OF TURNS ME ON.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom doesn't know what to say. The mountain of a woman rises again, sliding her skirt down her legs and revealing a tiny pair of white cotton panties. It might be... interesting for a while. But forever? And what about his girlfriend?</span></div></div>",

LOOK AT HOW MUCH BIGGER I AM THAN YOU EVEN NOW. I CAN HOLD YOU IN PLACE WITH A SINGLE FINGER, LITTLE MAN.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe aims the gun, and it whirrs to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AND IT'S ABOUT TO GET A WHOLE LOT WORSE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ashley raises her finger, the gun fires again. The flash of light blinds Tom, and he feels the ground stretch and expand beneath him. Ashley's nipple, where he had previously been lying, suddenly doubles in size, and it isn't long before Tom tumbles down onto the areola, which expands around him quickly. In the distance, the face of Ashley grows larger and larger, the look of disdain on her face transforming to a small smile. Soon, though, Tom is so small that even her face appears blurry in the distance. When at last he stops shrinking, he takes to his feet again, looking around for a place to run. But... where? Where can he run?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he can even begin to run, the voice of Ashley thunders overhead, forcing Tom to cover his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY SHIT,\" she booms. \"YOU'RE JUST A SPECK. JUST AN ITTY-BITTY SPECK ON MY BOOB. I CAN BARELY SEE YOU, LITTLE FLEA.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, seconds later, there's another whirring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AND THAT MEANS YOU'RE TOO BIG.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the flash begins again, the transformation is even more stark this time. Ashley's nipple, previously the size of a small building, suddenly grows to mountainous proportions just overhead. The flesh of Ashley's breast becomes almost too massive to comprehend, and the huge girl's face is now so far away that Tom cannot even see it. By the time the shrinking is passed, Ashley's nipple is an incredible monument, the tiny bumps on her areola are now the size of hills, and Ashley's face is indistinguishable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tom's world is shaken. There is a loud moaning in the distance, and the ground beneath Tom's feet suddenly rises, forcing him into the air. As this happens, he shrinks even further--apparently Ashley is using the gun again while she's doing... something. Tom shrinks well beyond the point that he feasibly should be seeing at least skin cells, but he dares not question--the device has enough strange properties as it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the ground shakes, the moans continue, and Ashley's fingers appear overhead...</span></div></div>",

Such an action would seem like little more than a scratch at normal size, but to Tom, it's as if two huge asteroids have collided with each other. However, the finger continues downward, hovering above him, and suddenly he finds himself drawn to it, shooting upward at incredible speed. Ashley must have licked her finger, as a wall of moisture surrounds Tom. It's a strange sensation--the moisture appears incredibly deep, but Tom's body is too small to break the surface tension, and so he simply clings like a piece of lint to the surface as Ashley turns the finger around--a simple motion to her that to the incredibly tiny Tom feels like a roller coaster the size of a city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the finger turns around, Tom finds himself before what he can only assume are Ashley's lips, each lip stretching for miles. Ashley's tongue peaks out of the mouth for a minute, and it's as if a titanic monster has breached the surface of the incredible world that is her face. When she speaks--merely in whispers--the force of her hot breath is stronger than the mightiest hurricane on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL, WELL, WELL,\" she says. The hot air envelops Tom, surrounds him, is nearly incomprehensible. Even her tiniest of breaths feels like the world ending. \"NOW YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE STRENGTH TO BEG. I CAN SEE YOU--THE GUN ALLOWS ME TO OBSERVE WHAT I'VE SHRUNK. YOU LOOK BROKEN, YOU INVISIBLE NOTHING.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom doesn't even know what to say. She's right. It's hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU HOW IT'S GETTING ME OFF SHRINKING YOU LIKE THIS,\" she continues. \"I'M SOOOOOOOOOO, SOOOOOOOOOO POWERFUL WITH THIS GUN. THE RUSH IS INCREDIBLE. AND IT'S INFINITE. DO YOU REALIZE THAT, MY INSIGNIFICANT INHABITANT? I CAN SHRINK YOU FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER. I CONTROL EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. AND THAT MAKES ME A GODDESS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill dangling from Ashley's finger, Tom finds the strength to nod. There's little point in arguing it--Ashley controls his entire life now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOOD BOY,\" she says. A chuckle--just a small, innocuous laugh, slightly louder than the whisper--threatens to blow Tom's eardrums to smithereens, but the speck manages to cover his ears just in time. Soon, the finger lifts off again, carrying Tom away, further and further away, until he finds himself on a strange pink surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU ARE NOW ON MY NIPPLE,\" she says--at full volume now, her voice rattling the entire world. \"IT'S TIME TO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND OUR RELATIONSHIP. SO WORSHIP ME. PRAY TO ME. BEG ME TO MAKE YOU EVEN SMALLER AND SMALLER AND SMALLER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom drops to his knees, the weight of the Goddess's commands weighing down on him, but even before he can do so, he hears the whirring again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEVER MIND; NO NEED TO BEG.

For ten whole seconds, her body shakes and quivers under the power of the gun and then... nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, in a daze, she sits up.

The final blast of the gun had shrunk him further still, and now, he has no idea how small he's become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one fentometer tall,\" she says, surprised to hear herself say it. \"Smaller than even an electron microscope can see. Compared to you, I'm trillions of meters across. My nipple alone is larger than a sun to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasps. But...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom articulates it. \"How do you even know that? How can you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHRINK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe command comes again, and Tom shrinks smaller still, shouting as he does so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GROW.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom grows a little bit taller but still doesn't regain much of his height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looks down at her hands, which are still crackling with the energy of the gun. With a raised eyebrow, she looks at her dresser, and by sheer force of will, the dresser contracts slightly. She tells it to shrink more slowly, and it does. She tells it to grow back to full size, and it does immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at herself. She grows an inch. She shrinks an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The power of the gun is mine,\" she says. \"Do you realize what this means, slave? It means I'm a true Goddess now. It means that nothing--absolutely nothing--can stop me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom gasps. \"But--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHRINK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FASTER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrinks faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WORSHIP YOUR GODDESS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if compelled by an invisible hand, Tom drops to his knees, kissing the nipple on which he rests, offering pleas of mercy to his now-omnipotent goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley feels her power grow even as the tiny man shrinks smaller and smaller. Slowly, his memories become hers, his knowledge becomes hers. With time, Tom is so small that her body recognizes him as a part of her--nothing more than a speck within a speck within a speck to the trillionth degree on her incredible body.

She tries to shake it off, assuming that she's just been knocked a little loopy when she tripped. Nervously, she adjusts her shirt, and she suddenly realizes that her bra strap has slid a bit down her shoulder beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her pants are looser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Ashley is a little bit taller now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh--what's going on?\" Sara stammers as she hikes up her sweat pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's exactly what it appears, my pet,\" Ashley says.

This time, she inches her way out of her pants, running for another room as the Goddess follows her. Her shirt begins swallowing up her arms, which in turn become tangled in bra straps that no longer comfortably fit. By the time she reaches the door, her doorknob is over her head, her panties have long since fallen off, and the Goddess has managed to keep up with her just by walking at a slight pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm.

She seems to be controlling her size, making her smaller and smaller. However, Ashley seems to want to take her alive. She's made no effort to crush the still-dwindling Sara, nor has she been particularly physical with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Sara slips out of the bra and forces her way out of the T-shirt, standing as tall as she can. With fists bared, she looks up at Ashley, and a lump forms in her throat--she's only knee-high on the intruder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HMM, NOW WHAT'S THIS?\" Ashley booms, her voice shaking the very core of the apartment. \"YOU HONESTLY WANT TO FIGHT ME, PIPSQUEAK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Sara shouts, not quite sure where she's going with this. \"Bring it on, Queen Kong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looks down with an imperious smirk. She winks, forcing Sara to grow just a bit smaller. The tiny girl, noticing the change, immediately starts to run, resolving to work out a plan later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, A CHASE, IS IT?\" Ashley says with a laugh. \"EXACTLY HOW FAR DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GO? YOU'RE NOT REALLY AN ACTION HERO RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW--MORE OF AN ACTION FIGURE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara looks back up, smiling. \"Then a toy shouldn't be a big problem for a 'Goddess,' huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley gasps. \"HOW <i>DARE</i> YOU MOCK ME?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley tries to lunge, not noticing that Sara has led her behind her computer desk. The giant girl suddenly finds herself tangled in wires, tripping and stumbling to the ground. Sara makes a flying leap, barely avoiding being crushed by Ashley's massive hand as she falls to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ashley falls, Sara realizes that she's stopped shrinking--Ashley must need to concentrate to maintain the effect! Even so, Sara looks down at herself and finds that she's only eight inches high. Still, this could be her last chance to make a move, but what?</span></div></div>",

So as Ashley got her footing, Sara slipped out of the main room and toward her bedroom, where she slid beneath the door of the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU LITTLE BRAT!\" Ashley shouted from the other room. \"WHERE ARE YOU HIDING?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara looked up... and up... and up. The gun was sitting on top of the shelf, just above her clothes. Sara grabbed onto a long trenchcoat, taking hold of the button loop and pulling herself up. Even though she was a computer nerd at heart, Sara dabbled in rock-climbing to stay in shape, and the experience served her well as she quickly ambled up the front of the coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's easy enough when you're not carrying all that weight,\" Sara muttered, pulling herself past the coat's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon a voice echoed from the other room. Ashley had pulled herself up and was obviously walking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HMMMM...\" she bellowed. \"THE ACTION FIGURE IS SOMEWHERE DARK, ISN'T SHE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara shuddered--<i>she could see where she was?</i> But she refused to let it shake her and kept climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"INTERESTING,\" Ashley said. \"YOUR GODDESS HAS THE POWER TO OBSERVE THOSE SHE'S SHRUNK, YOU KNOW. BUT WITH YOU, IT'S DIFFERENT. YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING IN THE DARK. WHERE EXACTLY ARE YOU HIDING?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to Hell!\" Sara shouted, sure that Ashley could hear her. She had reached the collar of the trenchcoat and was now ready to pull herself up onto the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley chuckled darkly. \"OH, NO, WE CAN'T HAVE THAT,\" she said. \"I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE PROBABLY HIDING UNDER SOMETHING, AREN'T YOU?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara lunged for the shelf, but she suddenly felt a strange sensation... as if the coat hanger was no longer supporting her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feel that, my pet?\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara did feel it. She was slipping off of the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting bigger--and very, very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just another of my tricks, you know,\" Ashley said. \"A Goddess has to have a lot of options. Shrinking people is fun, but what if I could also make you bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shelf suddenly gave way with a crash, and Sara fell to the ground. She was almost certainly her full height now, wedged between the two narrow walls of the closet... but she was growing larger still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I definitely heard that!\" Ashley lilted. \"Hiding in the closet, are you? Tell me, my pet: is it getting a little tight in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara struggled to reach the doorknob, but it was no use--her arms were wedged in too tightly, growing tighter still as her body expanded to fill the now-tiny closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a valiant effort, you know,\" Ashley said from outside the closet. \"But I'm much, much too powerful to fall for little ruses like that. It's honestly a lucky thing you weren't hiding under a cabinet, or you'd be crushed right now. Every bone in your body broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wood of the closet began to bend and strain as Sara continued to grow. Ashley continued to speak, her voice somehow growing louder, more confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the closet?\" Ashley said with a laugh. \"There must have been something in there, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closet suddenly began to rattle and shake a bit. Ashley's voice grew louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME WHAT'S INSIDE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Sara grew too large. The closet burst and splintered around her, scattering wood everywhere. The still-nude Sara fell backward out of the closet and onto a soft, yielding surface, the remnants of her clothes all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, she saw it next to her--the gun! It was only the size of one of her fingers, but it might work! She picked it up, rose to her feet, and shouted. \"ALL RIGHT, LET ME...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice trailed off, and she dropped the gun on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her--hundreds of feet tall--was a face framed by golden blonde hair, a pair of huge blue eyes staring down at Sara, inspecting her naked body. Sara had indeed outgrown the closet... but Ashley had shrunk both of them. Sara stood gaping up as she stood in Ashley's hand. She had lost. She was only half an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I TOLD YOU, MY PET,\" Ashley bellowed. \"I'M A GODDESS.\"</span></div></div>",

With every word she spoke, Sara shrank smaller and smaller, becoming a dot in her hand before becoming invisible. To Sara, it was as if she was receding into Ashley herself, becoming one with her. \"WHEN I ORIGINALLY CAME HERE, I INTENDED FOR YOU TO JOIN YOUR BOYFRIEND AS AN INHABITANT OF MY PERFECT BODY. HE'S LIVING ON MY LEFT NIPPLE RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara tried to call out. \"He's living on you?\" But her tiny voice seemed to be lost in a sudden motion that swept her downward, faster than any vehicle she'd ever been in before. Her shrinking was accelerating, and Ashley seemed to be moving her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, YES, DID I MENTION THAT?\" Ashley said. Her voice was more massive than the world itself, and it grew ever-larger with each second. \"THAT'S HOW I KNEW WHERE YOU LIVE, MY TINY LITTLE MICROBE. HE CAME TO MY DORM ROOM TO HAVE SEX WITH ME. AND HE MADE HIS WISH TO LIVE AS AN INHABITANT ON MY PERFECT BREAST FOREVER. I SHRANK HIM SO SMALL THAT HE BARELY EVEN EXISTS ANYMORE. HE'S A PART OF ME NOW. AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE HE WANTED ME... NOT YOU.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara wanted to drop to her knees and cry, but she found herself falling. She seemed to fall forever. Nothing looked like anything anymore--the whole world had become Ashley, who was now suddenly growing even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WANTED YOU TO LIVE WITH HIM, TO MATE AND POPULATE THE UNIVERSE OF MY BODY... BUT THEN YOU HAD TO GO AND DEFY MY WILL.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara finally touched ground, the smell of sweat overwhelming her. And still she shrank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AND SO YOU WILL SHRINK EVEN SMALLER THAN HIM. I NEED TO TEST THE FULL MEASURE OF MY POWER. AND I'M PRETTY SURE MY POWER IS LIMITLESS, MY LITTLE...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley paused. Sara was shrinking so quickly that she could see larger versions of herself before her very eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...WELL, THERE IS NO MEASURE TO DESCRIBE YOU NOW, IS THERE? YOU'RE NOTHING. YOU'RE PART OF ME. AND YOU WILL LIVE ON MY FOOT. AND YOU WILL WORSHIP ME... FOREVER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Sara realized that she had stopped shrinking. Nothing looked like anything anymore. Even the smell was gone; she had shrunk down so tiny that the odorous molecules were now the size of galaxies to her. All she could think to do was drop to her knees and stare, glass-eyed and blank. What could she even hope to do? No one would ever see her again. She could only pray that her new Goddess would keep her safe and well-fed... and show her mercy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rising to her feet, Ashley took a moment to look herself over in the mirror, twirling in a circle to admire her nearly nude body. Even after having rubbed one out with the microscopic Tom on her nipple, she still looked incredible, her perfect curves glistening with sweat. She'd never felt so turned on before in her life, having absolute control over someone like that, watching him become tinier and tinier before her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley smiled. Of course, she was used to control. She was unbelievably sexy, after all--tall, long-legged, curvaceous, utterly flawless from head to toe. Her parents had told her so many times to be humble and considerate of others, but what point was there in humility when she looked this amazing, when boys didn't even bother catcalling because they were so transfixed? She thought back to a party her sorority had held the year before, when she'd caught the eye of a gorgeous brunette and, with one kiss, had turned the girl off of men forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley had jokingly called it her superpower. Even straight women and gay men fantasized about her. And it turned her on to have that sort of control. It was why she could never grow Tom back to normal size. She <i>owned</i> him now, forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToweling herself off, Ashley knew what she had to do. Controlling one person at a time--man, woman, whatever--was too slow. She had always knew she was special--that once-in-a-generation flawless specimen. A goddess. And as many partners as she'd had, as many nights as she'd spent fooling around, the only thing that had ever truly gotten her off was having absolute control over Tom's size. And if she could have that power over <i>everyone on Earth</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at herself, cupping her hands on her perfect breasts. It was time to ascend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill only wearing her tiny cotton panties, Ashley stepped out into the empty hallway, then passed outside. A group of campus workers were gardening along the side of the parking lot, and they gawked as she stepped down the stairs. She kept her arms folded across her chest, letting all five of them--men and women alike--stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger,\" she whispered. And she began to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the gardeners didn't know what to think. Ashley finally moved her arms from her chest, flipping her hair back as she quickly grew past ten feet. By the time she crossed the parking lot, she was twenty feet tall, her cotton panties growing with her, staring down over her huge breasts at the gaping workers under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puny insects,\" she said, growing larger and larger before them. \"Bow before your Goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, something broke in the workers, and they began to run. Ashley huffed, growing past the fifty-foot mark, and put her hands on her hips. \"You're only making things harder for yourselves!\" she shouted. \"If you worship me, I will spare you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Ashley surpassed seventy feet, the workers had already scattered. No doubt the police would be here soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley turned back around to the dorms she'd just entered, and with a smirk she found that she'd already grown taller than the whole building. She poked at a glass window with her finger and was delighted to see the entire seventh-story wall collapse. Willing herself still larger, she rested her breasts on the roof and then grew until she could feel the structure buckling under the weight of her gigantic breasts. At last, the building gave way, and she fell forward with it, her incredible breasts crushing everything inside. And still she grew, bigger and bigger and bigger, until her breasts were larger even than the wreckage left by the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the sirens while she was standing up again, and as she turned around, Ashley realized just how much she'd grown--the police cars were no higher than her ankles! With an imperious smile, she lay down on her stomach, watching the tiny cops dart out of their cars and draw their guns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T MOVE!\" a cop near the front said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley grinned and blew--a swift puff of air that knocked the cop backward a good five feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you fully understand the situation here,\" she said. She willed herself to grow faster still until her already massive size doubled in just a few seconds, her legs and feet stretching into forests that now stood shorter than even her knees. \"I'm a Goddess and you're just little toys with little toy guns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see the fear in the cops' stances--many of them were shaking. Best of all, nearly all of them were staring right at her chest, her incomprehensible breasts that loomed larger than all of them. Somewhere in the group, she heard a gunshot, but she didn't even feel it. Not even a pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, who did that?\" she said with a chuckle. She let herself get a little bit bigger to once again show her power, but no one stepped forward. \"Imagine how that's going to look on the news, little bugs. A cop shooting a sexy girl outside of her dorm. I don't even have a weapon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cops watched, transfixed, as she rose onto all fours, still growing larger and larger, her pendulous breasts dangling over the group, her huge body blocking out the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I do have <i>these</i> weapons...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden hail of gunfire, but nothing could stop her. Ashley dropped back down to the ground, smothering the entire squad of cars with her breasts. She bounced up and down, rubbing her chest against the flattened steel, feeling the heat of a tiny engine explosion but still not even hurting from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, she rose to her full height, staring down at the carnage below. God, she was so damn big now, even the trees looked like tiny dandelions beneath her--she must have been a thousand feet tall. She could see for miles, into the nearby city, and beyond it to the ocean. She wondered what it was like for the pathetic bugs down below her, the tiny people who had never truly been her equals, who would now have to realize that they were mere playthings for their massive, unstoppable Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart was racing with anticipation. It was time to have some fun.</span></div></div>",

The city was built around the naval base, and they seemed to be wasting no time mobilizing. Ashley couldn't see them all through the crowded city, but if they were moving this quickly, they considered her a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" she sighed, rolling her eyes. Just as a show of intimidation, she willed herself to grow even bigger, stopping at around 2,500 feet--the device's ability to measure its target having been transferred to her. Her football field-length feet now stretched almost the whole way across the parking lot below her, and at her new height, she could see that the vehicles were now starting to enter the campus. They had about another mile to drive, but to Ashley, they were just a few feet away, practically under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood with her hands on her hips, willing herself to grow--a little slowly but fast enough to be seen. \"I'm speaking to the tiny, insignificant soldiers currently entering this campus,\" she said aloud, sure that she was being filmed from somewhere, her voice echoing for miles. \"I am Ashley, your Goddess, and whatever you're hoping to do here, it's not going to work. I was a fourth of this size a few minutes ago, and I didn't even feel it when I was shot. What are you expecting to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still the transport vehicles proceeded through the campus. As they made their way to the outskirts of the dorms, soldiers began to file out. Ashley rolled her eyes, staring down at them, making sure they could see her still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I don't want to hurt any of you insects,\" she said. \"How am I going to rule you if you're dead? All I want is for all of you to bow down and worship me. I'm clearly the most powerful being on the planet, so I don't think that's too much to ask. And if you don't believe me, watch this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley pointed to one of the empty transports, waving her finger in the air. To her delight, she saw it start to shrink. She could see the soldiers--each one a mere fraction of an inch tall--turn to face the shrinking vehicle, but from her perspective, it disappeared quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind doing that to all of you if that's what it takes,\" she said, folding her arms across her chest. \"And right now I'm--wow, three thousand feet tall. Fifteen minutes ago, I was just under six feet. I'm pretty sure my power is limitless, but do you <i>really</i> want to find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see some agitation in the soldiers' ranks. She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay down your guns,\" she said. \"Lay them down and bow down to me, and your Goddess will spare your lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with a grimace, she squatted down, glaring daggers down at the army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if even <i>one</i> of your bug-weapons goes off, you will feel your Goddess's wrath.\"</span></div></div>",

Oh, well... what goodies did send away this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a college junior, Lisa had been away from home for about three years. By now, she was pretty used to it, but apparently her mom wasn't; despite her protests, her mother insisted on constantly sending her money, home cooking, snacks, advice, and other helpful pieces of motherly love. Lisa didn't mind it during her freshman year, which was of course a pretty tumultuous time, but now it was starting to feel as though her mother had let empty nest syndrome get the better of her. She had tried to talk to her mother, to tell her that she was a big girl now and insisting that she stop sending away packages every week or so, yet her mother persisted in sending her more and more stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as long as she sent it...\" Lisa thought. A part of her actually liked receiving the gifts on a regular basis: her mom was a great cook, and being a flat broke college student, she wasn't inclined to refuse some extra cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, when she finally returned to her room and opened up the brown box, it contained nothing but a strange device and a note. \"Wha?\" she said, picking up the note and reading it, hoping to gather a clue as to why her mother sent her this. Sadly, the note didn't help much. It simply read \"Found this lying around in your room and figured it was yours. Love you! Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting aside the note, Lisa picked up the device and examined it. Amid the complex array of lights and circuits on the surface, she was able to make out two rather large blue buttons lying at the center of the strange machine. One was marked with a white plus sign, the other with a white minus sign. Protruding from the device's black body was what appeared a small cannon of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez. This defintely isn't mine. How the hell did it get in my room, though?\" she wondered, looking at it from different angles, as though doing so would give her a better idea of just what the heck it was. \"How does this thing work, what does it do?

When the light went away and she could see again, she gasped at the fact that everything in her room was giant!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut everything in her room wasnt giant; she was small.\"Oh no, I shrunk myself!!!\" she exclaimed.Realizing that the machine was the cause of her sudden size reduction, she went over to where it had fell on the floor by her bed and examined it more closely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came to the conclusion that the small cannon was the aimer of the device. She also figured the munus button shrinks whatever it was aimed at, as thats what she pressed. Therefore, she concluded, the button with the plus must make things bigger. \"I have to use the plus button on myself and get back to normal,\" she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was giong to be a problem, Lisa realized. The buttons were on top of the remote-sized device, and, comparing herself to the objects around her, Lisa guessed she was maybe an inch tall; nowhere near big enough to reach the buttons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around in a frantic, she had an idea. Her shoes were sitting next to the machine where she took them off before opening the package, so they were about the same size. She managed to climb up one of the laces to the top of the shoe, and was able to clear the jump to the top of the size-machine. She approached the enlarging button, which was as big as her. She was going to have to put all her weight into it, which was not a lot, as she was a cute, petite girl when she wasnt ant size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit her; even if she was able to get the button to move, the ray wouldnt be pointing at her and would be no good. She was stuck tiny unless she could get some help. Maybe...    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She watched as the doorknob--to her hundreds of feet in the air--turned, and the incredible door pushed open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly two people would come into Lisa's room without knocking. One was Danica, her roommate, because it was her room as well. The other was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lis! Just poppin' in to say hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other was Julie, her sorority sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa couldn't help but stare up at the massive girl who walked in her dorm room door. Julie was normally about five-six, just a little bit taller than her petite friend, with nice curves and a sweet face. The giant who now walked into her room was hundreds of feet tall, her tennis shoes the size of small warehouses. Towering legs disappeared into a crimped white skirt, and her pink blazer bulged with breasts that seemed large enough to affect the tides. When Julie moved a hand to brush some of her blonde hair out of her face, it was as if the skies themselves were moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was transfixed. With every step Julie took, her entire world shook. Julie had always been nothing but Lisa's kind of dopey friend, a little air-headed but always nice. Now, she looked like a massive, sexy Godzilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa? Are you in here, hon? I thought we could go grab something to eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friend's booming voice snapped Lisa out of her reverie. She hopped up and down on the device, waving her hands in the air. \"JULIE! JULIE, IT'S ME!\" she screamed at the top of her lungs. The mammoth Julie stepped right near her, affording Lisa an incredible, IMAX-sized view of her white thong underwear. She hopped and screamed her tiny little heart out, desperate to be heard...</span></div></div>",

She drops down on all fours, moving in close to the device and her tiny friend. \"Lis, is that you? Oh my God, you're so <i>little</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm shrunk!\" Lisa yells, relieved that her friend is close. \"This machine did it!

You're all teeny-tiny and you're helpless in here and your room is locked and oh my God I've got to get you somewhere safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUST PUSH THE BUTTON!\" Lisa yells. \"PUSH THE--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's too late; Julie has already gently rolled the girl into her hand. Little Lisa rolls to the center, totally disoriented as her new perch suddenly rises hundreds of feet in the air at incredible speed. She orients herself just in time to find Julie looking around again, the device in her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, hon, but I've got to get you somewhere safe!\" she cries. \"I don't have my purse with me, so I guess this'll have to do! I'll be careful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa tries to protest, but the motion of Julie's hand is too disorienting. Before she even knows what's coming, Lisa feels the hand tipping over, and the tiny girl screams as she goes sliding downward, out of the hand, and into...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Julie says. \"It'll have to do for now! I have to hide you and protect you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gasps. She's taken aback by her location. \"JULIE, I'M IN YOUR DAMN--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the tiny girl can't finish before Julie shoves her down further, thrusting her into the depths of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Lisa tries to struggle, clawing at the massive mounds of flesh in an effort to free herself. Of course, that doesn't work; she's simply too small, and Julie's breasts--impressive at normal size--are now the size of small hills. So instead, she simply settles back, falling into the warmth and softness of her good friend's chest. Lisa never dared tell a soul, but she had always had a bit of a crush on Julie, admiring her lovely body when the two tried on clothes or went swimming. So rather than fight further, she instead opts to enjoy the ride, burying herself deep in the sensual pillows of the woman she'd secretly loved, knowing full well she'd never have such an opportunity again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, however, the ride was over, and tiny Lisa felt a hand scoop her out.

So I grabbed that think next to you 'cause it, like, looked important, and I decided to take you hear because it's totally safe!\" With a nervous grin, Julie sets the tiny Lisa down on the carpeted floor, the normally thin fibers curling around Lisa's ankles. She stays hunched over, smiling down at her friend. \"You sure are tiny, though! How did that happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shrugs. \"IT'S THAT MACHINE!\" she shouts. \"IT CAN MAKE PEOPLE SMALLER! I HIT THE MINUS BUTTON AND IT MADE ME LITTLE LIKE THIS! I BET IF WE--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, okay, good!\" Julie says. \"So if we hit the minus button again, that should reverse it, right?\" She aims the device down at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!

WHAT ARE YOU--\" Lisa shrieks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing!\" Julie shouts as she presses the minus button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flash of white light that surrounds Lisa feels terrifyingly familiar. The carpet fibers that were curled around her ankles suddenly begin growing upward like mammoth plants, swallowing her whole. She screams at the top of her lungs, but it seems more pointless than ever. When the light fades, she opens her eyes to find carpet fibers the size of trees stretching overhead. The ridged plastic surface beneath the carpet looks to her like a thatching of thick wooden planks. Crumbs and dust specks that would have otherwise been invisible to her tower nearby like boulders. And overhead, filling the sky beyond the carpet fibers, is the face of her best friend. Lisa gasps at the sight--Julie is larger than any mountain she has ever seen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\" Julie screams, her booming voice forcing the minuscule Lisa to cover her ears. \"LISA! LISA, ARE YOU OKAY, HON? OH MY GOD, I THINK I SHRANK HER OUT OF EXISTENCE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here!\" Lisa shouts back, waving her arms in the air. \"Julie, I'm right in front of you!

The insect is, to her horror, about the size of a large van. While Julie could <i>probably</i> see her, how could she pick her out? She was nothing more than a speck now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lisa could start to cry, she steeled herself. She could stay tiny on the floor forever... or she could do something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sprinting start, Lisa leaped onto one of the carpet fibers, marveling for just a moment at how the fiber barely moved at the touch of her tiny body. Luckily, at her size, the strand was full of crevices where she could put her hands and feet--weighing practically nothing at all, she felt like she was floating to the top. Once above the carpet, she jumped up and down on the fiber, waving her arms in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JULIE!\" she screamed. \"JULIE, I'M DOWN HERE! CAN'T YOU SEE ME?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie was, indeed, looking right at her, but to Julie's warehouse-sized eye, the tiny Lisa didn't even register. No, she'd have to do something else instead. Luckily, at that moment, something else swung by, and with a quick leap, Lisa grabbed hold of a strand of Julie's blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit, this was a bad idea, this was a bad idea,\" Lisa muttered, clinging to the hair for dear life as Julie flung her head back and forth, sending her hair flying to and fro. To Julie, it was a simple head movement, but with every turn, Lisa was flung back and forth like a swing the size of a small mountain. Every time she had a moment to rest, Lisa marveled at the sheer scale of her friend--even her hair, which was about eight inches long, stretched for hundreds of feet above her. Even her barest movements felt like huge earthquakes. Julie was nothing less than a force of nature at this size, and she was also Lisa's only hope for survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Julie rose to her full height. It seemed that she was moving toward her desk, looking for something. Lisa ambled quickly up the strand of hair, her path helped by microscopic imperfections that Julie couldn't possibly see and would <i>not</i> have been happy to know about. She had to get Julie's attention, but how? There seemed to be two options...</span></div></div>",

Julie might blink her eye, or she might simply not see the nearly invisible woman clinging to a hair in front of her, or any number of involuntary things might go wrong. Inside Julie's ear, though, she could take her time, get her attention, and work her way around. Either way was a long shot, but the ear seemed a little bit safer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, as Julie swung her head to the right, the strand of hair on which Lisa was clinging flung towards the ear. When the hair settled, Lisa saw an enormous golden surface--dozens of feet long--just beneath her. It was Julie's auricle ring, a shiny path that would lead right to the inside of her ear! With a sigh, Lisa made the leap, landing on the ring with scarcely any force at all. Once again, Lisa was in awe at how little she seemed to weigh; the ring didn't move at all at her weight, and even as she stood up on it, she found it as wide as a huge highway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lisa could even take a single step, though, Julie moved her head again, and all at once, the ground beneath Lisa's feet began to tilt! The tiny girl shrieked in terror as she slid down the ring, flying into the air. Lisa was on the verge of tears, realizing how stupid she was to think she could interact with the universe at all at her speck-like size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all at once, she landed, sliding further and further along a slope surface. She screamed again, watching the gargantuan, skyscraper-sized pink wall before her as she slid down the opposite side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached the bottom, it dawned on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had landed in Julie's ear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this size and in this location, the movement of Julie's head wasn't even noticeable; it was on too massive a scale for the tiny Lisa to notice. Slowly and carefully, she walked deeper into the ear canal, past disgusting hills of earwax that loomed almost to her size, into the fleshy tunnel that stretched for hundreds of feet above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to be careful, though. If Julie felt her before she heard her, she might scratch her ear, and Lisa could easily be crushed even by the width of her fingernail. Or cut in half. Lisa shuddered and paused, deciding she'd better not venture further after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath. Then, she realized that she'd better pitch her voice deeper; at her tiny size, her voice might be too high-pitched for Julie to even hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JULIE!\" she called. Her voice echoed through the ear canal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a pause in the movement. <b>\"LISA?\"</b> a voice called back, so loud that Lisa had to cover her ears. <b>\"LISA, I HEAR YOU, HON. WHERE ARE YOU?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T MOVE!\" Lisa yelled back. \"I'M INSIDE YOUR EAR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"HOW DID YOU GET IN THERE?\"</b> Julie boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO TIME TO EXPLAIN!\" Lisa called. She coughed--pitching her voice this low was hurting her throat. \"PUT YOUR FINGERNAIL NEXT TO YOUR LEFT EAR, JUST TOUCHING THE TOP OF YOUR EAR LOBE. I'M GOING TO CLIMB ONTO IT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"OH GOD,\"</b> Julie bellowed. <b>\"JUST... BE CAREFUL, OKAY? I DON'T WANT TO HURT MY ITTY-BITTY FRIEND!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa turned around and saw the fingernail approaching, a hundred feet wide or more. Even the merest tap of the ear caused a ripple that caused the fleshy landscape to shift, and tiny tremors in Julie's movement that would have been invisible at normal size now looked like little earthquakes. Carefully, Lisa maneuvered her way down the ear, then climbed onto the polished red nail. At her tiny size, the streaks from Julie's nail polish were as wide as her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY!\" Lisa yelled back into the ear, as loud and as deep as she could. \"SLOWLY MOVE ME TOWARDS YOUR FACE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"HANG ON...\"</b> Julie said. Lisa did so, digging her hands into the otherwise microscopic imperfections in the polish, holding on tight. Julie was moving her hand slowly to her, but to Lisa, the nail soared through the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in the distance, it suddenly appeared. White and soaking wet at first, with a layer of moisture terrifyingly visible. Then an enormous field of blue and black, with rods and cones almost the size of Lisa's hand. Cells. Lisa was so small that she could see the cells in Julie's eye. As Lisa stood up, a gargantuan pink wall suddenly collapsed from the sky, and dark strands of thick rope descended with them--a simple blink that reshaped an entire world. Lisa was caught off balance but stood up again, holding her hand up meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...hi,\" she said softly. She don't know why she bothered. Julie was beyond enormous. She was incomprehensible, a goddess even. How could she hope to be seen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~*~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie squinted. She knew she had heard the voice, and she'd done just what it said. Had Lisa fallen off? Would she have to find her friend in the carpet again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all at once, she saw movement. A little flash of color against her nail, like a speck of dust. She moved the nail closer still, and she saw that the speck was waving to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Lisa. She was no bigger than a grain of salt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" she whispered, suddenly acutely aware of how loud she had been talking. \"Holy shit, hon. We've got to get you big again.\"</span></div></div>",

A white flash of light overcame her, and a tingling sensation filled her body. At first, it seemed like nothing was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she knew how it felt to be in the device's power. How could she be staying the same size?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>OH GOD!</b>\" Julie suddenly shouted. \"<b>SOMETHING'S WRONG! THE MACHINE IS SHRINKING! LET ME TRY AGAIN!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, all at once, Lisa knew exactly what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JULIE! NO!\" she screamed, her voice nearly growing hoarse. \"DON'T PUSH IT--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white flash of light came once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie had pushed it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was growing--there was no doubt about that. And the double-dose of the device would no doubt return her to her full size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up with horror, though, Lisa could see that she was right. The ceiling was approaching quickly. Julie was panicking. But from Lisa's perspective, the vast fingernail on which she stood wasn't getting any smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie had not just enlarged Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had blasted herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sighed, sitting down on the fingernail, watching as massive chunks of plaster and brick rained down around her, relieved to find that Julie seemed to be shielding her from the debris. \"Welp,\" she said to no one in particular. \"Good job, Jules. Nice work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~*~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill ran down Julie's spine as she fired the device. Lisa wasn't getting any bigger; in fact, the device itself was getting smaller! Was it the + button that did it? What was happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God!\" she shouted. \"Something's wrong! The machine is shrinking! Let me try again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill staring down the end of the device, Julie fired again, her thumb enveloping the button. The white flash happened and... nothing. The knot in her stomach tightened. She could suddenly feel a breeze around her, as if she was being launched upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she hit the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the--\" she started to say. The room was getting smaller, too! Everything around her was shrinking! She hunched over to try to stay in the room, but everything seemed to be closing in around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen... she realized what she'd done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>shit</i>,\" she muttered. \"We're <i>both</i> getting bigger, aren't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crunch of her head bursting through the ceiling gave her answer for her. As her eyes rose to the second floor, she saw two other students watching with terror, screaming their heads off as the gigantic Julie burst through their floor, her growth beginning to accelerate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Julie called. \"You might want to get out of--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was already bursting through to the third floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LISA!\" she screamed, and she moved her right hand over her left, covering her still-tiny friend up. Had Lisa been blasted, too? Was she getting bigger with her? Where could she put her? What if she put her down and then crushed her in her seemingly unstoppable growth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo many thoughts raced through Julie's mind before she burst through the building from all sides, the walls and ceilings crumbling around her. She was outside now, and she could see crowds beneath her, staring up at her with total awe, watching her rise and rise to the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her hand still quivering, she moved her left hand to her eye. There, still speck-sized to her, was Lisa, thankfully growing with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I need help,\" she said with a sigh. \"You're smarter than me, Lis. Help me.\" And she moved her fingernail to her ear again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~*~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're damn right I'm smarter than you, you enormous bimbo...\" Lisa muttered, holding on tightly as the fingernail moved. As she crossed from the fingernail to Julie's ear, she was for the first time aware of how high in the air she was, though at her still-dwindled size it was hard to gauge. What was important, however, was that she was rising very, very quickly. She was growing very, very quickly. Just how big was she going to get now? How big was <i>Julie</i> going to get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M SORRY, LIS,\" Julie boomed as Lisa climbed into the ear once more. \"I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY THOUGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa rolled her eyes. \"I'M okay? What about everyone in that building? Why didn't you put me down before growing me back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M SORRY, OKAY?\" Julie shouted. \"I'M NOT USED TO MAGIC SHRINK RAYS OR WHATEVER! I'M A RELIGION MAJOR, FOR GOD'S SAKE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Lisa sat down in the ear. Outside, she could see blue skies all around--Julie had obviously outgrown all of the nearby buildings. \"Well, there's not a lot we can do except hope somebody finds the device, I guess. Or if there's another one, maybe that'll help.\" Lisa didn't dare say what she was thinking: that Julie had destroyed their entire dorm building, that there likely wouldn't be any survivors, that the remote was no doubt buried in the debris of the building. Probably destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so lost in these dark thoughts that Julie's next question threw her for a loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO HOW BIG DO YOU THINK I'M GOING TO GET?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa paused. She hadn't even pondered the question yet. How could she know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're growing at the same rate,\" Lisa said. \"So that must mean that rate is consistent. I'd estimate I was about an inch tall when the machine shrank me, which would've been 1/62 of my original height. How tall were you, Julie, before...\" She trailed off, looking outside. Clouds were zipping past. \"...before all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SIX FEET,\" Julie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa crunched the numbers in her head. She had always been a whiz at math. \"Six times sixty-two... times sixty two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. <i>Oh God,</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Divided by... about five thousand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~*~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie could hardly believe what she was hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour miles tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't even get her head around it. Four miles! Bigger than any building on Earth! Bigger than almost every <i>mountain</i> on Earth! Lisa was still talking, still rattling off numbers, but even though Julie could hear the terror in her voice, she couldn't make out the words any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd had her eyes closed for some time--she couldn't bear to watch the world shrink around her--but for the first time in a few minutes, she opened them, trying to find something to compare herself to. The world around her was blue and bright, skies surrounding her from all sides, but the clouds seemed... different. Mostly absent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she looked down. And found the clouds. They were at her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of them in the distance were taller than her, and a few wispy ones seemed higher, but for the most part, they were low. And far, far down below her was the town she called home, growing further and further away from her. She felt like she was looking out the window of an airplane, and she remembered feeling like all of the little people had looked like ants when she'd gone up before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped. They <i>were</i> ants now. She had stopped growing, and their huge cities, their mammoth highways, their vast farms stretched out before her like a map. Picking out individual people was impossible. She could see a football stadium near her right foot--it was only about an inch long. Skyscrapers that had towered over her before now couldn't reach the tops of her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the midst of it all, the people. There must have been thousands of them staring up at her now, craning their necks to see past the enormous feet that no doubt covered her entire college campus. Many of them were probably already dead, crushed by her unstoppable growth. She couldn't even hope to move without hurting <i>something</i>--there was no doubt about that--but the remote was probably buried somewhere beneath her huge feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the fearful, the awed, the star-struck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie? Julie, you okay?\" she heard a tiny voice in her ear call out. She was so lost in thought that she forgot that she'd taken one of the tiny humans with her: her best friend and sorority sister, Lisa. If nothing else, she could keep her safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as for everyone else...</span></div></div>",

Maybe four and a half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S REALLY, REALLY BIG, LIS.\" Julie was bending over a bit, trying to see past her chest to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" the voice answered. \"We've got to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO IF I'M THIS BIG,\" Julie interrupted. She was squatting down a bit now. \"EVERYONE PRETTY MUCH HAS TO BE LOOKING AT ME, RIGHT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear Lisa sigh. \"Jules, every time you squat down like that, the pressure changes and I feel like my ears are going to pop out. Could you please hold still?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Julie giggled. \"JUST BY BENDING OVER?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just by bending over,\" Lisa repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed again. The feeling of power she had even in her barest movements was making her giddy. \"WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE THINKING DOWN THERE, LIS? ALL THE TINY PEOPLE LIKE YOU. THE ONES AT MY FEET.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~*~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Julie's ear, Lisa sighed, shaking her head. What was all of this all of a sudden? She felt dizzy, the sudden changes in height of her gargantuan companion doing a number on her equilibrium, but she had to talk Julie through all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if they're like me, they're pretty scared,\" she answered honestly. \"I mean, you've looked like this to me for a little while now, and I was pretty terrified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another rush of air--Julie was squatting down again, and Lisa's ears felt like they were going to explode. She screamed from the pain, and the sudden jerk of Julie's mammoth head indicated that she heard her. She waited to see if her friend would express even the slightest concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RIGHT, BUT THAT WASN'T ALL, WAS IT?\" Julie said. \"IT WAS... KIND OF NICE FOR YOU, WASN'T IT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shuddered. Where could this be going? \"Jules, I saw an ant that was the size of a minivan. I've never been so scared in my--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rush happened again. Julie was standing up now, faster than she had before, and this time the change was too much. Lisa collapsed, falling unconscious inside of her friend's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~*~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie, meanwhile, had risen to her full height again, staring down at the ground below her. Goosebumps rose on her flesh. \"I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE IN MY BOOBS,\" Julie continued, fidgeting with the buttons on her blouse. \"IT WAS KIND OF SCARY, BUT ADMIT IT: I'M PRETTY SEXY, LIS.\" With a smile, she began slowly unbuttoning her blouse, bending over. \"I, LIKE, DON'T WANT TO SOUND STUCK-UP, BUT I KNOW I'M REALLY HOT. I SEE THE WAY GUYS LOOK AT ME. DO YOU THINK THEY'RE LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT RIGHT NOW?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, waiting for an answer. When none came, she laughed, pulling her arms through her blouse and throwing it over her shoulder. \"OH, DON'T GET SHY ON ME, GIRLFRIEND. IT'S OKAY. I SAW THAT SMILE ON YOUR FACE WHEN I PULLED YOU OUT. I DON'T MIND. WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all at once, Julie dropped down to all fours, letting her massive breasts dangle above the crowds below. She lowered her face to the ground, letting it hover over downtown, delighting in the way even her hairs dwarfed the finger-length skyscrapers below her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DO I MAKE YOU HAPPY, MY LITTLE TINY PEOPLE?\" she cooed. She saw her hot breath begin to bend and rock the skyscrapers, which made her laugh even more. She had so much power over these little people that even her breath could rock the foundations of their greatest buildings. \"HAVE YOU EVER SEEN BOOBS THIS BIG?\" She rose to her knees, smiling, stretching her arms high into the sky. She turned around, looking towards her back. \"ARE YOU LOOKING UP MY SKIRT, LITTLE BUG-PEOPLE? DO YOU LIKE THAT?\" She rose higher, still on her knees, wiggling her backside all the while. She looked down at the ground, at the crowds of people beneath her, the little specks of dust between the finger-sized buildings... and she was pleased to see that many of them had stopped. She couldn't imagine what it was like, their little necks craning up to look at the massive bombshell who towered above them all. She ruled them, dominated them, demanded every iota of their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO AHEAD AND STARE, ITTY-BITTY PEOPLE,\" she sighed. With a flick of her fingers, she unclasped her bra, then eased it down from her enormous breasts. She put her hands behind her head and wiggled, shaking them for the minuscule people below. \"YOU'LL NEVER GET A SHOW LIKE THIS AGAIN.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Julie is beyond terrified as she frantically ran her nails through the carpet, trying to find Lisa. What if she'd killed her friend? What if Lisa had shrunk down so small that she just stopped existing? What if she got attacked by a spider? Or another bug? Or just fell through the cracks in the floor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still has the device, and she's sure now that the button with the plus sign makes things bigger. But what can she do? How can she aim the device at someone so small? What if she misses and hits an ant? Would there be huge, gross ants wandering around in her room?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, I'm sorry!\" she yells. \"But if I can't see you, then I can't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she stops, her eyes beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, little Lisa! I'm going to come save you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie grabs a lipstick container from her desk and, very carefully, dabs a bit of red onto the spot where Lisa shrank away. The frame of reference would certainly help; otherwise, she'd have to comb all through the carpet. Then, with a smile, she stands over the spot, legs spread, careful not to step on the spot where her tiny friend became tragically tinier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing!\" she calls, aims the device at herself, and presses the minus button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flash of light overwhelms her now, and when it subsides, her room is massive, her bed and cabinets now towering hills in the distance. Beneath her, the spot of red lipstick curls up around her feet, and sure enough, she hears screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie, what the hell are you doing?\" the voice calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can hear it clearly now, and Julie reaches her hand into the carpet and scoops up her best friend. Lisa stands in Julie's hand, arms akimbo, glaring daggers at her comparatively huge friend from bloodshot, tear-stained eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saved you!\" Julie says, grinning. \"Ta-daaaaaaaaaaaa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure did,\" Lisa grumbles. \"I sure feel saved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are!\" Julie agrees. \"And now to bring us back to normal size! All I've got to do is press the button on this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device isn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it?\" Julie says. \"Oh, no, did I drop it in the carpet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa points behind her. \"You sure did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie turns around slowly, looking up. There, stretching ten feet in the air, the size of a small house, is the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...it doesn't shrink with you,\" Julie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it shrank with you, don't you think I would've made myself big again?\" Lisa asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God,\" Julie mumbles. She sits down in the carpet, gently placing the tiny Lisa on top of one of the strands. \"I screwed everything up! I'm such an idiot! And now we're both going to be teeny-tiny bugs forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, sitting on the carpet, the size of a nickel, Julie does the only thing she can think to do. She curls her legs up against her, presses her face to her knees, and bawls her eyes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Lisa, the shock of being shrunk so tiny has passed a bit. She looks at the massive silver object--over a thousand feet tall--in the distance, knowing it to be the remote. She looks around the room, knowing that she's now so small that her tiny eyes can't even take it all in. She looks down at the single carpet fiber at her feet, and she hops once, watching with sadness as her tiny mass doesn't even cause it to move. She would worry about falling, but she knows that she weighs next to nothing; if she fell, there would be no way she would hurt herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, feeling a little bit brave, Lisa hops from one carpet fiber to another until at last she lands on Julie's skirt. The weave of the fabric provides the perfect handholds for the tiny girl to climb, and she's shocked at how little effort it takes; there's almost no weight for her to lift, so she practically floats up the side of the skirt. At last, she finds herself at Julie's huge leg, which she pats gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie stops crying for a moment to look down at her tiny friend, her hand on Julie's leg. Lisa smiles up at her, warmly, affectionately, not a hint of malice for what Julie accidentally did to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Lisa says, \"we're both really, really small. But I'm a lot smaller than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm--I'm sorry...\" Julie sputters, but Lisa's warm touch tells her that the tiny girl isn't mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I mean is that you need to keep me safe,\" Lisa says. \"And there's only one place you could put me that would make me feel safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looks down at Lisa, confused for a moment. However, the slight blush on her friend's face says it all. With a smile, Julie scoops Lisa up in her hand, stopping for a moment to give her friend a tiny kiss on the head. Then, as carefully as possible, Julie deposits Lisa safely into the warm confines of her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just trying to get at my boobs again, aren't you?\" Julie says with a small cackle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to get away from them at this size,\" Lisa says with a sigh, enjoying the soft warmth surrounding her again. \"But thank you.\"</span></div></div>",

Morgan will help us, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Julie isn't so sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her normal scale, Morgan is a tall, busty girl with pale white skin and raven black hair, her dark eyeshadow and purple lipstick providing the classic \"goth\" look. To tiny Julie, though, she is a monster of black leather and steel. Her high-heeled boots tower over the tiny girls, rising to her huge ankles before giving way to fishnet stockings, a tiny black skirt, and a black bustier that accentuates her incredible cleavage. With a sigh, she pulls her backpack off and throws it on the floor, and Julie and Lisa watch with horror as the gigantic pack tumbles out of the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit!\" Lisa screams. \"RUN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie doesn't need to be told twice; she stumbles through the thick carpet as the backpack rolls toward her, sliding forward like an avalanche of cloth. The backpack tumbles forward, shaking the ground with earthquake force and knocking the tiny Julie onto her stomach. Poor Lisa holds on tight as her perch tumbles to the ground, barely avoiding being squished flat by Lisa's breasts as her friend catches herself. Finally, Julie looks up to find that the backpack has (fortunately) stopped, and Morgan is now standing overhead, looking around her room.</span></div></div>",

I was just kidding around\". \"Sure\", Morgan said with a smirk. \"No hard feelings\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie let out a sigh of relief. \"See Lisa\", she said to the even tinier girl clutching her shirt, \"this is going to work out\". Julie looks back up at her colossal roommate. \"So as you can see Morgan, I have a bit of a problem. I accidentally shrunk myself with that gun lying over there. My friend Lisa's shrunk even smaller than me. You probably can't see her\". \"Uh huh\", Morgan said, eyeing the gun carefully and picking it up. \"So do you think you can help us out? You just need to hit the plus sign there and we can get back to normal\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan stared at her with an evil little smile. \"Gee Julie, I'd love to. I really would. Unfortunately though I'm- how did you put it?- a mean-spirited weirdo? Guess that sucks for you and your little friend now, doesn't it? Bye, bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie and Lisa's hearts sank as Morgan raised her right boot high in the air. It looked so enormous from where the girls were that it blotted out the entire sky. Julie started to let out a desperate plea. \"Morgan, wai-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLAT! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan brought her boot down with enormous force reducing Julie and Lisa to a small red paste on the carpet. She grinded her boot back and forth for a bit. Then she wiped the small girl's remains off her boot with a tissue and threw them in the trash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was satisfying\", Morgan said. Julie had been a garbage roommate and now she was only garbage. She didn't know the other girl she had killed that well but two less sorority girls was never a bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer roommate now disposed of, Morgan looked at the gun in her hand. \"Does this really work?\" Morgan pushed the minus button and fired it at Julie's desk.

For Lisa, this is almost unbearable, and she tightens her grip on Julie's shirt as she's carried for what seems to her like miles over the course of just a few seconds. Julie struggles and wiggles, but Morgan's thumb and index finger are enough to hold the tiny girl aloft as Morgan carries her to her desk. Putting the device down for a second, Morgan drops Julie from her fingers into her other hand, not bothering to worry about the tiny girl's comfort or safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie, all at once, realizes what Lisa must have realized before: that being this small can be terrifying. And while Lisa was faced with a gigantic version of her best friend and sorority sister, Julie finds herself face-to-enormous-face with her roommate, who has hated and resented her from the moment the two had met. Now, her boulder-sized eyes glare down at the tiny Julie, practically drinking in the sight of her, watching as Julie stumbles backward on her rear end in Morgan's palm before being met with the girl's entrapping fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Lisa, the feeling is far, far worse. Morgan is everything now--the earth, the sky, the entire universe. Her mouth is like an enormous, wet cavern, and even a simple act like running her tongue across her lips feels like a blue whale breaching in the sea. She can only duck down low in Julie's shirt, hiding as best she can, hoping that this immeasurable monster can't see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" Morgan booms, her hot, minty breath blowing the two girls with hurricane force. \"What was that you were saying about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie stammers, trying to stand up. \"Well, I was just joking around a little, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BULLSHIT,\" Morgan bellows, and the force of her voice is enough to knock Julie back down. \"Don't act like you've ever liked me, Julie. I know exactly how it is with you sorority girls and the way you like to look down your noses on the <i>freaks</i>. Well, look who's looking down now, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" Julie pleads. \"I'm really sorry, Morgan! Please just--just use the machine to make us big again, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us?\" Morgan interrupts, her eyes growing wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie stops dead in her tracks. She had been hoping to keep Lisa's presence a secret, to give her tiny friend even the merest chance of escape, but now, it's too late. With a sniff, she reaches into her shirt and plucks out the incredibly tiny Lisa, holding her friend up in the air for Morgan to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan moves in close, closing one eye to see better. Lisa cowers in her friend's hand, too terrified to look up, but she knows that the enormous eye of Morgan is peering down at her, looking her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Morgan whispers, but even her breath in that whisper is enough to almost blow the nearly invisible Lisa off of Julie's outstretched palms. \"So she must have been shrunk twice then, huh? I bet you did it, didn't you, you bubble-headed bimbo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie nods, lowering her head in shame. She runs her pinky finger over her tiny friend's hair, being careful to be as gentle as possible, and even in this small motion she can feel Lisa quivering with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are nice to her, Julie,\" Morgan says flatly, moving her hand back again. \"Even though you've made her a little grain of sand. I don't know who you are, little girl. You're nothing but a speck to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slow, evil smile suddenly crosses Morgan's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I must look like a giant to you.\"</span></div></div>",

That sounds like a good idea, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked up at her, trying to fight back tears. \"Morgan, please... I'm sorry... just... just make us big again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SORRY?\" Morgan roared, and the force of her shout nearly knocked Julie backward. Lisa put her hands over her ears as Morgan continued. \"How DARE you try to order me around, you pathetic little bug! You're NOTHING before me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Morgan turned her hand upside-down. The simple movement to her felt like the entire world turning over to Julie, and she screamed as she slid from the open palm through the air, wind rushing around her. Lisa was so terrified that she couldn't even open her eyes, but Julie saw every bit of it, watching as Morgan bent down before her, delighting in her plummet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie landed in the carpet below, remarkably unhurt thanks to her tiny size but with the wind knocked out of her. \"Are--are you okay?\" she managed to croak before coughing up a lung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa pried herself free of Julie's shirt, nearly falling over at her coughing fit. She was dazed and dizzy, but she was so small that she had no real mass to strike the ground. \"I'm fine, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH GOD!\" Julie screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark shadow covered the girls, blocking out the light above them--Morgan's shoe. The girls screamed, the massive ceiling of leather hovering overhead. When at last it slammed down, it missed Julie by mere inches--even to her. High above, still bent over, Morgan sneered down at the tiny girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry, bugs, I'm not going to let your little bodies tarnish my beautiful boots,\" she said. \"So long as you stay still, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie nodded and froze in place, staring up the length of Morgan's black leather boot, up the black ropes of her fishnet stockings. Lisa couldn't even take it in at all. The boot alone was the size of a mountain to her, and when Morgan bent over and began to unlace it, it was like the earth itself was being remade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Morgan slid her foot from the boot, wiggling her toes as she did. Julie watched, wide-eyed, as she slid her bare foot downward, her big toe directly in front of her. Lisa could only watch in horror as she realized that the grooves of Morgan's toe print were even taller than she was, but even to Julie, the toe was massive--larger than she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not going to let my boot crush you,\" Morgan said with a smile. \"I want to <i>feel</i> you die, Julie. I want to press my skin against you as every bone in your body breaks. I want to feel your body snap and crackle. I want to feel the warm gore ooze out of you, and then I want to grind the disgusting little paste that used to be Julie Parks into the carpet. And I want to do it all with my <i>big toe</i> so that you understand how absolutely fucking PATHETIC you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie begins to sob in heaves. She was really going to do it. This was no joke--Morgan was prepared to utterly end her life now. Was there truly no hope?</span></div></div>",

Maybe we could've done some science projects, pulled some pranks, made me into an omnipotent goddess towering over the entire world, who knows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Morgan reaches for the device, aiming it at the tiny Julie. Julie tries to run away, but Morgan's fingers stop her, keeping her safely contained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you couldn't keep your big mouth shut, could you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa, seeing the device aimed at her once again, suddenly flies into a panic. Fearing the consequences of being shrunk even smaller, she pulls herself out of Julie's shirt and takes a flying leap, knowing full well that her tiny weight will prevent her from being hurt. Julie tries to catch her--not knowing what her friend does--but before she can't, the beam strikes her, the white light enveloping her, the now-familiar sensation of falling overwhelming her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lisa lands, Julie stops shrinking, and the two girls find themselves about a hundred feet apart, roughly the same size, standing in the vast palm of Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evil laugh of the goth giantess echoes in the girls' ears as they run towards each other, sharing an embrace, crying into each other's shoulders. \"I'm sorry!\" Julie bawls. \"I'm so, so, so sorry! This is all my fault! If I wasn't such a dummy then--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay...\" Lisa whispers, running her hand through her friend's hair. \"It's okay. We'll get through this. I know we can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AWWWWWWWWWWW, ISN'T THAT PRECIOUS?\" a rumbling voice calls from seemingly everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls both snap to attention, staring upward, the eye of Morgan stretching out above them like a moon. The dust mite-sized sorority sisters clutch each other tightly, neither knowing what to expect, only knowing that they are now at the mercy of a cruel girl who was, not twenty minutes ago, their same size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TWO BEST FRIENDS, REUNITED!\" Morgan laughs. \"ITTY-BITTY BESTIES, REDUCED TO NOTHING BEFORE THE MIGHT OF THE GODDESS MORGAN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer laughter echoes again, and the girls shiver with terror.

With a huge grin, she holds the device aloft, aiming it into the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM A GODDESS, YOU KNOW,\" she booms. \"I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. I'M JUST NOW TAKING ON MY TRUE FORM. AND IF YOU ASK ME, A GODDESS'S WORSHIPERS SHOULD BE MUCH, MUCH SMALLER THAN THIS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa and Julie stare up in shock, the barrel of the device stretching overhead like a pipe the size of a city. They hold each other close, finding small comfort in each others' arms, until Julie--remembering how her friend was able to survive the long fall--gets an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUMP!\" she screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the two tiny girls make for the edge of Morgan's palm, a bright flash fills the air again. They feel the sinking feeling again, as if the air is being sucked out of them... but something is different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continue running for Morgan's palm, the edge seems to be getting closer... not further away. The girls are certainly shrinking, but the ridges in Morgan's palm aren't getting any larger. Which means...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She got herself!\" Lisa shouts. \"Oh God, she's shrinking with us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls make their last leap, still shrinking, still growing incredibly small, they look back to see the terrified expression on Morgan's face. The girls land gently on top of the surface of Morgan's desk, but the previously gigantic girl continues to dwindle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" she shrieks. \"NO! YOU TINY SLAVES, GET BACK HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it's all said and done, Morgan has disappeared into the distance. A huge abyss stretches out beneath them, and it's virtually impossible for them to see the bottom. Morgan is down there--somewhere--but at their size, they can't see down that far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did it!\" Julie says, embracing her friend tightly. \"We're safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be so sure,\" Lisa mutters. \"Look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie turns around, looking behind her, and she gasps at the sight. The nearest object to her is a strange network of white fibers stretching for hundreds of feet in the air and far, far longer either direction. Her eyes spy a much, much taller but much less wide silver tower in the distance. The desk below their feet--smooth to the touch at normal size--is a lattice of wood fibers, each one twice as wide as the tiny girls are tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's the white fibers that draw their attention. Julie fearfully steps closer, desperate to figure out what the object is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that some kind of mold?\" she asks. \"Did she just get some really nasty stuff on her desk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lisa's eyes go wide. She stares up at the object's incredible height, and the reality of her size hits her like a ton of bricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's paper...\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie gasps. \"A stack of paper is THAT big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Lisa says, almost too terrified to state the truth. \"That's not a stack of paper. That huge thing is... it's <i>one</i> sheet of paper.\"</span></div></div>",

That's less than an inch away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie gasped, turning back to Lisa. \"You're kidding me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shook her head. \"Unless my math is wrong, what looks like a mile to us is only about a quarter of an inch. We could walk across this desk for hours and not even travel a foot. If we can find a crumb of bread or something like that, we could probably feed ourselves for a long time, but at our size we probably wouldn't even be able to break the surface tension of a drop of water, never mind drink it\" With a sigh, Lisa hung her head. \"We're really, really, really small, Julie, and I don't know how we can get big again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa, who had been grappling with her own size for some time now, accepted the news with resignation. For Julie, however, it was like being hit with a ton of bricks--a ton of bricks that, to her, would be continent-sized. Dropping to her knees on the latticed wood fiber of the immeasurable desk, she buried her face in her hands, sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can we do then?\" she sniffed. \"Nobody can see us. The only person who knows we're here wants to kill us. Do we just wait until we die? Oh God, Lisa, I don't want to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Julie threw herself against her friend, bawling and sobbing into her chest. Lisa knelt down and held her close, rubbing her hand down her back. \"All we can do is stick together and hope for a miracle,\" Lisa said. \"We're tiny, but we're not alone. I've got you and you've got me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie lifted her head up, looking into her friend's eyes. She saw that Lisa was forcing a smile, trying to be optimistic, but there was certainly an undercurrent of defeat behind the look. She understood at last what Lisa meant earlier about feeling safe, about needing protection. When Lisa was tiny and Julie was bigger, she did what she could to help her friend. At this scale, though, all they had was each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so as Julie pulled herself up, the two girls' eyes met, and they shared a long, tender kiss, the feelings that they'd secretly held for each other for so long finally let out. On the infinite wood fiber of the desk, they explored each other's bodies with their hands, sharing in the only comfort they could ever hope to know now in their new lives as microscopic creatures. Then, draped in each other's arms, clad only in their underwear, the two girls fell asleep, Lisa's head on Julie's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither girl was certain for how long they slept, but before long, a new noise woke them up.</span></div></div>",

Something had woken her up. She could swear she heard a loud thumping, like somebody tapping their fingers on the desk. Looking around, she only saw the strange, alien landscape that had filler her view previously. The immeasurably large mass of white fibers, and the strange interlocking wooden landscape, and the tall grey thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie woke up by the sound of Lisa screeching, and quickly stood up, remembering what had happened last night. Wiping her eyes, she found her friend next to her, trembling with fear. She followed her friends gaze upwards, and froze. \"Oh. My. God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large, terrifying grey creature stood before them. With a strangely potato shaped body, 6 terrifyingly thick claw-like legs, with 4 in the front, and 2 in the back, and a disgusting, pincer-like mouth, the girls could only watch as it's...antennae(?) twitched, sending reverberations through the air, like strong gusts of wind. This thing stood above them at hundreds of feet tall, nearly at thousands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, what the hell is that?!\" asked Julie, as she scooped up her previously discarded clothes, staring at it all the while. Lisa just couldn't say a word. She was trying to process what kind of creature it was. Her first thought was that it was an ant...or a bedbug or something...but it was something far worse. \"Julie, I think...I think we're looking at a dust mite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie gasped, and stared up at the creature, the sight of it making her a little sick to her stomach. She'd already come to terms with the fact that she was practically microscopic, but...a single dust mite, this big?! As if the paper wasn't bad enough... \"Lisa! What are we gonna do! We're gonna die! It's gonna eat us and we're gonna-\" <i><b>THWACK.</b></i> A reverberating boom filled the air as the creatures gross leg moved slightly. Then, after a moment of pause, another series of reverberating, thunderous booms filled the air as the creature sped off, faster then anything Lisa or Julie thought could possibly move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds and movements left the girls on the ground, gasping for breath. As they tried to compose themselves, Lisa muttered \"It...we're so small...it couldn't even see us.\" Julie didn't reply. She was trying to take it all in. \"So...Lisa...what are we going to do? We...probably shouldn't stay here. I don't know anything about dust mites, but they don't go alone, do they?\" \"...if there was one, there will be more, yeah.\" Lisa said, picking herself off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...we need to get out of here. I have an idea.\" \"An idea?\" Julie asked, joining her friend in getting off the ground. \"If we can get to the science lab and get under a microscope, someone will be able to see us, won't they?\" Julies eyes lit up. \"Of course! So stupid! Why didn't I think of that! Wait...Lisa...there's no way. We're too small to get there.\" \"Well I know we can't walk there, Julie...I was thinking we could get a lift there on something!\" \"A lift...on what?\" Julie asked, curious as to what her friend thought they could possibly get a lift on.

I mean, if this thing does what I think it does, then if I shrink myself too small, I won't be able to grow myself back.\"   She placed the device down on the table in front of her, staring at it for several moments.  \"I think I'll just wait for Danica to come back.  I'll just have to be subtle about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa continued to study the device, adjusting the settings on it and firing it at several objects around her dorm, to get a feel for just how powerful it was.  She switched The Reducer to shrink and fired at her bed and watched as it shrunk to the size of a matchbox, before returning it to its original size a few minutes later.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout thirty minutes later, Danica returned, having just returned from her daily jog around campus.  Quickly, Lisa stashed the reducer under the pillows on her bed, and walked out to greet her friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Lisa,\" Danica said, sweat glistening off her trim body.  She grabbed a towel from the hamper and wiped her face with it.  \"Any mail today?\"  Lisa pointed to the table and Danica walked over, She flipped through the envelopes, not seeing anything of interest to her, since most mail they received was mostly credit card applications or stuff like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Danica said, placing the mail back on the table.  \"Nothing good today.  I'm going to take a shower.\"  She went into her room and grabbed a fresh pair of clothes, before going to the bathroom.  As soon as she heard water running, Lisa took the Reducer out again, thinking of how to use the device on Danica without her friend finding out.  \"I've got it,\" Lisa thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later, Danica walked into the kitchen area, looking for something to eat.  She had her back to Lisa, giving the 21 year old a perfect shot.    Slowly, and with shaking hands, Lisa raised the device at her friend, making sure the device was switched to \"Shrink.\"  Firing a quick burst, she fired, hitting her friend squarely in the back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched her friend shudder momentarily, then, it seemed as if she did, in fact, shrink a little.  Just a few inches, though.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Lisa fired.  And again, Danica shrank only a few inches.  Curious as to how much smaller she had made her friend, Lisa placed the reducer under her pillows again and walked over to Danica.  Before, the two girls were roughly the same height, about 5'5\".  Now it was clear, as Lisa walked closer, that  she was close to 7 inches taller than her dorm mate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Danica,\" Lisa said innocently, standing next to her, as Danica took a Tupperware bowl out of the fridge and placed it on the counter.  Danica paused.  Something seemed off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The counter seems...larger somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it's just your imagination.  You just came back from a run.  Maybe you're a little bit more tired than usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe,\" Danica said, unsure.  She picked up the bowl, got a spoon out of one of the drawers, and sat down on the couch, flipping on the TV.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa walked back to her room and picked up the reducer again.  She was beginning to feel guilty for shrinking her friend, but the rush she felt while doing it was hard to deny.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa fired the device again, shrinking Danica from 4' 10\" to 4' 6\". Lisa would now be near a whole foot taller than her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched her friend\u2019s diminished body, Danica's clothes definitely looked more loose and baggy than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a rush!\" Lisa thought, before firing again. This time Danica went from 4' 6\" to an even 4'. Danica hadn't noticed anything amiss, probably due to the fact she was sat on the couch, and engrossed in day time TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa decided to have a bit of fun with her friend. She put the device in her pocket, and walked over to the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I join you?\" asked Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all\" replied Danica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sat next to her diminished friend. Even sitting Lisa was a head taller now, and Danica's clothes looked very baggy, liked a young teen wearing her older sisters t-shirt &amp; jeans. Even her socks had slipped down around her ankles. Danica looked over at Lisa, then realised she had to look up into her friends face. Danica's brow creased, as she frowned, trying to work out what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Asked Lisa, knowing full well, it was her that was 'up' and Danica that was 'down'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure\" replied Danica, still frowning. \"I think I'm a little more exhausted that I originally though!\" Danica looked up at Lisa \"You look....bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill playing along Lisa looked down at her dwindling friend \"Oh nice! Just because I don't go jogging every day, you think I'm getting fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no! I don't mean it like that!\" replied Dania \"I mean, you look...taller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be silly\" laughed Lisa! \"People don't just get taller!\" Lisa looked down at Danica \"You're just tired! That's all! Come here, and rest you head on my lap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa reached over, and pulled Danica by her shoulders. Danica slipped side ways, sliding her legs over the arm of the couch, and resting her head on Lisa's lap. Lisa started to massage the diminutive girl's forehead. Soon Danica had closed her eyes, and was resting peacefully on Lisa's lap. Lisa took the opportunity to pull the device out of her pocket. She checked the settings hadn't changed, and then quietly fired the device at the resting girl again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm that's nice Lisa\" moaned the dwindling girl \"You give wonderful head massages!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled, and continued to dwindle her friend. The thrill and excitement of slowly shrinking Danica was having its own effect on Lisa - her nipples had suddenly become very hard and erect, and she felt a tingling between her legs. Danica was down from 4' to 3' 5', her socked feet, slipping back off the arm of the couch as she shrunk. The now very loose socks got caught on the edge of the arm, and her still dwindling feet slipped out of them. Lisa admired Danica's pretty feet, even though she was a runner, Danica had kept them well looked after. Her soles were very soft, and smooth, and she'd had a French pedicure recently, making her toes looked very pretty. Before long the perfect little feet disappeared into the legs of Danica's jeans, as her entire body was pulled into itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa continued massaging her friend\u2019s head, while dwindling her with the device, now down to 3' Danica looked like a little girl, playing dress up in her mommy's clothes. Lisa increased the setting on the device, she wanted to shrink Danica as much as possible before Danica noticed, which wouldn't be too long. At 2ft, Danica felt strange, her t-shirt arms felt like they were down past her elbows, she had no socks on, and her feet seemed to be inside her jeans, which no longer felt like the tight, sexy jeans she wore to show off her curvy sexy figure. She opened her eyes, and saw Lisa hide something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, something\u2019s wrong! What was that? Why are my clothes so baggy?\" Danica sat up, her bra slipped off her usually large D cup breasts; her t-shirt was hanging off her. She looked around, then she saw Lisa, how looked huge. Danica had to crane her neck to look up at her friend sitting behind her. \"What..what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked down at the tiny teen, trying to suppress a smile. \"Umm, I don't think anything has happened to me! But I think you've shrunk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? People don't shrink!\" Danica got up, and swivelled around on the couch, her once tight jeans slipped off her legs, and into a pile on the floor. \"What the..!?\" She slipped down off the couch, which was now quite a bit higher than normal. She stood before Lisa, like a little girl wearing a large toga, as she tried to hold up her huge panties, and t-shirt. \"What's happened to me?\" she started to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, shh, it's ok little one! We'll find out what's happening, don't panic!\" cooed Lisa<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't panic! I'm a god damn munchkin!\" shouted Danica. She turned and tried to walk away, but her feet got caught in the over sized t-shirt, and she let go of her panties, which slipped to the floor, just as she tripped over. Lisa got a nice view of diminutive girls bare ass, poking out of the t-shirt, and giggled. She fired the device one last time at Danica, dwindling her to 1'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanica was in a heap on the floor, covered in her oversized t-shirt and panties, trying to climb out. Suddenly she felt something large pick her up, and carry her. She squealed in fright. Before long she felt the giant t-shirt around her being removed, and suddenly there was light and she could see. What she saw scared her, and she let out another little squeal. A giant Lisa towered over her like a 30' tall giantess. Behind her was Lisa's bedroom, decorated in pink, with posters of bands, peace logos and a cannabis leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, shh, it's OK Danica! I'm not going to hurt you!\" whispered Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what happened?\" asked Danica<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'll tell you, but you have to promise not to get mad! I was only having a bit of fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this to me!\" shouted Danica, in a mix of shock, and anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I was just playing about, and it can be reversed!\" replied Lisa<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do this?\" Demanded Danica<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got this device this morning\" Lisa pulled out the device and showed it to Danica \"I needed to test it on someone, so decided you'd be my first test subject!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we were friends! I can't believe you did this to me! Without my permission!\" shouted Danica<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I'm sorry\" said Lisa apologetically \"But if I had asked, would you have let me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....well no! I don't know! But you should still have asked\" said Danica<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and I'm sorry, again!\" said Lisa. \"Look, all I'm asking, if for you to trust me, and let us have some fun with this thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun! How is this fun!\" shouted Danica, crossing her arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Danica, use your imagination! You've always said you'd like to see what it's like, being inside that doll house you have in your room, that you spend so much money furnishing out! Just think, now you can use all those teeny tiny cups, and plates, and things you buy for it!\" Danica thought this over \"And isn't your favourite film Attach of the 50ft woman\" Danica nodded \"And you love Land of the Giants right!\" again Danica nodded. \"Just imagine being able to play with a real Giantess! I can pick you up, and hold you, and let you climb all over me if you want! Or, you can be boring, and grow back to normal, and miss out on this opportunity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanica thinks it over for a few seconds, and then decides....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa put on a coat and boots and decided to go walk around campus. She slipped the device into the front pocket of her coat as she left. She didn't have class until 2:30 today, so she had some time to kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked around, she considered what to do with the device. She briefly considered trying it out on a statue of one of the school's founders, but decided she didn't have much use for a knick-knack like that. She really didn't care what that old dead guy wrote, or what classes he taught. And besides, the statue was right in the middle of campus, and it would have been too conspicuous to zap it and take it. Lisa didn't want anybody to know that she had the device. (On one hand, if it worked, she wanted to keep it a secret, and keep whatever it is that she shrunk secret. On the other, if it didn't work, she would be <b>so</b> embarrassed if anybody saw her whip it out only for it to not do anything).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa decided to find somewhere a bit more quiet. A bit more secluded. She hurried to the north quad of the campus, where there was a lone dining hall and a single dorm situated on a large, open field. The field was huge, and was used by students to play sports, have picnics, or sometimes to rehearse bands and dance groups. Normally, this would be far too many people, but, since it was only 10:30 am on a Tuesday morning, most people were either at class, at a job, or at the library (and if they weren't, they were probably sleeping). She only saw a group of girls, three of them, sitting at the edge of the field having what looked like either a picnic or an outside study session. They were probably a good 1500 feet from her. Far too far away to notice if something suddenly changed size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on a bench opposite the dining hall. It looked like it was just closing, perhaps setting up for the incoming lunch rush at 11:30. She watched, seeing if any students might stagger out on their way to class. None did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10:45. Campus would be flooded at 10:55 with students running to their next class, and she would either have to shrink someone before then or after, in order to avoid attention. She was thinking, at this point, at just going over to the group of girls. They didn't look like they would be leaving soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw, out of the corner of her eye, someone approaching her. She watched as the woman came into view. She was tall, and dressed in a jogging outfit of a hoodie, black bicycle shorts, and big, white running shoes. Strawberry blonde hair was tied behind her in a ponytail, and it bobbed slightly as the woman jogged towards where Lisa was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa almost instantly reached for the device, and wrapped her fingers around it as the woman came closer and closer into view. She was gorgeous - and Lisa thought she would make the most <i>adorable</i> little pet. Lisa immediately saw images of the tiny woman gripped in Lisa's hands as she pet her body with her fingers, and training her do to little tricks. It would be adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Lisa's surprise, the woman actually slowed down as she approached. Without saying a word, the woman slowed and sat down on the bench, pulling out her phone to send a message. Lisa turned to face her, staring at her with wide eyes as her new plaything nearly fell right into her lap. Well, next to her lap. Her eyes scanned the woman from head to toe, lingering on her long legs for a moment. She looked a few years older than Lisa, perhaps 24 or 25, and perhaps a graduate student or PhD candidate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" Lisa said to the woman, trying to get her attention. The woman had headphones in, and didn't seem to hear Lisa. Taking advantage of this, Lisa slid the device out of her pocket, cradling it in her palm. She positioned it towards the woman and hovered her thumb over the button with the minus on it, and then pressed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as the woman went from being perhaps 5'9\" or 5'10\" - a statuesque beauty - to a much smaller size almost instantly. The woman went from reclining on the bench to suddenly laying flat in a spread eagle position, dazed from the sudden experience of shrinking. Curiously, the phone did not shrink with her, though the rest of her clothes and belongings did. The phone hovered in place for a moment and then fell onto the bench, bouncing off of the wood and landing on top of the woman's legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa held her breath as she reached over and picked up the phone, slipping it into her pocket. She set the device down in her lap, and then lowered her face down near the now-tiny woman. The tiny woman slowly sat up, and shrieked as she saw Lisa's gigantic face looming above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" Lisa said, smiling. The tiny woman was silent. \"Hold still, okay?\" Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa then reached over to the tiny woman and picked her up with both hands. One hand gripped around her torso, while the other pressed against the tiny woman's shoes, as if to support her. Lisa traced the woman's right leg with her finger, and then pinched her tiny calf in between to legs and flexed the woman's leg, bending it at the knee. Lisa grinned as she realized she was holding a person like a toy, moving her leg as if one were posing a doll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa checked her watch, forgetting that the act of turning her wrist would also tilt the tiny woman in her hand. She shrieked as Lisa checked the time. 10:53. Campus would be swarming with students in a few minutes, and she didn't want anyone to see her new prize. Tilting the tiny woman right back up, she said. \"You're going to have to hide for now, okay? But you're too big. You look like you're Barbie-sized right now, so I'm going to have to make you smaller. She picked up the device from her lap and activated it on the woman again, feeling her get smaller in her grasp. She looked like she went from roughly 10 inches tall to being about six, which was the perfect size for hiding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stood up, adjusting her grip on the tiny woman. She pinched her torso between two fingers, admiring how the tiny woman kicked and struggled in her grasp, as if she were a toy that moved on her own. \"Okay, perfect. I'm going to put you away for now, but we'll play later, okay?\" With that, she opened her jeans pocket and stuffed the tiny woman into her left pocket head-first, her tiny legs just barely sticking out of the top. She stroked the girl's leg one more time and then pushed her further into it, so that only the bottoms of her shoes were poking out of her pocket, and then patted her pocket to secure her pet into place. She slipped the device back into her coat pocket, and then stood up. Students were just beginning to filter out of the academic buildings, so it was time to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>But where would she go?</b> She was planning on going straight home with her new acquisition. She had to set ground rules for the little woman, and she wanted to play with her as fast as possible. She could still feel the woman's body in her hands, and wanted to recreate that feeling as soon as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could go shrink one or all of them and have fun with them, and it wouldn't hurt to have more than one pet. Images of holding them in her hands and toying with them filled her with excitement. She imagined making them kiss, as if they were dolls. Maybe she'd make them put on nail polish for her while she worked, in order to save time. Or maybe she'd shrink them all down to tiny, tiny size. They would make cute pets for her other pet, or maybe she could turn them into jewelry. She could fasten them to earrings or to a necklace, no longer people but her cute accessories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe she'd find something else around campus that she could use the device for. She was amazed that it worked at all, and while she still intended to keep it (and her tiny pets) a secret, she imagined all of the fun she could have with it in public. She imagined discreetly shrinking instructors in front of their students and watching the ensuing chaos occur, as well as the inverse as a professor lectured her now-tiny students for failing to complete their assignments. She dreamed about shrinking down entire sororities - the ones who had rejected her in the past - and feeling their bodies in her hands as she indiscriminately scooped them up. They would make great gifts. Or maybe she'd finally shrink those guys from her classes and have them at her mercy. It had been so long since a boy took her on a date, and wanted a boyfriend, no matter what size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa realized the options were unlimited, truly.

Not finding anything that she could see, our naked redhead tried to pull the remote across the floor to the computer on the other side to do her research on it, but found it impossible to move with her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd I even get this thing up here?\"  She asked herself as she lay on her back, breathing heavily from her attempt to move the remote.  \"I'll just ask Alicia to help me move it then when she gets back.\"  Amy said as she started to make the (proportionally) long journey to the kitchen and get something to eat.  As she continued her trek, she kept having this feeling that something was different, and kept looking around to find what it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the massive furniture now the size of mountains or skyscrapers, she didn't see anything wrong with her perspective, but something about it just felt....different.  Once in the kitchen, Amy started doing her routine to get on the counter, climbing up the leg of a stool and jumping over to finish climbing up the drawers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do this every day I'm home alone, why does this feel so different?\"  She wondered.  Once on the stool, she got into position, shimmied her bare behind for good luck and jumped, snagging the drawer nob easily.  Climbing up the rest of the way didn't present any other challenges, and she wandered over to the fridge and just stared at the side of it, unable to remember how she got into it yesterday, much less this morning!  \"I know I had strawberry this morning!  How'd I open it?\"  She practically screamed into the empty apartment, her little voice barely filling half the kitchen.  Deciding that her friend and roommate Alicia would be able to remind her, Amy turned around and headed over to the fruit bowl, grabbed a small grape, and waited for Alicia to return.</span></div></div>",

It took a minute for her to come into Amy's line of sight, but eventually Alicia appeared, carrying the pile of clothes in the hall and the remote in her hands.  \"Oh, there you are Amy!\"  Amy did a little wave, hopping over to the edge of the counter to talk.  \"Whose clothes are these?  And what's with the remote thing?\"  She gestured to the items in question she held as she walked up to the the counter where Amy was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy shrugged, \"I don't know, I was checking out that remote I bought, and the next thing I knew, I was buried under the clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia's eyebrows almost disappeared into her hairline, at Amy's size, a lot of things could crush her, and the thought of someone just ... dropping stuff on her was a little frightening.  \"Did anyone get in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy shook her head, \"I looked around, but didn't see anything or anyone that indicated a break in.  Call me crazy, but I think the remote did it.\"  To be fair, it was the only explanation that matched the story.  \"Speaking of, I don't know how I got it up here, but I can't move it over to the computer, think you could help me with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia looked at the strange remote and nodded, putting the clothes on the couch before coming back to set her hand out for Amy to hop onto, before guiding her over to her breasts, letting Amy hop down and find her spot between what served as the best cushions in the world (to Amy).  \"Alright, lets see what we've got here...\" Alicia muttered as she typed the information into the computer, scrolling through various images and sites, but not seeing anything that matched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could go to the mall,\" Amy suggested, \"I know the pawn broker there, and we do need groceries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made sense to Alicia, \"Alright then, I'll just grab my purse and we'll head out.\" As she grabbed her purse and the remote, did she accidentally hit the buttons on the remote?</span></div></div>",

All in all, it was an uneventful trip to the bus stop, neighbors saying hi, Amy getting paid for babysitting their neighbors 3 year old son the other day (though that one did seem odd to Alicia, who was trying to figure out the logistics of how that'd work).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaying for their bus ride was easy enough, they only needed one seat, and Amy and Alicia started talking once the bus got going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Amy,\" Alicia started, nervous because anyone treating her differently because of her height (or lack thereof) really upset her, \"how'd you babysit little Tommy?  He's quite the handful for his mom, I couldn't figure out how you'd be able to corral him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked up from her perch between Alicia's rather large breasts, \"Well it's simple!  I ... uh ... hhhmmmm.\"  She rubbed her chin thoughtfully, trying to recall the details of the babysitting job, but the details continued to escape her.  \"I don't remember, that's strange.\"  Suddenly remembering a question she was going to ask earlier in their apartment, she looked back at Alicia, \"Hey, how do I open the fridge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia tilted her head back and tried to think, she'd seen Amy open the fridge hundreds of times before, but she couldn't remember the process, the knowledge was there, but no memories or mental images to give it context or a solid answer.  \"I honestly don't know.  I've seen you do it before though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded, looking down at her naked body, she didn't have tan lines because she always walked around naked, not having clothes in her size and all that, but it still felt weird seeing herself naked for some reason, her breasts and red bush out in the open for anyone to see.  The bus hit a pothole, causing Alicia's phone to hit the remote, and a flash was seen filling the back half of the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Alicia and Amy didn't see anything that could've caused the flash, and returned to their idle conversation, trying to figure out how Amy did everyday things, not noticing that a mother had been shrunk by the remote, and she was trying to uncover herself from her now too large blouse, while her five year old daughter continued to dig through her mothers purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally at the mall, Alicia and Amy got off along with the now inch-high mother and her daughter, neither seeing anything wrong with their predicaments, though Alicia and Amy did enjoy watching the tiny mother try to direct her daughter to go where she wanted, as the daughter was carrying her mother and the purse.  The last they saw was the daughter running at full speed to the toy store while the mother held on tight to one of her daughters pigtails, trying to ge their to go to the toy store, and failing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the mall, where did Alicia and Amy go first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWe\u2019ll go get the groceries first.\u201d  Alicia said, setting off for the grocery store next to the Hot Topic.  While she was passing by, a goth girl and her friends bumped into Alicia, knocking Amy from her perch between Alicia\u2019s breasts.  The sudden movement between the goths bumping into Alicia, and Alicia catching Amy as she fell, caused the remote to go off repeatedly, hitting all four goth girls.  After making sure that Amy was safe and secure back between her breasts, Alicia turned around to check on the goth girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four girls in question were worming their ways out from under their now far too oversized clothing, their pale white bodies and black hair made them almost blend into the black and white clothes.  \u201cAre you girls alright?\u201d  Alicia asked, gingerly helping each girl out from under the clothes, and one girl who\u2019d gotten tangled up in a neon pink thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead girl looked up at Alicia, \u201cYeah!  No thanks to you!  You could\u2019ve killed us!\u201d  She stomped her foot and crossed her arms, accentuating her practically flat chest.  \u201cAnd you made us spill our smoothies!\u201d  She pointed at the now spilled drinks, two of which had spilled on their respective piles of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d  Any yelled from her perch between her friends breasts, \u201cIf you all didn\u2019t walk through these piles of clothes, she wouldn\u2019t have tripped!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goth girls blushed, not really knowing why they walked where they did.  \u201cIt\u2019s ok Amy,\u201d Alicia said looking over at the spilled smoothies, \u201cthe least I can do is to replace all your smoothies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four newly shrunken girls agreed, and aside from one of the girls carrying her now massive car keys, the girls wore nothing but their tattoos.  Standing in Alicia\u2019s hands while in line at the smoothie stand, the four girls suddenly found themselves questioning the sizes that they wanted to get.  Whereas before the mediums snd larges they got were perfectly sized for each girl, now they looked massive compared to each girl.  Even the small size cups towered over them, but they all did want their smoothies, so they all agreed to split a small strawberry banana smoothie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four goths were deciding on their orders, Alicia was digging in her purse to get the money out, and the remote went off again, only once this time, it ended up hitting the cashier.  This of course meant that they had to wait the next few minutes as the now inch and half tall naked girl climbed back up and in position to take their order.  Alicia, trying to stay politically correct about \"Tinies\", did her best not to laugh at the absurdity of the small girl hoping from button to button to fill out the order.  Nobody noticing the empty uniform piled up behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the girl was done entering the order and ringing them up, and catching her breath, Alicia handed the money over to the small cashier, watching the balancing act that the girl had to do to handle money far larger than her, open the cash drawer, and get the correct change.  Once the order was in, the guy behind the cashier started making it, and it took so long for the girl to get the correct change out and close the drawer, the smoothie was ready before then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the four girls and their smoothie back on the ground, Alicia grabbed her change and put it back in her purse, once again setting the remote off, but this time shrinking the smoothie maker, and the now naked and diminutive man now was forced to figure out how he made smoothies earlier when the machine and cups were well over seven times his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the four goth girls were sitting on their smoothie lid, taking turns straddling the straw to try and get a taste of their drink, while the girl with her car keys was trying to figure out how they were going to drive home.  All the while each girl took turns having a group hug with each other to keep warm from hugging an ice-cold straw, their tiny bodies covered in goosebumps and their nipples erect from the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least it all worked out.\"  Alicia said happily, unaware of the confusion she left in her wake each time the remote went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded, enjoying the rhythmic bounce of Alicia's breasts with each step, \"Yeah, wonder how they thought they were gonna drink such massive smoothies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly don't know, but at least they agreed to share one, that's much cheaper and more sensible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally in the grocery store, the two roommates got a shopping cart started getting everything they needed for the next two weeks.</span></div></div>",

This meant that it could fire off one shot, or many, and all at random intervals, but neither Alicia nor Amy knew this, the remote perfectly positioned to stick out of the purse, but angled in such a way that it wouldn't hit Alicia, unless she ended up shifting it of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the cart down the aisle, Alicia didn't notice the flash behind her, nor the toddler who'd outgrown all his clothes, and was now standing head and shoulders above his father, who was busy trying to keep his son from knocking over the shelves.  Of course, when Alicia turned around to get a look at what was causing the noise, she didn't see anything strange there at all, and continued on her merry way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mommy!  I want it!\"  A little girl cried as her mother pulled her along, reaching desperately for the box of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't need it now Susan.\"  Her mother warned, \"Now behave or you're going to get a spanking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan pouted but closed her mouth, following her mother down the aisle, trying to figure out how to get the candy she wanted without getting in trouble.  She looked at the people in the aisle, people watching, she saw a pretty black lady without dreadlocks and a little nakie lady between her boobies.  Susan knew about the \"Tinies\" but hadn't really seen them before, then her eyes were filled with a white flash, and just as quickly as it happened, it vanished.  And so had mommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy?  Where'd you go?\"  She looked around before seeing a pile of clothes next to mommies shopping basket, and there was movement under the skirt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, little Susan lifted up the edge of the skirt, and reached in, pulling out a tiny naked lady sloppily wrapped up in pink lace panties.  \"Mommy!\"  Susan cheered, nearly deafening her minuscule mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan, untangle me from this would you?\"  Her mother tugged at what had formerly been her panties, not at all noticing anything odd aside from suddenly finding oneself under a pile of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan did as she was asked, and picked up the basket, put her naked mother in it, and continued to follow her directions, not at all wanting to get spanked, not realizing that her inch and a half tall mother couldn't even reach Susan's bottom anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we need soda?\"  Alicia asked Amy, holding up a 2 liter bottle of ginger ale, while Amy watched two employees try to figure out how to load a fresh box of cans onto the third shelf, while standing less than two inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you say?\"  Amy asked, looking up at Alicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soda.\"  Alicia said slowly to her diminutive roommate, \"Do we need it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy thought about it, she did like ginger ale, and it was fun to swim in, all the bubbles tickling her while she swam in a bowl or cup, the taste didn't hurt either.  \"Sure, I haven't taken a soda swim in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Alicia placed the bottle in her cart, maneuvering around the massive bare behind of an employee trying to stock a display of cookware, which was kind of hard to do when you were ten times the size of the display.  And watched as one customer almost ran into on the employees now enlarged genitals, the penis alone was the size of an average man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have everything Amy?\"  Alicia asked as she went through the cart, seeing if she missed anything.</span></div></div>",

Alicia watched as the various undersized and undressed employees worked in tandem to barely move the chunk of turkey into position on the slicer, while behind her, a giant customer accidentally sat on the ice cream display, causing her her squeak in discomfort as her now bed sized bottom had an ice cold display wedged between her bare butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the deli employees were done slicing the meat, they pushed a cart over and had to work quite a bit to get the bagged and labeled meat onto it before moving it across the aisle and to the naked deli lady who'd taken the order was unable to get it up to Alicia.  Meanwhile, the coworkers were working as fast as they could, trying to keep their fast pace, while figuring out how to still do their job, like the two poor teenagers trying (and failing) to open the fridge for more cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia, taking pity on the employees, reached over and grabbed her order, \"Thank you, I'm sorry for all the trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deli girl, panting and bent over from exhaustion trying to move a pound of meat when she weighed less than five ounces now, nodded and waved at Alicia, \"It's **pant**... ok... **pant***, NEXT!!!\"  And the naked giant crawled forward and placed his order, various customers staying out of the way from his legs and massive bare behind, his swinging genitals easy to see between his legs beneath his behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\"  Alicia cheered, \"Time to checkout and get the remote dealt with.\"  Amy nodding in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, Alicia and Amy were amazed at how many people here were under or over-sized for their jobs, what with the gigantic shelf stockers, and the minuscule deli team, it seemed like the management staff didn't look at the heights of their employees when assigning jobs.  \"But, what with equality for everyone, this is what happens\", Alicia though to herself, looking down at her roommate situated between her breasts, and couldn't help but wonder how she did her job a thing her size.  But that was a conversation for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckout was easier than with the smoothie girl, though Amy did find the sight of a tiny mother telling her normal sized eight year old daughter how to use the credit card a bit amusing, but she didn't say anything.  Pushing the cart through the mall, Alicia saw a dress that looked absolutely gorgeous, and she just had to try it on, after all, they had plenty of time before the pawn store closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Amy,\" Alicia begged, \"it'll only take a bit, a quick in and out, and then we pawn this remote!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"  Amy sighed.</span></div></div>",

Follow me to the changing rooms, and I'll go get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the friends in the changing room to get the dress, Alicia began undressing, sitting Amy on the bench next to her purse.  Amy, meanwhile, was bored, clothes shopping was always boring for her since she couldn't wear anything, but didn't object to the view of Alicia wearing only her bra and panties, her well shaped bottom right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\"  The sales lady said as she opened the door, handing the dress to Alicia, \"Lets see how this fits.\"  And Amy watched as Alicia took her bra off, not wanting to have underwear lines showing through the dress in the mirror, and tossed the bra on her purse, nudging the remote.  Just as soon as the dress was fully zipped up, the sales lady found herself naked in a pile of clothes staring at Alicia's ankles before looking up the dress at her customer.  \"How's it fit?!\"  She called up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing a little spin for herself, looking at her reflection and admiring her appearance before turning back to the sales lady, squatting down to talk to her.  Not caring that the lady was getting a clear view right to Alicia's panties, \"It fits pretty good.  Do you guys do alterations here, or do I have to go somewhere else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sales lady looked up at her customer, briefly tripping on the collar of a discarded white shirt that was in the changing room for some reason, \"You'll have to do alterations elsewhere, but I can put the dress on hold for you if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia nodded, and began unzipping the dress, though it took a few tries before she could grip the zipper right, and handed the shoulder strap of the dress to the minuscule employee, \"Could you hold this for me then?  I'll probably be by in a day or two.\"  The tiny employee nodded and began the very arduous task of dragging the dress to the back, not really remembering that she brought the dress in on the hangar currently on the hook on the door, nor that she was once as tall as Alicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Amy?\"  Alicia said as she slid her shirt back on and her skirt back up up legs, \"That wasn't so bad was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy giggled and shook her head, \"No.  But you forgot your bra!\"  She pointed at Alicia's (almost) forgotten bra on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Alicia quickly slipped the bra back on before heading out, noticing that the sales lady hadn't even moved the dress two feet, the poor dear was sprawled on her back, taking in deep breaths of air, clearly exhausted from trying to move such a massive (for her size) dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good day!\"  Alicia called as she left, the tired employee waving her arm in the general direction of the exit as Alicia and Amy left the store.  As Alicia and Amy headed to the pawn shop, groceries in tow, they saw a very satisfied five year old girl pushing a kiddie cart full of dolls and toys, her inch and a half tall mother angry, but unable to do anything from the confines of her own purse that her daughter had stuffed her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Amy said, more than a little entertained at the sight, \"I guess we know how that went earlier.\"  Alicia smiled and nodded her head, remembering the two from the bus when they arrived at the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we're here!\"  Amy said as they entered the pawn brokers store.</span></div></div>",

She saw everything from old TV's and radios to unique statues and antique furniture from wall to wall and from floor to ceiling, not a single square inch was wasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd if it isn't my best scavenger!\"  A twenty something old man behind the counter called as he spied Amy nestled between Alicia's breasts.  \"What find do you have today?\"  He leaned forward as Alicia set Amy down in the counter and placing the remote next to the tiny naked redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alexi, I found this remote here,\" Amy leaned up against the remote like a car salesman would a sports car, \"but I couldn't find anything on its value, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm...\" Alexi hummed to himself as he picked up the remote and scrutinized it from every angle, briefly touching the minus button, and  disappeared from sight in a bright flash, the remote landing on the desk.  Alicia and Amy looked over the edge of the desk, seeing the now tiny and naked Alexi working his way out of a black t-shirt, \"Can y'all get Sally fer me?\"  Alexi asked from his position, ignoring how the cold had caused his crotch to suffer from cold shrinkage, \"She should be somewhere's in the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia nodded and headed to the back of the store, found Sally stocking shelves, and got her to come up front, where she then headed behind the counter and picked up Alexi and set him on the countertop before taking a seat on the stool.  \"Thank you Sally.\"  Alexi said with a bow before returning his attention to the (now massive) remote.  \"Retro design, no obvious marks or dents...\" he walked around it, looking at every detail before looking back at Sally, \"Darling, if you would be so kind as to test them there buttons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally nodded and picked up the remote, trying to press the \"plus\" button, but it was jammed, the \"minus\" button however, worked fine as Sally found out, now finding herself at an inch and a half tall as well.  Alexi looked over the countertop, seeing his employee's round and shapely rear end back itself out from under a large bra before she waved up at her boss.  As Amy and Alexi got back to talking, Sally started climbing up the wooden stool on her side of the counter, confused as to where those clothes that were on top of her had come from, and sitting herself back on the stool once she climbed her way back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Alexi began as Alicia picked the remote up to take a good look at it herself,  \"Considering the fact that one of the buttons don't work, and the fact that I don't recognize it, I'll give ya $20 for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked surprised at her friend and broker, normally he did better than that, \"But just look at It!\"  She pointed to it as Alicia was looking it over in her hands, \"It's gotta be worth something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi nodded, \"Indeed it might be, but I don't recognize it, nor did you find out anything useful.  $25's the best I can do.\"  Meanwhile, Sally had hopped off the stool (weighing less and being smaller meant they could survive proportionality larger falls) and was heading back to stock the shelves like she was earlier, unaware that that task would be substantially harder now that she didn't even reach 2 inches in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a small group of four tiny naked goth girls who had gorged themselves on a smoothie and each had gotten the mothers of all brainfreezes, successfully hitched a ride all the way to their car, and were now stuck trying to figure out how to get in the car in order to figure out how to drive it home.  With a combined height of a little less than six inches (if they stood on each other's heads), they were nowhere near the handle or the keyhole.  They did, eventually, find good luck in a little girl who was walking to her shrunken mom's car, and was willing to unlock the door for them, and even opened it, but then left them be, the girls mother telling her to hurry up and drive home so the cold food items don't spoil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the goths were in a slightly better position now, what with the door open and all, but they still were no closer to actually <i>driving</i> the car, and they were trying to figure that part out before their parents showed up and embarrassed them for not getting home on time.  The four naked girls standing on the floor of the car by the pedals, trying to figure this particular puzzle out, such as how to depress the pedals, how to steer, how to change gears, and how to see, all while each weighed less than six ounces, and standing less than two inches tall.  Oh, and closing the door, they had to figure out how to do that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy debated the offer in her head, she paid $12 for it, so $25 would still be making a profit, but not much of one.  She looked up at the remote in Alicia's hands, and the flashes of light it kept emitting as Alicia rotated it, by pure luck or subconscious awareness of what the remote was doing, keeping herself away from the blinking end.  The same couldn't be said for the various mall patrons who found themselves much taller, or much shorter, and each altered patron now going about their day in the buff just outside the pawn shop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had finally come to a descision,\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

Soon getting Alicia to pick her and the device back up and into her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... But I don't think you get much anywhere else.\" Alexi trailed off walking back behind the massive cash register<br>\r\n\"You stay safe now, you hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, see you next time..\" Amy yells leaning out of the purse and waving goodbye as Alicia carried her out of the store and back to the cart. The two continued pushing the car back towards the mall exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, on the way to the exit, Alicia soon stops the cart next to some benches and places her purse and Amy down on the bench. \"Hey, you stay and watch our stuff, I have to go to the bathroom before we head home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Thing\" Amy responded, even though at her size, she wouldn't be able to stop anyone from doing anything. After Alicia head down a separate hall towards the bathrooms. Amy climbs out of the purse, pulling the device along with her. Soon plopping down on the bench, straddling the device, Amy begins to inspect the thing again, surprised that Alexi didn't see much value in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she had fell out of the purse with the device, the slight force of hitting the seat, un-jammed the \"plus\" button on the device. As Amy inspected the thing further, climbing towards the front of the device. As she got to the front of it, she accidentally press down on the \"plus\" button, firing the device at the target in front of it, her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before, in a flash Amy was blinded before coming to and releasing the device. Opening her eyes, Amy saw that she was naked without clothes. She froze in shock not knowing why she didn't have anything on. She still didn't realize she had managed to grow back to about her original size. Now not small, she felt embarrassed being non-clothed. Thankfully, from all the miss fires while in the mall, there was quite a few piles of clothes scattered around. Savaging through them, she managed to find a a top and some shorts and threw them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling less exposed now, Amy sat back down on the bench, pulling the device back into the purse. Soon after, Alicia returned from the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, ready to go?\" She asked, not seeing anything different in her now normal sized friend. Amy nodded before handing Alicia's purse back to her and both continuing out of the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving out side, the two grabbed the things and waited for the bus to arrive. As the waited in the small shelter, Alicia soon slacked a bit. enough to put pressure on her purse and firing the device. As the two continued to wait, they didn't pay no mind to the flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff a bit away, four blonde girls from the local sorority tiredly walked from the very far end of the parking lot of the mall. They had came here for some shopping and fun, but due to how busy the mall was, had to park far out in the parking lot. tired from having to walk so far, the girls didn't pay no mind when suddenly there was a bright flash of light in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy and Alicia waited for the bus, Amy looked far off to her right and saw 4 massive, towering girls walking their way to the mall. Again, seeing nothing wrong with anything, Amy turned back around to talk to Alicia while waiting. The 4 girls were now massive, all at least towering at about 50' in size. However like everyone else, they continued on as normal, all talking about what they were going to do in the mall, which was now obviously a bit too small for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly as the girls talked and walked with one another, the lead didn't notice a car slowly pulling out. As the 4 goth girls had managed to all manage a individual part of driving, one for pedals, steering, looking, and another for shifting. Though they had only made a tiny bit of progress, they were getting there. Or should say was, as a 50' girl's foot smashed down on to the car, crushing it and everything in side of it, including the girls. Either out of ignorance or something else, the 4 sorority girls continued on as normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls talked about clothing they needed to get, even though they were all naked and nothing there would remotely fit them. The girls quickly managed to reach the entrance to the mall, however they soon reached their dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting long enough, the bus finally arrived. Amy and Alicia proceeded to get up and get on the bus. Looking back around, Amy saw the 4 sorority girls, inspecting the relatively tiny entrance to the mall for them. She even saw one of them attempting to crawl through and into the mall. However due to not looking forward, Amy bumped into Alicia and her purse, causing another flash. Apologizing to Alicia, and getting on the two pulled away as 3 of the blonde girls attempted to help the friend who was now TWICE their size at about 100', now stuck into the entrance of the mall.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking at the massive behind not sticking out of one of the mall entrances, Amy wondered how such a huge girl could've even gotten  herself into that's predicament.  Shrugging it off, she continued to talk with Alicia about their days so far, and dreading the part of the parking lot that the mall hasn't re-paved, filled with potholes which would begin perhaps the largest chain react yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral rapid flashes shot out, hitting targets both inside and outside the bus, but nobody noticed anything different, except for perhaps some momentary confusion.  A family of four found itself now on the smaller scale of existence, and had to walk what was miles, rather than a hundred yards or so, to get to the front door.  The father carrying his keys around him like a hilariously oversized bandolier, the keys clinking and jingling behind him, while the mother and their teenagers helped with dragging her wallet along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn employee running late for his shift was running to the mall, intent on getting to In/Out Taco when he was struck, and found himself 50ft tall.  Unaware of the fact that he wouldn't be able to fit behind the register, much less in the kitchen, or his nudity, the employee started to try and wedge himself through the door to the food court, seeing as how the main entrance had been jammed up by some girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rich heiress and her maid were walking along when the heiress was affected, of course she's couldn't be seen being <u>carried</u> by her help, that just wouldn't do!  So she had the maid follow her, ignoring the fact it would take literally hours to go anywhere like this now, and that several minutes for her was a single footstep for the maid.  It also was a little odd seeing an inch and a half tall girl bossing around a full grown normal sized woman and succeeding in getting away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, three unfortunate shots were fired into fellow passengers of the bus, the first was a girl who'd just gotten off her shift at DQ, and now found herself rolling out of the bus from the massive hole she tore out of it as she grew to fifty feet tall.  A bit dazed and confused, the naked giantess shrugged it off after a minute and started to stroll home, her perky breasts and well rounded behind jiggling and bouncing along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second shot was the bus driver, who found herself sitting under a massive wall of fabric as the bus had a minor curbing incident.  Coming to a forced stop, everyone began making sure everyone was alright, the poor bus driver trying to figure out how she even drove this thing so far without incident as she wormed her way put off the now useless pile of clothes, trying to use her radio to call her manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the third shot hit...</span></div></div>",

You'll be able to sell it in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded, \"Yeah, but now I'm going to be busy for who knows how long trying to figure out how much it's worth.\"  She worked her way into a comfortable spot and stretched, \"Wake me when we get home.\"  And she began to drift off to sleep in the rhythmic bounce of her friends breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the back of the store, Sally was busy trying to push an antique radio onto the shelf, but she just couldn't even budge it a bit.  She glared at the shelf, looking at all the other stuf that she'd been shelving before Alexi needed her up front.  She <u>knew</u> that she stocked that stuff earlier, she just couldn't remember how she'd gotten it up there.  Heaving deep breaths and trying to think this through, the tiny naked employee looked around for anything that could help her, before wondering how she got those TV's on the shelves.  It was only her and Alexi running this place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the bus stop with groceries in hand, Alicia decided to people watch, and just look at the people who went by.  She saw a police officer talking to a tiny naked mother about her daughter trying to drive a minivan home, but a flash later and the cop was now standing at the same height as the shrunken mother, surrounded by what had been his uniform.  After digging himself out of the heavy pile of Kevlar, the conversation resumed as though nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before her people watching could continue, Alicia got on the bus, making sure that she had all her groceries, careful not to drop or spill anything as she worked her way to her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer purse had hit almost each and every seat on the drivers side of the bus that she passed as she worked her way to an open seat.  And what followed was a sudden readjustment to several people's lives as they now had to come to grips with being much, much shorter than they had been when they got on the bus.  There was a girl who was playing bejeweled on her phone, and now found that she now had to sit down and slide her bare bottom on the screen for her phone to even detect her touching the screen.  One business lady was now trying to continue her business call while her phone was quite a few times larger than her.  Completely ignoring the $200 business suit that was now partially crumpled up on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd one couple that now found themselves in an awkward situation with the girlfriend still normal sized, and her boyfriend now under two inches tall.  Their make out session was interrupted and she now had him nestled in her own breasts so that they'd be able to walk and talk, one things for sure, that was going to be a very interesting \"meet the parents\" dinner tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the bus came to their stop, and Alicia quickly got off and headed up to their apartment, trying to make sure the cold stuff stay safe cold.  \"We're here!\" She called out as she opened the door, waking Amy from her nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the computer, she set the remote and Amy down on the table, \"You start your search, I'll put the groceries away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded and began hopping on the keyboard to wake the computer up and start her search for anything similar to the remote.  She did feel a little bad about not helping with the groceries, but what could she do at this size?  After a good minute or two of tiring herself out moving the mouse to open the web browser, she began to slowly type in her search for the remote, trying to be a bit more specific in this search than Alicia's search earlier had been.</span></div></div>",

Their device didn't look right and there was an extra button or three, but otherwise it looked pretty close, the only catch was that her remote didn't have the company's logo anywhere on it.  Not even a faded or drilled place where one had been mounted in the past.  Remembering to bookmark the website for tomorrow, she hopped off the computer desk and began the long trek to the kitchen, all that typing made her hungry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alicia!\" Amy called as he finally stepped on the tiled floor, \"We got any lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia, who'd  just finished putting away all the groceries, looked at her roommate and nodded, \"I think we still have pizza in the fridge...want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded before starting to climb the cabinets to get to the top of the counter as Alicia pulled out the pizza box and grabbed two slices for herself, and took a knife and cut off the tips of each slice, making two tiny pizza slices for her best friend.  Amy shimmied on the cold kitchen counter, hopping from one leg to another and rubbing her hands eagerly, she hadn't had pizza in a while!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the slices were done, Alicia pulled out a desert plate and nudged Amy's slices onto the smaller plate before setting it down in front of her.  \"Bon appetite.\"  She said with a terrible French accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Was all Amy said before grabbing one of her still quite large slices and digging in, watching as her friend easily demolished a slice twenty times her size, it was a little imposing, but she practically grew up with Alicia, their friendship stretching as far back as the third grade.  She knew she'd always be there to help her out.  \"You ready for the party tonight?\"  Amy asked as she finished her first slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia nodded before swallowing her food, \"Yep, I've got everything all set, we'll take a quick shower and be on our way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled and nodded around her mouthful of cheese, \"Sounds like a plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finished eating, the two friends headed to the bathroom, Amy standing on the shampoo rack suction cupped to the wall of the shower while Alicia stripped down and got her towel out.  Once ready and as naked as her roommate, Alicia stepped into the shower and started it up, once it got to a comfortable temperature they started to soap up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy would have Alicia hold the shampoo bottle a squirt a drop out for her, while she could lather with the soap bar just fine.  Drying off was another matter, depending on their schedule Amy would either dry off under the hair dryer or on a hand towel.  The party started pretty soon, so today was a hair dryer day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirmly gripping Alicia's pinky, Amy would have Alicia dry her off with the dryer as quickly as possible, which frizzed up her hair a bit, her curly red hair standing on ends like a little red microphone.  Eventually she'd be able to get it under control, often with a piece of string to make a messy ponytail, but it worked for what limited supplies they had for what her size required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning a bit late, Alicia grabbed her purse by the computer desk, not noticing the remote had rolled into it after she bumped the desk trying to grab her purse in a hurry.  Quickly double checking herself, Alicia made sure she had everything/one important: purse, Amy, wallet, clothes.  Check, check, check, and check!  They were good to go!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Heading out the apartment complex, Alicia and Amy were deciding on whether to take a taxi or an Under car, since no buses would be coming by for a good 45 minutes, and they wanted to get there on time, not after all the good party foods are eaten.  While they were debating the issue, a lady jogger found herself struggling to get out from under some sweaty booty shorts and sports bra before continuing on her way, trying to meet a time goal for this jog that she'd never reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter deciding to take an Under, the roommates made sure that they were in a spot that the driver could pull up to, the swaying of the purse firing off the remote in a few directions.  A few Girl Scouts found themselves now far taller than their parents, and tried to handle the cookie boxes without crushing them as people purchased them from the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hot dog vendor found himself much smaller than his product, and he struggled to even open the buns, much less even move them.  To say nothing of his new inability to use the tongs to grab the hot dogs, the poor vendor was forced to let the customers do all the work, and hope that they'd pay him and not run off with a free hot dog.  Like that ten year old kid that ran off with three for him and his friends, calling him \"shorty\" and warning him not to call the cops, the poor vendor found his business at the mercy of the people on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a kindergarten teacher found herself far shorter than her charges all of a sudden.  The teacher managed to keep tenuous control of the class, but it was obvious that if the kids ever decided to disobey her, she couldn't really do anything to stop them.  Not to mention that the class was doing finger painting today, so she was going to have to do her best to not get messy, or used as a paintbrush...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a policewoman who was filling out a parking ticket found herself weighed down under her hat for a good few minutes before she was able to worm her way out and attempted to hand the ticket to the driver.  But she encountered two problems there: first, the notepad weighed more than her, second, she couldn't reach the window anymore.  So she yelled up to the diver to open his door and take the ticket, which the driver did, still fearing getting a heavier fine for not listening to a cop just because she was extremely tiny.  Once the driver had his ticket and drove off, the policewoman started to continue her foot route, or tried to at least, dragging her pen, badge and notepad was impossible at her size, though that didn't stop the girl from trying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, the Under ride got to Alicia and Amy on time, and they hopped into his car and enjoyed looking at the city sights, a giant trashman tossing trash bags into his partners truck, an inch and half tall drummer hopping on his drum, tapping out a simple song.  A waiter serving two normal sized plates of steak and potatoes to a shrunken naked couple who couldn't even hold their forks, or even drink from their massive wine glasses.  And a tiny naked police woman sprawled out on her badge as she tried to cool down from trying to move her stuff earlier, flinching each time someone stepped just a little too close for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The city is always full of something going on, isn't it?\"  Amy asked, watching two fifty foot tall guys playing basketball with their normal sized friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia nodded, admiring the giant naked basketball players bodies, \"Yeah....\" she sighed, if only such a relationship could work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally their ride arrived at their friends townhouse where the party would be held, and already a few people had already shown up.  \"Thanks for the ride!\"  Alicia called as she stepped out of the car, not noticing the flash that caused the driver to no longer be able to reach his steering wheel or pedals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\"  The (former) driver called out, trying to free himself from his oversized shirt and figure out how to drive his car home in time for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls!  You made it!\"  Their friend Ashley greeted them at the door, hugging Alicia (and Amy by proxy), \"Come on in!  The party just started!\"  As Alicia stepped through the doorway, Ashley closed the door behind them, the faint sound of pop music could be heard even across the street from the party.</span></div></div>",

Drinks on table!  Pool out back!\"  Alicia nodded, showing the diminutive hostess that she'd heard her.  \"I'm checking on others!

Alicia, meanwhile, was looking for a place to put her purse, not noticing that all the swinging it was doing was setting the remote off like a strobe light, growing and shrinking the various partygoers at random.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\"  Alicia said when she found the coat room, and everyone else's purses, \"Here we are!\"  And after dropping off her purse, she turned and headed out into the party, noticing several little islands of clothing and tiny naked people dancing and chatting, while a thirty foot guy and girl relaxed by the pool, soaking their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was enjoying the party so far, plenty of food, lots of people here her size, and some friends she\u2019d been meaning to talk to.  \u201cSharon! Is that you?\u201d  Any called out to a shrunken girl who looked about eight months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon was reclining in a margarita glass filled with ginger ale, and looked over at the voice calling her name.  \u201cAmy!  Oh my gosh it\u2019s been so long!\u201d  She gestured for Amy to hop up and join her in the soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right?\u201d  Amy asked as she climbed a nearby cake and slid into the glass, her two gram body barely making a ripple.  Swimming over next to her friend, she reclined next to Susan, \u201cSo, how\u2019s the bun in the oven?\u201d  She asked as she patted Susan\u2019s very pregnant belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s been a ride,\u201d Susan laughed as she drank a handful of the soda, \u201cI\u2019ve hade so many cravings and poor Tom has had to deal with me whining about by aching back, feet and breasts.\u201d  She gestured over to a man who\u2019d remained unaffected by the remote talking to a group of shrunken guys (and one twenty foot one) about sports.  \u201cBut he\u2019s patient and has been willing to deal with my complaints like a trooper.\u201d  She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed, \u201cI wish I could find a nice guy, but I\u2019ve got problems finding any my size, or any larger that\u2019d be willing to date me!\u201d  She pointed at Tom in the distance, \u201cHow\u2019d you get him, and does he have a brother?\u201d  But Susan\u2019s response was cut off as a bubble drifted right up between Amy\u2019s butt cheeks, making her squeak and shiver as it slid up her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Alicia was enjoying the company of several friends in the living room, many of whom now barely came up to her ankles.  Though the friendships and conversations remained the same, there were some different things happening, like some of the shrunken couples simply going under or behind furniture rather than go upstairs.  This was less so because of not wanting to, rather than practicality, make out sessions weren\u2019t as fun when both were dead tired from climbing a carpeted mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d Alicia\u2019s blonde friend Alice started, leaning in, \u201chave you got a man yet or what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia blushed a bit, looking down at her drink, \u201cNot yet, between work and helping Amy get around, unless we double date, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll find one soon.\u201d  She looked up quickly realizing how that came out, \u201cNot that I wish I wasn\u2019t rooming with Amy, but she\u2019s been insecure around guys after her last failed blind date.  So I\u2019ve been trying to help her out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice backed up a bit, realizing she\u2019d struck a nerve, \u201cHey, it\u2019s alright, wanna go out back and take a swim?\u201d  Alice pointed to the back door leading to the pool where the largest of the guests were hanging out chatting.  \u201cWe should have spare swimsuits upstairs.\u201d  She added.</span></div></div>",

I could go for a swim!\"  Alicia said, and followed Alice up the stairs to the guest bedroom where Alice went into a closet for a moment and came back out with a neon pink bikini, and held it up for Alicia to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all we've got in your size.\"  Alice said with a twinge of jealousy at the black girls massive mammaries, \"Go ahead and change, I'll run and change in my room.\"  And at that, she left Alicia alone in the guest room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Alicia stripped down and slid herself into the bikini, admiring how it hugged her body in the mirror, and headed down the stairs with her clothes bundled up in her arms.  Each step causing her practically unsupported breasts to bounce and shake as she headed over to the coat room to place her clothes where she'd remember them.  Looking at her purse, she decided to bring it out with her to the pool, just in case she got a phone call, she'd bring just her phone, but the purse would keep it dry in case of splashes that the poolgoers caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading to the pool through the kitchen, she saw Amy and...Sharon if she remembered correctly chatting away while sitting in a margarita glass.  \"Hey Amy, I'm gonna be out by the pool!\"  She called over to her friend who nodded and waved, returning to her conversation with her pregnant friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\"  Alice said as she came up to Alicia, throwing an arm over her shoulder, \"Let's go for a dip!\"  She grabbed a pool noodle and hopped in the pool, a little wave splashing Alicia's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me put my purse down real quick.\"  But she didn't realize just how much of a jostle that her purse received from being carelessly plopped on the table, setting the remote off, and in two quick flashes, Alice was a tiny naked girl sitting on the now massive pool noodle, and Alicia found herself buried under her bikini top.  \"Who dropped this on me?\"  Alicia called out as she finally got the top off her body, looking around, but nobody was close enough to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that the issue wasn't worth pressing, she started walking toward the pool, a trip that took about five minute mind you, before diving into the gentle waves of the pool.  Her tiny inch and a half body a little black speck in the water as she swam to the pool noodle that Alice was straddling as she tried to prevent herself from falling into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The water sure is warm!\"  Alicia said as she was pulled onto the noodle by Alice, \"This was a good idea Alice, just what I needed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice smiled at her friend, \"I'm glad,\" looking over at the inflatable chair that several other shrunken partygoers were dancing on, she nudged Alicia, \"c'mon, lets join them!\"  And she dove into the water and began to swim to the chair, Alicia, feeling like something was different, but unable to place the feeling, followed her friend.  One the two of them joined the other people on the chair, a mini dance party was being held as the various shrunken men and women danced away to the pop music.  All the while everyone was oblivious to the large number of discarded swimsuits in the bottom of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy meanwhile had dried herself off with a napkin and was busy scaling the chocolate cake with Sharon, her pregnant friend having reached the top first, began to eat out a sizable hole into the cake, letting her chocolate cravings run wild.  Amy giggled and looked out the nearby window, watching the shrunken Alicia and the other tiny people on the inflatable chair have a mini rave in the middle of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll join them.\"  See you later Sharon!\"  Amy called as she hopped down the cake, her pregnant friend waving in Amy's general direction as she dug herself deeper into the chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce down on the countertop, Amy looked around for a spot where she would be able to get to the pool without too many people in the way.  Finding one, she hopped down and began the long trek to the pool, but as she walked out under a table, she heard Alicia's phone ringing above her.  Looking up, the phone was vibrating itself out of the knocked over purse, and the remote was rolling slowly to the edge of the table, before falling and enveloping Amy in a bright flash of light.  Once again back to her normal height of 5' 10\", Amy panicked as she realized that she was now naked in public, unaware of having already spent a sizable part of the day naked already.  Covering herself, she ran back inside and thankfully, there were several piles of abandoned clothes she could dig through, successfully putting together an outfit with a white tank top and a too-short mini skirt, as long as she didn't bend over or squat, her modesty would be preserved.  Though no underwear her size could be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up Alicia's phone, she saw that it was their boss, who'd left a text message asking if they could come in early.  \"Hey Alicia!\"  Amy called out, getting the tiny black girls attention, \"Our boss left a message!\"  She waved the phone in the air for Alicia to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Alicia hopped back into the water and swam for the steps, where Amy helped her out, and let Alicia sit on the screen to enter the unlock code, hopping on her butt from number to number.  Once unlocked, Alicia played the voicemail, and sighed, \"I guess we gotta go home early Amy.  We've gotta leave for work extra early tomorrow for that board meeting that was scheduled for next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in agreement, Amy picked up her friend and carried her out in Alicia's purse, situated right between her own phone and wallet.  Amy would've let Alicia ride between her breasts, but they weren't that big compared to Alicia's (proportionately), and as such wouldn't be much of a comfortable ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick Under car ride home, and the two got ready for bed.</span></div></div>",

As the two went about there normal routine of getting ready for bed. It became incredibly hard for Alicia to move around in the bathroom to try and ready herself for bed. In the end Amy had to help and Alicia ended up trying to use the toothbrush, though it was as big as her. After finishing up, Alicia hopped down and went for her room. Thankfully the door was already open. As Alicia entered her room, she though to herself why she had decided to get a bed way too big for her size. However she pushed the though aside as she began to climb the bed sheets up to the top. After a minute of struggling, she finally managed to get to the top and begin to move towards the massive pillows. Settling under the covers, Alicia soon fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had wondered how her roommate had always managed living in this house with her, and why was Alicia's stuff all to big for her, including her bed. She just assumed it was Alicia's determination to try and be \"normal\", even though Amy had told her that is was fine being her size and that quite a few people were just like her. After watching her friend enter her bedroom, Amy went to the kitchen to turn off the lights, however not before grabbing the device from Alicia's purse and bringing it back to her bedroom with her. Making it to her room and shutting the door, Amy placed the device on her nightstand, before switching to her bra and panties and flopping down onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the side lamp on as she grabbed and inspected the device. She still couldn't fathom how Alexi didn't see anything of real value in the thing. Flipping the device over, she saw what looked to be the batteries slot cover. Thinking maybe it just wasn't powered, she popped of the cover. To her surprise there was not batteries, but instead a whole slew of buttons and knobs all labeled with what looked to be many settings. She saw what said clothed On/Off switch, flicking it to on, she waited, yet nothing happened. Disappointed she tried another Random power mode On/Off. Again flicking it on, nothing happened. Setting the device back to the side of the nightstand, Amy went to turn off the lamp and turn over to go to bed. Tomorrow she would mess with the thing more and maybe try to find another buyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night pasted on, and the city feel calm, Quite a lot had happened in one day. Now across town more than 100 people now ranged for different sizes. Some only a Inch and half, while others towered over homes. Though these differences in size would normally cause mass panic, the world continued on as everything was normal. Though the world had unknowing accepted these changes as previous fact, the world physically didn't chance causing unknown amount of accidental damages and many lost people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the party goers was heading home, this happened to be Rachel, one of Amy's and Alicia's friends. She had blonde hair in a pony tail and was shorter than Amy but still had a good figure to boot, or she was. During the party Rachel had been one of the few out in the pool when Alicia and Amy had arrived. In the issuing chaos of the device firing, she had been hit while swimming in the pool. She soon ended up getting out of the pool, due to her growing in size too about 50' in size. of course she pondered why she had tried to swim in such a tiny pool for her size. She then had spent the rest of the time enjoying what she could of the tiny party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the street one the way to her home that she now WAY to big for. Rachel hummed to herself, enjoying the sights and night air. Passing by Amy and Alicia's home, she payed no mind, she ended up causing minor shakes as she walked. This vibration was all that was needed for Amy's book to fall over onto the device. As the device fired at Amy, still asleep on her bed she...</span></div></div>",

Crawling up and out to take a peek, hoping that it wasn't damaged, she was relieved when she saw no apparent damage to the remote, and curled back up under her covers for a nice relaxing sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Amy and Alicia slept soundly, poor Alicia and Ashley had spent almost an hour trying to get their house cleaned up after the party, but in that time they only succeeded in getting a red plastic cup into the trash can by rolling it.  Neither was large enough to wash the dishes or put away leftover food, and already tired from the party, they decided they'd just work on it when they could.  Trying to get to bed was another adventure, as climbing the stairs was like climbing a mountain at their size, it'd be some time before they got to their beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon and Tom meanwhile, had a relatively normal night, including Tom going out to sleep in the guest bedroom because his wife had the tendency to kick <i>really</i> hard when she slept.  Neither of them realizing that with her new size, there was no way she'd be able to kick him unless she was sleeping on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring her walk home, Rachel had been enjoying the cool city air, not noticing how she was literally strolling down main street without a single stitch of clothing to cover her body.  Of course, it's possible that she <b>did</b> know, but didn't care because of the effects of the remote, once she got to her house, she then had to puzzle out how she even got inside to sleep.  And so, the majestic scene of a gigantic naked blonde tiptoeing around her normal sized house, trying to find a watch inside was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came in the usual calm it normally did, the two tiny naked roommates hopping out of bed and taking the half hour strolls from their rooms to the kitchen.  \"Morning Alicia!\"  Amy called to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Amy!\"  Alicia responded as the two began to shimmy their way up the kitchen stool, intent on getting breakfast.  Once on the countertop, the two looked at the massive wall of fridge, trying to figure out how they opened the fridge to get food, much less put in all those fresh groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith neither of them coming up with a solution, the two naked tiny friends headed over to the fruit bowl and dug into a blueberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got all the papers for the meeting today, right Amy?\"  Alicia asked as she's took another bite out of her piece of berry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded, swallowing before answering, \"Yep!  All organized on the computer desk.\"  She pointed at the now skyscraper sized desk over in the living room.  \"Once we're done getting ready, we just grab it and go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia smiled and nodded, \"Sounds like a plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them realized of course that this would be an impossible task to do, as neither of them were strong enough to actually <i>move</i> the folder any more, even if they worked together.  But they'd get to that soon enough, for now the two were done with their blueberry and were heading over to the sink to wash themselves of all the juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we reach the faucet?\"  Amy asked as she looked over at the distance to the faucet, she wasn't blind to the dangers of getting stuck in the smooth chrome walls of the sink, despite the effects of the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure...\" Alicia muttered, trying to find a way out there, but failing, \"Let's just wipe ourselves off with a paper towel and get the rest of our stuff going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgreeing, Amy and her friend did just that, and then the realities of living as two inch and a half tall girls without a normal sized person around began to show...</span></div></div>",

Even though the walk there took almost 45 minutes, they didn't see that as a problem, the problems started once they hopped into their shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd we ever get this thing started?\"  Amy asked Alicia, scratching an itch in her bush absentmindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia, also looking up at the shower handle, was dumbfounded trying to figure how they showered in previously days, remembering the shower that took yesterday before that party, but not how they turned the shower on.  \"I have no idea.\"  She answered amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the shower for anything to climb was useless, the smooth walls offered no grip, and the handle would have to be turned almost the whole way around to get hot water.  Amy and Alicia were beginning to give up on taking their shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could use the bathroom sink?\"  Alicia suggested, unable to think of anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about the shape of the bathroom sink, Amy realized that it could work, it had a shallow basin they could climb in and out of, and a handle they could lift to start their shower.  \"That works!  Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce done climbing up the sink, the two naked mini girls stood carefully on top of the sink faucet and got right under the handle.  The two braced themselves up against it and pushed with all their might, giving it everything they had, only to nudge it up just a little bit, starting a steady drip from the faucet.  When it was clear that their pushing wouldn't get it to go any higher, Amy and Alicia stopped and headed down into the sink to shower under the marginally warm water dripping down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Amy said in between drops that soaked her all the way through, \"it's  not the shower...but it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia, trying to keep her dreadlocks dry, nodded, \"Dont worry, soon we'll remember how we used the shower, today's just a fluke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, across the city, hundreds of similarly affected people were waking up and finding their morning routines far harder than they remembered, or impossible to complete.  The policewoman who'd been shrunk on Amy and Alicia's way to the party had been unable to complete her foot patrol route, and after a reprimand by her superiors, was reassigned to a patrol car instead.  The tiny naked officer found herself sitting on her partners shoulder during debriefing, wondering how she was going to use the radar gun or the laptop while in the car.  Not to mention the fact that she was too small for seatbelts to do more than bury her underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexi and Sally found themselves unable to finish restocking the shelves due to their small size, and so they were trying to set up their office for interviews with a new employee.  'Trying' being the operative word here since they were too small to really clean up or reorganize Alexi's desk aside from moving a piece of paper or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice and Ashley, tired from climbing their stairs last night, found themselves trying to continue cleaning their house after the party, and couldn't.  Alice settled for hiring a maid to come in and clean up since they weren't getting anywhere on their own.  Which meant that they first had to find a maid service via phone or somputer search.  Alice and Ashley were hopping on their bare bottoms in tandem on Alice's phone to type out their search query for an affordable maid service (at their size, hands and feet aren't detected by the phones).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel, who'd  been unable to find a way into her house last night due to her new fifty foot height, was forced to sleep in the backyard, her massive butt pointed right at her neighbors living room.  Of course, neither saw anything wrong with this picture, aside from Rachel sleeping outside instead of inside her house.  Waking up with some branches in her hair, Rachel brushed them out as best she could as she stretched, before heading downtown to that breakfast nook on the corner she liked.  If she couldn't make breakfast for herself, she could still order it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Amy and Alicia, the two had finished their impromptu shower and the challenge of brushing their teeth when their toothbrush was ten times their size.  Amy dried her hair on the discarded hand towel sitting on the countertop after they dried off from their shower, using a loose string to make a very loose ponytail out of her curly red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, lets go get that folder and be on our way.\"  Alicia called as she hopped down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Amy called, catching up to her friend, \"I've got to make my bed, forgot when I woke up.\"  She explained, not realizing that the small part she'd used was pretty much unnoticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you gotta make your bed?\" Alicia asked, \"Ain't like we got any company coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy blushed, nudging at the carpet with her foot, \"Just a habit mom had me do everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Alicia said she'd meet her by the door with the folder while Amy went and made her bed.  Upon entering her room to make her bed, does she get returned to normal by the remote?</span></div></div>",

As she walked over, she realized that it was going to be a lot harder for her to get up onto the bed than off at her size. Though she didn't know how she had gotten up on it last night. Not wanting to walk all the way too the front door to get Alicia, Amy pushed on to find a way up onto the bed. Looking around she soon spotted a convenient pile of books and boxes that made the perfect place to climb up to her nightstand, and then to her bed. Amy soon began climbing the stack of books towards the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of climbing, Amy finally made it to the top of the nightstand. Thankfully she had this large stack of books from her collage courses. She soon hopped of the top book and onto the nightstand. She walked passed the sitting device, paying it no mind. She got the gap between her bed and the nightstand. Doing a running jump, she managed to land on the bed. Once she got to the middle she contemplated on how she was going to do this, as her sheets were like giant walls around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy went and tried to pull the she cover up, the top book on the stack she had climbed on slowly began to slide, before falling down onto the nightstand. As the book fell, it landed on the device. Firing the device, the room was then engulfed in a bright light. Amy uncovered her eyes and found herself standing on her bed, naked. She jumped down and questioned why she had jumped onto the bed and was naked to make the bed. Shrugging it off she went about cleaning up the bed and making it. Now that she was back to about her original size, she finished making the bed quickly .She was a bit taller than she was, as the device was still on random power input mode allowing for a multitude of growth ranges to be achieved, but she didn't notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Amy went to put on some clothes, however most of her clothes didn't fit her. She wondered why she didn't have any clothes for her size. She had always been around 6' and 5\" tall she thought to herself. Thankfully she found a tank top and some shorts to put on, though they were a bit tight as well. As she was about to leave, she went to the nightstand and grabbed the device. She though that maybe later her and Alicia could maybe look around town for another buyer. Walking out of the room and towards the kitchen, Amy found Alicia struggling to move the giant folder with her tiny size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Amy mind some help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, don't know why you tried, i'm normally the one who carries the big things.\" Amy said reaching down and grabbing the folder from Alicia, and putting it in Alicia's purse. \"Yeah, I don't know why I was trying...\" Alicia said sounding a bit defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy putting the folder and device in the purse, put it over her shoulder and went and opened the door, heading out. Looking outside, Amy couldn't believe how many pot holes were littered on the street. The city, really needed to sent some construction workers soon to fix it. As she was about to walk, she remembered she had to grab Alicia. Looking down to her right she found Alicia standing waiting for Amy to pick her up. As Amy reached down, the device, which she had placed on the top edge of the purse fell out, Cursing under her breath when she noticed the device fall. The device Hit the ground firing a random burst...</span></div></div>",

She didn't know what was causing all this bright flashes lately, must be reflections of sunlight or something. Standing still for a second she quickly remembers that she was grabbing Alicia to put in the purse. Amy bended down on her knees to grab Alicia, who was patiently waiting for her to pick her up. Of course unaware to anybody, Amy had now doubled in size and was 12' and 10\" tall. Of course due to the settings Amy acted normal, as well her tank top and shorts managed to remain her size due to the setting, though were still tight and revealing. After managing to bend down and grab Alicia and the device, and putting them in the relatively small purse to Amy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, ready to go!\" Amy enthusiastically said to Alicia in the purse as she began walking down the street towards there destination. Walking down the street, Amy still couldn't believe the city had let the roads get so bad, Its like they weren't used to giants and giantesses walking about. Alicia though that she was lucky to have such a big friend like Amy, as travel anywhere at her size was hard, plus Amy was able to get around faster due to her tall stature. Amy continued to walk with Alicia in tow, they passed by  a couple of people who had been effected by the device earlier. With the new day, many tired to continue their schedule as normal, though peoples new sizes were effecting that. Their were tines who had barely managed to just get the paper this entire morning and now getting ready for jobs they certainly would be late too. On the other extreme giants and giantesses tried to continue their lives as if they were normal sized, They left remains of parts of their homes and other personal belongings damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy continued on, soon entering into downtown. thankfully it wasn't to chaotic as only less than 200 people had been effected in some way by the device. As they made their way towards the office for the financial loan company, Amy soon spotted her friend Rachel, they had remained friends since middle school, even after Rachel's \"massive\" puberty growth spurt. However things weren't looking good for her as she was begging for the manager of the place not to call the police and that she could pay for the truck load of food she had ordered just to satisfy her appetite. She sat cross legged next to the building, taking up almost half of the parking lot and back against a near by apartment building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy felt sorry for her friend, thinking maybe to go help her, but she had to get Alicia to the loan company. Maybe afterwards she would go meet back up with Rachel and do things with her and Alicia. However, watching the scene unfold, Amy missed the foot shaped pot hole left by Rachel entering the parking lot. This caused Alicia to fall out of the purse along with the device.</span></div></div>",

As she did the purse with Alicia and the device inside fell onto the concrete below. Both bracing for the fall, didn't see the flash go off as the device hit the pavement, before Alicia landed on top of it, firing it at Amy. After felling her hands hit the ground, Amy opened her eyes and looked down to see if Alicia was alright. Thankfully, though hard to see, Alicia seemed alright. It was hard for Amy to notice her friend, now standing at about 60' in size. Amy pushed herself up onto her knees, leaving hand shaped imprints on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright Alicia? Sorry I wasn't watching where I was walking...\" Amy yelled concernedly down to her tiny friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think so, just watch were your stepping next time. Now lets go to the place before we're late\" Alicia screamed at Amy so she could hear her. Amy, carefully reached down to grab the purse she had dropped, as Alicia dragged herself and any lose items, including the device, back into the purse. Amy couldn't believe how clumsy she had been, at her size, she could have killed someone. Thankfully the streets weren't congested today. Very Carefully, Amy managed to pick up the purse with her pinky finger, though even that was a bit to big to comfortably carry the purse. Amy pondered why and how she had managed to carry Alicia's purse this morning? Still no one couldn't notice or realize the rapid shifts in peoples' sizes. Putting that though to the back of her mind she stood back up at her full 60' height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel on the other hand was still so stressed out over her situation. Not only did her breakfast cost way more than normal for some reason, but that she didn't have her wallet with her, as she had left in her house yesterday evening, before the party. She didn't know how she had, seeing as she had to sleep in the yard last night. Not enjoying the stress of the managers vulgar words and threats ,Rachel looking up noticed Amy standing on the street. Thinking maybe she could help her with her situation with the manager and bill, called her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Amy! Over here!\" Rachel yield towards Amy. Amy quickly looked to her right and not wanting to be rude, walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Rachel, long time no see, weren't you at the party last night?\" Amy said waving her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhh, yeah I was outside at the pool, couldn't head inside...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, OK. Yeah I was inside, talking with the others inside.\" The tow conversed, not even comprehending they were vastly different sizes last night. The manager snaps to get Rachel's attention and asks one last time to pay the bill. Embarrassed, Rachel soon looks towards Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Amy, hope you can do me a favor, this guy needs for me to pay for breakfast, but sadly I left my wallet at home in the house. Do you mind footing the bill, just this once, I promise to pay you back.\" Amy, though still in a rush to get her and Alicia to the loan company, couldn't leave her friend like this. Pulling up the tiny purse to her face, she asks Alicia, if she still had her credit card in the purse. Alicia soon disappeared into the purse, digging around. After a couple seconds, Alicia poked her head out, hold a credit card, which was half her size. Amy, afraid to try and grab it with her hands, lowered the purse with Alicia down to the manager. Handing the card to the manager, her scoffs and walks back inside to ring the card and bring back the bill to sign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel, sighed in re-leaf. She couldn't believe how expensive the food was for her. She had always came her before and ordered food, but for much cheaper. What ever caused this place's spike in price didn't matter, she planned on not coming here again. Looking up at Amy, the two began to talk about recent happenings and how they were both doing. After talking a bit, Amy soon asked what Rachel was doing today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, why?\" Rachel asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well after we go the loan company, I though maybe we could hang out and go somewhere, all three of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, sure. Hey what about the beach, its so nice this time of year, plus I need to start getting a tan..\" Rachel responded. Amy nodded and agreed to the plan, as well as Alicia. Soon the Manager arrived back to the table with the card and bill. Amy attempted to sign it though with how tiny the pen was to her and the area to sign, she ended up just squiggling over the receipt. The manager gave the card back to Alicia and began to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her talk with Rachel and dealing with her bill, Amy soon waved by as she walked out of the small parking lot, trying not to step on anyone. As she goes around the corner, She bumps her hand holding the purse, throwing Alicia and the device around a bit. Suddenly a burst flies out the device back towards the cafe. As luck would have it, a pair of moving guys were caring a mirror out of the near by apartment building. this splitting the beam as it made contact with two people. Rachel soon got up and began to make her way out of the parking lot, soon running for cover, asking herself, why she was naked, what was with the giant crater in the one half of the parking lot and why was she sitting their? As well the Manager continued to walk inside though, it would take a while, with him now begin less than 1\" tall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy continued walking down the city streets and blocks, traversing the city at her massive size was a bit difficult. She had to watch out of pedestrians, light posts, cars, and other things to not crush. Again she wondered how she had managed to go too the clothes store in town at this size, ignoring the fact that, other than the revealing tank top and shorts she wore, no normal clothing would fit her. She soon spotted the 6 story building, that was the loan company. She soon stopped in front of it, now realizing there was no way she could get inside at her size. As she though of what to do now, she soon realized she had to move quick as cars were now honking below her as her feet blocked a 3 way in front of the building. Lifting up her left leg in surprise and quickly apologizing to the people below, Amy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Seeing this as the best option, she lifted the tiny purse to her face, where Alicia was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Alicia, do you mind going in and meet with the board, maybe even see if they can have the meeting in a room next to the windows?\" Amy spoke to her tiny friend, who was poking out of the purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Amy, Sorry about this, I forgot how tall you really are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's OK, I sometimes forget myself too..\" Amy responded waving her hand in jest. Amy soon bended down to place Alicia at the front entrance of the building, for her to walk in to. Amy then layed out her open left palm for Alicia to land on, as she lowered her down to the ground, as Alicia began to climb off her friend's massive hand. As Amy began to stand back up, Alicia realized she had forgot the folder in the purse. She soon looked up at Amy and begin to yell to get her attention about the folder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough unable to make out the words tiny friend Alicia were saying, Amy suddenly took notice and shift quickly to try and here what her friend was saying.

Alicia, still yelling up to gain the attention of Amy, didn't notice the purse falling and it hitting the ground. Thankfully the thick leather purse absorbed the impact of the fall, but not enough for the device to activate as it's pointing straight at Alicia.

Alicia sighing quickly begins to help Amy look for the purse and belongings. As the one hot red head and and busty naked woman began to bend down, having to squint and fell around with their fingers, Pedestrians and traffic continued on as normal. It was quite hard for the two giant girls to bend down and look around for the device. Amy unknowingly lightly setting her butt down onto a parked city bus. Thankfully, she wasn't applying force down onto the bus, though the bus driver did act slightly annoyed and passengers ignored the giant looming ass over them. Alicia had also bumped into a few street lights as she squatted and moved around, her giant breasts and ass jiggling around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of no luck, Amy soon notices the purse next to a park bench with the stuff inside strewn about. Seeing a guy in a suit and drinking his coffee, Amy quickly gets the guy's attentions. felling Amy's giant index finger tap him on the shoulder, the man looks up at Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey excuse me, sir. Do you mind helping me get me and my friend's purse and belongings? thank you..\" Amy says staring down at the man, brushing some of her long hair away from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" the man responded before moving over to his side and grabbing the purse and belongings and putting it all together. As her puts the last item in he accidentally activates the device. Thanking the man again. Amy picked up the purse carefully with her large fingers, as the now 1' man went back to drinking his coffee which was now twice as big as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, got it! phew, though I lost it. Anyways..... here .... it is...\" Amy said, delicately pulling the folder out of the purse and dropping it into Alicia's hands. Having what she needed, Alicia turned back to the front entrance, before freezing for a second. Why was she going to go inside? She knew Amy wouldn't fit, but how did she think in her right mind, she herself was going too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey Amy. How did we plan on going about this..\" Alicia says dumbstruck on what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe just ask the receptionist down below about our meeting and she can direct us to the room?\" Amy said, shrugging, before quickly jumping at the loud burst of a car horn, and lifting her right leg to allow the angry driver though. Alicia seeing no better option, quickly bent down soon taking up most of the street as she tried to look into the lobby for the receptionist. Spotting her she quickly got her attention. the lady looked up calmly at Alicia's face peering through the front entrance. She calmly asked if she had a appointment. After explaining the situation to the receptionist. She told Alicia that the meeting was begin held on the far side corner of the 5th floor. Thanking the woman, Alicia soon forced herself up and informing Amy of the meeting room. The two giant girls began to walk around the building to where the meeting was. Thankfully there was a parking lot area on that side, giving the two massive girls space to move and stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two soon spot the room and see that the other people where already in there seats waiting for them. The two made their way up close to the window and greeted themselves. The board members took notice and greeted them as well, telling them to get this meeting started, and asking for the required paper work. Alicia put her hand up to the window, before one of the people got up and opened the window and grabbed it. The meeting soon began as the board members began to discuss Amy and Alicia's loan request for the new car the two were asking for. Even though the two girls were now WAY to big to fit in any kind of vehicle, the board still considered the proposal as normal. Alicia listened intently to the meeting, while Amy was bending down with her hands on her knees trying to see into the room. After discussing the proposal some more, the board came to the conclusion to green light the loan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanking the people so much, Alicia attempted to shake the hand of the lead board member, however ended up shaking hand and large pinky finger due to her size. As the members left the room, Alicia turned back excitedly to Amy before screaming in delight and hugging each other. They jumped in glee over the loan place accepting the deal. Each one of their jumps shook the parking lot and set of multiple car alarms. As well firing the device at random people head in and out of the building. Now people ranging form close to a millimeter and as big as half of Amy's size. After calming down the two decided to head home and get ready for the beach meetup with Rachel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy at 60' and Alicia at 50' respectively, began to walk back towards their home through the city, both taking up the entire width of the tight city streets.

The two made their way towards the suburbs where the home was at. As hard as they tried the two massive girls unintentionally left depressions in the street of their large feet and as well bumbled into many street lights along their walk home avoiding to step on any cars on the road. Soon the two girls arrived at there place a mere 10 minutes after leaving the loan place, which had taken them a hour to get too before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls stopped in front of their home, it became apparent to the two that they were going to have trouble trying to get inside the tiny house. Let alone one of them managing to FIT inside it. Amy soon got to her knees and elbows inspecting their small house. Alicia went around back to check for anyway for the two to get inside. As Amy inspected the their house she couldn't understand why they couldn't even fit inside their home. She knew that her and Alicia had always been 60' and 50' tall respectively for as long as she could remember, and knew their house was way to small for them at their size. However she knew the two had left from inside the house earlier before. As well as she looked into her tiny bed room through the window, she wondered where she had fit her massive tank top and booty shorts in such a tiny room. the two items alone would fill up her bedroom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy dug around the house wondering what was wrong and how to get inside, She accidentally presses her left hand, which was holding Alicia's purse in it onto the ground, activating the device and firing a couple flashes of light. Amy soon found herself laying in her front yard on the ground, holding Alicia's purse on her arm. She had managed to shrink back to original height of 5'10\" . Across the lawn at her neighbors driveway, their family found themselves all sitting in their SUV getting read to go get some lunch. However now the couple in the front and their two kids in the back, all stood in their massive SUV at less than 1\" tall. The family struggled to figure out how to drive somewhere to get something to eat, let along now open the doors of the SUV at their sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to her feet, Amy looked up and spotted Alicia's head over the backside of the house, still looking for a way in. Amy, grabbed the purse and keys and headed inside. upon entering, she headed for the kitchen. As she entered, she found Alicia's massive face peering through the large sliding glass doors that lead to the back yard. Amy proceeded to open them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how did you find a way inside?\" Alicia asked Amy, as reality was trying to catch up to their sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just walked in through the front door, like I always do. Don't you remember that you can fit in here..\" Amy said, though second guessing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah.. I could have sworn... never mind. Just get ready and I'll take us to meet Rachel for the beach...\" Alicia said a bit sadden that she wouldn't be able to get inside and put on her nice new one piece swimsuit, though it wouldn't fit her anyways at this size. Nodding, Amy proceeded to head for her bedroom to change, however nor before dropping the purse on the kitchen table.

In a flash, Alicia soon found herself laying on their back porch, now returned to her original size, though she just takes it that she's always remained this way. She does question why she was just laying on the porch outside, and why there was giant feet imprints in the backyard. Strolling on inside, Alicia continued down the all back to her room to now get ready for the evening at the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half a hour passes by as the two girls get there clothing and beach stuff ready. They had packed a couple of towels, sun lotion, and a few other miscellaneous things. Amy was in her room, as she finished putting on her yellow two piece bikini for the beach. She always had kept this pair, as her and Alicia had enjoyed going down to the beach form time to time. Looking in the mirror in her room, she walked out and went to put some backup clothes in their bag they were bringing. As she puts her things in the bag in the kitchen, her attention is brought back to the device laying now on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy remembered she had forgot to see if pawn shop in town had wanted it. seeing that she had already made plans with Rachel this evening, she decide to put that excursion on hold for the time being. Still intrigued by the thing, Amy walks back into the bathroom with the device, as she flips it over and continues to inspect the buttons and switches on the back. She found a knob labeled instant or hold-and-press as well as something called B___ something, it was hard to tell as the text had been worn off to the point of being unintelligible. She thinks maybe now the device might work, as she feels it vibrate for a second. Intrigued as she looks it up and down, she ends up firing at herself. Suddenly her flat chest and butt begin to expand. She manages to hold down the button for only a few seconds before letting it go, still not seeing anything work with the thing. Of course, Amy's simple flat chest had now became DD to E sized cups and her butt had filled way more out to fit her figure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy continues to look at the device, unaware of any changes at all, Alicia walks in to make sure she's ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Amy, ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure... I still can't believe this think can't seem to get to work...\" Amy said focused down at the device. Just as Alicia begins to inspect herself in the mirror. Amy gives the buttons a press, unintentionally targeting Alicia. Suddenly her friend's breasts and butt begin to expand soon looking almost a big a large watermelons. Just like Amy, her one piece swimsuit grows with her body's shape. Of course again Alicia doesn't even flinch, believe she had always had such extreme proportions. However this unknown gift to her is short lived as Amy hits the shrink button, diminishing Alicia's breast and butt size, until it becomes smaller than she had before, now leaving her at a C cup size and only a decently size butt. Sighing in frustration, Amy flips the device over, switching the B____ switch off, but leaving all the previous setting the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls leave the bathroom and head into the kitchen to grab their things. Amy puts the device into the beach bag, still determined to figure the damn thing out. As the two girls grab their things, they here a knock at the door.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a 30 minute bumpy ride in the car, the 3 girls make it to the local beach. After pulling into a parking spot and unloading their things, the three make their way over the dunes onto the beach. Getting onto the beach they find the beach to be decently active today as surfers ride the waves, families enjoy the ocean and sand, and local teens and young adults enjoy the sun. After walking around for a bit the 3 spot a open area close to the near by pier. Thinking it wasn't a bad spot the group begins to set up their spot. As Rachel and Alicia set up the towel's and chairs, Amy begins to set down the bags and grab the umbrella. As she does so however the bag caring the device slumps over and falls a bit, giving it free range to target anyone on the beach. Finally a bottle of sun screen rolls and falls onto the device, landing on both + and - buttons. This causes the device to randomly shrink or grow unsuspecting beach go errs. Amy as well doesn't help the situation, bumping into the bag with her feet, switching up the device's targets as the constant stream from the device fires out across the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first victim was none other than the shrunken mother with her normal sized daughter. The mother, yelling over her daughters shoulder to stop and let her put sunscreen on her. Though the daughter did care for it, and raced to the water. In a sudden shift the daughter was now 1\" like her mother before, how ever the mother had been caught in the blast and shrunk as well with her daughter. She now was less than a half a millimeter in size. The two continued on towards the water, still like before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bump the target soon switched to a unsuspecting man selling ice cream form a beach cart. The guy soon found himself at 1' in size, hanging onto the push bar on the cart, confused as to how to continue to push the cart. As well there was a group of children all heading for the cart to get some ice cream, soon they all reached a averaged height of about 8' going up to the cart for ice cream. The guy attempted to stop the kids form reaching into the cart and taking his product, how ever at such a small size, the large kids had free rein on what ever they wanted from the cart. Eventually leading to the kids just simply grabbing the car to bring back to their other friends near by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beach soon became populated by a few people of radically different sizes, ranging from tiny parents, to quite a few large sun bathers. However soon Amy, looking over her shoulder noticed the fallen back and lifted it up, stopping the blasts. After finally setting up their spot the girls pondered on what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, looks like were all set up now, all right what are you guys going to do now...\" Amy said, huffing a bit from trying to get the umbrella set up straight to block the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm going to lay her and get some sun, I really need to improve my tan\" Rachel said as she laid on her towel, and lathering herself up with sun lotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh, I think I might take a dip in the water for a bit, seems like it might be nice, want to join me?\" Alicia said standing up and beginning to head for the ocean. Amy thought for a second on which one to go or stay with...</span></div></div>",

I might head in a bit later..\" Amy said, deciding to sit with Rachel and maybe catch up a bit in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, suit yourself, more ocean for me.\" Alicia said shrugging as she headed off for the water. Amy soon laid down and began to lather herself up with some lotion as well, afraid of getting sunburned. After laying down on the towel and covering her upper body under the umbrella, she began to take in the relaxing view of the beach. It wasn't to long before Rachel and Amy began to catch up on their daily activities and happenings. The two talked on, not mentioning or even remembering their radical shifts in height over the past 24 hours. However the topic soon fell on Amy's discovery of the device and trying to pawn it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wait, you just bought it off some random homeless person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, looked like it would make some good money, but seems like the thing is just a broken modified TV remote. Probably just a prank gag someone threw out...\" Amy said , a bit upset the events, though she couldn't complain as she had only bought it for 12$.<br>\r\nLooking over at her bag she sees the device poking out, Seeing that she must have just thrown it in the bag without noticing, she pulled it out and began to inspect it, Rachel taking notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the thing you were talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, must have accidentally put it in the bag. not that it matter, doesn't even work anyways.\" Amy said depressingly, looking down at the remove fiddling with it. As she did beam after beam exited the device at the water. The beams missed the swimmers out in the water and soon started hitting seemingly randomly spots in the water, but unknown to Amy, she was changing the sea life in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut off the coast, a fishing boat soon gets stuck on something. As the crew come to investigate, they find their fishing boat had become ensnared on top of a gigantic jellyfish, 5 times bigger than their boat. Soon the area of the sea was teaming with scaled up or downed animals. Giant sardines, size of a great white, tried to swim in large schools, constantly bumping and crashing into one another. As well a blue whale found its self the size of a sardine, though it swam on as normal. The beam soon landed on and began growing a shark out in the water. By the time the growth stopped, the shark was now enormous bigger than even the blue whale was originally. Its massive dorsal fin rising out of the water, height than the near by pier. The giant shark soon found itself forced into deeper waters and engulfing entire schools of fish in a single gulp. However this didn't last long before the beam found itself back towards the shark, shrinking it down to minuscule size, before suddenly the tiny blue whale soon expanded in size, and stopping at 2x its original size, before unknowing gulping up the tiny shark into its giant mouth as it attempted to eat krill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy stopped pressing the buttons, still upset that the thing didn't want to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let me take a look at it.\" Rachel says looking at the remove. Seeing no harm Amy hands over the device, as Rachel grabs it from Amy, Rachel's finger lands on the + symbol. In the quick amount of time of handing it to Rachel, Amy soon gains some height to about 7'7\" in size, before laying back on her now smaller towel compared to her size. She soon begins regretting taking two towels for herself. Rachel soon begins to look the device up and down, unknowingly activating it at people out in the ocean. Surfers soon become to small to control their boards and are lost into the crashing waves, while other become to big to even use the boards as bogie boards. a couple find themselves now try to swim out into deeper waters, even though they are now both 2\" in size, waves become the size of tidal waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alicia continues to swim, talking with a few others from her classes, before she is hit by the device. As Rachel continues to inspect the device, her finger continues to press down on the + symbol, continuing growing Alicia in size, though none of them even take notice of this. Rachel continues to grow in size reaching taller and taller over her friends, soon reach double her height at about 11'. Though her growth continues she continues to talk with her classmates as normal and so do they, even as Alicia's knee's start exposing themselves above the water. After Rachel moves her finger, Alicia now finds herself at about 14'4\" in height, towering over the others. However Amy and Rachel stare on. Amy was surprised that Alicia made a big deal of going into the water, yet, she only went in to below her knees! However staring she did wonder where she found a one piece that could even fit her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mm... I don't know. but hey at least you have it for when ever it does work!\" Rachel said handing back to Amy. Blinded by a flash, Amy continued and grabbed the device from her 3' friend Rachel. As Rachel went to lay on her chest to tan her back, Amy went to put the device next to the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe it might work some day....\" Amy said, attempting to make herself comfortable on the towel at her size.</span></div></div>",

As Amy continues to watch Alicia stand above her classmates in the water talking to them, some seagulls descend onto the group's stuff and begin to attempt to steal any food form their bags. Hearing the commotion, Amy turned around and began to shoo the birds away from their stuff. As one went of a bag of chips, it became scared and ended up grabbing the device instead before flying off down the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, fucking stupid birds and liking shiny shit\" Amy cursed under her breath, getting up and deciding to go after the stupid bird. She left Rachel, who was still asleep, chasing after the bird. Following it across the beach, Amy took notice that quite a few more tines and giants had decided to come to the beach than what she had saw before. She saw a group of tines attempting to serve a volley ball over a net that was way to big for them. As well she passed a group of girls sunbathing, blinded by a flash, she soon returned focused on finding the bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa and her two college room mates at decide to head one last time to the beach near their college before heading home and beginning their careers.As she laid flanked by both her friends as they enjoyed the sun she was getting. She had managed to get the perfect beach body figure, nice yellow two piece, and wanted to get a tan to go with it. She wanted to surprise her boyfriend when she went back home. However as she laid their, her mind wondered back to the device she had thrown out two weeks ago. After the fact she had called her mom explaining to her that she didn't know what it was and that she didn't need it. She did regret not seeing what the damn thing was for anyways. However as she laid in the sun she soon heard what was the flapping of wings before hearing the panting of someone running. She assumed that it must had been some angry beach goer that had their fry stolen by a seagull. Though as her and her friends had their eyes closed, none took notice of the long flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she laid on her chest, she became uncomfortable, felling sand dig its way into her bikini. Annoyed she soon lifted herself up for a second and finding herself rubbing up against her two friends on both sides of her. Looking down she was that for some reason she had thought to bring a small towel. She didn't understand as the towel barely covered the middle of her chest. Accepting the fact that she forgot a bigger towel, Lisa stood up to about 25' looking for a spot to move to away from her two similar sized friends, before finding it and laying down on her back as to not get sand in her new bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy continued to run after the bird. Seeing it perched on a tall wooden post, Amy began to struggle to get the device. The bird landed on the post, inspecting the weird item it had found.

Looking up at the bird, she continued to try and contemplate a why to get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Device fired of a beam down the beach towards the pier. Rachel still laid chest down, on her towel. She slept as the sun rays hit her. unknown to her another type of ray soon made contact with her. The device's ray made contact with Rachel, as she began to slowly grow and expand in size, passing Amy's 7'7\" height, though continuing to get bigger and bigger in size. Soon she covered her towel, now passing Alicia's impressive 11' size. As Rachel continued to grow and grow, Her and the rest of the beach continued on, paying no mind to the growing blonde on the beach. Even Alicia herself, looking back at Rachel, saw nothing out of the ordinary in her mind. In her mind she had know Rachel to be around 25' 5\" , or maybe was it 28', 32? Alicia continued to ponder, her mind and everyone else's adapting to Rachel's growing size. Alicia scanned the beach, before spotting Amy trying to get the device. Seeing that she needed help with something, she told her friends that she'd talk to them later, before walking towards Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Rachel was reaching past her previous max height of 50' to now 60', still growing from the constant beam begin fired from the device in the seagull's claw. By now she had completely covered the entire area, they had placed there things. She showed no signs of stopping, nor was she awake to even notice, if she could that is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy continued to get the the bird to leave the pole, so she could just she the pole and drop the device into the sand. However the bird was busy just standing on the post, no care in the world. As she became frustrated, she soon turned behind her and saw Alicia walking up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Alicia, can you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, whats wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seagull up there ended up taking the device and I want to get it back.\" Amy said looking up at Alicia. Alicia looked up and tried to think of a way to get the device without scaring the bird away with the device. The tow began to ponder on a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the two girls, things weren't getting any better. By now Rachel  now stretched the entire beach from dunes to her feet barley touching the ocean. She down had to be about 270' in size. Her breasts, the size of trucks and began to dig into the lose sand. Her black bikini continued to grow and expand with her size. Rachel continued to sleep through the whole ordeal, getting bigger and bigger as she slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy and Alicia continued to be stumped on how to get the device back for a couple of minutes as the pole was double Alicia's height. As Amy began to lose hope and accept that the device was lost to her. She turned around and noticed 3 girls around 24-25' in size getting up from sand and grabbing their surprisingly tiny belongings. She wondered why they even carried such tiny items, let alone all had fitting bikini's to their sizes. However seeing as the best chance at help, Amy and Alicia wave to get their attention. The brunette, with the yellow bikini off the group notices them and walks over to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you guys need help\" Lisa says to the two girls below her. She swats down to hear the two better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hey do you guys mind helping me and my friend out. That stupid seagull to a possession of mine, looks like a remote.\" Amy says, before pointing up at the post. Lisa looks up and spots the tiny seagull on the post. Seeing no harm in helping these two out with their bird problem, Amy calmly reaches for the device. However as she does, she soon enters the beam hitting Rachel as begins to grow as well, passing her two friends in height and even further. This does complicate the situation a Lisa for some reason has to continue to adjust her approach to grabbing the remote. eventually she goes in and grabs the remove  and the bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oops, sorry little budy, but that an't yours\" Lisa teases at the bird, as it sqwaks and frees itself from Lisa's massive hand and flying off.

Thanks!\" Amy yells revealed. Amy reaches for the remote at the girl passes it down to her. The device finally stops firing when Amy grabs it. After thanking the girl, the two watch as the three walk off the beach towards the parking lot. Amy was happy they had found a 60' woman on the beach that had managed to help them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't want to get rid of the remote?\" Alicia asks looking up at Amy. \"Though you just wanted to pawn it off, since it didn't work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but Rachel talked me into keeping it\" Amy said, inspecting the tiny device in her hand. \"And plus, I kind of want to see what it does, when it eventually works...\" The two chuckled a bit as Alicia told Amy about her conversation with her classmates, saying they actually might know someone who can take a look at the device. Amy, excited, jumps with glee, kicking up sand into passing by beach goers. However the two notice that the sun is beginning to get low to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well looks like its about time to call it a day, don't you think Amy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, kind of sucks that I didn't get to enjoy the water with you.\" Amy said a bit disappointingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its fine, we can come back tomorrow if you want, It not like we don't have all summer.\" Alicia said patting Amy's shoulder. \"Hey, speaking of Rachel, we probably should go get her, we need her for the ride home anyways..\" The two laughed as they went to make their way towards Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the whole ordeal with the seagull, Rachel had been changed radically in size from the constant device firing at her. Her entire body from feet to head stretched the entire pier next to her. She was now about 1984' and 10\" in size, easily dwarfing any person on the planet, even though that had been grown by the device. Her breasts were gigantic, each about the size of a small house! Yet even at this ludicrous size, Rachel continued to sleep as normal, her black two piece easily begin the biggest item of clothing ever to exist and weighting multiple tons. Alicia and Amy had been effect as well. Now reach 17' 7\" and 20' 5\" respectively. All their swimsuits being the only items of clothing in the world to fit their bodies. The two made their way up to Rachel. As they did, Rachel began to stir, she soon rolled over on her left side, almost smashing into the pier. Amy and Alicia attempted to get close to their friend to wake her and let her know its time to go. They soon descended into the crater in the sand from Rachel's breast. Upon reaching Rachel's left breast, the two began to call her name to wake her. Eventually the two resorted to trying to shake her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelling something trying to shake her, Rachel's eyes slowly opened before falling upon Amy and Alicia. Rachel Shifted herself, bumping into the pier, damaging at bit. She quickly turned around apologies to the people on in before scooting over to open beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, enjoy the sun?\" Amy yelled up at her titanic friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, sure was nice, did you go in the water any?\" Rachel asked as she stretched and pulled her legs out from the water. She wondered how the tided had came in so much? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, some bird nabbed the device, had to chase it and get help to get it.\" Amy said as Rachel began to stand up, reveling the pressed in remains of the items they had brought. Rachel quickly apologized, though Amy and Alicia said it was fine, seeing as nothing was crushed, except the umbrella. Rachel ended up watching the two pack up the things as she had no clue how she packed and carried such tiny things to the beach. Though Amy and Alicia had to carry the things, it wasn't a problem due to their size allowing them to carry a lot more. As they made their way to the jeep, Rachel found she only needed to take 1 to 2 steps over them before she found the parking lot. More confused however, she saw her jeep was WAY to small for her size. She could have sworn she had drove them to the beach today. Things didn't get better as Amy and Alicia saw they too were way to small for the jeep. The group wondered on what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lisa and her two friends made their way to the car, they soon took notice of something odd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lisa, did we ride here in your car today?\" Heather said, as she crouched down to inspect Lisa's SUV she had borrowed from her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I though so.\" Lisa said confused as she was sure the three of them had driven in the SUV to the beach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't, I mean this is your SUV, and its way to small for any of us, especially you..\" Hanna said bending down over the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had no clue why she had borrowed her parents car in the first place, at her size she could easily travel at a decent pace, and her friends were way to big to have even fit it. The group began to panic as Lisa asked for her phone to call her parents, even though her cell screen was smaller than the tip of her pinky finger! The three worryingly waited around not knowing what to do, Hanna and Heather unknowingly sitting down onto a pickup and convertible parked next to the SUV, smashing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy and Alicia at least attempted to load the jeep with there things, Rachel sat on her knees on the beach, trying to understand the situation. After the three of them stood their confused, Rachel shrugged her shoulders, and said that she would just figure it out tomorrow and would carry Amy and Alicia home. Grabbing Amy and Alicia, she placed them on her shoulders, before reaching down and grabbing her jeep and storing it between her gigantic breasts and bikini. Rachel began walking towards Amy's and Alicia's apartment. Each step shaking the ground and leaving a 2' imprint of her foot in the street and ground where she walked towering over all nearby buildings...</span></div></div>",

Amy enjoyed the view and the breeze she felt as she continued to look around at the city she was above. Rachel had more or less stopped trying to be subtle as she walked through the city. Each of her footsteps taking up almost the entire street. Her hips brushed and smashed into buildings she passed. All the while her tiny jeep jiggled around in between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it had taken them a while to get to the beach from there place. Rachel reached Amy and Alicia's home under 15 minutes. The three were confused as they had expected it to take longer since Rachel had to walk and carry them. Thinking nothing more of it, Rachel shrugged her shoulders. Unknowingly this caused Amy to slip of her shoulder and slide down. Thankfully she managed to fall in between Rachel's breasts, cushioning her fall, though damaging Rachel's jeep under her. Rachel looked down in shock and embarrassment, before reaching in between her breasts and pulling her friend out. As well as grabbing Alicia on her other shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooopps! Sorry about that! I don't why I keep forgetting how tiny you guys are.\" Rachel said holding her two friends, \"Well her you guys go! Home sweet home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the lift Rachel, appreciate it\", Amy said up to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, If your free tomorrow, we can go back to the beach if you want to join?\" Alicia said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, sure! Here you guys go!\" Rachel said as she carefully put her friends down on the ground and handed the jeep down for them to grab there items. After saying their thanks and good nights, Rachel stood back up to her full height and began to continue down the street to her home. Amy and Alicia stumbled a bit as they felt Rachel's steps as she walked home. Getting there stuff together the two girls made their way into their house. Though bigger than there normal heights, the two girls managed to squeezed their way through the door into their tiny home. However not before the remote getting stuck and firing a beam behind Amy as she tried to get herself inside. The beam fired behind her into a alley across the street, hitting a unsuspecting cat digging in the trash. Suddenly the feline found itself digging through the entire section of trash, now 30' in size trying to find any piece of food big enough for it to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Amy and Alicia the two went to settle in for the night, crawling through their house to get to the bathroom and eventually their bedrooms.

However through out the week, the two girls and many others continued to be unknowingly subjected to the remote's power. People across town continued to shift in sizes, Families and locals the size of barbie dolls all the way to giants that rivaled the downtown cityscape. It was still a surprise no one questioned a thing about their new perspectives of their lives, from tiny public workers attempting to do tasks unsuited for their size, to giant casual joggers tearing up streets and yards on their daily runs. People began to take notice of the effects of the people of various sizes. People being fired or being let go for failing to do or even make it to the work they did when they were normal. Countless reports and complaints of public and private property damage, from people suddenly found themselves too small to control the actions they were doing too others all of a sudden out growing their surrounding. Even things such a supplies of food and water began to show their strains as giants now found themselves consuming many time more food then they remembered. But in the end life attempted to continue as normal, even if it was now anything but \"Normal\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Alicia had continued to enter and leave their house to hang out with friends or go to work for the week. Alicia ended up having to sleep in the living room, after she woke up to find herself laying in the ruins of the her side of the house busted open and exposed to the elements, however later that day she found herself a couple inches tall and confused on how the damage had be caused, even tho she had just been close to 60' tall the day prior. Amy found herself luck as through out the week she hadn't expanded while inside the house, never passing 20' in height while inside the house. Though she was upset of losing her cozy office job after her office collapsed and her a few others were let go for being unable to complete tasks efficiently. Though she didn't know how she had even worked in such a tiny office, with the fact she was 70' 2\". Thankfully she had managed to get their neighbor John to use her laptop and help her search for jobs in their kitchen, while she sat filling up most of the back yard, leaning on her hand with a board expression, a John continued to search.

Alicia reclined in Amy's purse, enjoying the ride she got as they went to work, thankfully they could walk there instead of having to take the bus or a taxi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where all these potholes came from.\"  Amy said looking briefly down at her tiny friend, \"They weren't here yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia shrugged, \"Maybe some giant or giantess just forgot to step lightly.\"  Pointing a tie one one of the nearby ones, she added \"Thar one looks like a footprint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy hummed in agreement, she wasn't sure why there seemed to be so many cars not being driven today, almost like everyone didn't want to (or couldn't) drive their own vehicles.  She saw quite the crowd of tiny people hopping out of a taxi, and several who were too big to ride simply jogging or walking at a brisk pace to get where they needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, four tiny goth girls were sitting on the bus seat on their way to school, complaining how unfair it was that they got in trouble for not being able to drive a car sized for normal people.  Now they had to take the bus like a bunch of losers, totally unfair if you asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel, for her part, had cleaned out the local diner and had reached the difficult reality of paying for such a large amount of food.  Kneeling down in the Parking lot, her massive bare behind pointing down the street, she tried to convince the officer threatening her with jail time that she could go inside her house and grab a check since she wouldn't fit anymore.  Though honestly, this could turn out either way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the sign for their work, 'JJ's Accounting', Amy was glad that she was only a part timer here, unlike Alicia who spent a good amount of time working here.

His secretary, Jane, found herself struggling to take down notes at her new inch and a half height, unable to lift her pencil, but she tried nonetheless, noticing nothing strange about being that small or naked in front of everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it carried on, and on, until Amy and Alicia were done presenting the information to the board, which looked a bit more chaotic than it had earlier, answered their questions, and then were allowed to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think that went well, how about you?\"  Alicia asked her friend who looked ready to collapse from nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded, \"Yeah, at least they didn't ask me the detailed questions like they did to you, I'm only a part timer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved at their office buddies and kept going, not noticing how Stacy at the printer was unable to reach her paper she needed at her new 1.5\" height, nor how Todd the IT guy was too big to work on the computers, hunched over at 20 feet tall.  The minor chaos that followed in their wake was like a microcosm of the wider city, various people trying to do jobs they no longer could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was glad that the police officer was willing to run inside and get a blank check for her from her house, understanding her situation.  But the price was still higher than she was used to paying, she'd better try a few other places to eat later, try and save some money.

I was joking, relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy blushed so deep that her face almost matched her hair, \"That wasn't funny Alicia.  Some people take that stuff really seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia waved her friend off, \"I know, I know, let's move on and eat!  Foods here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Doris placed their usual on the table, made sure that the two friends were alright, and as she left, the remote managed to get her too.  Crawling out from the 50' style dress was the naked blonde herself, who simply dusted herself off and continued to check on her tables, not needing a notepad since she'd been here so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Alicia started after swallowing her minuscule mouthful of waffle, \"what're our plans for the rest of the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy hummed to herself, thinking about it, and remembered that she wanted to pawn off the remote, or at least get another opinion on its value.  \"I was going to try and pawn off the remote again, see if someone else knows about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia nodded at her friend as she grabbed another chunk of waffle, swabbing it through the whipped cream before eating it, \"Good plan.  We still ordering cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed at her friends determination for the cake, and she couldn't blame her, the coconut cake was the best either had had anywhere.  \"Of course!  What trip to Joe's doesn't get any cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlagging down Doris, they place do their order for another slice of cake, not noticing that their poor waitress couldn't really move the slice anymore at her size.</span></div></div>",

Entering the glass door, the sleigh bells on the handle jingled, and form the back of the store, a woman's voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute!\"  And a blonde girl walked out a moment later, her hair up in a ponytail, wearing skinny jeans and a white button up shirt.  \"What can I do ya for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sat the remote on the counter.  \"We're looking to get this appraised.  I haven't been able to get it identified, nor my usually buyers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth smiled and picked up the remote carefully, \"Let me see here.\"  And after looking around at it for a bit, she set it back down, \"I got nothing.\"  At Amy's disappointed face she quickly added, \"Just a minute!  Let me run in the back and check my catalogs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded, and as Ruth headed back, Amy picked up the remote and accidentally hit both buttons in rapid succession, swapping the sizes of herself and Alicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I naked?!\"  Alicia whisper-yelled, quickly digging her best friend and roommate out of the convenient pile of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\"  Amy shrugged, watching as her roommate slid her wide hips into the booty shorts, forgoing the pink lace panties and too small bra, Alicia's nipples easily visible through the pastel pink shirt.  \"How'd I get down here?  Wasn't I on the counter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia thought it was odd too, but didn't say anything, picking up her now 1.5 inch roomy and setting her on the counter next time the remote.  Not a moment later, Ruth came out with a catalog of vintage remotes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry girls, I don't have anything here that matches your item here.  I'd probably post it online, not many brokers will pay for an unidentifiable item.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed, stepping onto Alicia's lowered hand, watching as Ruth disappeared behind the counter in a flash form the remote, Alicia having accidentally hit the minus button.  Settling herself between Alicia's breasts, Amy got comfortable for their walk home, upset at the verdict for her remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ruth had worked her way out from under her shirt and was hopping on her keyboard, laboriously typing out an email to a colleague, it would've been quicker had she been a 'Normie', but as a Tiny, she had to stop frequently to catch her breath.  Not to mention, the frequent hopping had her breasts flopping around, and that got tiring quickly too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back at the apartment, Alicia and Amy were enjoying a salad as they discussed what to do with the rest of their day.

Thankfully she was alright, her 20ft tall teammate found out as he lifted the ball gingerly off her, not noticing that his shorts had been torn to shreds.  The opposite team too, found their teammates now at various heights as well, and a very lopsided and awkward game (re)started after the brief interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blonde who'd been enjoying a relaxing walk on the beach while licking at an ice cream cone suddenly found herself avoiding the falling frozen dairy treat, no longer held by her hand.  She scratched her head at how she'd been carrying it earlier as her bikini was taken out to sea by the waves crashing at her minuscule feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of families who'd made a very impressive and substantial sandcastle suddenly found themselves all a thing 1.5 inches tall, and they dutifully tried to keep working on it, though the kids would rather play on the castle rather than keep building it.  A task that was impossible at their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral swimmers out in the surf suddenly found that they had to go <u>much</u> further out to sea to swim comfortably, as their new 20-50ft height had them standing in the areas where the surfers and other swimmers were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Alicia and Amy were sure that the boy was heading to his friend, who'd been hiding by the dunes, and they went around the other way to catch him and his buddies by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd it go?\"  A ten year old brunette asked his buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid held up the remote, \"I got this neat thing!\"  He lowered it to get a better look at it, \"Wonder what it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia cleared her throat behind the two boys, \"Its ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the adult, the two boys realized they'd been caught, and in his nervousness, the boy dropped the remote, causing it to go off.</span></div></div>",

And who dropped those swimsuits on him and his friend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two little jaybirds made their way over to their moms, the volleyball games were rebracketed to only be based on size.  So 'Normies' played only with their size, 'Giants' with their size, and 'Tinies' with their size, so as to avoid any injury to the other players.  Of course, the Tinies now had the problem of trying to figure out how to play with a normal sized volleyball, but none of them realized the impossibility of their goals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilarly, one Asian girl was in a shrunken predicament, her dachshund was running wild, and she was holding on for dear life to the leash, trying to get him back under control, wondering to herself how she even kept him under control before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Alicia was gone, Amy stretched out and began tanning while people watching, it was always interesting, if a little boring sometimes, but there was always a surprise somewhere.

No!\"  She yelled, the dog stopped what he was doing and whined a bit, \"Heel!\"  And as she left she called out to Amy \"I'm sorry!\"  The dog following his shrunken owner slowly, tail between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back into position to tan, she didn't notice that the purse had been knocked over, and had fired off as it fell out of the purse into the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl roller skating suddenly found herself somewhere around 20ft tall, her roller skates and bikini shredded off her body around her.  Upset that her cheap roller skates broke, she picked up what was left and started her way back to the store, intent on getting a refund or a new pair, not realizing that no pairs of shoes would ever fit her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe busty lifeguard on patrol found herself buried beneath her swimsuit, the now naked tiny lady tried to continue her job, but the whistle she was determined to drag behind her weighed a ton!  Not to mention, if she ever really had to, she wouldn't be able to blow the whistle or actually safe someone at her new size, at least (some of) her coworkers could still do their jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alicia got back to the towel, she saw the spilled contents of her purse and started packing everything back up so she could stretch out and dry off, did she hit a button on the remote?</span></div></div>",

One thing that Alicia was a bit miffed about was that Tinies couldn't share seats with their friends and family, they had to have their own seat, just like any Normie or Giant.  The ride there was fairly uneventful, their cab driver lucked out and didn't get affected by the remote, but the various others around them did not.  The swinging and slightly hurried movements Alicia was doing, trying to get to the check in point and find their terminal, was setting the remote off frequently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stewardess walking with her coworker to their plane suddenly found themselves at different heights, one was 50' tall, barely able to move in the massive airport, the other was 1.5\" tall, and buried under her clothes.  The naked giantess and naked shrunken woman were worried about making it to her flight, neither remembering how they'd done their job before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo women from the Middle East wearing their full body robes suddenly found themselves swimming in their clothes.  Both had been shrunk to 1.5\" tall, and neither was sure how they'd walked anywhere while in these traditional dresses, Tinies were too small for clothes!  Worming their way out from under, the two shrunken naked ladies laughed at the absentmindedness of each other, trying to wear clothing sized for a <i>Normie</i>, much less clothing <i>at all</i>!  How ridiculous!  Now, if only they could figure out how to carry their luggage ....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA receptionist found herself shrunken to 1.5\", and had to jump on her keyboard to get anything typed out anymore.  Not to mention the fact that she was too small for her headphones, she had to stand near them to hear them, and run to the microphone to reply.  Only one small flaw there, she had to press a button on one of the earpieces to talk, not something she'd be able to do with her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching their terminal, Alicia and Amy got through security, but not before they saw her remote in her purse, taking it to look at, the TSA agent found himself hunching over everyone with his new 50 foot height.  Of course nobody batted an eye at the giant naked security, and he allowed them to keep the remote.  The two were sitting right now at their terminal waiting to board, idly watching the news on the tv.</span></div></div>",

In other news, the city of Sizeburgh recently has developed several sinkholes across its street and parking lots, the city maintains that its roads have been up to code for years, but the common folk have a different story to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the second camera came on screen, the anchor found herself shrunken to an inch and a half, unable to get herself onto the desk, a crew member came over and gently lifted her up to the desk, allowing her tiny naked self to be seen on camera and continue the report.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Todd, the officials state that there is nothing wrong with their streets, yet reports are coming in about massive sinkholes.  Care to comment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the man could answer, the remote blinked, causing him to grow to twenty feet tall, forcing him to squat down to talk on camera, giving everyone behind him (and the news crew in front) quite the unpleasant view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jane, long time viewer, and the potholes have gotten out of control.  Yesterday my car got lodged in one that popped up overnight.\"  He said, everyone ignoring that is was now impossible for him to fit inside any car now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane nodded, \"Some Normals say that this is the fault of Giants walking with heavy feet, or giant delinquents, rather than the city's fault.  Care to comment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane, that is a load of BS and we know it, Giants have lived here in Sizeburgh for a long time, I was born and raised here, and this is only just now happening.  City's hall has got to get its stuff together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mr. Todd, and next we have a Normals perspective on the subject.\" Jane motioned to a well dressed Asian woman in a very expensive suit.  \"Here with us is Mrs. Nguyen, ma'am, what are your thoughts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane, these Giants are destroying our city and eating us out of house and home, I know they've been here for years, but we've seen fleets of 18 wheelers rolling in to feed a single family of giants.  They've picked up their food intake in the last few days and its unsustainable.\"  At this the remote blinked, causing Mrs. Nguyen to grow to fifty feet tall, her $700 suit torn to ribbons around her.  \"I know that I've been managing my diet for a while now, and I don't have to be fed by a big rig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very interesting ma'am,\" Jane said calmly, wondering why a Giant would side with Normals over their own kind enough to identify as one, \"thank you for your time.\"  The camera closed down and Jane looked back at the camera, \"Now we go live with our man on the street, Calvin.  Calvin, what can you tell us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera cuts to a young clean cut man who looked fresh out of college in front of a parking lot with a massive crater (formed by a particular giantess known as Rachel, a friend to Alicia and Amy).  The remote blinked a two him, shrinking him down to an inch and a half as well, the camera focusing on his collapsed suit until he worked his way out, standing next to the microphone.  \"Jane, the sinkhole here is nothing short of a crater, and we can see here the maneuvering that everyone has to do just to get into the diner here.  You can see Tinies and Normals having to go far out of their way to pale here, and over by the street,\" (at this the camera pans to a nearby street with several sets of Giant foot imprints in it) \"that the sinkholes problem seems to be increasing.  The city officials and the locals have plenty of problems to work out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Alicia and Amy's group had even called up and they started to board the plane, looking forward to their vacation in the Caribbean.</span></div></div>",

Can you believe it?\"  Alicia asked excitedly as she collected her luggage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded excitedly from her perch between Alicia's breasts, \"I know right?  Can't believe we're here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they exited the airport, Alicia looked around at the other passangers, noticing that compared to home, there didn't seem to be many Tinies or Giants, but then again, Sizeburgh was a little unique in its concentration of abnormal sized individuals.   Waiting there for a cab, the remote blinked as Alicia's purse was bumped or adjusted, adding a bit more of a height diversity than had been prior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of college girls walking across the street to the nearby beach, enjoying their first major international vacataion, were subject to the first batch of remote blinks.  Not a second later, the four girls found themselves at 20, 40, 30, and 50 feet tall, each of their clothes ripped to shreds on the sidewalk around them as they walked past.  They talked about how much their new dresses back a top their hotels cost and how they couldn't wait to go clubbing, nevermind the fact that none of their clothes would ever fit them now,  or could any of them except the 20' girl have a chance of fitting inside a club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA street vendor found the grill he'd been operating to suddenly be quite harder to work, his new height being 1.5\" tall and all that.  He was forced to close up shop, selling what he'd already prepared, as he couldn't remember how he'd been cooking his food earlier.  Plus he didn't want to end up falling on the grill, that tends to be bad for ones health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman riding a horse pulling a rickshaw styled carriage found herself shrunk on the horse, her legs spread uncomfortably wide on the seat of the saddle as she clung to it as tight as she's could, not wanting to fall off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken horse rider managed to direct her horse to the curb, signaling to Alicia and Amy that she was there for them.  Excited to ride in such a rustic mod of transportation, Amy and Alicia hopped in, and enjoyed the view as their cart navigated the roads to the hotel.</span></div></div>",

They all added up to some minor damage to the remote, namely the fact that the \"Plus\" button, which was still stuck, was now firmly wedged into its postition, it'd take a good amount of force to press that button again!  That, and the growth function was, for the moment, completely fried, now all the poor, unaware victims of the device would shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is exactly what happened when the two entered the hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sparks caused the remote to send off several flashes across the lobby, striking many employees and guests alike, leaving several dozen piles of clothes across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo maids who had just entered the elevator found themselves standing shorter than the wheels on their supply cart, their skirts, blouses and aprons piled up around them as they wormed their way out.  Once the elevator reached their destination floor, they pushed and pulled with all their might, but were unable to get their cart moving, which meant that the doors closed on the two girls.  Which left the two naked Tiny's to figure out just <i>how</i> they'd pressed the buttons up so high in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo brothers who'd been excited for their surfing trip suddenly found their surfboards to be too large to even budge a millimeter.  Not to mention them having to dig themselves out from under what appeared to be abandoned swim trunks, thankfully, a pair of very pretty surfer girls agreed to help them out in exchange for dinner.  One can only imagine how the surfing episode will go later on at the beach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bellboy who'd been carrying luggage and following a pretty heiress, who insisted that no poor person would ever touch her precious puppy 'Nubs' the pug, found himself and the heiress both at the shrunken height of 1.5 inches.  The bellboy, after successfully getting himself out from under his cap, tried to continue carrying her bags, and the heiress, after digging her way out of an abandoned $3,000 dress, had taken to riding around on her pug, and and failing to get the stupid dog to listen to her directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all this was going on, Alicia and Amy were at the front desk, watching the employee hop from button to button, entering their information and confirming their identities for their reservation.

As she situated the remote in her purse, the lady who'd bumped into her, a blonde woman approximately 38 years old, was working her way under the lab coat, and appeared to be clutching her head.  Much like most of the market place, like that guy way over in the corner selling bags of weed, which were as big as he was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmigosh!\"  Alicia said, quickly helping Amy out of her breasts and setting her down by the blonde woman, letting another Tiny help out another one was best so as to avoid accidents.  \"Are you alright ma'am?  I didn't step on you did I?\"  Alicia was on the verge of tears, the last thing she'd ever want to do was hurt anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, I'm fine.\"  The blonde said as Amy helped her up.  \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you in such a hurry for?\"  Amy asked, curious as to why a Tiny would be running through such a crowded place without a Normal go help them put.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I work for the government, we lost a prototype and had detected that it'd ended up back here on the isl- THERE IT IS!\"  She quickly said, seeing the remote in Alicia's purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that thing?\"  Amy laughed, \"Bought it off an old guy at a dump and it doesn't work.  Trust me, we've tried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde wasn't having it though, \"We detected it activating erratically at the San Palm hotel not an hour ago.\"  At the two girls surprised faces, the blonde continued, \"I guess that is your hotel then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but, we've never seen it DO anything!\"  Alicia said, quickly getting out of the way of a group moving through the market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde nodded, \"It had an inbuilt protection feature,  making anything it did appear normal, despite the obvious logical flaws that it'd produce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then what's it do?\"  Amy said, greatly intrigued.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><span class=\"cbrown\"><b><div align=\"center\">~~~Basic Info~~~</div></b></span><br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">In this story you have a choice in between both either male and/or female characters who has found a dangerous weapon known as a the \"Reducer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly this is an experiment. I just wanted to see if I can pull off one of these kinds of stories. Anyway I've got nothing to lose so just read these \"simple\" rules.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\"><b><div align=\"center\">~~~Rules~~~</div></b></span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">-You can kill off characters off but I really don't recommend it. You don't have to kill a character if you don't like them but please don't just instantly write them out of the story in one sentence, the story just revolves around whoever you want so feel free to change the lead character.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I don't mind Vore, feet, or any of that other stuff, just make it believable and not the mian focus of the story. (By believable I mean. What would a <u>real person</u>, in <u>real life</u> <u>actually do</u>?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No sex. Honestly this is the only rule I cannot allow, <b>NO EXCEPTIONS!</b> I didn't write to have it become an adult fictional story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Nudity is now allowed, just remember the rule above this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I guess, no homosexual characters but that pretty much falls under the no sex rule. Still if you have the urge to make a person become a homosexual branch it off in another chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No severe swearing. (Let's make it simpler, just don't use the F-Word that word bugs me.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don't make chapters containing pedophilia. I'm mean you can but It will just get <u>deleted.</u> Underage characters are allowed in the story but please leave any adult content away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<b>The Reducer can enlarge things too! So all that giantess/giant stuff is allowed too.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose are the only rules so don't blow it. Seriously. Oh yeah and have fun!</span> <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></td>",
