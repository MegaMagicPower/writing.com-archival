It wasn't much, but it was the place you called home for all of your life. Well, all of your life up until now. You look over the village one last time as you stand at the front gate and double check your supplies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about this, Erik?\" A girl asked you. She was fourteen years old and had a modest figure. Her curly red hair came down to her shoulder and her eyes were a forest green. You've had a crush on her for the past two years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly am, Molly.\" You tell her as you tie a small sack filled with coins to your belt. You understand her concern for you perfectly well. Her father went out on this same quest years ago; no one in the village has heard from him since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're going out there with only a wooden sword!\" Molly shouted at you. She was right, the only thing you had to defend yourself was a wooden sword. There just wasn't enough metal in the village to spare for quality weapons or armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll buy something better when I reach the port.\" You tell her as you pat your money pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...Send a letter when you get there, alright?\" Molly says when she realizes that she can't talk you out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise.\" You tell her with a grin as you head off to start you new adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was high in the sky as you traveled the dirt road that went from Malak to the port. The road wasn't used that much despite the fact that you could travel between the two towns on foot in less then a day. The monster girls of the Witch Queen had spread out to even this far corner of the kingdom; so even a short walk like this became incredibly dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a noise from the forest. Out of a bush near the side of the road emerges a...</span></div></div>",

Some sort of light blue slime is left on the ground as she walks and when she stops, it begins to pool around her until its ankle deep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What luck.

You let out a moan as the slime rubs itself against your member. Slowly it begins to massage your dick and you let out another moan as your penis begins to erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to struggle free with renewed vigor. You fight back with all of your might and you manage to move you pelvis just a tiny bit. You manage to move it again, and again. Being the only part of you that you managed to move, you thrust against her to try and buck her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes!\" The slime girl screams out as she bounces on you. Her eyes begin to gleam over as you thrust against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in response to your actions, the slime begins to vibrate against your member. The sensation was too much for you. With one last thrust, you blow your load. You lay beneath the slime girl completely defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't bad for a newbie.\" She compliments you.

You were supposed to effortlessly beat any Monster Girl that got in your way. You where going to defeat the Witch Queen in a long and grueling battle that pushed you to your limits. You would then return home victoriously and Molly would fall head over heels in love with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of that was ruined by a single slime girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you managed to pry yourself off of the ground. There was no way you could return home like this, so you had no choice but to continue on to the port. You trudged along the dirt path. A few Monster Girls spotted you but they all left you alone when they noticed the slime stuck to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was well into the night by the time you reached the port due to your slow pace. The streets were mostly empty except for the occasional couple going for a late night walk. You head to the local tavern. There where a few adventures scattered about the place. Some where telling tales of the great adventures they had been on, while others where simply drowning their sorrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do for you, laddie?\" The owner, a short man in his forties, asked as you approached the counter.</span></div></div>",

After the...event in the forest, you weren't exactly on good speaking terms with her. The Slime girl chuckled a bit, putting your sword down and looking at you darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right. Slime don't have names. Of course, for me to be traveling with you, I'm gonna need a name.\" She retorted, a devious grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what? \"Um...you plan to travel wi-\" You started before she interrupted, a miffed frown on her face now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you prefer a repeat of last time? This is not negotiable. See, I got to thinking...you're doomed. Dead. Helpless. You taking on the big girl on top is actually laughable. But...I honestly am interested.\" She said, surprising you. She looked up, as if counting the little nicks in the ceiling, and spoke again. \"Odd, huh? I wish to kill the witch. See, my kind has gotten a bad reputation. I don't like that at all. Sure, you might think it's deserved after what I did to you today, but...let's be honest. I doubt you could call that your 'first time' given the circumstances. Your pride still has some merit. But as I was saying, it might be a little ODD to you, but I don't like laying low in a cave. Every. Single. DAY. I honestly live in fear with the constant thought a man or woman will one day come into my cave and freeze me with some ice magic. It's...a sad feeling.\" She said, looking down now, sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My feral urge got the best of me back there, newbie. Now, to be fair, that was pathetic on your part not to offer any meaningful resistance, but that's neither here nor there. You're a longshot, but...\" She trailed off, looking at your sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...what?\" As much as she was insulting you, you couldn't help but listen. She seemed to have point she wanted to get to. She turned towards you and walked right up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While there are bands of warriors out there hunting Monsters, there are few people who wish to fight the one on top. But I can tell YOU do. And while you are still a newbie, with me by your side, you might get some good training between here and the witch. From there, we can part ways, be all buddy buddy, whatever you want. But either way, I'm joining you. Lord knows you need it!\" She said, though it didn't sound like she was insulting YOU this time as much as she was counting on the witch being more dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, you had to agree with her. She seemed like a good traveling companion, and she was quite skilled. Plus, like it or not, you were not much of a powerhouse yet. \"Well, alright then. You can come along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked, wrapped an arm around your neck, and winked. \"Aha, good of ya, newbie! Still...question. Do you have a name for me now, or can you think of something later? I've kinda always wanted one, really, and I can't think of anything good. Aqua sounds nice, but...that's just silly. I want something with STYLE, newbie. Got anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...do you?</span></div></div>",

No offense Nimue.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Well you ARE the first to have ever mentioned that. And I always knew I would make the weapon to carve a path to killing her. Very well. You and your companion shall recive my best weapons.\", he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? Your also giving your weapons to her?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANYone should be allowed to defend themselves be it Monster or Human. When the Queen is dead many will share my philosophy of having monsters united with humans. I may be old but I know when things are inevitable. So let's hope you are the comming change.\", he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNimue and you picked out your weapons of choice and got on some armor. It wasn't much but it would take you a long way more than having a wooden sword. You and Nimue set off for the nearest settlment that was en-route to the Witch Queen's lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a long journey ahead of us.\", Nimue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's good to be moving now. And were ready for action.\", you said a bit overconfidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there. it's that attitude that will get you killed.\", Nimue warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of traveling it got dark and you weren't near the next settlemnt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should make camp for thre night.

Now I can sleep a bit easier seeing you have my back.\", she answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we need eachother so there's no point in killing you. Truth be told you could still sure as hell kill me later when I outlived my usefullness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't kill you, unless you give me a reason. Hehehe,  looking back I could have made you my sex slave until you were dried out from the moment you crossed paths with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you spare me other than thinking I might have a chance to kill the witch queen? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe out of pity, or because I could use you for something personal, or perhaps I let you live because I felt a connection.\", she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said that didn't count as my first time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't. You'll just have to keep guessing until I confess. By the way newbie,  why did you start this quest in the first place?\", Nimue asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something I'd prefer not to talk about. But if you must know I had a brother, he was older than me but always watched out for me. But when the queen's army spread across the world like wildfire he was killed by one of the monster species.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By what kind?\", Nimue kindly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An Alurane. She seduced him into making out with her and then her flower bud engulfed them. When it re opened all I saw was just blood and that creature. It didn't know I was there so it didn't use it's powerful charms on me. I went back later to murder it but it was gone. Not a trace.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm no expert on forest monsters but doesn't an Alurane stay planted to the ground and can't leave it's own flower?\", Nimue asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that's what made me worry that the monsters were evolving. After that I studied as much as I could from home about the monster species I'd encounter. I couldn't wait for proper training because if they might be growing out of their weaknesses then humans would be exterminated. Your a monster so, care to say if my theory holds truth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need you to know about me regarding if I'm stronger.

So many of us were better and intelligent, you saw how quickly I was on top. But today may just be the day the world will change.\", Nimue looked up at the sky and stared at the fire, \"It's late.

Along the way we might be able to recruit some others if were lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't say lucky Erick. Even the ones who listen to reason would prefer to kill you than join you.

Nimue says, \"Someone's coming our way!\" When the figure revealed itself it was a Kitsune which looked to be kind of young with six tails, but the colors of it were off. You knew a typical one had one of four types of fur color to represent an element with yellow being flame, brown representing earth, light/normal/dark blue to depict water, and for wind it was depicted as either a light purple or green. This one however had pure white fur with some pink at the tip of parts of it. You were confused at first but realized this was a rare version of one because it was an albino. It said, \"I am sorry for approaching you at a time this but um, I'm not like most of my kind that has been known to eat men. I don't mean any harm to you and I want to assist you in your adventures. I know how dealing with the Witch Queen will be hard and dangerous. Being a rare version of my kind means that I am able to use each and every element. Let me just say previous warriors that got to the Queen herself always lost because of one reason: They weren't able to handle her magic because they only fought before the battle against her with monsters that preferred a more physical type of fighting. To beat the queen you need to effectively become a master in magic, power, skill, sanity, intelligence, wisdom, agility, and certain other traits. I am a member of a town full of many species of monster girls that dislike what the Empress has made monster girls as a whole. We call her the Empress because in the town we reside in there are top tier monsters that are considered queens as well and we use that phrasing as our way of mentioning our enemy. Would you kindly follow me there?\" You and Nimue follow the Kitsune to her hometown which the exterior looked like a cavern which clearly was intended to ensure any threats did not know that was the entrance and upon reaching it you were surprised to see the town was enormous. There looked to be both humans and monster girls getting along with each other here perfectly. The Kitsune you followed lead you to who apparently was the leader of the Resistance who was a albino version of one of those dragon girls you've heard about. You know that albinism in a monster girl means they are a lot stronger than their regular counterparts and a dragon was no exception. The Kitsune then said, \"Mistress Akiko I've found the perfect candidate for finally allowing us to defeat the Empress once and for all!\" The dragon now known as Akiko looked at you and said, \"No doubt about it you found the person we were needing to finally end the Empress' reign. You need plenty of training of course considering how you look to be inexperienced. Unlike the Empress I want coexistance between both humans and monsters. Problem is the Empress is so powerful she seems to know exactly what to expect. So you will need about 10 years of training or so if we are to finally take her down. But we know that won't be enough. We have heard of rumors of a legendary weapon that supposedly is hidden in some ruins somewhere on this continent that is said to be in a desert. The weapon is our key to victory but problem is the ruins will only allow a human to enter and attempt to claim the weapon. We know even with that it still won't be enough but there is a legendary set of armor that grants the wearer complete immunity to magic and is made of a material so strong any physical blow won't hurt the wearer at all and yet allows complete mobility. That too is in some ruins and from what we heard the location of it is said to be in a forest where it rains far more there than in other places. The armor also is said to ensure the wearer can endure even the harshest of conditions like say the wearer can traverse through the coldest of Arctic terrain without any fear of frostbite. But you will need to prepare for all of that first through training. You will need to rest up first though. My associates will lead you to your room, I'll see you later.\" You were lead to a bedroom inside what seemed to be the largest of the castles of this town that was for royalty in mind. In comfort you went to sleep and when you woke up...</span></div></div>",

The force blows out the candles and leaves the newcomer shrouded in shadow.<br>\r\n The Slime Girl shrieks in fright and stops humping you, turning to face the intruder. The newcomer didn't say a word, just reached for a hip pouch, withdrew something and flung it at the Monster Girl.<br>\r\n The something turned out to be a tiny crystal vial. It connected and penetrated the Monster's slimy body, twinkling inside her goop. Suddenly and with a gurgle, the Slime girl was sucked into the vial from the inside out. She screamed as her entire body was pulled in, magically fitting into the small space. It was over in seconds. As the last of the Slime Girl was sucked in, the vial hovered for a second before dropping onto your stomach. It felt unpleasantly cold to the touch.<br>\r\n You begin to cough after the slime left your face. When the fit abates, you look at your rescuer: \"Is it over? Is she dead?\"<br>\r\n The newcomer says nothing, just sheaths their sword and lights one of the candles. The room brightens and you see your savior is a muscular, attractive woman with short brown hair. <br>\r\n She strides over to you and plucks the vial from your stomach. \"No,\" she says in a strong voice. \"This is just a magic trap designed to contain them. Cages obviously don't work, and you'd need a much larger vial if it weren't magic.\" She looks at the vial contemplatively \"Slippery bitches...\"<br>\r\n You sit up and try to cover your nudity.

You're lucky I saved you.\"<br>\r\n You turn red as she say's this. \"It's hardly my fault! I only have this bloody wooden sword and no money!\"<br>\r\n Selka punches you lightly in the ribs (lightly for her, but still enough to sting) and laughs again. <br>\r\n \"You should come with me boy. We share the same quest. You need to be kept alive, and I could use an extra set of eyes\"<br>\r\nYou think about this briefly.<br>\r\n\"You don't have to say yes, kid\" she teases. \"You can stay behind if you aren't brave enough\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Go out like that and you'll just be monster girl bait.\"<br>\r\n Selka effortlessly pulls you to your feet and rips of the remnants of your clothes, ignoring your protest. You stand naked and shivering in drying slime as she rummages in her pack and pulls out a cloak. You accepts it and wrap it around yourself as best you can. As she leers at you, you gather your luggage, cinch the cloak with a belt and go pick up your sword. Together, you and Selka leave the room.

A firepit was recently dug and a few embers still remain.<br>\r\n \"Start the fire boy, I'll arrange you a bed\" says Selka as she strides to the chest.<br>\r\n You nod passively and gather kindling. In no time at all you have the fire burning again and walk to the clearing's edge to get larger logs.<br>\r\n \"Careful kid!\" calls Selka. \"If you wander around there at night, the Dryads might get you.\"<br>\r\n You freeze in your tracks and look around the dark forest carefully. You can't see or hear anything out there...<br>\r\n A few minutes later you have a bundle of firewood in place, and Selka has laid out your bedroll. With the fire blazing you get a chance to appreciate her looks.<br>\r\n Of course, she's tall and muscled, but not overly so. Clearly very powerful, but also lithe and limber. Her brown hair is kept in a practical pony-tail, and the hardness in her face disguises the regal cheekbones and full lips. Her breasts are small for a woman so tall, her legs long and toned and her ass is rounded, yet also muscular. She's wearing green clothes, leather armor and a gray cloak. All in all, quite good looking, even though she keeps teasing you and has a leering, mischievous look in her eyes. <br>\r\n She sits next to you and hands over bread and cheese. Hungry, but still dignified, you tear off chunks and eat them slowly. She says nothing, but takes out her journal again. <br>\r\n\"What are you writing in there?\" you ask.<br>\r\n \"Just notes on today.\" What I caught, where, how. And also who I picked up.\"<br>\r\n \"Is that what you do? Hunt Monster Girls?\" you ask.<br>\r\n \"Yeah, but I don't kill them. I catch them.\" She takes out the phial with the Slime Girl and passes it to you. You carefully handle it. <br>\r\n \"See the runes?\" she asks. \"It's enchanted to suck in Slime Girls. It fits two of them, or one Earth Elemental. I have different traps for different Monster Girls. Silver ropes for Weregirls, magic shackles for most things with hands, freezing potion for Fire Elementals and more cages than you can imagine.\"<br>\r\n \"What do you do after you catch them?\"<br>\r\n \"I keep them, usually. Monster Girls submit when defeated, so they make useful companions on a lonely road. Or I sell them. Mason's pay an Earth Elemental's weight in gold to marry and hire them. They're simple Monsters, easily dominated.\"<br>\r\n \"Where do you keep them?\"<br>\r\nSelka laughed. \"You ask too many questions kid, I'll tell you when I trust you.\"<br>\r\n \"Last question\" you say. \"Why don't you have a horse? It can't be easy lugging around that chest.\"<br>\r\n She smiled. \"You'd be surprised, I pack fairly light. And speaking of my chest...\" she got up and walked to the chest, opened it, and took out a large glass bottle. After sitting down, she uncorked it and took a swig.</span></div></div>",

She keeps on her leather armour, but it hangs a little looser on her now. She also corks and sets down her bottle. Then she turns to face you, and raises her fists in a boxing pose.<br>\r\n\"Hand to hand!\" she shouts, a little too enthusiastically. \"If your fighting a Monster Girl, it's the most important skill.\"<br>\r\nYou nod and pull your sword out of your belt, tossing it to the ground. You're still wearing a cloak belted around your waist, so you feel a little ridiculous.<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Selka explains. \"Hand to hand is less about strength, and more about leverage. If you can lock a joint, you can lock a Monster Girl up. Try to punch me.\"<br>\r\nSelka spends the next few minutes battering you. Each time you punch, she demonstrates another method of blocking, then arm-locking. Finally, it's your turn to practice. Her punches come in really fast, light, but still hard enough to sting. Each time she hits you, she giggles a bit. Finally, in anger, you succeed in blocking a punch. You're quick enough to twist her arm behind her and lock it tight.<br>\r\nThe arm lock brings you right up behind her, intimately close. She swishes her short hair aside and she looks back at you, close enough to kiss. <br>\r\n\"You can let me go now,\" she says seductively. \"Unless that's what you like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're caught off guard and let go instinctively. Selka backs away then looks at you amorously. <br>\r\n\"Now, let's work on a leg sweep\". She continues. \"Even a big foe can be swept down, it's all just leverage. Punch me again.\"<br>\r\nYou throw a solid cross, but Selka easily blocks it. From there she grabs your wrist and sweeps your leg forwards. Your balance goes and you sprawl to the ground.<br>\r\nSelka immediately follows you to the ground and straddles you, pinning down one of your wrists while her other hand rummages up your cloak and grabs your penis.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello...\" she growls. \"It's been so long since I traveled with a male companion. I'd been lonely with just Monster Girls.\"<br>\r\nYou say nothing, still caught off guard by this beautiful, and heavy, Amazon sitting on you.<br>\r\nShe started roughly tugging your dick. \"The last man I traveled with was afraid of me... He slept lightly around me because I got too, friendly. Sadly the last time I saw his face, it was disappearing into the cunt of a Naga.\"<br>\r\nShe bends down and licks your cheek, then nuzzles your ear. <br>\r\n\"I think bad things happen to the men I travel with...\" she whispered. \"So I've learnt not to hesitate in enjoying my partners.\"<br>\r\nShe sits up fully and shuffles back a bit to sit directly on your growing dick, then she starts to rock back and forth gently.<br>\r\n\"I bet you've never been with a real woman before, have you?\"<br>\r\nYou shake your head.<br>\r\n\"Thought not. We might not be better, but we're far more unpredictable...\"<br>\r\nAt that, she begins unlacing her leather cuirass.<br>\r\n\"There are two things I can teach you now.

Undo my lacings.\"<br>\r\nAt that, she thrust her crotch towards you, lifting off your hips slightly. Her leathers were held on by intricate laces and you quickly untied them. Then she stood up and peeled them off. <br>\r\nHer pussy was wet. Maybe it was fighting you, or sitting on you, but Selka was extremely horny and you were all she could take it out on. She sat back down and leaned back, trailing her fingers across her thighs and pussy lips. Then she looked you in the eyes, beckoned you with a cocked finger, and pointed at her wet sex.<br>\r\n\"Dinner time...\" she teased. <br>\r\nYou sat up and crawled forward, lowering your face to her pussy. \"Uhm,\" you said. \"I've never done this bef...\"<br>\r\nSelka cut you off by grabbing your head and shoving it into her cunt, thrashing and writhing to get the lips spread around you. <br>\r\n\"It's easy, boy,\" she said. \"For now, stick out that tongue and let me do the rest...\"<br>\r\nYou did as you were told, letting the Monster Hunter fuck your face firmly, feeling her hot and wet juices spread and seep into your eyes, nose, and mouth. It tasted good, indescribable, but arousing. Selka didn't take long to cum. Between your tongue and her gyrations, she soon arched her back and let out a low, moaning-shout of ecstasy. Her body shuddered, her pussy quivered, and then she lay still, moaning happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to get up, but she gently pulls you down again.<br>\r\n\"No, stay. I'll need you down there again in a minute.\"<br>\r\nInstead of replying, you kissed her lightly on her still-hot lips. The gentle touch made her giggle and shudder lightly.<br>\r\n\"Ah, do that again.\"<br>\r\nYou did. At her instruction, you kiss her more and more, all done her thighs and around her pussy. Then, she inserted her fingers into her slit and peeled apart the lips, revealing what looked like a small button of flesh.<br>\r\n\"That, boy, is the clitoris.\" she murmured. \"And if you can find it, then any woman will be wrapped around your finger. Now start kissing it.\"<br>\r\nYou do. She kept holding her folds apart, giving you access to her clit. At her command, your light kisses changed to licks, then sucking, until eventually her only command was \"yes!\" After she came again, she called you up to lay next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked peaceful, but she was far from done. Her hand was snaking under your makeshift robe and playing with your throbbing erection. Selka's hands were larger than most, and callused from swordplay, but they were stronger and very dextrous. Soon you were fully hard, and a horny glint was in her eyes. She sat up, pushed you down, and mounted your cock. Her wet pussy was big, but tight, and your lost your human virginity to this fearsome Amazoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, do you want me to do now?\" you breathed as she gyrated on you.<br>\r\n\"Hold on...\" she said, grinning.<br>\r\nShe started to ride you, hard. Her hands gripped your robe like a vice, and her powerful legs made her buck powerfully on your cock. She made hard circular movements on you, using your dick to reach deep into her. The movements grew more and more powerful, and you felt an orgasm welling up suddenly.<br>\r\n\"I'm cumming!\" you gasp, preparing for it.<br>\r\nSelka had other ideas. She let go of your robe and viciously slapped you through the face and shouted \"No!\"<br>\r\nYou were so shocked from pain that you orgasm subsided. She fucked you harder and harder, and kept on slapping you until your face was on fire from the pain. You tried to catch her wrist and push her off, but she just laughed and pinned your arms down. Soon she was coming again, hard, on top of you. She cried out in pleasure and lay forward, squeezing you painfully tightly to her as the waves of her orgasms crashed. The heavy woman straightened her legs from their straddling position and lay fully on top of you, crushing your body while enjoying the after glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began stroking your red and wounded cheek. \"You're good, boy. For beating and for fucking. Don't die too soon on me.\"<br>\r\nShe finally got up, sliding free of your dick. \"You should clean up,\" she said. \"The smell of sex attracts them.\"<br>\r\nYou nod and get up. Your body ached from the training, your tongue from the oral, your face from the brutal slapping and your dick and balls from the abuse by Selka's cunt. You badly needed to cum, because she had only satisfied herself.<br>\r\nShe pointed to the edge of the firelight, where a small pond was barely illuminated. \"Go wash up.\"<br>\r\nYou walked painfully to the water, strip, and wade in knee deep. The cold water did nothing to shrink your penis, but it felt good to get clean.<br>\r\nSuddenly you were grabbed from behind! You thrash and fight, imagining the myriad of water Monster Girls that could be trying to rape you, but Selka's light chuckle in your ear calms you.<br>\r\n\"You're too tense, boy. Let me help with that...\" she reached down and grabbed your penis from behind, working the shaft with those powerful hands of hers. You also feel that she was naked, and her breasts were squashed hard into your back. Her expert hand has you cumming in a minute, and the release of your orgasm calms you down considerably. You both wash up in a cleaner part of the pond, then Selka guides you to her sleeping-roll. You lay down together under a traveling cloak, and you're asleep quickly. You never expected your first day of your quest to end like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt dawn, you awake in...</span></div></div>",

You haven't heard a sound, or seen a single living thing besides trees. It's unnerving, but at least nothing is trying to rape you. Yet.<br>\r\nAs you round a corner you see something blocking the road. It's a signpost. It's carved of stone, and used to be tall. Now it's mostly cracked rubble and lies flat. A stone stump stand to the side, a headstone to its own former glory.<br>\r\nYou try to get a look at the individual signs on the post. Clearly, they were made of wood back in its heyday, but have since rotted away to nothing but rusty metal rings. The post has vertical carvings on it, but these have eroded into illegibility. All you can make out is: \"U--d--  P--t---i-n -- O--- Q----\". Above and below that is the same coat of arms you saw on the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put aside this mystery and climb over the post, pausing at the top to look around.

Both have dirty skin and dark, messy hair. Both are also bigger and stronger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle and thrash and succeed in punching one in the stomach. As she falls over, her friend punches you in the jaw, hard enough to make your ears sign. The other returns, and grabs your exposed penis in a vice like grip so hard you shriek.<br>\r\n\"Stop your squirming!\" she shouts, spittle flying. \"Goblins only buy slaves who can fuck, but if I need to sell you to a hungry Orgress for two gold coins, I will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe releases you and you stop moving. They quickly set to work binding you securely, tying your feet to your hands in a hogtie. One of them then reaches out to gag you.<br>\r\n\"Help!\" you scream, just before the gag is tied and you are muted.<br>\r\nThey both laugh.<br>\r\n\"Help?

A thin circlet of white metal is delicately balanced on her head. She's clad in white, and appears suddenly out of nowhere.<br>\r\n\"You two trespass\" she said, in a cool and commanding voice.<br>\r\nThe bandit women jump in fight and turn around, one drawing her club, the other drawing her whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you come from bitch!\" hisses one.<br>\r\n\"I was always here, and I do not abide criminals in my domain\", she said. <br>\r\n\"Like I care, two slaves are better!\" said the other bandit as she attacked with her whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the whip never reached the new woman. It struck an invisible field and burned to ash in a second. The other bandit now attacked with her club, but the woman grabbed her by the throat and lifted her off the ground. The captive bandit's feet kicked and thrashed for only a second before she seemingly lost her strength and went limp, club falling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swipe of her other hand, the woman levitated the second bandit off the ground. The bandit rose up and up, visibly straining against invisible bonds.<br>\r\n\"Listen to me\" the magic woman said.<br>\r\nThe second bandit kept thrashing.<br>\r\n\"I said LISTEN!\" roared the woman. At her words, the wind howled and the forest went dark. The second bandit froze and was silent.<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said the woman while smiling. \"I want you to bear witness.\"<br>\r\nThe woman lowered the first bandit to her knees. The bandit regained her strength and tried to run, but the woman seized her painfully by the hair, holding on and ignoring the struggles.<br>\r\n\"For too long, my domain has lain in ruin,\" the woman said. \"People no longer speak of me in fear and awe, not since the Monster Queen took the throne. That changes now. You,\" she said pointing at the levitating bandit, \"will tell every person you meet of me. Share what you saw until the world knows or your heart stops. Tell them the Queen of the Forest will rise again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the Queen lowered the second bandit, who stumbled once on firm ground.<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" said the Queen, \"I forgot one thing...\"<br>\r\nWith a snap of her fingers, a naked, tall and muscular Monster Girl materialised. Her skin was red, her hair dark and two horn curled out of her hair. More spikes protruded from her back. The succubus immediately grabbed the bandit and held her, hand pawing at her breasts, and tongue lapping at her neck and ears.<br>\r\n\"That succubus can only be seen and and felt by us. But believe me, she's real. And whenever you rest or stray from your duties, she will make your life hell!\"<br>\r\nAs if to illustrate this, the succubus was no holding the bandit's mouth closed while it grinded its pussy against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But before you go, you must watch this,\" continued the Queen.<br>\r\nThe first bandit had stopped her struggling when the succubus appeared, but now that the attention was on her again she was thrashing and shouting again. The Queen merely smiled, and the bandit's clothes and armour disintegrated.<br>\r\n\"This is what happens when you enter my domain with foul intent!\"<br>\r\nThe Queen lifted her robes and forced the bandit's face into her pussy. The bandit's shouts turned to screams, and then to muffled moans as her head slipped into the Queen's wet folds. Soon, the bandit's head was gone. She was grabbing, thrashing, trying to pull herself out, but she just steadily was eaten by the Queen's cunt. Soon her shoulder's were in, then her hands. Finally her feet were sucked in. And then she was gone.<br>\r\nThe Queen smiled and dropped her robes, patting her sex gently. Then she snapped out of it and glared at the remaining bandit.<br>\r\n\"Go.\" She ordered. \"Before you're next.\"<br>\r\nThe bandit fled quickly, with the succubus close behind slapping her on the backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the Queen turned to you. <br>\r\n\"Young man, I'm sure you have many questions. But you are exhausted. Let sleep take you, and we will take in my castle.\"<br>\r\nShe lifted her hand at you. Fearing what might happen, you scream beneath the gag and thrash. But a comforting darkness falls over you eyes and you rest willingly.</span></div></div>",

No, Erik. But trust me, I am as human as you are.\"<br>\r\nYou're still wary. \"Then what did you do to those bandits? I understand the summoning, but the other one...\"<br>\r\n\"Her? That was just magic, and not even powerful magic at that. She is no longer anyone's concern. Now, tell me your story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do. It doesn't take long, but you two walk around while you tell it. It's clear you're in an old, run down, yet massive castle. By the time you finish, both of you have climbed stairs and stand atop a tall rampart, overlooking a sea of trees. <br>\r\n\"Now let me tell you my story,\" the Queen said.<br>\r\n\"Everything you see was once my domain,\" she said. \"To the borders of the forest, and beyond. That, was maybe two hundred years ago.\"<br>\r\n\"What was your kingdom called? I've never heard of power here before\" you ask. You've had a strange few days, so her age doesn't bother you. <br>\r\n\"You haven't heard, and out there you never will. So great is the magic that stripped my domain from me.\"<br>\r\nShe paused for a few seconds to choose her words.<br>\r\n\"A ruler is only as strong as her subjects, and mine were the mightiest. Giantesses, tree-people, the Sacred Black Coven, even the Sisterhood of Spiders paid me tribute. In my domain, Monster and human lived side by side in peaceful, if slightly messy harmony.<br>\r\n\"That changed with the witch. Her name is Clarcili, an outcast from the Coven, she was the one who began sowing dissent. The Monster-girls became more ravenous, my subjects grew nervous, and my power began to slip as the first dregs began to leave.\"<br>\r\n\"Was it the Witch Queen of Asun?\" You interrupted.<br>\r\n\"No,\" said the Queen, shaking her head slightly. \"But she was the one who helped the Witch Queen gain her power. Power she used to overthrow the king of Asun and rule the land with her Monster-girls. Power she stole from me!\"<br>\r\nThe Queen's anger had risen. Even the skies were darker.<br>\r\n\"Of course, the Witch Queen betrayed Clarcili. She is now like me, stripped of her glory and bound to this forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen did not speak for a short while.<br>\r\n\"What would you have me do, my Lady?\" you venture.<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Yes, you do owe me your freedom and your life. Don't worry, you'll pay those back...<br>\r\n\"My power is a shell of its former self. It was derived from my people, and my rule, and both of those were taken from me. My castle is a shamble, and my city is in ruin. <br>\r\n\"But, should my power return, so will my domain. I can rebuild, regrow my power, and build an army.\"<br>\r\nYou perk up at that.<br>\r\n\"An army to usurp the Witch-Queen,\" announced the Queen.<br>\r\n\"How do I help you?\"<br>\r\n\"Simple. Regain my powerful followers. When they left, they stripped a part of my power. Each group or being that swears fealty to me will make me stronger. And when my Domain is grown, more people will flock to live here.\"<br>\r\n\"What about the other witch? Clarcili?\"<br>\r\n\"That wretch? I don't care for her fealty. You will drag her here and I'll lock her away until the sun goes cold...\"<br>\r\n\"How do I start? My Lady?\"<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"You haven't even asked what your reward is.\"<br>\r\n\"Like you said, I owe you my life. And If I side with you, I'll have the chance of defeating the Witch Queen.\"<br>\r\nShe smiled and brushed your cheek with her hand. \"Not to mention, a Queen needs a consort... Who better than her brave first knight?\"<br>\r\nYou blush at the thought.<br>\r\nShe removes her hand. \"Take a knee, and swear fealty to me.\"<br>\r\nYou do that, swearing to forever fight for her, and follow her rules. While your head is lowered, she smiles sinisterly and accepts your oath.<br>\r\n\"Now, rise. Sir Erik the First Sworn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day later, you are back on the road. Your hair is trimmed, your clothes new, your backpack stocked well, your sword perfect, and your chest covered with armour. It bears the coat of the Queen of the Forest, and it's the first time one of her knights has been about in the world in years. Your missions are clear. Inside the forest you will need to recruit the Giantesses, the Tree people, the Sacred Black Covern, and various small towns of Monster Girls you learnt were in the forest. You will also need to subdue the Spider Sisterhood and, when you are powerful enough, capture Clarcili. All of these are your missions in the forest.<br>\r\nOutside the forest await challenges much like your old mission. The Queen needs cities to swear allegiance, to remember her Domain. And that will mean far journeys afield, many encounters with Monster-Girls, and trips to many cities.<br>\r\nIt's up to you whether you will start in the forest, or outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She spoke with a booming voice and threatening tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who dares to enter this part of the forest? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneeled in respect and answered her question,  \"I am Sir Erik, First sworn to her majesty of the forest. Great and mighty giantess I come not as a conquerer but as a negotiater. The Queen has placed me in charge of reuniting the factions of her kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! A bold claim but she has no power any longer. She may pretend to assert herself by sending a puny human, but it will take much more to have us join her again. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wrong!  She sends me to reclaim her fallen kingdom because I am the one who may change the world. You are familiar with the witch queen yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I told you that by joining her your people would help raise an army. THE army that dethrowned the witch queen and changed the world with your almighty strength. I think that deserves some consideration with your people don't you agree? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You speak an interesting argument. Give me 13 hours until I return with my leaders answer.\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well I'll remain here until then.\" The giantess walked away keeping her word. In the meantime you sat by a tree root waiting,  but the paitence broke when you heard something behind you.</span></div></div>",

It's a large and aged leather-bound book of spells. The Queen said it would be easy to learn from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the next few hours studying and practising a Protective Circle spell. Once cast, it surrounds an area with an impenetrable and invisible wall. In no time, you have the spell mastered and cast, protecting a small ring around you.The only evidence of the spell is the thin line that pushed through the foresty undergrowth, and the noticable sap on your strength. Clearly, casting spells has a draining effect on you. Safe inside your circle, you eat and rest peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waking, you start your day with some sword drills, stretching and practising your swings and strikes. You then don your armour, pack up your camp, and deactivate your circle. The power from your spell siphons back into you and you feel relieved at its return. You then return to the meeting point and wait.<br>\r\nThe Giantesses are punctual, returning almost exactly when they promised.<br>\r\n\"Knight!\" booms one. \"Our Queen will see you.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, lead the way.\"<br>\r\nThe Giantess shakes her head. \"Our land is far, and you'll never keep up.

You step into her hand, and she lightly places you on her shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Hold on Knight,\" she says as she breaks into a run.<br>\r\nThe massive woman and her companion run quickly through a path in the trees. The wind whips at your hair, and each step threatens to jostle you from your perch. After a particularily rough bump, you cry out involuntarily and can barely hold on. Your cry makes the Giantess pause.<br>\r\n\"Having trouble, Sir Knight?\" she mocks.<br>\r\n\"Just a little!\" you pant. \"Can't you rather walk?\"<br>\r\n\"No, we're only a few hours away.

She is taller than the others, barefoot, and wearing very little. Her mountainous beasts strain again their coverings, and her skirt is made of strips of leather that barely conceal her sex.

She climbed where only the creatures with firm grips could scale atop the highest reaches of the forest. As the giantess climbed higher you were wondering if you could see beyond the trees that made up the sky. By the time she reached the top of the rocky terrain, you saw that the entire tribe of giantess\u2019 lived on high above the forest. It would explain why they aren\u2019t always typically heard whenever they\u2019re on the move. The giantess took you to where a group of giantess\u2019 gathered around a fire and their leader sat on a chair wearing twigs to look like a crown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe  giantess carrying you laid you on to a platform that was directly above the fire, where you noticed that the area you were on top of specifically appeared to have a trap door which would drop you into the fire. You knew whatever you said would have to be something they could agree on otherwise you were either going to be roasted or worse, mated with by one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst sworn of the Forest Queen, you sought an audience with me. Elaborate on this proposal of yours. You claim that your Queen is building, THE army that would dethrone the Witch Queen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes your highness.\u201d, you kneeled in respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRise. Be quick with your words.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy queen says that if her former subjects were to provide their fealty again, she would be able to launch an army over the Witch Queen. I humbly request you to swear loyalty to her again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHAHAHAHHAAA! You are arrogant as you are puny. Why would I do such a thing? The giants here would make more suitable leaders than the puny Forest Queen. Swear to be MY knight and perhaps I will let you be transformed into a giant yourself. So that you could both serve me in this conquest and in my, more pleasurable endeavors.\u201d, she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith all do respect I ask you to assist me in bringing order back to the forest for the forest queen. Only together can we stand a chance of overthrowing the Witch Queen.\u201d, you politely declined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha! You presume too much. Even if I were to return to the Forest Queen\u2019s service, who would lead those forces? You? A knight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were losing them, you needed a way to persuade them in a way that they would respect you. \u201cI don\u2019t intend just to lead my queen\u2019s I intend to lead all races of the forest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHAHAHHAAHAAA! You jest far to much. You couldn\u2019t even handle me! The queen of giants! Your puny body could never satisfy me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I could? Would you follow me then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou satisfy me? Hmm. I\u2019d be entertained by the notion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will satisfy the great giantess queen. And show that there is more power in this forest than that overrated Witch Queen who rules over all of us can comprehend. So what\u2019s your answer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you can satisfy me, I will, consider it. But it depends on how much I am satisfied if at all by you puny human. If you bore me too fast, I\u2019ll cook you right here and now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will not fail you.\u201d, you realized that this was insane. You only said you could because that was the only thing all monster girls responded to universally in a positive light.</span></div></div>",

The queen stood over the platform and looked down on you. She let out her hands, you stood within her palms, then she raised you up to her face. \u201cAny creature can potentially please the great Giantess Queen, and this is how it is done.\u201d (instead of illusion, have the shamans imbue Eric with magic to provide the necessary extensions)<br>\r\nYou found your body feeling incredibly numb, it made you so numb you collapsed before the Giantess\u2019s hands. You then felt your member reach a hard-on. But then it started growing longer, and longer. You essentially reached the exact limits your body could physically reach for your member to ever stretch. The numbing made sure that you could feel the pleasure it brought without feeling the pain of your body remaining at the limit it can physically exceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor any creature, they must remain at this physical peak as long as they can in order to have sex with a giantess. Unless they are naturally of abnormal size, then they must have this method performed on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen placed you on what felt like a bed, and so undressed her lower body revealing her grand opening. The other giants were laughing or giggling, the idea of a puny human pleasing a giant was far fetched, but the queen? The one who was the tallest of the tribe? It would be impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had already taken off your pants for your hard-on to be free, and the queen lowered herself about to meet with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re ready.\u201d, the queen said sexually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last the folds made contact. In that instant, you lurched back in reflex. The insurmountable pleasure was on the verge of killing you right then and there! It felt so good you could cum right there and it would feel like a whole round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if you did, then the queen would probably kill you if you did. You needed to hold it in. You clenched all of your lower muscles holding in the urge.</span></div></div>",

And they were much bigger than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to regain composure to where holding it in wasn\u2019t a big issue now. Now this was going to be the difficult part. She pressed into you ever so gently, trying not to crush you. It was super slow for her, but it was just as hard to keep hold as when you first joined her massive slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to keep it in after surviving the contact as you managed to find a rhythm to hold in your desire to let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to move in rhythm with you, now the moments where you could have a moment to hold on were gone. Now every second from here on in was an everlasting moment to finally release. You didn\u2019t want to yet. The Queen wouldn\u2019t stand for it just when she started getting going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive, a puny human lasting enough to get me to start revving up.

But you needed to gain this army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was gaining speed, you felt some actual pain from this now. Holding it in now was becoming painful even with the shames numbing your body. Which made you worry since if now, you were feeling pain, you were in for one hell of a pain in the crotch when it wore off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought if you could release your load, you could survive the rest. But holding it in could ensure your alliance. The overwhelming pleasure was becoming to be too much for your body, you were going to give out any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can cum now, I can see how hard this must be for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave one big pelvet thrust and busted out your semen. You let out a loud moan that sounded like you were being relieved of pain rather than pleasure. Your fluids went inside her body, and at last you could relax if for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen didn\u2019t relent her slow but incredible thrusts into your member. After about a minute, you started taking the offensive now. You were managing to meet pace with the queen, this made the queen very excited. Any average creature wouldn\u2019t be able to get this far. Now her thrusts were starting to gain speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remained careful not to crush you within her folds, she managed to keep you both connected without surrendering too much comfort. The other giantess\u2019 were starting to look in awe of how you were matching pace with their queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued going for about 30 minutes until you build up enough of a desire to cum inside her again. Your moans echoed through the forest for the entirety of that time. You were pleasing the queen, you thrusted with all of your strength with each thrust as if you were bench pressing with just your member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed and kissed the lips of those now, wet folds which were leaking onto your small body. It was a tiring but unbelievable experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErik I\u2019m going to\u2026. Cu\u2026 ahhh\u2026. AHHHHHHHHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she and you both came together.

And if that isn\u2019t proof enough I am worthy of your strength, then let this reminder of reality be what beckons your call. The Witch Queen and her dominion has brought nothing but shame and have laid waste over this once great kingdom. I am not intending to eradicate all monster girls! No! I come to you all as a leader. But don\u2019t let that mistaken my intentions. This is not an exchange of ownership over who is your master. I am here to liberate you all. If we unite, with every race from the forest, to overwhelm the monster queen, then we will be able to reclaim our land. But numbers alone won\u2019t do her in! It is our passion for change, for love, for everything that makes our growing army prevail! So join me! Fight for something larger than ever your own bloody bodies, or fight to gain a reward equal to your own heights, I don\u2019t care why you do it, but at the least do it, so the pages of history remember the might giantess\u2019 who shook the very foundations of the Witch Queen!\u201d, you yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gave quite the speech. You certainly left an impression.\u201d, the queen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut will it be enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy people will fight of their own choice. But rest assured my elite guard will follow you along side me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe so called queen of Asun won\u2019t be able to ignore this growing alliance for long. Soon she will have to take action. A village of Dryads and the Giantess Elite guard isn\u2019t a force to match a witch. We\u2019ll need monster girls with an affinity for magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will be difficult since the monsters who were strong casters of magic were sentenced to the Queen to be her personal sex slaves or be her subjects to maintain her dominance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Sacred Black Coven was among the groups that I needed to recruit. Where will I find them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Coven are well hidden even from the Forest Queen and the Witch queen herself. They never show themselves in person, only through magic do they communicate to the outside world. Only way to meet with them now is to directly navigate to their lair. It\u2019s located in along the river by the falls.\u201d, the giantess explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHas anyone been able to find them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNobody. All anyone knows is that they\u2019re somewhere along the falls but nobody has ever figured out what it means.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll have to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re many types here that might help you, and some of them have fluids that would do well in creating powerful potions to find the coven.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe my queen will have a few ideas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething worthy to mention, come to my chambers Sir Erik.\u201d, she picked you up and brought you to her chambers where you assume her sex slaves and other various thing happen for her amusement. \u201cWhen your Forest Queen was in power, the other queens who lived with her domain were given mirrors that acted both as a doorway and a link of communication. She will have mirrors of all in her chambers. I shall activate mine to prove I am loyal to her once again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd thank you for that wonderful time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked into the mirror where it transported you back to the queen.</span></div></div>",

Most wonderful. My power has begun to be at its former glory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Coven is a matter I believe we should attend to next.

You would do anything to avoid a round for at least a week. Your entire private area felt sore from being with the giantess queen, which meant any sex for a while would be nothing but painful torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no dear, you aren\u2019t worthy of bringing me to my bed. Only after we defeat the Witch Queen would I allow such an honor to be given to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToday was a major victory. For now we must ready ourselves. We mustn\u2019t let this momentum we\u2019ve gathered stagger. Tomorrow I will send you to recruit the Plant life.\u201d, the queen announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t they loyal to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot every one of them are willing to remain loyal. And even the ones who are, won\u2019t forfeit their treasured fluids to me for a cause of any kind. Not unless I give them good reason to. In the past it was either because the forest was on the verge of destruction, or they owed a favor to me. Attempting to go to them without either of those reasons will strain relations with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will have to wait and see your majesty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. Meantime I have readied your quarters here. Enjoy your rest, you have earned it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore going to bed you noticed a desk containing a pen and some writing paper. It hit you that your village back home must be worried sick. Especially your crush Molly. You decided to write to them to explain your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cDear Molly, I am happy to report my quest to defeat the Witch Queen has become quite fruitful. I have gathered allies within the forest far from our own. This forest is ruled by a Queen, who has befitted me a proper set of armor and weapons to face against all sorts of monsters. So far I have recruited a whole village of Dryads and the Queen of Giantess\u2019. I will be headed to recruit the help of the Alurane population for their assistance tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a personal level, I hope this letter fills you with relief as this proves I still live. During my most trying point during my journey, when I was certain that my quest would be in vain I thought of you. I imagined how you would be saddened by best efforts being all for nothing. But I assure you that now I feel that things are looking up. In fact I dare say, the Forest Queen may allow me to hold a position of power, should we succeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel more commanding now, ever since I found her, I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019ve grown on confidence. Like now I can take anything, now that I have powerful allies. When I return home, I\u2019ll make our home a landmark and make it better than it ever was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Molly, I miss you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik</i></span></div></div>",

If you value your life hold your cries for help as no one will save you in time from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at who was grasping hold of you and saw the most striking monster girl you have laid eyes on yet. Her hair was dark as the night sky, palish skin but not ash-white pale, and within her maliciousness held a pair of gold yellow eyes. She wore jewelry with gold around her wrists, earrings, and hair thingys that tied her hair in a pony tail. She wore a dark shade of red on her dress shading her most noticeable areas, with the color brown to blend into the rest. A figure that had some nice busty assets around her but for all intensive purposes she seemed human. \"Hmmm for a human you look so tasty.\", her mouth opened to reveal a pair of long fangs hanging on her upper gums. It made sense what she was now, Vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milady hasn't need of meat this hour does she?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you silly boy.

And like me, my queen hates to waste the talent when it can be put into servitude to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Servitude under a leader or slave to a master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The forest queen is among the few who could quickly rise to power and challenge the witch queen. She has all the resources at her beck and call but she is reconnecting with them through you.\", the vampire explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't betray her!\", you struggled more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me.\", she said directly. For some reason you stopped trying to struggle and felt the need to hear her out. \"My queen is offering you a whole town of monster women as your sex slaves. You will be master to them for the rest of your life. But all you have to do, is deliver to us the forest queen's crown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hung on every word she said, steal your majesty's crown? Humiliation may not be the only reason behind this request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't. I won't.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have you do it by force but the sun would be out by the time we were halfway out of this forest and I'd be very limited to make it out. So for now this is all I can make do with. Bring the forest queen outside the castle to help you discover the coven tomorrow, to prove you accepted the offer. If not, you can try to build your feeble army and have a lucky monster girl keep you as a sex slave, be crushed under my queen's power, or die. Slow and painful isn't my method of straight forward death, much too boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire threw you back into your room and disappeared into the night. You wished you were dreaming, but the marks on your neck reminded the fact, this was real. At least she didn't try getting into your pants.</span></div></div>",

It was sticky and hard to move, you weren\u2019t bound by anything but you could barley swing your arms around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider-girl got back up and webbed your feet together, she tied them and then started hoisting you up into the branches above. You still had your sword and tried to swing it at the web tethering your legs, but your force wasn\u2019t enough to break it in one swing, you were breaking it apart, but the spider-girl noticed and knocked your sword out of your hand making it fall to the ground and repaired the damage to the web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took you up to her lair where monster-girl bugs and birds were all trapped trying to escape. \u201cYou will make an excellent prisoner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!

You were surprised she started with you first but it gave you some time to free yourself a bit. She managed to cut the web around her wings, freeing herself completely and left you your knife.

You were at the bottom of the falls, so you weren't in immediate danger thankfully. But the spider went to try and collect you soon as you came up for air. She spewed web out of her mouth hitting your arm, you tugged at it real hard, suddenly the spider came right at you, but not of her own volition. You slammed into the monster girl knocking the wind out of her. You looked at your arm and noticed the water made the webbing rubbery and more solidified. You scrapped it off with ease and waled over to the monster girl holding your sword to her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm giving you one chance to surrender. If you do not relent I will be forced to kill you.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider girl snarled, \"The forest queen will never return to power. We will take what she stole.\" <br>\r\nHer remark confused you for a moment which was enough to have one of her legs quickly wrap up your own legs. She had you tied up again but this time she had your face untouched by the her web. She barred her teeth at you threatening to do all manner of torture, \"Normally I would fuck you to death or suck out the fluid in your body. But I think I will eat your head whole for all the trouble you caused me today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to do that when the harpy from before clawed at the spider girl right in the face. Blood popped out of the beast's many eyes. When she turned you noticed most of them were clawed right out of her sockets, leaving only 3 eyes total left unharmed. It screamed in a ear piercing hiss in a blind vengeful rampage. The Harpy grabbed the spider and ascended high up, the spider girl was unable to do anything having its legs move erratically. With one good throw, the harpy dropped the spider girl into the water, effectively drowning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harpy came down and used its talons to cut your free. \"Thanks I am very grateful for you saving my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You choosing to trust me saved mine. I would be happy to show my appreciation, and getting yours at the same time.\", she said with sultry eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? Perhaps another time. Right now the Coven is my top concern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Maybe I will tag along until I can make time.\", she cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked flushed but at least felt grateful someone was helping you on such a tough journey. \"Ok. So somewhere along these falls, is their hideout. But where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it isn't down below. Many water based monsters tried that. The rocks are thick as metal, so no openings. To be frank nobody knows.\", the harpy exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet they know its around here. So it has to be. Maybe up stream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. The only reason people know is because there is a ton of magic coming from this spot. It just leaves them to be the only ones who could live here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around, looking for a clue. You starred at the falls, but noticed an incongruety. The water coming down, wasn't leaving ripples outward the water. \"Hold on. Look at the water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ripples are coming outward from the falls, its going inward! That's where they must be. Their entrance is through it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All be damned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the water is laced with their magic, it would explain why the web was changed when that monster girl attacked me. Maybe I need to go straight through the falls or over-\", suddenly the water blasted out and splashed down on top of you. For some reason you felt being sucked inside. When it ended, you were on the floor of a cavern. From what you gathered, it must be the entrance to the Coven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed the harpy wasn't with you. But you heard laughter deeper in the cave. In a second you found yourself bound by dirt and soil trapping you in a cocoon. You had your head free, and saw the dirt around you crawl forward along the path. All you could see going deeper in the cave was darkness.</span></div></div>",

Wait! Just listen! She-\u201c, you halted for a second. Bragging about her rise to power would only encourage them disposing you and letting them take over.

What would she offer that she would discard if it is so valuable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou all, would be the leading witches, of the world! No need to hide any longer.

He is only saying that to save his own skin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Forest Queen was ruthless but fair, our alliance allowed us freedom to do what wished so long as we paid a reasonable tribute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo quick to grovel sister? Why not keep that boy for yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSisters this is our only chance to get anything substantial out of a good opportunity. Have you felt the giants and the dryads begin to submit to her rule once again?\u201d, the one who seemed interested in the deal tried making the others see the viability of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClora you have always respected the queen. This is turning into trouble for our sisterhood. We are loyal only too each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlliances have been made to ensure our survival. If we openly oppose we will have nothing.\u201d, Clora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have grown tired of serving, it is time we rule instead.\u201d, the others all agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are all fools.\u201d, Clora said leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSisters\u2026do you believe we-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.

You were hung by your wrists dangling by the pot barley touching the liquid inside. The other three Mages laughed as the started chanting their magic spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they doing?!\", you asked Clora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are priming the potion for absolute stimulation.

Give us the magic of your union!\", the other Dark Mages chanted. The ropes holding your wrists became undone causing you and Clora to fall into the potion. At first nothing, your first thought was to get out of it, the temperature was like that of a hot spring only warmer than preferred. You were already getting yourself out, but just before you could even lift your first leg out, you felt strange. Your libido was straight as an arrow,  a thirst for courtship swept your mind. You sunk your head into the potion washing all of your body into this intoxicating feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you rose up, you saw Clora giving you signals to come to her side. Her eyes were sharp as daggers with her sultry look of desire, the smile she gave was transparent as ice, her fingers waving you down like a distress flag beyond the sea. Without any hesitation from either of you, you both joined together as one and with nothing held back, exerted intense passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lips sucked the others like a slobbering child would. Tongues poked and swirled without any guidance or reason to savor the taste of saliva. Hips thrust and thrust with sheer power in every movement. In your mind this was all that mattered, all that needed to matter. It didn't matter what you liked in a woman or who you were fucking right now, you just needed to and with everything you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Clora yelled and screamed and moaned in ecstasy. For four whole hours you and her engaged in ravenous sex until you two began to grow so tired you both died from the amount of stimulation and exhaustion of the union.

Now that I know where you hide, its rather sad seeing how all these years you have only clung to this cave like animals. Your power was only a challenge nobody knew where your domain was. But now, your tricks are little more than riff raff. I know your secret, and my Knight has delivered me my best pawns to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem very boastful for someone without her full strength.\u201d, they said trying to act prideful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have had enough of your petty squabbles. But you need for our alliance to work until we overthrow the Witch Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want the forest, we have no interest in the world. You were too ambitious, and look where it has lead you.\", one of the witches spoke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have the giantess' and the dryads. Soon the rest will follow and I will not be betrayed this time. What of you. You haven't changed sisters.\", the Queen chuckled and taunted them like a bitter rival rubbing in the fact of the other's superiority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe demand tribute to get us back in your graces.\u201d, the three claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three are in no position to bargain.\", she sternly raised her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We... will provide all of our resources to you.

A way to replenish our magic for the road ahead.\", she elaborated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. You, in particular, for helping my knight I shall grant you rights to my gift.\", Clora bowed down in gratitude while the others knelt in solem anger.\u201cYou will be given a human, my knight Eric for your replenishment.\u201d, she offered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy queen?\u201d, you reacted not the most enthusiastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErik do be a dear and let these, darling friends of mine have some fun with you.\u201d, she ordered you.

But I am grateful it will not be born from devious intent like most would care to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have no fear, this endeavor will be one you will thoroughly enjoy.\", she said confidently. Yet you still reserved judgement and still didn't feel to please about the arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed was ready Clora nonchalantly took off her cloths and sat on the edge of the bed covering her privates deliberately to tease you into her seduction. You didn't get into this so quickly as you still tried hoping to have the bargain dealt differently even though you knew it wouldn't work, you stubbornly persisted anyway on the slimmest of chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now, time for fun, and for you to get into it. <b>Maximum attraction!</b> She casted a spell that allowed anyone within range to view her with a high degree of attraction to her. Dark Mages used spells to enhance their sexual experiences so this was to be expected from them. You weren't so prepared though. Almost as if it were a cartoon it almost looked like hearts would form in your eyes by how wide eyed you looked at Clora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took off your armor and cloths and literally dove into her. You took a moment to admire her fully revealed body, she seemed flattered by how much you liked it judging from her blushed face. You squeezed and rubbed her large breasts like tenderizing a meal. They were so big it was inhuman, but a monster girl could often hold steadily to such unproportioned assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClora moaned joyously by your initiative and arousing actions you were giving her. She pulled you close by your shoulders into a deep kiss. You could feel like she was doing something to you through this, but it was so pleasurable on its own you didn't care after the fact. \"I just helped make you more adaptable to my spirit energy, our union may be short, but it must yield enough for our power to be sufficient.\", she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't care you continued your actions by kissing the side of her neck giving her a hickey. Clora felt so hot and embarrassed by this. Normally the monster girl takes lead but here, she was feeling pleased just from you. She felt your erect member, and took that sign to change things up. In a smooth yet firm pull, she had you inside of her vagina, making the both of you one. You moaned to the point it was quite audible from outside the room. Clora laughed, thinking she made it even on the embarrassment scale for you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClora rolled over being on top now, and rode you with you laying down and letting her do whatever she wanted. The exhaustion thus far started getting to you, Clora's spirit energy had broken your resistance and made you completely susceptible to her whims. Clora did not do much from there except ride you along like a horse, and squeezing your member at the right intervals for maximum pleasure. In a few seconds the urge to cum grew notable. Three or more times of Clora's movement down your privates was all that would be needed to give her the energy the Coven required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to hold it in, you were enjoying it very much, you wanted to last a little longer. But finally you felt your body squeeze out your fluids and it entered Clora's insides. You both moaned loudly from your orgasm leaving the both of you satisfied with your sexual encounter. She laid on top of you, both of you incapable of movement from the experience, but it didn't leave you two uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent work there Sir Eric. My sisters should be at full strength within the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\", you said dozing off a bit.</span></div></div>",

Your priorities shifted to meeting the Elder Dryad to gain the full support of the tree people to boost the Forest Queen's power. With the opening back outside left open for you, you thanked the Dark Mages for their fealty and left. When you exited outside waterfall you presumed to be real was actually an illusion, so you managed to walk right through it without issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you saw through it, the harpy who had aided you earlier was gone. You guessed it must have assumed you died or would be forever lost to the world. It seemed likely in hindsight given how most adventurers don't appear to last long. You took a moment to consider how far you have made in your quest to defeat the Monster Queen. Most of your success relied on luck, mercy from people who had total control over your fate, really you felt blessed to have survived this long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy breath to let out your stressful mind, you headed to where the Elder Dryad would be found. The Elder monsters often are found in the heart of their native population. Dryads being half-tree, naturally the place to go was the heart of the Forest itself. But this journey would not be so easy, you knew just from a few days in the forest it is teeming with all sorts of monster girls who would hunt to rob you of your freedom for sexual pleasures. Going into the heart of it would not  only attract not only Dryads but other monster girls who dwelled around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime skip....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a full two days on your own searching for the Elder Dryad. You were running out of basic supplies, and finding shelter was becoming less frequent since last night you were nearly taken by four different monster girls in the night. Dusk was creeping above the tree tops, meaning you had to find somewhere, where you could spend the night and refuel. Luckily ahead you noticed a sign showing two different places that had rest areas for weary travelers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the left, a traveler inn. This was perfect, traveler inns are neutral territory and guarantee safety for adventurers, since Monster girls are never allowed inside, and there are multiple protection spells to keep them out. The downside was that if you went left it would be counter intuitive in the direction you were headed. It was a 5 mile walk and you were already tired as is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe right path offered another option though. A monster brothel, humans welcome, vacancy. It was about the same distance as the inn but in the same direction you were headed for. You knew the path on the right was an obvious trap, however a seal was embedded onto the sign. A royal seal! This changed your thoughts on this place, since royal seals were the signs of integrity. Given this seal was the same to the Forest Queen's symbol on her banner in her castle, you considered to give it the benefit of the doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were viable options with their disadvantages. But ultimately you decided to go to...</span></div></div>",

You knew there might be a little trouble, but you figured expediency was the higher priority. You knew it would be best to play it safe, but being the Forest Queen's knight, and having some large allies now, it felt that the risk wasn't too high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou headed to the brothel hoping things would be smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours later, you arrived. The brothel was located in a giant mushroom with a blueish glow like it was a light bulb. You walked toward the stem thinking the entrance was in the stem. You knocked on it expecting an answer. Suddenly a hole opened inside with some kind of bouncer peeking out. \"What mare rides on all fours?\", the bouncer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew this was some kind of password system they used. For entry but you had no idea what to say or what that even meant. Only thing that jumped to mind was telling them you work for the Forest Queen. \"I am her majesty's personal knight. This establishment is under her protection, so I need to use this to rest and restock my supplies.\", you said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come again when you know the password.\", the bouncer closed the peek hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for gods sake!\", you kicked the stem hard out of frustration knowing it was another night fending for yourself. However an lift that took people up to the cap of the mushroom hoisted down for you. Presumably the bouncer joked with you or left you with a warning of some kind. But either way you got on, and just after that you were being brought up. When you reached to the top a door opened with the first monster girl to see in this establishment, being a Centaur. It didn't look like a traditional one, this one wore a little hood over her head and carried a staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome knight of to our queen. I am the owner of this establishment.\", the half horsed girl informed you. She let you inside, soon as you did, you noticed all the other monster girls in either lewd clothing or none at all. The place seemed very morbid, not the kind of tone to expect in a brothel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave your bag anywhere, my girls will take it and refuel your supplies and belongings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. You will be remembered for your actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is our duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something didn't feel very right. Her tone was genuine but the words she chose gave you the idea she was planning something that would mean ill-will for you. You kept a hand on your sword just in case you needed to fight. The centaur showed you to a room. \"This is where you will sleep.\"<br>\r\nThe fungus bed felt soft and squishy, not at all what you thought. \"Sleep well. Very safe.\", your host said before shutting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't buying it and sat in a pretzel style position with your sword on your lap. You wanted to lay back but this seemed too creepy the more you stayed here. You shut your eyes and tried to be ready for anything as long as you could consciously be aware...</span></div></div>",

Once you had your hand over on the knob you called out in response, \"Yes?!\", you tightened your grip on your blade expecting the very next thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I enter?\", it was the owner of the brothel. You lowered your guard a bit by opening the door. When it opened, the small cloaked centaur from earlier had apparently been hiding her erotic personality with her covering and concealed appearance from earlier. She was without the cloak altogether. She looked very buxom with long flowing hair and prime facial features that grown women only dream of. It made sense by her striking appearance she would be the leader of an establishment like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something you need from me?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. I have all I need.\", she said as her horse body trotted towards you slowly. \"The real question is, do you have everything you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she asked you felt completely at peace. Her question brought out a total and unbreakable trust with her. She gently pushed you onto your bed undressing you until you were completely naked. She took no time being as naked as you were. She smiled positioning her lower body to where she and you could be most comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis felt so strange like it was all a dream. You were about to have sex with this lovely monster girl. But there was this sense, sense that you get when you dream that reminds you this isn't real. Why are you so trusting of her?

The centaur interjected, \u201cIt is just spring water, taken from the purest of sources within the forest. It will quench your thirst.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis point you had one answer, \u201cNOPE! I am fine! I\u2019ll be on my way!\u201d, suddenly a seat grabbed your arms and kept you seated.

For some reason it had a strong odor, it must have smelled so badly you were on the verge of passing out. You kept your mouth sealed tight, if you drank it, who knows what it would do to you. The chair then bear hugged you forcing you to gasp for air, to which the cup forced itself in your mouth pouring a little of the water inside. You didn\u2019t swallow it at first, you held it inside so that when you could, you would spit it out. But then moments after the taste set in, your tongue felt numb. You felt funny. You couldn\u2019t wrap your head around it, but the water tasted great, but it had no flavor. Yet you wanted another sip. When the cup left your mouth so that the bottle could refill itself, you took a large gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you swallowed that numbness followed along with the drink. You felt fuzzy, as if your body was falling asleep. The next sip of the spring water felt just as numb. You could feel the liquid in your mouth as you gulped it down but it just made you feel funny. The chair let go of you letting you have the cup, with one last sip, you felt parched and didn\u2019t feel thirsty anymore. But your body felt like it was falling asleep. But now that feeling went to your head at last. You let out a heavy yawn. And with no feeling in your entire body you fell back limply and with a peaceful smile passed out.</span></div></div>",

Oh how he wished that he didn't run into those goblin slavers. Taking up a fighting stance, Erik waited for whatever this beast would do to him. And waited he did, keeping his stance at the go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Was that rolling attack all it had?</i>\" Erik thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cautiously, Erik crossed over to the stuck in boulder and was greeted by the smell of blueberries. It was a giant blueberry that was trying to kill him! Erik found that absurd, at least the monster girls were a moving danger. Erik wondered why someone would waste perfectly good produce, especially something this huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Erik inspected the huge thing between the trees, looking for any signs of entrapment. As he got closer, Erik began to touch it. The front half was open to him and was smooth. A small divot was in the middle, Erik poked his finger into it. Afterwards, Erik looked upwards, two small dots were on the the blueberry. Erik was confused, and then got an idea. Going over and taking a hollow log, Erik dragged it over and stood upon the it. Like an inspector, Erik looked at the two divots and tweaked them a little. Suddenly, he was startled by the boulder moving;so it was a monster! He ran off the log and ran a good distance away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Erik waited for an attack again, but none came. Slowly did he reached back to the hollow tree and tried to find the head of the beast. Craning his head upward, he found it in a small crater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It wasn't a horrible snarling thing, but a young woman with tears in her eyes.

No cat slits, snake eyes, or weird pupils in general, just normal human eyes. Erik looked at her and she looking back at him.

The roped weights coil around your ankles, trip you, and send you sprawling naked to the ground. You try to crawl away, but one Gobliness lightly jumps from her house and lands next to you. She grabs your roped ankles and drags you helplessly backwards.<br>\r\n\"Going somewhere boy!\" She taunts in a scratched, hissing voice.<br>\r\nYou're yanked back and flipped over. You try to fight, but the Gobliness straddles you and forces your wrists to the ground. She's stronger than you, and her greenish-grey arms are coils of muscles. They're both wearing light, yet rough clothes. Long and tough leather boots, riding pants, a strip that holds down their breasts, and leather bracers. The one straddling you carries more bolas as well as a short sword, the other has a belt with many large pouches.   The second Gobliness lands at your head and quickly ties your wrists together tightly.<br>\r\n\"Selka!\" You scream. \"Help!\"<br>\r\nThe first Gobliness clamps her hand over your mouth to stifle you.<br>\r\n\"Sssh boy! You're ours now.\"<br>\r\nThe second Gobliness finishes with your wrists and quickly ties up your ankles. In less than a minute, you're their bound prisoner.<br>\r\nThe Gobliness sitting on your is breathing heavily and staring at you. She brushes a finger across your cheek.<br>\r\nThe other one slaps her hand away. \"Not yet, Red. We need to measure him first.\"<br>\r\nThe one on you, apparently called Red, sighs and gets off. The two Goblinesses then take you by your wrists and drag you kicking and thrashing to a nearby tree. A long rope is tied to your wrists, then thrown over a branch, and you're hoisted until you can barely stand.<br>\r\nThe two slavers inspect you. First your height is measured, then the width of your chest, hips, neck, biceps and thighs. They talk constantly, Red is the one doing the touching and feeling, while the other is writing down details. <br>\r\nThen Red moves to your dick. She measures you, cupping your balls and stroking your shaft.<br>\r\n\"Nice size...\" she comments.<br>\r\n\"Get him hard Red, we need more numbers.\"<br>\r\nRed does that, pumping your dick with her strong hand. It feels wrong, being tied up and molested by these horrid creatures. You try kick Red and scream, but only succeed in swinging yourself.<br>\r\nRed laughs as the other uncoils a long whip. \"Careful slave. You're worth money, and I know how to beat you without breaking you...\"<br>\r\nYou can do nothing but glare as the other takes notes and Red keeps playing with you. Soon you're half-hard, so Red opens her mouth and unleashes a too-long forked tongue. She flicks it across your organ, teasing, stimulating, before opening her mouth and taking you in. She sucks, licks, and tugs, soon getting you swollen and erect. And then she stops, spits your dick out, and takes a measurement. <br>\r\n\"Like I said, nice size...\" Said Red, squeezing your balls painfully as she stood up.<br>\r\n\"Good, good. Test his mouth.\"<br>\r\nRed steps up on a high root and is now higher than you. She forces your mouth open with a rough, calloused hand. Then she sticks a finger in, rooting around, pulling your tongue out as far as possible.<br>\r\n\"Good teeth, large mouth, long tongue...\" she says. She then examines the rest of your face, eyes, ears and hair.<br>\r\n\"Check his ass, there's a market for depth\"<br>\r\n\"No, no! Wait!\" you beg as Red licks a finger and forces it up your ass. So struggle, kick and scream as she feels around inside you. It feels like ages until she finally pulls out.<br>\r\n\"Average,\" she says, sounding almost disappointed.<br>\r\nThe other nods, writes down some more notes, and finally puts her notebook away. \"This one is good. He's nice and young, strong, big enough.\"<br>\r\n\"And if a buyer doesn't like fucking him, he'll make a tasty treat,\" threatens Red before licking your back.<br>\r\nWithout talking, they lower you to the ground. Red straddles you enthusiastically as they tie you up even more securely. When you're trussed up, Red throws you over her shoulder and carries you to her horse.<br>\r\n\"Where are you taking me!?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"You'll see, human. But I suggest you enjoy the sun while you can still see it...\" Red answers.<br>\r\nShe throws you over her horse and ties you tight to her saddle. Then she jumps up and sits behind you. In this position, you're lying over the saddle, and Red is half sitting on top of you.<br>\r\n\"Get comfortable human...\" taunts Red. She sneaks her hand between your legs and gropes your dick and balls. \"I'm going to have much more fun than you...\"<br>\r\nYou glance up and catch a look from the other captive. She's blonde, clothed, gorgeous, and looks terrified. Her mouth is gagged, and her Gobliness is sitting in front of her, so she's clearly not being used as a toy.<br>\r\nThe other looks at Red. \"Lets go find the others, we're meant to meet at the barge this evening\" she orders.<br>\r\nBoth slavers crack their reins and ride at brisk trot. Red keeps her hand between your legs, twisting, scratching, pulling, and making you even more uncomfortable.<br>\r\nThe four of you ride off to find the rest of the slaver party. </span></div></div>",

You're taken off the horse once to pass water, but otherwise you're bound and in Red's grasp for hours. As you all ride, you learn that the other is named Gypsum. The names are off putting, far too pretty for Goblinesses.<br>\r\nAfter midday, Red and Gypsum begin to encounter other slavers and their prizes. In ones and twos, your party grows until there are at least twenty horses, each with a rider and a captive. The captives are men and women, and it looks like you're the youngest. Some are in worse predicaments that you, lying face-up on the horses while their Goblin captors straddle or sit of their faces.<br>\r\nWhen one slaver joins the party, all the others cheer. She is leading two horses behind hers, and both have two captives each. She is also much larger, easily twice your size. Her light green-grey body is muscled, she's dressed the same as the goblins, and her hair is shaved at the temples. From her sheer size, you guess that she's both an orcess and the leader of this band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly before sunset, you arrive at The Barge. It's a large, river-going vessel that sits low in the water. Next to it is a large inn, with an even larger stable. The name is written in Orc, and indecipherable. <br>\r\nThe entire party unloads their captives next to the barge. There is a series of posts, and four slaves are forced to the ground and tied to each. You're sanwiched between Gypsum's captive, and a woman wearing cleric robes. Red and Gypsum lead their horses into the stable, and come out a few minutes later carrying only their gear. Red walks over to you, and boldly sits on your laps, grinding her thin hips painfully into your crotch.<br>\r\n\"All of this,\" she says gesturing, \"is to support us. We slavers pay that inn a lot of money to keep the horses here, and they also kidnap a few guests for us.\"<br>\r\nYou let her talk. You've tried speaking a few times today, and it's only earned you pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the large Orcess comes striding out of the stables with her gear. Gypsum and several other Goblinesses approach her and hand over papers with their captive's details. The Orcess pockets them, and shouts out.<br>\r\n\"Load the meat!\" She has a commanding voice, although it's surprisingly appealing. Throaty, yet smooth.<br>\r\nAt her command, Red unties you and the other woman from the post and starts leading you into the barge. She walks quickly to avoid the surge of other slavers doing the same thing. As she's about to mount the gangplank, you all pass the Orcess. The giant leader glances at you, then suddenly grabs you and pulls you close.<br>\r\n\"You're young...\" she purrs. Her hand on your wrist is like a vice, and her gaze is predatory. <br>\r\nThe Orcess shoves you away, and Red leads you up the gangplank and onto the boat.<br>\r\nOn the other side are two Monster Girls. One is a blue Lamia, half-snake, and upper body female. She's wearing rough oilskins and is clearly the captain. The Monster next to her is a lithe, blue-skinned Naiad. She's also naked, and clearly the first mate.<br>\r\nYou presence seems popular, as the Lamia licks her lips while looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed leads you below deck. It's dark and humid, and you're forced onto a bench with your wrists shackled above your head. The other captive is finally ungagged, and restrained next to you. She pants as she's shackled down.<br>\r\nRed squats in front of you, parts your legs and grabs your dick painfully again.<br>\r\n\"You, dear boy, are going to be very popular on this voyage,\" she taunts. She leans in and licks you from your chest to your chin, then walks away.<br>\r\nAs other slaves are led in and chained down, you try to settle in for the voyage. An hour later, shouts and calls from above deck announce the departure, and the barge slips its mooring and is caught by the river current. Goblins begin to patrol as you all sail away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed was right. It wasn't even an hour before someone came to use you. It was... </span></div></div>",

What about you?\"<br>\r\n\"I was sold. By my step-mother.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" you say aghast. \"I don't know what to say, that's awful.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you.

I only hope that...\"<br>\r\nShe's cut off suddenly by one of the patrolling goblinesses who grabs her painfully by the cheeks.<br>\r\n\"You're a pretty one...\" the slaver hisses. \"And you have a nice mouth...\"<br>\r\nThe gobliness began unlacing her trousers. <br>\r\n\"No! Please don't!\" begged the captive.<br>\r\n\"Don't talk with your mouth full!\" snarled the gobliness as she shoved her hairy pussy into the captive's face and began to grind. The other patrolling slavers broke out into cheers and catcalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Red was standing in front of you.<br>\r\n\"Hello boy...\" she said threateningly. \"My leader wants to have a word.\"<br>\r\nYou're uncuffed and pulled to your feet. Red grabs a fistful of your hair and half drags you with her. You pass the captive who is still having her face raped and you climb the stair back up to the deck. The top of the barge is mostly piled with crates and boxes, most likely legitimate cargo. To the rear is the wheelhouse, and behind that is the captain's cabin. To the front of the barge is a large, opulent tent, and Red drags you into that and throws you to your knees. Inside is dark, lit by several red lanterns and a low fire in a brazier. The floor is carpeted, there are numerous large chests and a desk. Opposite you is a long, low, bed  that looks more like a couch. Seated on that is the massive Orcess. Her accommodations clearly point to her being the chief slaver, and leader of this operation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins at you, baring her large tusks.<br>\r\n\"Hello Meat\" she growls.<br>\r\nYou say nothing, until Red slaps you on the back of your head.<br>\r\n\"Answer the commander!\" she hisses.<br>\r\n\"Um, hello. Ma'am.\" you say awkwardly.<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha!\" booms the Orcess. \"Calling me Ma'am already? Slavery will suit you fine. But Ma'am is what you call your owners. You will call me Quinne.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, Quinne.\" you say.<br>\r\nQuinne makes a gesture. \"Red, get out. I want to test the Meat.\"<br>\r\nRed looks like she's about to argue, but drops the matter. With a final and painful twist of your nipple, she stalks off. Probably to find someone else to rape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinne beckons you over. \"Come here slaveboy. Take off my armour.\"<br>\r\nYou get to your feet and stand behind her. She's wearing a combination of heavy plate and leather, and you start unlacing the shoulder guards first.<br>\r\n\"You have a well built body,\" she compliments. \"Were you a squire or a fighter?\"<br>\r\n\"I was an, adventurer.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh? What was your quest?\"<br>\r\n\"To, to kill the Monster Queen.\"<br>\r\nQuinne booms laughter. \"It looks like you didn't get far!\"<br>\r\nYou grit your teeth as you start on the next shoulder. <br>\r\n\"Do you like my ship?\" she asks.<br>\r\nThere's no point in lying. \"It's horrible.\" you mutter.<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is. But not when you own it. Did you catch the name of it?\"<br>\r\nIt was written in Orcish, so you shake your head.<br>\r\n\"It translates to '<i>Chattel Wrangler</i>. I named it myself\"<br>\r\nYou stay silent as the other pauldron comes off. Now you're working on the gorget.<br>\r\n\"I bought it ten years ago, hired that snake captain eight years ago. And every year I make twelve trips just like this one. My cargo is always full.\"<br>\r\nWhen the gorget comes off, Quinne sighs in a please way. Her neck is beaded with sweat, and she hands you a towel.<br>\r\n\"Wipe me down first.\"<br>\r\nYou start wiping the sweat off your captors neck, then stand in front of her to unlace her gauntlets.<br>\r\n\"You probably want to know where you're going? The barge will take two days to reach Darkstad, the underground city.\" <br>\r\nThe name Darkstad gives you a chill. It's a massive city built into and under a mountain. You've heard that no human has ever left it.<br>\r\n\"There, I auction you personally at the Flesh Dock. I pocket the coins, and throw you to your new owner.\"<br>\r\nThe thought of you being property is starting to hit, and an uncontrollable shivering comes over you. Quinne ignores it, instead presenting her other hand for you to unlace. <br>\r\n\"Until then, you're mine.\" she growls, staring at you as one would a morsel.<br>\r\nShe leans back and lifts her foot. It's massive, and looks like a booted shovel. Untying and removing her boots takes a lot of effort, and a pungent odor fills the small tent. <br>\r\n\"Put a kettle on to boil,\" she orders while pointing out a water cask and a large black pot. You fill it, and leave it on the brazier before returning to her side to unlace her breastplate. Underneath she's wearing a light shirt that stains to hold in her breasts. For a Monster so muscular, she has massive breasts.<br>\r\nShe unlaces her shirt and parts it in the middle, revealing her cleavage and chiseled abs.<br>\r\n\"Do you like my body?\" she asks coyly while stroking a finger through the light sweat on her skin.<br>\r\nYou say nothing, and she laughs at your shyness.<br>\r\n\"Lick my feet,\" she orders suddenly, pressing a massive foot into your face.<br>\r\nYou hesitate, stunned by the invasion of the smelly, massive, green foot. She growls, and you stop hesitating.<br>\r\nGrimacing, you lick the sole of Quinne's foot with big strokes. She shivers with pleasure, and makes you do the other foot after a few minutes. Then she forces her toes into your mouth and makes you suckle them, one by one.<br>\r\n\"You make me wish I always had a foot slave,\" she purrs.<br>\r\nBefore long she pushes you away, ordering that you add scented oils to the boiling water. After mixing in a pleasant smelling lavender and cinnamon oil, you pour the water from the kettle into a washbasin and soak a washcloth in it. <br>\r\n\"Wash me Slave,\" orders Quinne, while pulling off her shirt.<br>\r\nYou start at her shoulders, dipping the washcloth, wringing it out, then wiping down her neck. You move down to her shoulders and clean her gently.<br>\r\n\"Use your muscles...\" she orders, eyes closed from pleasure.<br>\r\nYou obey, massaging her long, bulging muscles as much as you can. You can feel the knots of tension being rubbed out of them as you captor relaxes. You rinse the cloth, and continue down her arm, then her huge hands. You spend a little time massaging her palm, then move to the other arm.<br>\r\nThe arousal kicks in when you start on her breasts. They're the size of your head, smooth, and topped by a dark green and rigid nipple as you clean them of sweat and dust, Quinne murmurs with pleasure and your penis stirs. You continue cleaning her stomach, before stopping.<br>\r\nQuinne stands long enough to strip off her leather pants and throw them aside. Now fully naked, you can see that her legs are just as impressively muscled as the rest of her. Her pussy is hairy, and gaping, easily large enough for your face to be engulfed fully. You continue to wash down her legs, and spend some time pleasuring her feet. Finally, you're made to clean between her rock hard and sweaty buttocks.<br>\r\nClean, she wraps a tiny loin cloth around her waist, barely concealing herself.<br>\r\n\"Can you cook?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour, you prepare her meal. She eats a grilled venison steak, and a thick vegetable stew. While she eats, she has you on hand and knee in front of her to serve as her table. After she's had you clean up, she lies fully stretched on the bed and hands you more scented oils.<br>\r\n\"Massage me until I say stop.\"<br>\r\nYou comply, working the oil into her hard body, you don't pace yourself and soon tire. Your hand cramps, your arms ache, and you only want to sleep. But touching this intimidating yet sexy Monster Girl keeps you turned on enough to hold your attention.<br>\r\nSuddenly, you notice something. One of the knives you used for cooking wasn't packed away, and Quinne hasn't noticed. She's face-down with her eyes closed, blissful under your massaging hands. You have to act now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lunge for the knife, grab it, and are about to hold it to Quinne's neck. For a big woman, she moves fast. She grabs your wrist in mid-swing.<br>\r\n\"I didn't say stop...\" she growls furiously, standing up. She towers easily two feet above you, so larger and heavier you can't even comprehend it. She squeezes your wrist, and you drop the knife. She then easily pushes you over onto the bed and straddles you.<br>\r\n\"Now lets see if you're really a good slave!\"<br>\r\nShe slides her massive pussyy above your head and sits down. You were right, her sex engulfs your face like it's trying to eat you. Her weight nearly crushes you, it's sopping wet inside her, and you feel a clit as large as a pebble rubbing against you. She begins to rape your face, and Quinne cums in minutes. You're barely given a breather before she face-fucks you again, and again. And again.<br>\r\nShe's cum four times, but it's not enough. She removes your face from her gaping hole and moves down to your dick. Somehow it's hard, and it gets lost in her huge folds. <br>\r\n\"You are so small...\" she taunts as she rides you to another orgasm. You can't move under the mountain of her body, and her thick legs keep you tightly pinned.<br>\r\nAfter a short while, you cum too. Quinne pulls you out, and stands up, leaving you exhausted on the bed as she washes your seed out. When you've gotten your breath back, she orders you to kneel on the floor again. She sits in front of you, spreads her legs, and pulls your face back into her pussy for you to lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raping goes on for hours. You rest little, and alternate between licking and using your fingers, hand, and fist to bring her to orgasm. You're in a stupour when Quinne finally pulls you onto the bed, cuffs your wrist to a pole and settles her massive bulk on top of you.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to make so much money from selling you...\" She growls in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a long, hard, and wet two day voyage. Your days began and ended with Quinne, and the Orcess slaver kept you busy constantly. She liked to cum when she woke up, so oral was your first duty. You then took up slave duties and cooked and cleaned for her. Not once were you allowed to put on clothes.<br>\r\nShe stopped fucking you the day before arrival. She claimed it was to keep you fresh for the markets. On your last night together, she called in Red who roughly and eagerly washed and shaved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the barge docked in Darkstad. The harbour of the city was accessed through a tunnel leading into a massive cavern. This was where a lot of the surface-world trading took place. The slave markets however, were much deeper.<br>\r\nBefore disembarking, Quinne tied your hands behind your back, fixed a rough leather collar to your neck, and painted a large red Orcish rune on your chest.<br>\r\n\"It's my personal mark,\" she explained. \"Your new owner will replace it with hers\".<br>\r\nBefore leaving, Quinne stroked your cheek. \"You were my favorite slave. I'd keep you, but you're just meat to me.\"<br>\r\nWithout further ceremony, she picked you up and threw you over her shoulder like you were weightless, and she left her tent to join the unloading.<br>\r\nDisembarking was just as chaotic as embarking, it seemed. Hundreds of slaves were leashed together and being led on by Gobliness slavers. Some slaves looked frightened, others defeated. You were also the only one being carried, but weren't in any position to enjoy the honour.<br>\r\nOnce all the product was unloaded, Quinne led the procession down into Darkstad. From the harbour, a wide flight of stairs wound down a massive corridor. Torches and skylights illuminated it, but it was dank and murky. The stairs went on and on, deeper into the subterranean Monster-girl city. You grew uncomfortable on Quinne's shoulder.<br>\r\nFinally, the procession reached Darkstad proper. The sheer size was inestimable, streets twisted haphazardly, low houses gave way to markets, stores, and inns. Several rivers ran through bringing water, and strategically placed crystals helped maximise the light. In the distance are castles and mansions, and above it all is an oppressive stone ceiling.<br>\r\nQuinne leads the way to a special part of the market: The Flesh Dock. It has the largest standing space, the biggest podium, and attracts the largest crowd. As the procession walks, Monster-girls catcall and whistle.<br>\r\nWhen you reach the Flesh Dock, all the slaves are taken to the podium. Here are hundreds of wooden posts, packed tightly together, with sturdy metal hoops, and your cuffed wrists are secured firmly to that. <br>\r\n\"Well slave,\" says Quinne. \"This is where I leave you for now. Let your future mistresses have a taste, and try to make me some money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe posts are to display slaves. All around you are others, trapped like you, and packed tightly enough to touch. Some are naked, but most still have some clothes. For the next hour, prospective clients are allowed to wander around the posts to check the product. You're poked, prodded, scratched, licked, tasted, and violated by more Monster-girls than you imagined seeing. Orcesses, Goblinesses, Slime Girls, Bunny-girls, half-spider Driders, and many others. A few brave human women are here too, and they treat you no better.<br>\r\nThe bidding eventually starts with the lowest valued slaves. It's mostly handled by a team of a Leech-girl and an Ogress bigger than Quinne. The Orgress hoists the slave, dangling them helplessly in midair, spreading their legs, and generally demonstrating them, while the Leach fires into rapid auctioneer talk. Her pulsating lower body jiggles horrifically and she slimes back and forth, speaking four different languages and very swiftly selling the slaves. When a human is bought, they get a new number written on their chest and they're sent back to the post to wait. After all the slaves are sold, their new owners will pay and collect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it's your turn. Apparantly, it's a custom for the slave-hunter to personally sell their favorite slave, and Quinne has chosen you for that honour. The Ogress unlocks you, and carries you to the front. <br>\r\n\"Creatures of the Flesh Dock!\" Begins Quinne. \"This boy kept me clean, fed, relaxed, and on my back for three nights!\" She repeated it in various languages while the Ogress molested you to demonstrate. Quinne continued her sales pitch, explaining what you could cook, how you performed your duties, and telling several lies about your powers in bed. The crowd got into the pitch, gasping with each new boast. <br>\r\nThe bidding started high, and rose swiftly. While the buyers warred, the Leach-girl squirmed up to you and stroked your thigh with her cold tail.<br>\r\n\"Personally, I hope you go to the Brothel. They'll let me drink you up for the right price...\" as she trailed off, you watched a slit spread open on her tail. It stretched from her navel to the floor, glistened with shining pussy juice, and was lined with sharp teeth. The spikes were lying flat, and it was clear they would stand up if she was hungry. \"I think I could fit you in, but we'll need to test that...\"<br>\r\nYou couldn't say anything, just stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Leach girl had been threatening you, the bidding had reached its climax. With a roar of \"Sold!\", Quinne condemned you to the possession of someone. Quinne strode to you, grabbed you by your hair, and kissed you so hard you saw stars. Her huge tongue invaded your mouth and the crowd cheered. As she pulled off, she said: \"I knew you'd make me rich.\" At that, she walked away, leaving you to the Ogress. <br>\r\nYou were chained back to the post for another hour, and then the auctioning was done. New owners paid the Leach, and collected their slaves. Most kicked and screamed, but all were subdued. Some men and women were even shoved into sacks or boxes for transport. <br>\r\nYour life as you knew it was now over, and soon your buyer would come to collect you. But Darkstad attracted buyers from the surface as well, so maybe you wouldn't live in this dark hell city for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour buyer was from...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your new owner is a slimy Leech-Girl. Richly dressed and towering above you, her plump body descended into a thick and muscular tail, all covered in shimmering skin. Her face seems surprisingly human, with the exception of a line, almost a seam, running from her jaw all the way to the base of her tail. You've heard terrible things about Leech-Girls. Well, only slightly more terrible than the rest of the Monster Girl species. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are soon chained around your neck, and secured in a line with the other purchased slaves. One you recognise; it's the captive female that Gypsum brought in. You don't have a chance to talk to her, as the chain gang is swiftly led along by more tough-looking Ogresses. The procession is led through winding streets, a veritable maze with Monster Girls everywhere. Their hungry eyes follow you, and you know that being alone on these streets would mean certain death. <br>\r\nYou pass through the rest of the market, passing stalls selling foods, artifacts, weapons, and shady looking cure-alls. All around you are symbols of human oppression: several naked humans tied to stakes, trapped in stocks, or caged, with signs such as \"Thief\" or \"Runaway\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, it dawns on you where you are all going: The streetlights change from grimy-yellow to pale red. You've been sold to a brothel. Your dread mounts with each step, knowing that your life will be spent pleasing paying customers. Eventually, the road opens into a plaza centred around a fountain, and your procession makes it' way to the largest, most opulent building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are all taken inside to the basement. Here you are brought to a stop, and the Leech-Girl slithers in front to address you.<br>\r\n\"Welcome dears,\" she says in a high-pitched voice. \"My name is Madam Shereen, and I will be your employer. You are now all a part of <i>Shereen's Home for Wayward Humans</i>, and I expect you not to let down our name. If you do, I own several other houses that cater to a lower sort, and they will be glad to have you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShereen slithers down the line, idly caressing her slaves.<br>\r\n\"We cater to all sorts of ladies here, ladies who selflessly sponsor this place. Who aid the plight of lost humans, and support this house which lodges and feeds them. Naturally, these noble patrons are to be treated well, and you are to be highly generous with your gratitude.\"<br>\r\nShereen's slimy hand now trails over your stomach, leaving a glistening trail, and making you shiver at the cold touch. She senses your movement and smiles at you.<br>\r\n\"I trust I will come to know you all very well, I pride myself in my care of the charges here. But first! You must be cleaned!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe claps her hands twice, making a horrid slapping noise, and an assortment of Goblins, Imps, and Bunny Girls enter the room with stools, buckets, and basins. You are all unchained, and two Monster Girls force you onto a stool. With extreme efficiency, your hair is cut, and the basin is filled. You and all the other slaves are swiftly washed, and everyone is shaved completely clean. After being toweled dry, the Monster Girls leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Clean and fresh!\" says Shereen. \"So lovely. Now, would you all please kneel down.\"<br>\r\nYou know it's not a request. You and the other slaves go onto your knees on the hard, damp, stone floor.<br>\r\n\"It is a dangerous would out there,\" she says. \"I would hate for any of you to get lost. So, we must mark you so that the denizens of the city know where to return you, should ill befall you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, a Salamander Girl entered the room, carrying a branding iron. Salamanders couldn't generate fire, but they could hold and sustain a blaze in their stomachs indefinitely, provided they kept it fueled. The Salamander held up the brand and breathed out a jet of her fire, soon turning the iron cherry red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will sting, but only for a moment. This is for your own safety,\" Shereen said brightly.</span></div></div>",

What's your name?\"<br>\r\n\"Erik,\" you hiss.<br>\r\n\"Erik? It doesn't suit you. Maybe we'll think up a different one while you're housed here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the screams and sizzles end, and a salve is rubbed onto every brand to heal it. It must have magical properties, because your wound heals almost immediately into bright red scar tissue. <br>\r\nShereen looks delighted. <br>\r\n\"Look at you all my dears, so clean and pretty. Now you'll stay safe too. Ladies! Give them their clothes!\"<br>\r\nThe Monster Girl servants force everyone to their feet and you're given a short skirt to wear. It's barely a flap that covers you, and it's slit down one side to expose your thigh, but at least you aren't totally naked anymore. The women slaves are given a similar skirt, as well as a gossamer shirt that barely obscures their breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" trills Shereen. \"If you would all please follow me, we are going into the Welcome Room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of you are lead through a door and down a narrow flight of stairs, which eventually opens into a large room richly decorated in red. You are all assembled in the centre, and dotted around the room are low couches. <br>\r\n\"As you are all new here, we will need to evaluate your performances!\" announces Shereen. \"This is an honour that only our top paying and most faithful guests may perform, so I guarantee you will all be in capable hands. Or claws. Or tentacles, whatever the case may be.\"<br>\r\nThe servants open another door at the far end of the room and a group of high-spirited Monster Girls are led in. They're giggling, some of them are clearly drunk, but they are all richly dressed. One by one, they single out a human and lead them to a couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself face to face with a female Satyr. Her hairy lower body is sleek and muscular, and her barely covered breasts are enormous. Judging by her slightly greying hair and long horns, she's at least three times your age. </span></div></div>",

She's wearing a long, low-cut, sleeveless dress that clings tightly, and you can see the tips of sturdy boots peeking from beneath her dress' hem. Tattoos spiral up her arms and onto her neck, and you're not sure what kind of Monster Girl she is. <br>\r\nFlanking her is a squad of Orcesses and Ogresses clad in imposing armour. They carry chains, cuffs, and hungry looks in their eyes. Your owner waits as her lackeys gather all of her newly bought slaves, maybe seven in all. There's one other male, and you see Gypsum's female captive from earlier. When everyone is together, you're addressed by your owner. <br>\r\n\"Greetings slaves,\" she says. \"You were once people, now you are property. You are now what we tell you to be. Obey, and you will be cooks, cleaners, entertainers, and workers. Resist, and you will be food.\"<br>\r\nYour owner licks her lips to emphasise this, showing off her hinged jaw.<br>\r\n\"You will call me Mistress, I am the head of slaves in the Palace of the Goblin Queen, ruler of Darkstad!\"<br>\r\nYour fellow slaves gasp around you and your blood goes cold. You've heard of the Goblin Queen, her conquests, her victories.<br>\r\nHer appetites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mistress clicks her fingers and the Orcesses quickly get to work, binding and chaining all the slaves together. You're still naked, and the Orcess tying you takes the time to squeeze your balls until your eyes water.<br>\r\n\"I heard you kept Quinne the Slave-Taker satisfied for two days,\" she growls. \"Want to bet I break you on your first night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour procession is soon on its way, marching at a slow and humiliating pace through the city. The palace is far, and the Mistress is riding comfortably in a palanquin carried by the Ogresses. The slaves are hurried along by the Orcesses and their whip. Monster Girls on the sides of the road leer, whistle and cat call. If you got seperated in your present state, you wouldn't last ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at the palace and enter through the servant's gate. It leads into a combination of stable, harbour, and loading dock. The Queen clearly receives a lot of visitors and supplies. You're all led into another room where you're untied and given new, rough, clothes. You eagerly dress in the roughspun tunic and trousers, not caring how they chaff, just how you're dressed for the first time in three days. <br>\r\nThe Mistress paces back and forth with a clipboard, assigning you all to your new positions. Two women are sent to be maids, and a fat gobliness in a mob cap hauls them off. Another two women are assigned kitchen duty, and Gypsum's female captive is made a personal servant and carried off to the chambers. That leaves just you and the only other male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" hisses the Mistress. \"We have several openings where we need a man. You!\" she points at the other man. \"You're not pretty enough to work the kitchens or the chambers, so I'm sending you to the barracks as a toy.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" he asks incredulously. <br>\r\n\"Oh yes, a toy. We have two hundred guardswomen here, and they'll all need something to play with.\"<br>\r\n\"No! I'd be wasted there! Please! I'm a ledger-man! I know numbers, I can run the expenses!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, no need for that, it's what I'm here for. They just need something they can fuck.\"<br>\r\n\"No! Not that! I'd rather die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man suddenly dashed forward and attacked, catching the Mistress off guard. His punch clipped her on the chin and sent her reeling. He didn't get another chance to attack, because one of the Ogresses had grabbed him and was dangling him in the air as he thrashed and struggled.<br>\r\n\"Let me go you whore!\" he screamed.<br>\r\nThe Mistress had regained her composure. She wiped the blood from her cheek and glared at the man.<br>\r\n\"What did I say happened if you didn't obey?\" <br>\r\nThe man's only answer was more swearing and struggling.<br>\r\n\"I warned you, that you become food!\"<br>\r\nThe Mistress clicked her fingers, and the Ogress immediately began shoving the struggling man into her cavernous mouth. His legs first, then she pushed his body in, finally sucking in his failing arms. With terrible finality, she swallowed hard. In the wild, Ogresses were used to feeding rarely. Their massive stature and lumbering bodies meant that hunting often failed. As such, they had evolved to consume enormous amounts of food in a single mouthful, and slowly digest their prey whole to feel full for longer.<br>\r\nThe man was now just a thrashing bulge inside the Ogress. He would spend the next few hours there in the wet darkness, but the Ogress already planned on regurgitating and keeping the man as a personal sex slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let that be a lesson to you...\" hissed the Mistress while pointing at you. \"Everything in this palace is hungry. And now, where are we going to put you. Unless the Goblin Queen wants you for herself, we need a slave the most in...\" </span></div></div>",

You hurried to keep up with your escort.<br>\r\n\"At least I'm no danger to you,\" said Ember, grabbing your hand and shoving it between her legs before you could pull away. You felt the cold steel of a robust chastity belt. <br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she sighed. \"It turns out the fine print in a summoning contract is meant to be read after all.<br>\r\nAfter a long series of stairs, she explained the roles you could be assigned.<br>\r\n\"Bathhouse slaves will serve many guests and staff of the castle, sometimes hundreds in a day. Maybe you'll give massages, or scrub them, or enter the communal bath as a toy to be chased. If I send you to the chambers, you'll become a body-slave. You'll dress your mistress, comb their hair or tentacles, attend to their every need and accompany them wherever they go.\"<br>\r\nShe was about to continue, but she suddenly fell to her knees, pulling you down with her. You soon saw why.<br>\r\nAhead, the small corridor intersected a larger one, and the fattest, most hideous Gobliness you'd ever seen was lumbering past. She was your height, grey skinned like her kind, but so many times heavier than you. She and her body guards soon passed, and Ember got back to her feet.<br>\r\n\"That was her majesty. If you're unlucky, she'll take a fancy to you.\" Ember leered at your body while pulling you to your feet. \"Not that you'd last ten minutes with her.\"<br>\r\nYou shuddered at the thought as you both kept walking.<br>\r\n\"Before I assign you, let me tell you the hierarchy around here. If it's not human, it's your superior. And everything that is your superior can take your body without hesitation or resistance. And if you refuse an order and they DON'T decide to rape the insolence out of you, you'll be sent to the fighting pits or the dungeon.\"<br>\r\n\"What happens there?\" you asked. <br>\r\n\"Well, Monster Girl fighters come from around the world to battle here. And sometimes they throw a human in there for fun. If you can't fight or fuck, you'll die. As for the dungeons. Well... nobody ever comes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you had reached an intersection.<br>\r\n\"Well human, I figure you can have this last choice. Do you want to work the bathhouse, or should I assign you to a room?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The idea of being a permanent slave to one Monster Girl doesn't appeal to you, and if you're in the baths there's a greater chance of slipping into a crowd and escaping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll work in the bathhouse,\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" says Ember. \"Human men are always welcome there, you have the best hands for massaging.  Follow me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led the way through some corridors and down a flight of stairs. As you go you see more and more Monsters of all shapes and sizes. <br>\r\n\"Be careful what you touch\" says Ember. <br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n\"It's the Mimics,  there's a bit of an infestation lately. They sneak in with the supplies and get some easy meals. Every day we're losing slaves, and even some of the royal guests.\"<br>\r\nYou shudder at the thought. \"What forms do they take?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, anything with a hinge. I've seen chests, wardrobes, vanity chairs, even pianos grab prey and gobble them up. Once you're swallowed, only the Mimic decides if you're coming out again; their insides have a magic all of their own. \"<br>\r\n\"What do you do with them?\" <br>\r\n\"We used to throw them in the cells and feed them prisoners to save space, but that just drew them in their droves. Now we chain their mouths shut and use them as furniture.\" Ember chuckled darkly. \"It's utter torture for them.\"<br>\r\nYou nodded, and took a step away from a nondescript cabinet. <br>\r\n\"The rule of thumb is: if it wasn't there yesterday, it could eat you.  Keep it in mind. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reached the baths. The entrance was a pair of ornate brass doors, depicting depraved sex between Monster Girls and humans, but Ember led you through smaller doors to the side.  These were servants quarters and storerooms combined, and several rows of hard bunk beds were built into the walls above sacks of soaps and rubbing salts. Ember called over a fat Gobliness sweating in the humidity and introduced her as the mistress of the baths. <br>\r\n\"Good luck settling in, and I'll come in for a massage soon if you're not food or fucked to death,\" said Ember before leaving.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goblin eyed you.  <br>\r\n\"Woss your name?\" She barked<br>\r\n\" Uh, Eric.  Ma'am.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh, at least now I know who to call for when the Giantess' arse needs scratching.  I'm your mistress now, and you call me Crag. Got it?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes Crag\".<br>\r\n\"Good. Now you do what I tell you, and whatever your bathers tell you.  If not, I'll make you wish you could be fucked to death. Now, you sleep in here, pick whatever bunk you like, there are several spare. Follow me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led the way through the back areas of the baths. There was a laundry, where several Ogres and Trolls were washing towels. Lower ranked Monster Girls hung the towels the furnace room to dry, and it was the human slave's job to take towels to the bathers. Crag explained that only human  slaves were allowed in the actual bathing chamber,  because that was the  servitude the Monster Girls wanted to see. <br>\r\nThe furnace was large and sweltering.  Trolls kept a boiler stoked, which heated the water pipes for the baths. The piping was complex, and Crag told you that a team of Lizard Girls and a specially trained slave named Mathias  maintained them, but they weren't to be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrag then showed the oil supply room, where incredible quantities of massage oils were kept. <br>\r\n\"Now you must understand,\" she explained. \"Different Monsters got different skins, you got to match the oil with the skin, or you'll burn or scar them. There's instructions written on that chart there\" she said while indicating a crudely written chart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you were taken to the bathhouse floor. The size of it was astounding. It was a huge, high ceilinged and ornate chamber, with a central and massive pool of hot water. Around it were multiple smaller baths with walls and screens for privacy.  The walls and pillars were richly adorned with marble, and hundreds of statues depicted hundreds of sex acts. The main pool had raised seating along the inside rim and through the middle, allowing Monster Girls to lounge  in the water. Inside the walled off sections were smaller baths, and raised benches with racks of oils for massage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonster Girls of every size and variety were in attendance.  Lamia lay uncoiled, Bunny Girls chattered together in pockets, one small pool of blue water turned out to be tens of Slime Girls in a relaxed and semi melted state, and many more naked inhuman women were soaking. Human slaves moved among them, soaping, scrubbing, toweling, brushing hair, washing tentacles, or massaging bodies. Nudity was everywhere: the Monsters bared everything, and only some humans wore scraps of clothing. Sex and domination were in abundance too: Monster Girls forced slaves to eat them  out, or sat on them, or made the slaves lick their bodies.  A crowd of mixed Monsters were simply watching a human man and woman fuck while placing bets, and a ring of muscled  Orcesses were gangraping an unfortunate male with their strap ons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrag clapped you on your shoulder. \"Welcome to your life. Now get to work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by your instructions, you have a good grasp on your duties, and you see some things that need your attention. Do you:</span></div></div>",

You quickly dart back to where Crag showed you the towels were kept; hopefully you could stay unnoticed for a little longer.<br>\r\nAfter the towels were washed and dried, they were folded and stored on racks. You fill your arms with as many fluffy white towels as you can, and quickly rush through the bathhouse. A few Monster Girls make a playful swipe at you, but you quickly dodge their hands, claws and tentacles. Instead of angering them, most laugh at your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you return to the towel room, you find you are not alone in there. Another male slave, lean and impressively muscled, was being defiled by two Lizard Girls. The slave was lying on a hard wooden bench, while one Lizard Girl lustily fucked his face, and the other rode his cock. Their faces were contorted with ecstasy and malice; their claws dug deep into his skin, their rough scales chaffed him raw, and their powerful muscles crushed him as they raped him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they were done. The one on his face finished first, but kept resting while the other rode him and had a rippling orgasm. They dismounted with wet noises, and stood above their victim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what to do now Mathiasss... get on your kneessss...\" Their words hissed as their forked tongues tasted the air.<br>\r\nThe slave, Mathias, rolled off the bench. Bleeding, wounded, and exhausted, he got onto his knees and kissed the scaly feet of his tormentors. <br>\r\n\"Good ssssslave. Ssssee you tonight...\"<br>\r\nThe pair of Lizard Girls wrapped towels around their waists, and walked into the bathhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy the show?\"<br>\r\nWith a start you realised he was talking to you.<br>\r\n\"Um, no, just, I...\"<br>\r\n\"Didn't want to be seen and turned into the second course. I understand.\"<br>\r\nMathias got off his knees and limped to the towels. After wiping himself clean, he wrapped a towel around his waist too.<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't just the Lizards,\" he said. \"The lot of them have marked me as their personal slave, only the Goblin Queen would dare touch me.\" <br>\r\nHe winced and sat down.<br>\r\n\"And they like to play rough.\"<br>\r\n\"How many are there?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Lizard Girls? Fifteen or so. Some are rougher than others, and those two were positively gentle.\" He looked you up and down. \"Are you new?\"<br>\r\nYou nod. \"I was bought today.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, welcome to your new home\" he said grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething clicked in your mind.<br>\r\n\"Are you the Mathias who maintains the steamworks? Crag said someone named...\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's me,\" he interrupted. \"Praise be that I was a talented artificer, and heal quickly.\"<br>\r\nA plan forms in your head. You quickly sit next to Mathias.<br>\r\n\"You know the piping well?\"<br>\r\n\"Like the back of my hand.\"<br>\r\n\"Then, you must know where it all drains to.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n\"So, there has to be a way we can escape!\"<br>\r\nMathias smiled wearily.<br>\r\n\"Are there ways? Yes. Have I tried them? Yes. Did I suffer? I'll let you answer that one.\"<br>\r\nHe got up to leave, but stopped after only a few steps. <br>\r\n\"Although, maybe, now that you could help...\"<br>\r\nHe turns back to you. <br>\r\n\"Don't ever speak of this again. If there is a possibility, I'll tell you.\"<br>\r\nAnd before you can talk, he quickly walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there in stunned silence for a moment. Meeting Mathias was purely chance, but now there may be a chance at escape!<br>\r\nYour daydream was broken by a Slave Girl who came bustling in.<br>\r\n\"Unless you want to get on Crag's bad side, you better get back to work!\"<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks,\" you stammer.<br>\r\nYou get up, grab more towels and head back to the bathhouse. You haven't gone ten feet before a Monster Girl calls to you. <br>\r\n\"Hey! New boy! Bring me towels now!\"<br>\r\nYou turn to see what fresh horror awaits.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You recognise two as the tormentors of Mathias, and they are clearly relaxing after their session.  <br>\r\nEach Lizard Girl is taller than you by a foot or two, with long and powerful legs. Their scales are slick and moist from the steam,  but you can make out their iridescence. Each has distinctive patterns and colours; the smaller ones are green, the largest is a violent shade of purple. Their faces are monstrous: a short snout ending in large and rough-looking lips, horns on their head, and mouths filled with small teeth.  Their tongues are long and thick, and forked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple Lizard taps her long talons and swishes her muscular tail irritably. <br>\r\n\"Did I ssssstutter, human?\" <br>\r\nYou shake your head.<br>\r\n\"N-no ma'am. \"<br>\r\nShe jerked upright, making her small breasts bounce. <br>\r\n\"We're you jussst making fun of me?\" <br>\r\nYou open your mouth to answer, but she beats you to it. <br>\r\n\"Here. Now.\" <br>\r\nYou rush over, slipping slightly on the damp floor. The sauna is hot, and you break out in sweat Immedietely.  <br>\r\nYou stop in front of the Purple Lizard Girl.

You tassssste...... ssscared.\" <br>\r\nThe other Lizards chuckle. You say nothing, trying not to anger these vicious rapists. <br>\r\n\"Do I frighten you?\" She asks gently<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"No ma'am. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she snacks the towels flying from your arms.  <br>\r\n\"I don't?\" She stands, towering over you, and still grilling your clothes.  \"I don't?!\"<br>\r\nShe picks you up one-handed and slams you against a wall. <br>\r\n\"Every human I've played with hassss been sssscared of me. What makes you think you're brave enough?\" <br>\r\nYou don't feel very brave; held aloft by a scaly Monster Girl, feet kicking uselessly in midair.  You swallow and answer shakily: <br>\r\n\"Because I'm on a quest!\" <br>\r\nShe laughs, lifting you higher. By now, two brown scaled lizards have moved closer, tongues dancing around your legs and up between them.<br>\r\n\"A quesssst? Ha! Boy, you are at our mercy. I susssspect your quest is as good as over. ...\" <br>\r\nHer jaws snap open, massively, and she clamps her teeth around your neck. Your head is fully inside her surprising big mouth, your nose and mouth suffocating agaisnt her writhing tongue.  One bite, one swallow, and you're in her stomach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she releases your head, freeing you from the trap of her maw.<br>\r\n\"I like your fire, human... Let's see if we can put it out...\" <br>\r\nShe drops you to the floor, and stomps her foot on your face. It has extremely rough scales, and three powerful taloned toes. The toes grab you roughly, you feel your nose creak and your skin scratch open.<br>\r\n\"Mark  him...\"  Your attacker ordered.  \"Let everyone know who had hin firsssst....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the other four Lizard Girls crowd around you and rip your tunic to shreds with their feet, not caring how they scratch or bleed you.

Amazingly, a slit opens up as she goes, revealing her cavernous pussy.  She straddles you on the hard floor, jerks you erect fully, and forces your manhood inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls of her vagina are scaled too, and nearly as rough as her body. As you howl in pain, it feels as though sandpaper and powerful muscles are raping you at once. She grunts in pleasure and triumph, digging her claes into your shoulders as she fucks you into a pulp.  Her hips pump up and down, maliciously hammering your hips to the floor.<br>\r\nAfter what felt like a lifetime, she shudders in ecstasy and climaxes, clamping her pussy muscles tight like a vise as her back goes ramrod straight. She shrieks out with pleasure, and relaxes on you, breathing hard.  After catching her breath, she pulls off of you, leaving you battered, bloody, and drenched in cum again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she saunters off to a pool she says to the other four :<br>\r\n\"Find a Slime Girl and use her as lube; he won't last through the lot of you otherwise...\"<br>\r\nYou look up in fear as the other four Lizard Girls approach, grinning eagerly. They quickly pin you down, and an all-too-willing Slime Girl transforms into a thick, dense, and viscous lube, which is roughly smeared over your face and dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne quickly sits one your face, and another straddles your cock. The Slime Girl lube makes it smoother, and you are no longer being  roughly scraped open,  but the magical material still made you feel all the pain...<br>\r\nJolastra was right; you don't last.

It's your life, mostly.\"<br>\r\nYou're led upstairs, away from the hubbub of the castle. In what are clearly the royal apartments, there are tough guards stationed  at intervals, and a few servents and slaves hurrying with their heads down. You're taken through a grand set of doors, and into a luxurious chamber. The bed is massive and reinforced to support larger Monsters, the furniture is grand, and there is even a wide balcony.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be your home for now\" says Ember. \"When we get a guest, one of the guards will escort her here, and you will attend her every desire.

For the first time in days. You walk around the chamber, searching  the cupboards and chests. For a weapon, a hiding place, anything. You find nothing, so you walk onto the balcony to look there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view takes your breath away. The tower you're in is cylindrical, opening up to actual sunlight at the top.  Above you are many more balconies, terraced to not obstruct  view. Below you is the arena Ember was talking about. Far below, an Orcess was fighting some kind of giant plant. You strain forward to see clearer, and your hand bumps a large crystal in the railing. Instantly, the view of the arena zooms closer, until you can see and hear as though you were ringside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter containing your fright, you watch with interest.  The Orcess is clearly losing. Her clothes and armour are in tatters, and angry welts are raised all over her skin. She raises her sword and charges the plant monster, but the creature easily and lazily smacks a vine across her, knocking her flying. She tries to crawl away, but a thick vine  latches her ankle and drags across the ground. As she struggles, she is hoisted into the air like a morsel, and dropped into the plant's glistening mouth.  The mouth looked like an oversized flytrap, and it began to slowly close. The Orcess tried to climb out, but the sticky walls held her in place, and the mouth closed. As the crowd down below cheered, the plant lumbered to the wall of the arena, and into it's depths. The Orcess could still be seen writhing inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back, disturbed.  Whatever that creature was, you didn't want to fight it. Still, you wished the Orcess had been your captor from the boat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clearly had time to kill, and Ember said to familiarize yourself with the floor. Do you leave the relative safety of the chamber, or stay where you are? You need to explore the castle, to be a better servant and maybe find a way to escape, but there's no telling what may find you out there...</span></div></div>",

You decide to stay in the room, at least nothing can sneak up on you that way. <br>\r\nIf you're going to be assigned this room for some time, it's best if you learn its layout. Maybe there are secret passages or other escape routes you missed in your first search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check the cupboards again, finding only robes, towels, bathing goods, and changes of linen for the bed. Near the balcony are glass cabinets with assortment of drinking glasses and liquors.  And next to the bed is a chest filled with sex toys. Ivory strapons and dildos, whips, floggs, and others.  Another chest next to it has only restraints, chains, cuffs, even special outfits. They're all human sized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething catches your  attention from the corner of your eye.

They fall to the bottom of the cupboard, covering the struggling figure of the trapped girl. <br>\r\n\"I'm back here!

You reach in to part the heavy furs and peer into the darkness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pale, pink, arm shoots out and grabs you with a vice grip.  <br>\r\n\"My hero...\" says the woman's voice, now perfectly clear and sinister. <br>\r\nYou struggle, trying to wrench yourself free, but another hand grabs you and pulls. The cloaks themselves come alive, sealing around you, trapping your body in a velvety prison. The cloaks contract, squeeze, and push you deeper into the wardrobe, as if you were being swallowed whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a foolish boy...\" chides the voice.  \"Don't you know Mimics hide in plain sight?\"<br>\r\nYou've been pulled to the back of the wardrobe, and face to face with the Mimic. Her pink skin glows with a lurid light, and it looks as though her body is grafted to the wardrobe. Her blonde  hair tumbles to her massive breast, and she licks her thick lips. The walls around you transform from dark wood to dripping pink flesh, you've  been inside her the whole time.<br>\r\n\"I was starting to think I'd never have another playmate...\" she teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe draws you close and squeezes your face into her breasts, suffocating you.

She begins licking, and biting you. <br>\r\n\"Help!\" You scream. \"Somebody he ..\" <br>\r\nA cloak wraps tightly around your face, silencing you. Your Mimic captor continues enjoying herself, tasting and nipping painfully all around your body. Your clothes are quickly torn away, and she caresses you all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a tasty one... you must be new.\" <br>\r\nThe cloak leaves your face as you are lowered, and you see what awaits you. The Mimic's pussy is forming, opening like a huge, glistening mouth. <br>\r\n\"You're going to be fun, my magic means you'll live forever inside me...\" <br>\r\nDespite your struggles and screams, you are dragged entirely into her pussy.  It closes over your head, leaving you trapped in the dark, hot, dripping cave. The walls begin to contract, and grind against you as the Mimic begins fucking her latest victim. You can just hear her massive doors close with a crashing boom, sealing you in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the Mimic is discovered after she consumes a visiting dignitary and her guards. They were saved and pulled free, but you were left behind. The Mimic was chained shut and locked in a dungeon cell for all time, with you trapped inside her  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her skin is brown, her hair looks like creeping ivy, and her eyes are inky black. Her full lips look hard and she has large breasts, impressive for a tree.<br>\r\n \"I'm a Tree Spirit,\" she whispers while gazing at you. \"And you are a lost boy, tied to my tree.\"<br>\r\n \"I'm not alone! I have a big friend!\" <br>\r\n \"The same one who tied you here and left?\"<br>\r\nYou're stunned. \"No, Selka wouldn't do that...\"<br>\r\n \"Oh yes, she would. She tied you to me and left you, whether as an offering, or bait, I don't know.\"<br>\r\n You turn to face her. \"Can you help me get free?\" She called herself a 'spirit', so maybe she can be trusted.<br>\r\n Her brown face smiles. \"I could undo the collar for you, but\" she reached out as far as she could \"I can't reach it.\"<br>\r\n \"What should I do?\"<br>\r\n \"Come to the trunk, where I can touch you...\"<br>\r\n You don't hesitate to follow her. As you near the trunk she emerges and smiles, arms outstretched to get the collar. You step into them. <br>\r\n\"NO!\" screams Selka, suddenly bursting from the underbrush. \"Don't...\"<br>\r\nIt's too late. Before you can pull away, the Dryad has grabbed you by the collar. You struggle, but her wooden arm isn't going anywhere.<br>\r\n You hear a groan and and the tree peels open in front of you, releasing the smell of sweet, sticky sap. The insides of the tree are green, like a plant shoot, and look soft. The Dryad starts dragging you in.<br>\r\n But Selka reaches you! With one mighty swing of her sword, she shatters the blade on the hard arms of the tree. She face looks shocked, until a thick vine wraps around it and drags her inside the tree.<br>\r\n\"Foolish humans...\" chides the Dryad as you're also dragged in. \"I've lived for hundreds of years before you were either born, and I've destroyed plenty of would-be heroes like you two.\"<br>\r\n Once inside, a vine shoots across your waist and pulls you into the green walls of the tree, next to Selka . It's soft, cold, sticky and the thick vine holds you firmly in place, despite your desperate flailing. Selka is also struggline. Still blinded by the vine on her face, she fights, punching kicking and pounding the tree. But it's to no avail. Smaller vines sprout from the walls and grab her limbs, binding her in place as more vines snake across her body and rip her clothing off. <br>\r\n \"Tut, tut, tu,\" says the Dryad as she emerges from the floor, \"such aggression. That'll make you more fun!\"<br>\r\n The Dryad releases the vine from Selka's face and lowers her, the vines acting to the Dryad's will. Selka was shouting, threats and profanities, but the Tree Monster just grabbed the Hunter's head and forced it between her legs. The Dryad's body immedietly splits open as a gaping, green, vagina is formed. Selka's face is forced fully into the Dryad's pussy, and her shouts are cut off. <br>\r\n The Dryad enjoyed this. \"It's been so long since I had  a human in here with me, I plan to enjoy this!\"<br>\r\nAt that, things got wetter. The Dryad's pussy began to gush a clear, sticky looking sap, and the walls secreted it as well. The inside of this tree got wet and soon you are drenched in the sap. It tastes a little sour, but has an underlying tang that is impossible to explain.<br>\r\n The Dryad is getting more and more vigorous, gripping Selka's face tightly and humping it, rubbing her sticky pussy all over it, pounding into it like she was fucking Selka in the mouth. It wasn't long until the Dryad convulsed, doubled over, and shrieked as an orgasm ripped through her, making the walls even wetter. <br>\r\n The Tree monster detached Selka with a sucking noise, letting the beaten warrior be pulled back into the wall. Then the Dryad turned to you.<br>\r\n \"That sap you're swimming in will keep you alive, both of you alive and young for all time. It's the energy of the sun, and ground, brought up and given as my gift to both of you. And your gift to me? Well, that was the first orgasm I've had in ten years. I don't know when I'll see another human, much less a man! So, say goodbye to the sun, because you'll never see it again!\"<br>\r\n At that, the slit in the tree closes, sealing off the outside world. Soon it's dark inside, dark and hot and wet and sticky. The you feel the Dryad's hand on your cock. <br>\r\n \"Let's get started human...\" she says as she pulls you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You never leave the tree. You and Selka are kept in there as the sex slaves of the tree, until Selka disobeys and is promptly eaten. You however, remain in that dark tree forever. </span></div></div>",

At the same time she reaches out and starts playing with your exposed cock.<br>\r\nHer hand begins to morph and shapeshift, turning into a network of tentacles. You scream inside her mouth at the touch and try to fight, but between the chained collar and the Wendiga's grasp you are stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the monster girl has you erect and hard. She's getting more excited, feeding off the sexual energy you're producing. She forces you down to the leafy ground and mounts you.

The lips engorge and grow wet, and the slit widens until she has a vagina almost half a meter long. She rears up, grabs your struggling legs and begins to feed you into her pussy.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your new home. Most of them last 10 hours, and the longer you last, the better for me...\"<br>\r\nYou try to fight her off, but her pussy muscles keep contracting, sucking you into deeper into her. She gazes down at you with excitement as your thrashes stimulate her deep inside.<br>\r\nSoon you're half swallowed by her monster-cunt and your dick is inside her. It's wet, and too hot to be comfortable. Also the walls have a pebbly texture that you can't explain. The Wendiga is close to climax now. Her eyes close and she moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly her moans are cut off by the timely return of Selka. The female monster-hunter attacks the Wendiga from behind, clapping a large silver collar around the monster's neck. There's a spark of blue light, and the Wendiga's orgasm is cut off.<br>\r\n\"What did you do!\" the monster shrieks.<br>\r\n\"Enchanted collar! No more magic for you!\" Selka then yanked on a heavy chain attached to the collar and pulled the Wendiga to the ground.<br>\r\n\"Now you purple bitch, spit my partner out of your pussy!\" Selka commanded.</span></div></div>",

In seconds, the purple monster was sucked in and the lid slammed shut, cutting off her screams of rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelka sighed. \"There's one I can't sell.

You have a slightly higher survival rate with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Selka?\" You shuffle closer to your companion, now covering your private area as you finally felt the wind on your unprotected skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" She turned your head to see you \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have my clothes back please?\" You timidly ask \"It's kind of cold...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly scans you over, taking in the sight of your birthday suit, before beckoning you over \"Sure. Come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing closer to the mimic, the prison of surely an amazing amount of monster girls, that you could easily fall (or be pushed) into causes some pause. But soon you swallow your tasteless fear and slowly draw closer to your traveling companion and her gluttonous chest. You come to a stop just before Selka and look around for your clothes before looking up at her \"W-where are they...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and wraps a arm over your shoulders, before instantly swinging you around, closer to the mimic than you'd like, with her great strength. \"In there.\" One arm grips you firmly to her, possibly to prevent the mimic from having another meal today, while the other waves at the world within the chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonster girls. You see lots of monster girls, of all shapes and sizes and kinds, are active inside this little pocket dimension. They all look healthy and fine. The Wendiga, the newest arrival, is the main centre of attention right now, as she is being molested by about twenty others in a sort of 'welcome party'. Some stragglers are just trying to sleep or quietly talking to each other. Selka points, and her finger guides you to another group of monster girls in the back. There's less of them than the Wendiga's 'greetings' group, you guess about ten or eleven individuals, and they seem to be sharing something between them, sniffing it and tasting it and... and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my clothes...!\" You squeak in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Selka's response is guilt free \"I gave them it as a reward for good behaviour.\" She knocks on the chest lid \"Get his clothes back for me would ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pink-skinned hand emerges from the chest-world's floor and snatches away the fabric from the monster group, before growing upwards. Some of them protest and try to snatch it back, but more hands sprout and keep the girls away. Soon it's before you, and Selka grabs it from the mimic's hands. A glance back, and you see monster girls looking up at you, eyes full of lust and licking their lips hungrily, before the mimic slams her lid down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelka hands it to you as you both pull away from the chest, it's fabric damp from saliva and undoubtably other fluids. You consider asking for something else to wear, but realise if there was she would have offered that first. You pull the sticky and wet clothes over yourself with some discomfort. \"So, Selka...\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you say?                               </span></div></div>",

Gradually sucking her writing form into her pink depths until she was gone. <br>\r\nYou are weary to peer down until the mimic talks to you.<br>\r\n\" No fear Master,\" she says. \"I am bound to only do what you command. Until YOU are fed into me. Then someone new will take your place.\"<br>\r\nYou nod and peer down. Selka hadn't even gotten to her feet before she was tackled and pinned by monster girls. Already three where tearing off her armour and clothes. She was swearing magnificently until a muscular monster-girl spread her thick thighs and buried Selka's face under her ass. Others had pulled off her trousers and two were going crazy on her pussy with their tongues. Another monster-girl seemingly made entirely of vines had wrapped her tendrils around all Selka's limbs and bound her fast. A few seconds later, all that could be heard was the chorus of moans from the gang-bang orgy inside the mimic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou back away and the mimic closes her lid.<br>\r\n\"So Master, what are your instructions?\"<br>\r\n\"Well\", you stammer. \"I don't want anyone feeding me into you. So I want you to go. Go anywhere, and don't eat humans!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh Master,\" she cooed. \"I could never obey that. I would sooner smother you to death...\"<br>\r\n\"Ok... fine. Just go away, and never eat me. Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n\"Of couse,\" she said smiling. \"Farewell!\"<br>\r\nAt that, she sprouted a long pair of pink legs and took off running, leaving you standing alone and naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaked, and completely without supplies.<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" you swear as the realisation hits you. Selka must have secured all the gear in the mimic while you were knocked out. And now you're left with nothing but a coating of Wendiga cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a choice: North across a river to where you can see a farm house in the distance, or back to the city you just left. The city is closer, but you would need to brave the forest and humilation of being naked. The farmhouse is across open ground, but who knows what monster-girls lurk in the river ahead?</span></div></div>",

Both options involved traversing monster girl- infested territory (not that anything in this kingdom didn't, it seemed,) and both options meant begging for assistance with everything bare to the world. Neither option was particularly appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breeze blowing across your still-slightly-damp skin spurred you towards a decision. Deciding that perhaps familiar territory was better than forging ahead as you were, you start on towards the town, traveling back through the woods. Not that being familiar made it any less dangerous, but still, you felt better about the shorter route you'd traveled (mostly while conscious, even), than the long trek across literal uncharted waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk through the tree-packed terrain, wincing at every branch to prod your unprotected skin, very stone to dig into your sole, and holding your breath at every rustle of the leaves, you wonder if Selka <i> really </i> ha to take your shoes along with everything else for her trap to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time, you let your mind wander, between paranoid glances over your shoulder.

Instinctively, you each a hand down to cover your member.

Yes, you think, somewhere around 25 satyrs in a clearing. Among monster girls, satyrs were regarded more of a nuisance than anything; they were prone to drinking, a special ale they made using some secret method, and herds of the wild, naked women would sometimes run through small human towns on a lark, breaking and defacing the walls and harassing the flustered men and women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese particular satyrs were enjoying their brew in a more familiar environment, a secluded little grove in the woods. And boy, it looked like they were <i>really</i> enjoying it. Some were dancing, some running after each other in done game, almost all of them with a cup in their hands. The only ones not drinking we're the ones passed out on the ground, curled up on their sides, on their back with their goat legs spread open, or face down, their backs arched to let their backsides jut out into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTying not to focus too hard on any of the ones lying in compromised positions, you take a closer look at the other psychical features. They all looked like normal human women to a point- as normal as any human could look, running naked and wild through the woods. Then there were the horns- a pair of short goat horns, jutting out from inside the hair of each and every on of them. And of course, there were the legs; just passed the thighs, just under each distinctly human looking rump, were a pair of ungulate goat legs, the fur matching that if the hair on their heads (and, though you might not admit you noticed, the hair just below their belly buttons). Additionally, a tuft of hair above each backside showed you they all had a short little goats tail as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was about where the similarities ended. Of the 20-30 of them in the clearing, no two looked exactly alike. Some had pale skin, some had dark skin, some looked vaguely green. There were satyrs with curly black hair, short blond hair, neatly cut flowing red hair, etc. some were lithe, some were curvier, some were in between. One in particular was rather chubby, laying down on a pile if gathered moss, soft brown skin contrasting against the softer green lichen. To her left, a pale skinned satyr with ref-hair and freckles all across her body stood, pouring from a glass bottle into the larger ones cut whenever he would run out. To her right, a dark haired, dark skinned satyr stood, apparently not partaking in the merriment other than a few sips of her own cup. You gulp, seeing the muscles in her sternly crossed arms out do yours by a fair amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all though, it looked like a good time; satyrs weren't supposed to be too bad, in terms if monster girls, and they certainly seemed like a fun group. Of course, the still rational voice in the back of your head reminded you, they still were monsters- possibly the largest collection of monster girls you had seen in person. You were one naked man, with nothing but aspirations of adventuring, and you were almost seriously considering walking into a group of wild, increasingly inhibition-less monster girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, you were tired of sitting in that bush. The continued crouching was killing your legs, and the silent staring (and slow stiffening) was starting to make you feel like a voyeur. You aren't quite sure what to do, when...</span></div></div>",

The lingering effects if Selka's Alraune ale weren't helping your judgment any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the rustling of leaves, every awake woman in the clearing whips their heads around to the source, and even a few of the blacked-out satyrs on the ground started to stir. The dancing and running stopped. The music went quiet, though you still aren't quite sure where it was coming from. The muscular satyr was staring you down, and was starting to crouch into a charging position. Sensing a little bit of hostility, you speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" you cough, clearing your throat, \"h-hello.\" The muscular satyr slowly straightens back to a standing position. She glances back to the satyr lying on the moss, who nods and begins to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" she says. She's smiling softly, but there's something in her eyes that keeps you from relaxing. As she continues to speak, you see the other satyrs in the herd slowly lower their guard, though as they begin to examine you more closely, you notice a faint glimmer of whatever it was in their leader's eyes. \"Not often we see humans out here,\" and her eyes dart between your eyes she the bush below you, \" and the ones we do see usually come armed and in full armor.\" A wry smile plays across her face. \"I'm going to guess you're not wearing iron leggings behind those leaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle, forcing the laugh out if you a little. \"A-ah, well, there's the thing. I, uh, ran into a bit of trouble, it's a long story and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A story, eh?\" Her eyes light up. \"We all love a good story, don't we girls?\" A murmur of assent goes through the group, and the leader looks back to you. \"Why don't you come a little closer and share?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehe, well...\" you scratch the back of your head, not really wanting to give up your cover, \"if it's all the same with you, I'd rather not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" she interjects, a slight edge creeping into her voice, \" I insist.\" The muscular satyr narrows her eyes at you, and you decide that maybe you should comply for now. Slowly, you move your hands in front of your crotch, and take a few steps into the clearing. As your nude form steps into view, it's greeted by a chorus of giggling, and even the muscular one lets a smirk creep onto her face for a moment before she returns to stoicism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess he wasn't lying about running into trouble, huh?\" You hear one satyr comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" comes the reply, \"looks like he's really got his hands full!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush in response to the comments, the looks you're getting are starting to make you reconsider things. Nonetheless, you continue the exchange. \"So, well, uh, there isn't much to share, really,\" you falter for a moment, noticing out if the corner of your eye a few satyrs circling around to look at your backside, \"someone I though was going to help me ended up tricking me out here to fight monsters. There was a scuffle, and the two of us, we, parted ways. She just happened to have my things when she did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead satyr nodded, as if it was all perfectly sensible. \"... And you decided to interrupt out fun because..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was on my way back to town, hoping to resupply, or at least get some clothes, when I happened to stumble across your little, uh, clearing here, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what?\" She says, laughter creeping into her voice, \"did you think we could help you when it came to clothes?\" She swept her arm in front of her own naked body, as if the logical flaw wasn't plainly obvious to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I didn't think about that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice does in your throat, not really even knowing yourself why you made yourself know to the satyrs.

Formally Selka's mimic stands before you, now completely in her human form and wearing a dangerous smile on her lips. After giving her eyes the chance to take in every ounce of you, she pressed forward, sandwiching you between her warm and wet body and the dry and cold bark. You try to yell at her to release you, but from your fleshy gag all noises that escape sound like moans, which make the monster girl smile wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Just go away, and never eat me. Can you do that?</i>\" The mimic echoed your words in a perfect copy of your voice, before returning to using her own. \"That's what you said.\" <br>\r\n\"You said go away...\" She leaned in close and blew into your ear. \"But you never said anything about not coming back!\" <br>\r\nA manticore's tail sprouted from the mimic's back, and quickly snapped shut onto your exposed cock. You whimpered as it began pumping, hungrily intent on getting your seed, while the mimic wrapped your legs together with the tendrils of the vine monster girl that bound Selka. <br>\r\n\"And eating you?\" She chuckled, having finished binding your legs tightly. Bringing a vine to the enterance of your anus, she pokes it in against much resistance, which cuppled with your cock being merclessly devourered, started to make you cry. She laps up your tears, uncaring at your discomfort. <br>\r\n\"There's much better things to do with you, sweet Erik...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, a succubus tail sprang up from the mimic's pussy, coming open above your head, letting you stare in fear at it's ravenous maw before it came down and slurped up the top of your head. <br>\r\nThe mimic gasped loudly at the feeling, her insides more sensitive than she thought they'd be, and your desperate struggling only amplefied that pleasure. You would be the first, and only, being to be sucked into her vagina. <br>\r\nShe removes the hand sealing your mouth, though all you can manage is the sharp intake of cold air and a weak \"Please...\" before the her tail consumes more, taking your entire head in a speedy gulp. Within the pink tube, you can still breathe, but it was so cramped and so hot that it was almost painful to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you'll be my personal slave forever! Y-your h-h-home will be my cunt! My m-m-m-magic'll keep you young and h-healthy for eternity!\" The mimic's voice wavers, her mind not used to this kind of ecstasy. Pulling your struggling form closer and hugging it strongly, she squeals as your shoulders enter with a mighty slurp. <br>\r\n\"I'll use all the girls in my collection to please you! I'll spit you out, we'll have fun, then I'll slurp you back in! D-doen't that sound so good, Erik?\" Wildly licking and kissing the perfect outline your face makes within her pussy tail, the mimic knew she was going to have her best orgasm once you entered her. You began thrashing even harder as  your chest was sucked up and now bulged out of the mimic, but all that did was make her moan louder. <br>\r\n\"You'll never make it as a hero, and this'll be <i>soooo</i> much better than ending up as some ogre snack, right?

The mouth on your dick and the vine in her ass now working in overdrive, you knew she was waiting for you to cum before sucking you in utterly. And that moment was approaching, as you can feel yourself about to erupt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped within the mimic's grasp and getting closer and closer to the egde, all you could do was beg that someone would save you from this fate. </span></div></div>",

Inside her pussy it is hot like a sauna, and just as wet. The walls close in on you and constrict from every angle. You can still breath and even see, but you can't get out. Despite the constriction, you can still thrash around and struggle, which only excites the Wendiga more. The walls are wet, but pebbly. As though covered in thousands of tiny, hard buttons. You quickly realise they're thousands of clitorises.<br>\r\nNo wonder she enjoys it so much.<br>\r\nShe cums quickly, flooding your tight cave with her pussy juice. You almost drown in it, coughing and spluttering as it covers your body and goes down your throat. Those struggles make her cum again, and again. Even though a mimic just ate her, she's still having a good time digest-fucking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen hours later, you're both still at it, much to her surprise. You're tired, but your energy has barely faded.<br>\r\n\"Seems like that hunter bitch was right!\" you hear the Wendiga say. \"This mimic really does keep us both sustained. Looks like I'll get to enjoy you for many years to cum...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wendiga was right, and very cruel. You stay in her tight pussy, never leaving. Just making her cum and drinking up her pussy juices. Often she captures another monster girl and swallows up them. The newcomer usually rapes you inside the Wendiga, just for fun. <br>\r\nYou don't know when the magic of the mimic will run out and allow you to be digested, but you know the Wendiga's pussy is your prison and home for the rest of your existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Bad End.</span></div></div>",

You almost don't notice, continuing to walk forward until she grabs and tugs at your cloak. If it weren't for the tense look on her face, you almost start to complain about her loosening your already precariously secured garment. Instead, you decide to just step back, coming again to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wro-\" your companion silences you with a finger to her lips. Evidently, her experiences senses are detecting something you cannot. Then, Selka grabs you by the arm, quickly dragging you behind a cluster of tall grass. Once again, you almost begin to protest her rough treatment, but the words die in your throat as the cause for her caution comes into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't realize it, but your eyes were adjusting from the lanterns that lined the streets of the city. Now, with cause to focus, you rapidly find yourself looking at a figure in the darkness. About twice as tall as Selka, and just about as muscled, with green, scarred skin. Her black hair was wild and matted, yellow eyes almost glowing in the darkness and tusks jutting up from her jaw, though you almost reluctantly admit to yourself you might not find her entirely unatrractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping that opinion along is her attire, or lack thereof. The monstrous woman has nothing obscuring her chest. Proportionally, you suppose they'd be above average size on any human sized woman, but to you they seem as gigantic as anything else about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lower half is clothed, albeit barely. A tarp of hide and leather, crudely stitched together and tied at the side, hangs low on her hips. And what hips they are! Almost as broad as her shoulders, thick and toned. She turns away for a moment and you get more than a glimpse if her ass; evidently she made it to cover her front more than her back. It hangs low enough that plenty of it is visible above the loincloths coverage, and the garment itself stops high enough that her green, meaty, muscley behind juts out from underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelka's hand on your shoulder stirs you from your thoughts about her lower half, just as something on your lower half starts to stir. She glances back to the titanic woman before starting to whisper, almost imperceptibly quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An Ogress,\" she explains. \"They're tough to fight and tough to sell. Didn't think we'd run into one or I'd have just the thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we-\" Selka clamps a hand onto your mouth, raising a finger to hers as the Ogress perked her head up, glancing around. \"Can we beat it?\" You ask more quietly once your companion removed her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelka half smiled. \"Not in a head on fight. I'd say run away, but she'd see us leave- they're a little slow to move, but not slow enough for us to leg it.\" Seeing your face as your panic started to set it, she nudged you lightly on the arm. \"That doesn't mean we're out of options. Listen carefully now:\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She smirks at the incredulous expression on your face. \"Hey, you wanted to fight monster girls, didn't you? Here's lesson number one: sometimes you can't avoid a fight.\" Glancing between her pack and the Ogress, she started to take out and gently gather a number of various odds and ends; a vial of pink liquid, a strange runes metal rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lesson two: not every battle is won with swords and shields. Learn that and you'll last a lot longer against these things.\" She looks up from her work and stares you in the eyes. \"So, Erik, ready to win a fight for once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words sting, but they stir something in you. In your chest this time, not your nether regions. You take a deep breath, and stare back into her eyes. \"What do I have to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelka grins. \"Just keep her attention on you and her hands off you long enough for me to get her.\" You nod, hesitate for a moment... and run out of the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to get just past her before she brings her foot down, shaking the ground and almost causing you to stumble. As it is, you only barely manage to turn your fall into a roll, climbing shakily to your feet as the giant woman looks you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knew there was human here!\" Her voice is husky, almost growling every word. You reach for your sword, ready to shout something back at her, but the second your fingers touch the hilt she lunges, making a grab that you only just manage to sidestep, before she brings her other hand swinging down at the earth, prompting you to roll away once more. All the while she's smiling, her eyes twinkling with a malicious lust. \"Human man, too! Even better!\" She narrows her eyes. <i>\"More fun.\"</i> That last word, she definitely growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have too much time to think, though, before the ogress lunges again, and again, and again.

You can no longer feel your hands, but she makes up for that by how much pleasure is coming from your crotch and lips. It begins to become too much but then she raises her hips and removes her lips, releasing just a little pressure... but you miss it already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so needy, baby. Don't worry... mommy's got what you need.\" She lowers her pussy by just enough that the heat encompasses only your tip. But that's not what you're focused on. It's her face that has your full attention. As she lowers her head, she begins making kissing noises which arouse you even further. Instinctively, you know what will happen once her lips touch yours; your soul will be sucked out. But you don't care at this point. You just really want her to kiss you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMwah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloser..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mwah!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloser...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Mwah!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>MMMMMMMWAH!!!</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips drop onto yours as her pussy kisses the base of your crotch.

I'm about to take your soul and all you can do is moan in pleasure, how wonderful... for me that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething wet and sticky absorbs your dick.

You let the honey sit in your mouth for a moment before swallowing, and it tasted heavenly! You've never tasted this kind of honey before in your life! \"Hey that tasted amazing, mind if I have some more?\" you ask the Bee Girl as she giggles in response. \"Sure thing! You can have as much as you want!\" she says as she sits on the branch with you and scoots closer to you. The Bee Girl pats her lap, instructing you to lay your head on it. Normally you would suspect a trap, but this Bee Girl was so nice, giving you that honey and offering you even more that you wouldn't dream of refusing. Plus, there was something about her that was making her look so much cuter by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you laid down on the branch, putting your head in the Bee Girl's lap as she feeds you more honey. \"My name is Daisy by the way, what's yours?\" \"My name is Erik.\" you managed to say in between Daisy feeding you honey. \"So what were you doing in the forest before that mean slime girl Mia attacked you?\" Daisy asked you as she continued to feed you even more honey. You were getting pretty full, but for some reason you just couldn't resist eating more. \"Oh, I came to the forest so I could... Uh...\" Come to think of it, you couldn't remember why you came into the forest in the first place! \"You mean you don't remember? Silly boy!\" Daisy giggled as she ruffled your hair a bit. As you were trying to remember why you came out into the forest, you couldn't help but notice how much more beautiful Daisy was looking as the sun that managed to sneak through the leaves shined off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it doesn't matter. At least I get to spend my time with a beautiful woman like you.\" you said, making Daisy blush. \"Oh stop! You're embarrassing me! But you are really cute and sweet...\" Daisy said as she fed you even more honey. As you gulped down the last of the honey, you couldn't help notice something tugging at your pants until they slid off. \"You know, us Bee's aren't the only ones who make honey. Human men make some great honey too..\" Daisy said as she started to hover in the air, laying your head on the branch. \"Do you mind if I have some of yours, Erik?\" Daisy asked as her head lowered towards your crotch. You immediately felt like you wanted to leap off of the tree branch and run, but your body wouldn't respond. You felt like you wanted to cry for help too, but instead the only words that came out of your mouth were \"How could I say no to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy smiled and carefully took your penis into her mouth, she began to roll it around using her tongue until it hardened from the sensation. Then she began to suck, alternating between slow and gentle, as well as fast and hard. You simply laid there, sighing with pleasure as Daisy's tongue playfully licked at the tip of your penis. Finally you burst inside her mouth, Daisy greedily slurped and licked everything up. \"Ah that was delicious. Thank you Erik!\" Daisy said as she put your pants back on you. \"Hey Erik, how about you come live with me? I know you like my honey, and I have an endless supply back at my hive!\" Daisy said as she surprisingly lifted you off the tree branch. At this point, you found it impossible to refuse anything she asked and happily agreed to live with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a joyful giggle, Daisy flew you deep into the forest and into a massive bee hive, where dozens of other Bee Girls were working hard to make honey, take care of the young or bring pollen back. You noticed a few Bee Girls mounted on top of men in a few corners of the hive as well. When Daisy put you on the ground in front of a door, she landed beside you and noticed one of her friends fluttering by. \"Oh hey Helen! How are you today!\" Daisy shouted as Helen fluttered over to her. \"Hello Daisy! I'm doing fine. And by the looks of things, you're doing fine too.\" Helen said as Daisy let out a laugh. \"Haha yeah! I found Erik here wandering in the forest when he climbed up a tree to get away from that slime girl Mia. He was so nice to me, even before he ate my honey. He actually ate so much that it took effect twice as fast!\" Daisy said as she and her friend continued to talk for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you hadn't been under the honey's trance, you might have minded it being used to brainwash you, but now you were happy just to be with Daisy. \"So Daisy, is this your new husband or is he another baby maker for the Queen? I heard she needs a new one.\" Daisy looked at you and said...</span></div></div>",

Why, if I hadn't kidnapped him, you know what would have happened.\" Daisy said, ruffling your hair a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you wanted to scream at her for admitting to kidnapping you, you could only feel joy at the thought she cared for you so much that she saved you from Mia. Helen giggled, eyeing you a bit. \"He's a little young, but...he certainly is appealing. And that's so like you, Daisy! Always putting others above yourself! Taking him in...keeping him as your husband...you're such a great girl!\" Helen commented. It just occurred to you: apparently the monsters, despite being rather evil creatures, didn't all like each other. For once, you almost prayed the Slime girl would come. Certainly a few hours before merciful death was better than living the life of a mind controlled toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, anyway, I'm going to take him home. See you, Helen!..And he's NOT too young! I'm only 19!\" She said, taking you and flying you over to a little honeycomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly learned that...honestly, it was a rather nice life. Within a day, she had already fed you plenty of honey, and had found ways you could stay in her little abode while working off any fat the honey could possibly give you (Which was apparently not much) and she practically pampered you as much as you pampered her. She was genuinely sweet, in fact. She hadn't been lying: she liked you a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you woke up with Daisy lovingly stroking your hair. \"Erik, dear...I'm so happy I saved you from that meanie. Think nothing more of the outside world, alright? I'll always be here to protect you.\" She promised, kissing you on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you...really want to leave this life?</span></div></div>",

The loud stomps of your feet sound much different from the light taps of honey bee feet, and soon you can what has to be an investigative team of at least ten is gaining behind you. The adrenaline from the chase combats your already growing fatigue, but as you turn the corner you realize you're screwed. The hallway comes to a dead end, the only two exits blocked by monster girls that now know of your existence. You defensively put up your hands and back into the corner, much to the amusement of the bee swarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww look at him. He thinks he can fight us.\" One of the more courageous bees emerges from the encroaching crowd. \"How'd you get here little buddy? Do you want to impregnate us that badly? Do you really love bees that much? What a weird human huh girls?\" She turns and gets a sadistically hungry cheer from her co workers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands turn to fists and you started trying to search for a weak spot in the encirclement. \"That's just so adorable, he thinks he can still get away. Not without screwing all of us you're not.\" She takes one of your arms in a stunning display of speed and throws you to the ground. There, she stands over your sprawled body and opens up her lower lips with two fingers.  \"We all know you want it, sit up and kiss it or we're gonna have to get rough right girls?\" A cheer erupts from all around you, your outstretched limbs receiving gentle kicks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate before leaning up and planting a calm kiss on the snatch of this mob's leader. She shudders and is about to demand more when you punch her in her knees and begin to crawl away as fast as you can. She collapses in a cry of anguish, but you don't make it very far before you're overwhelmed by horny and now angry young women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn extremely soft but firm foot pins you to the ground, hands pull your arms away in an unbreakable hold, your legs sat on. The girl you punched rises slowly and smirks at your pathetic, restrained, and humiliated body. She strides over and delivers a decimating kick to your balls with the same suddenness she used earlier to throw you to the ground. You open your mouth to scream, but the foot on your head relocates to your mouth. A sweet taste actually, much like the vagina of the leader, but not pleasant in the circumstances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader now strides over your body and mounts your face. \"You will do as we say, mess up again and you're on bathroom duty. Trust me, bee bladders are teensy. Now will you be a good human?\" Another bee penetrates herself on your penis, her moan starting a frenzy among the still growing group. Your body becomes the center of a mass orgy, and you're force fed honey after every session so that you're stamina never runs out. The leader quickly rises to a screeching orgasm on both your face and your penis, and you get passed around your fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, you're completely covered in a honey/love juice combination, and multiple bees lay in almost a drunken like state. The liquid combination sticks you to the ground, and whichever bees still have energy after those couple hours eye you up for a third or a fourth round. You lay there petrified of what's next as one girl lazily sits on your crotch, another your face. They both slowly move themselves about on you, much too slowly, and you begin to run out of air. You attempt to raise your hands in protest, but the sticky fluids have begun to harden so there's nothing you can do but yell and struggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour yelling sends vibrations through the lead bee, which only incentivizes her to continue, and you begin to fade out under her. Your lower half is still going strong from the special bee honey however, so the second girl is really getting the better deal. You certainly aren't, but she is because she cums in no time at all. The final little drain on your system though is the final straw for you staying conscious, so you pass out underneath the top bee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awaken, you've been freed from your prison and are now surrounded yet again by the bees. This time you're in a chamber, surrounded by worker bees on all sides, except for right in front of you. Right in front of you sits the Queen, who extends her foot towards you. She's much bigger than the workers, her backside the size of you, her foot easily the length of your skull. You gulp and lean forward to kiss it, no tricks this time. Unsuprisingly, she too tastes sweet. Her foot doesn't have a trace of sweat or dirt, just the sweetness of everything else in this establishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes your lack of hesitance as a great sign and pulls you underneath her, connecting herself to you in the most intimate way. Only your neck and head show from underneath her, your arms pinned by her long and powerful legs. The way she clenches herself instantly hardens you, and in no time you start pumping semen in a never ending stream. You are doomed to spend the rest of your days underneath the massive queen bee as her personal sex slave, producing new bees until you die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The honey combs that make up the walls are hypnoticly yellow, and you trip in piles of honey every once in a while. You eventually come to a halt, breathing heavily in a hidden corridor, when you hear buzzing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's just one honey bee girl, but she stops right in front of your hiding place and sits. It's not likely she's going anywhere soon after a while of waiting, so you take your chances st running again. She's quickly on her feet, but you roughly shove her aside and dash past her. She screams, awakening the whole hive to your whereabouts, and you only go faster. Bees start pouring, blocking exit after exit, forcing you to run into walls of them, making a gamble that you'll be successful in breaking through them, but it works every time. You can hear the mad buzzing behind you as you run down a particularly long hallway, but just as they're almost on you, you fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a hole at the end of that hallway, one that lead to the outside world, and now you're freefalling back into the forest far below you. The bees pour out of the hive, a final attempt to swarm and carry you back into the hive, where no doubt a brutal gang rape resides for you, but you crash into some bushes before they can reach you. Now quite bruised and possibly with some more serious injuries from that fall, you start running again to lose the horde of bees who still haven't given up on you. The first hands you run into, however, might save you from the bees, but aren't necessarily in your best interests. </span></div></div>",

The door slammed shut, and you looked around the house which looked surprisingly normal. Aside from a dusty bookshelf with questionable looking books and a desk with potions placed everywhere, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed a womanly figure sitting on a chair near the bookshelf, reading one of the books as she casually looks up at you. \"Not very often a human gets this far into the woods.\" Blaire said as you nervously took a step forward. \"What compels you to be so brave as to confront a witch, young man?\" Blaire asked. \"I've come to learn some magic so that I may properly defend myself.\" you said with a hint of nervousness in your voice. You heard Blaire giggle to herself as she closed the book and got off the chair, she was a bit taller then you and looked almost nothing like witch's you've ever heard about. She looked like a normal woman, with an very voluptuous figure and light blue hair and she also wore a few, quite short you might add, robes. She began to walk around you, eyeing you up and down. She finally stopped after she circled you and spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be a nice witch, but I don't give out lessons for free child. You'll have to pay.\" Blaire said. \"Uh, sorry Ms. I don't have enough money to spare... I've got barely enough to stay at an inn...\" you nervously stuttered, trying not to anger her. An angry witch is something you would never want to see. \"Doesn't matter deary, I don't take mere coins.\" Blaire said nonchalantly. \"Well what do you take then?\" you ask and Blaire grew a very lustful smile. \"Well dear, since you were so nice to ask, not many men come through these woods. The ones that do are often caught by Mia and her slime sisters. From the looks of your clothes, I'd say you met her already.\" Blaire said as you tried brushing off some of the dried slime to no avail. \"So here's my proposition dear, spend a night or two here with me and then I'll teach you some magic.\" Blaire said with a smile as she traced her finger around your chest. \"W-what would I do while I stay?\" you ask as your nerves continue to grow. \"We'll have a magical night dear. In more ways then one, I know quite a few spells to make relations much more...fun.\" Blaire said with increased lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis witch seemed very VERY lustful, but she did have a point. No man ever comes by these woods, and if they do they're generally caught by another monster before they can get to her. You've heard tales of making bargains with witches though, and having sex with them is one of the things you should never do! You've heard stories of people being slipped potions that make them fall in love with the witch, or even things like being shrunk and kept as a pet, or worse! Some witches are honest though.. but should you really take that chance?</span></div></div>",

As your vision becomes clear, you can see a large group of Fairies floating over your head, talking amongst themselves. Fairies are mischievous and magical creatures that are basically tiny women with insect wings, they feed off of semen like most other monsters. If a group of fairies catches someone, it's been known to be impossible to escape without outside interference. Once they knew you were awake, the leader of the group of fairies announced \"Fellow ladies, our food issues are over! We've finally found a human to play with, enjoy!\" after the leader spoke, the other fairies let out a cheer and dove at your naked body. You felt two fairies grab onto the shaft of your penis, rubbing it until it became stiff. Then they began to lick the tip with their tiny tongues. Two fairies down below at your balls were beginning to play, one of them rubbing the left ball for stimulation, the other burying her face into the right and blowing air into it. A few fairies were laying around on your stomach and chatting, while two more played with your nipples individually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, the immense pleasure that you were feeling forced you to quickly reach your breaking point, the resulting orgasm led to cheers from the fairies as multiple fairies fluttered around your penis, lapping up all the semen that came out. The feeling of them licking only made you cum faster, supplying the fairies with a never ending buffet.<br>\r\nOne fairy fluttered up to your face, one who had been observing from a distance and planted a kiss on your lips. She giggled at your reaction and stuck her feet in your mouth when you gasped from another orgasm. She forced you to suck on her feet for awhile before she fluttered down to your crotch to join the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead fairy fluttered up to your face, revealing that she was actually slightly bigger then the others, in more ways then one. She wore a yellow corset and had yellow hair with butterfly wings. She quickly ripped her corset off and shoved her crotch into your lips, commanding you to lick. As you began to eat out the fairy, she let out moans of delight as you forced her to orgasm multiple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to tear up from both pleasure and despair, hoping that someone would find you and end this pleasureable hell...</span></div></div>",

This human sized fairy said, \"Thank goodness I got to you in time, names Simona, a Sylph.\" You paled a bit knowing you were now looking directly at a Sylph, a Wind Elemental and you knew that elementals are among the strongest monster girls out there. Simona said, \"Relax I'm not going to hurt you, I saw that you had a dilemma with dealing with slime girls with how you need magic to hurt them. Well learning from a elemental like myself can really help you out, plus you should gain some insane speed too, possibly enough to possibly keep up with a tengu.\" You knew tengus were among the fastest monster girls around with some being able to break the sound barrier with how fast they go. Simona then said, \"I'm a gentle one and if we have sex you should be able to absorb some of my essence and...\" She blushes before continuing with, \"Possibly impregnating me since I am at the phase where I can be fertilized.\" You knew this was a pretty good offer knowing that you can gain wind magic rather easily can help you deal with not only slimes but also deal with monster girls that can fly because you could create some wind to force them down to where you can attack them with your sword and possibly fly as well should you get very good with wind magic so you accepted. Simona said, \"Wonderful! But there is a catch, you have to be my husband. Not to worry in elemental society it is encouraged to have more than one wife and children due to declining birth rates among us elementals.\" You accepted becoming her husband and Simona had quite the body too as well with what looked like I cup breasts. Simona said to you, \"So do you want to have sex here? Or have me take you to where the other elemental monster girls reside which is where I come from and do it there? If you decide to be taken to where I come from well you are going to really like us elementals because we elementals aren't under the control of the great witch queen and we do have in our stores equipment you can't get elsewhere. Also I should've added to my first one is that we have sex here first and then I take you to where I live. Its called Elementia just to let you know.\" You thought, 'A fitting name for a place where only elementals reside' and decided on...</span></div></div>",

Simona says, \"Good choice because I know that you might be wondering where we reside anyway. Try not to pass out before we get there.\" She grabs you by the chest and flies off towards the ocean. You were surprised at how fast she went but didn't pass out. Eventually you reached what looked like a city that seemed to be off the ground floating above the ocean. Simona said, \"Welcome to Elementia. I'll take you to my home.\" And you were lead to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe home seemed surprisingly large, rather it was in truth, a mansion. Simona said, \"Here we are! Oh it seems we have company meet the other elementals and they too want to be wives and as I said this is encouraged in Elementia. Meet Uriel the undine, Gaia the gnome, Ellie the Ifrit, Candice the Cupid, and Shino the Shadow. They compose of the other elements namely water, fire, earth, Light, and darkness.\" You were surprised that all of them had just as good bodies as Simona did. Knowing how this society encourages an unusual form of bonding you accepted becoming the husband to them. The elementals squealed in happiness and you were lead to a massive bedroom that upon laying on it felt like a cloud due to how comfortable it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimona said as you noticed the elementals seemed to be dripping milk from their breasts, \"Are you capable of taking us all on? I sure hope you are because we will be having sex simultaneously. Not to worry you can have our milk in case youre losing strength to recover it. Let's do it!\" What happened over the course of a few hours was a case of a 6-way form of sex. Thanks to the milk the elementals allowed you to have you were able to impregnate the elementals without tiring out with each one having octuplets. Upon doing so the seven of you fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you saw they all had much larger bellies, breasts, and butts. Simona said, \"Surprised aren't you? Well an elemental's reproductive assets cause us to have our offspring grow to what can be considered full term for women but we still have to wait the same amount of time as a human pregnancy would so our offspring can actually start developing their abilities. Also believe it or not we are actually the heads of Elementia.\" That surprised you but in a way it made sense since apparently you were in a mansion and all. You decide to rub Simona's belly and felt a kick. Simona giggled and said, \"Seems Sonya likes that. Oh I forgot to mention we came up with the names for our offspring already.\" You thought, 'Thinking ahead of time for the names.' Simona said, \"So what do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChapter writers note: I wasn't sure what the true term for a dark and a light elemental was so I just came up with this. Also compared to my previous chapter you can tell I didn't have it as one big paragraph this time that's because well I forgot to do so ehe.</span></div></div>",

You look around and see a surprisingly well lit room with stone walls and torches and lanterns all lighting up in sequence. As they light up more and more of the room, you finally gaze upon what broke your fall: A legendary colossus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColossi were an ancient race of giants who were among the most powerful creatures the world had ever seen. According to legend they could reshape mountains and change the weather on a whim. They were worshiped as gods by humans and monsters alike and ruled over the entire world, and some of them are still worshiped by cults today. According to legend, they all disappeared after wars broke out between them and some theorized that they wiped themselves out. Clearly though, this one was able to avoid the fate of her kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe probably about 500 feet tall and have a head of blonde hair that could easily be mistaken for a field of golden wheat. You looked behind you and saw her lower body, she wasn't wearing much except for a leather skirt and pair of boots, all adorned with gems the size of horses. Her legs are smooth and support and hourglass figure that makes up the colossus's body. You look down and see the surface that saved you from a perilous fall is a tit that could fill up four of your houses, supported by a bra adorned with silver and diamonds. Even considering the woman's size, they look huge for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the last of the lanterns lights up, the colossus starts to stir and opens her large blue eyes. She sits up, causing you to fall into her massive cleavage. Apparently she felt you fall in, cause after looking around the room, she reaches a hand into her bosom and pulls you out and takes a good look at you. \"Oh hello there,\" she says in a soft voice, \"My name is Ania Viasdoter. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith fear in your voice you say \"E-Eric. Uh-I'm an ad-adventurer and my mission is to ... um\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing you stutter in fear, Ania ...</span></div></div>",

Can you tell me your name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Eric\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric. That's a nice name. My name is Ania, I already told you that. As you can see, I am a colossus. This room here is my resting place\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Resting place? Like a tomb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nonono, tombs are for the dead little one. This is where I went to sleep. You see, back in my day, the other colossi were fighting each other for territory and ideologies and stuff, and I just couldn't take it. So, I had my subjects put a sleeping spell on me. And they were to wake me up when the colossi finally made peace with each other. Oh! Is that why you're here, little one? Did the others finally make peace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't really know how to answer that question. There aren't really any colossi left to make peace with each other, but you don't think lying would make things any better, so you answer honestly. \"Actually, there aren't any colossi in the kingdom anymore. You're the first one I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" she asks, \"That's odd. Perhaps they left the region to go elsewhere? Eh, no matter. So, do you know how long I've been asleep? What's happened while I've been down here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...well, I don't know how long you've slept. But in that time, the kingdom of Asun has been taken over by a witch queen, who's leading an army of monster girls to take over humanity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that doesn't sound good. But um... what's Asun?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asun? Why that's the name of the kingdom. It's been that for years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, I must've slept for far too long. Say, do you know about the Arkun realm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... it's not a realm per se, it's just a region that I live in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so my realm has collapsed in my absence. That's...\" she suddenly has a look of sadness on her face, and you can see a large tear forming in her eye. She wiped it away and perked up again \"Well no matter. What's gone is gone. So, little...Erik was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said this 'witch queen' was taking over humankind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, with an army of monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, disgusting. Humans and monsters are supposed to work together. At least that's how it was back in my day. Tell you what, in return for waking me up, I'll help you take down the witch queen, does that sound fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are completely dumbfounded, this massive, powerful woman was offering her help in your mission. You don't know what to say, but then you realize. \"That great! But, I can't honestly say that you're in my debt\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What do you mean? You woke me up didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that but, I would've died if not for you. You see that hole in the ceiling?\" She looks up to where you're pointing and you both see a beam of light shining through the hole you fell down through. \"If you were not here to break my fall, I would've certainly died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you're saying I saved your life?\" you nod at her. \"And may I ask what part of me was soft enough to break such a long fall for one as little as yourself?\" You going to her right breast, the one you landed on. She grasps in and holds it up for you both to see. \"So my boob saved you, that's what you're saying?\" You nod again, this time blushing a little. She starts to giggle, but then it slowly turns into a laugh, she laughs so hard that the ancient walls start to rumble with her laughing. Once she calms down, she wipes her eyes and looks upon you with a wide grin. \"Well, little one, tell you what. How about we consider each other even, that way neither of us are in debt to one another, and I help you take down the witch queen not to repay a debt, but as a friend. Sound fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod a third time, still surprised but also glad, and say \"Sure, I could accept help from a friend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, shake on it?\" she hold out her finger, and you grasp onto it with both hands as she gently moves it up and down. \"So, how about I help you out of here then?\" she stands up in the room, which is just barely high enough for her to stand in. \"And because they played such a vital role in forming our new friendship...\" she moves you up towards her chest, and drops you into her bosom, \"you can ride inside of my boobs on our way.\" You blushed a bit at the sudden gesture, but you find that it's quite comfortable resting on her bra in between her soft breasts. You even get a good view outside, surprisingly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, she climbed up on the ancient walls and broke her way through the ceiling and climbed up onto the ground, and took a deep breath of fresh air. You are in wonder over how high you are now, you can even see your house and the place where you were almost attacked by that slime from earlier. \"So little one,\" you hear Ania say from above, \"you know this land better than I, where to first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply...</span></div></div>",

A familiar voice rings through the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, farm boy!\" The Slime girl from before calls out as she gushes onto the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, uh, hey miss Slime.\" you nervously stutter out. \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking. \" The Slime girl explains playfully, \"Rather than lugging back a big ol' bag of stinking manure, wouldn't you rather be milking a Cow Girl, instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, another monster girl steps onto the road. With pale skin marred by black blotches, cloven feet, a small pair of horns on her head, a thin tail with a tuft of fir on the end. Her thighs were almost as thick as your torso and each of her breasts were easily bigger then your head. The Cow Girl was completely naked except for a red collar with a bell on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" A Cow Girl!?\" you exclaimed in shock. You had never seen one on the island before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you lucky,\" the Slime girl teased, \"that I just happened to know one? With how rare Cow Girl milk is around here, any <i>Farmer</i> would surely drop what ever they were doing to bring one home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted by the Slime Girl and just generally caught off guard by this whole turn of events, you didn't noticed the Cow Girl sneaking up on you.

She lets go of your ankles and you quickly scramble back to your feet, only to see the Cow Girl has advanced and is leaning down,  on eye level with you.  You try to swing at her but before you are able she grabs hold of both of your upper arms,  smiling the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww!

It was obvious she was wanting to toy with you. In that case...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep a deep breath and assess you situation. Alright, let's review...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's a slime girl. A living mass of sentient liquid/slime, meaning that there is only 3 basic things that can handle a Slime. <br>\r\n1. If someone has enough power or strength, they could physically be capable of dispersing said slime, and use the time it would take for the slime to reconstitute to flee or make an escape. However, since Erik is just starting out, he doesn't necesarily have the physical strength to pull this off, especially with just a wooden sword. So fighting directly would be out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Magic or elemental attacks would be capable of dealing damage to a Slime. Erik though doesn't know any magic yet, and he doesn't have any form of Elemental enhancements, or enchantments. You could however use something in the environment, question is, what? Looking around, you see on the ground is some loose dirt and dust. It would take some effort, but if you could manage to sling some dirt into the slime, it could slow her movements down marginally, and give her body something physical to hit, even with your wooden sword. However, could you be able to pull it off? At close range, Slimes are quite fast, and throwing dirt would require you to get close, and rely on dodging skills. And if she manages to get a hold of you, you wouldn't be able to escape her grasp, as a Slime's body can potentially become a variety of consistencies, from sticky to smooth, to even watery to acidic. If she grabs you, it's over, and you would be at her mercy, and all things considered, that option may not be viable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Slimes were constantly oozing out and drinking up liquid, which means, as long as they are not in a moist area, than overexerting themselves could result in quick dehydration, which would result in fatigue and/or weakness. This process could also be hastened if the slime tries to use projectile attacks, such as flinging its own slime. Once dehydrated, a Slime would become vunerable, which would give you the opportunity to attack, or run away. Then again, if she were to start slinging her slime at you, you would have to not get hit even once, for the slime would restrain you and prevent any further movement, which means, one hit, and you're done... You look around, and see that the area seems a bit dry, which makes sense since it hadn't rain for a couple of days. If you could goat her into attacking you with projectiles, and manage to avoid all of her attacks, you could win this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever happens next will require effort, perfect timing, lots of endurance, and speed on your part. So choose your next action wisely...</span></div></div>",

I will not be stopped here.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Slime at that moment began to make her move, stalking closer to Erik's position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith goal set in mind, you takes one last breath to prepare for your next action. Your hand hovers over the wooden sword hanging from your back, drawing it forth and out. Again, the sword, as it is, would be useless against a slime... however, for a preemptive strike, it'd be best she didn't figure out the plan early on. So... best to deceive her with false attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold the sword out in front of you with both hands, keeping both eyes on the slime, watching her every movement, the muscles of your legs tensing, preparing to spring into action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha heh ha! You're actually going to try and fight me with a wooden sword newbie? Heh! That is actually quite funny...\" Ignoring her insult, Erik remains focused, he couldn't afford to be psyched out. \"Alright... if you want to make a fool of yourself, go ahead... I like playing with my food anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your move. Charging, you run toward her as fast as your legs can take you, sword raised high. You slice downward, your attack simply going right through her gelatinous body. She gives a triumphant smirk at your attempt, her eyes mocking you. However, you don't stop there. You take this moment to dig the end of your sword into the ground, digging it in, twisting it so the flat edge would scoop a clump of dirt up, and sling the dirt as best you can toward the slime's face, picking up a good portion of it, catching her off guard. You look to see that the layer of dirt only clung to the surface of her gelatin upper body, the first sling not enough to really mix it in. Thinking quickly, you take the end of your sword, and swing again at her head, the sword passing through, but mixing the dirt deeper into slime, that area turning a dark brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression has become a bit more annoyed now, \"You're going to pay for that human!\" She raises her arm, changing it into a whip like tendril, and tries to launch it down at you. Reacting quickly, you backpedal, barely missing the whip like appendage by an inch, almost feeling the crack of the air as it slams into the ground where you were standing, cutting partially into it. As it did, you noticed that she managed to kick up some more dust and dirt, getting some on the end of her appendage. Perhaps you might be able to use that to your advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far so good... but that was only the first move. So far, she hasn't suspected your tactic yet, but now she knows you aren't just some weak human, which means it's going to be a lot harder to avoid her attacks now. The tactic of using your sword to kick up the dirt was effective in disguising your plan, but how long can you keep it up? You could just start grabbing some dirt in your hand, and tossing it at her every time you get close, but that would risk giving away your plan, and if she catches on, she'll be more relentless in her attacks, and might try to stop you from gathering the dirt on her. What to do...?</span></div></div>",

For this fight, you must rely on your speed and leg work, and hope your stamina will not fail you. Right now, the slime is keeping her body's viscosity liquid to avoid physical damage, which means that for now, you can slice her one or two more times with the sword without it getting caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Slime raises another tendril, planning to whip you with another attack. Seeing this, you begin to charge forward and closer, shortening the gap between the two of you. As the Whip tendril on her left is inches from hitting you, you put pressure into your right leg, and side step at the last second, allowing the tendril to embed into the ground, covering it in more dirt. You then raise you wooden sword to your left, and like you were using a golf club, kicked the flat of the sword into the dirt, throwing more all over her arm, while pretending to try and swipe at the tendril. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up toward her in time to see that she is shooting her tendril toward you to stab. Reacting quickly, you lean your body to the right, narily avoiding the attack. You then realize your error, now seeing that you are now between both her tendrils, and they are now trying to enclose around you. Thinking quickly, you start to charge right towards the Slime's main body, knowing that the closer to her you are, the higher her arms would be from the ground, allowing you to roll under her arms. Running as fast as your legs can carry you, keeping you body leaning low to the ground in the event she starts to close the gap between her arms faster than you can run to her, you also start to bring the sword up into a stabbing position.<br>\r\nHer arms are closing in on you fast, you look to her face to see any read or opening of movements. You see that her body starts to shift, the preemptive indication that is going to lift her leg for a kick at you from her right. Taking action, you lean your body back, and using the momentum of your body to perform a slide, and using the inertia of your leg to kick out some dirt while you were at it, you manage to slip under her kick attack. You roll quickly to your front and get to your feet quickly, and take the sword, stab it into the ground, and start to kick more dirt toward the Slime's back. Seeing her having trouble to turn herself around, you continue to dig dirt into the soil and kick as much as you can onto her, performing sword swings and slashes to pull this off. By the time the slime managed to turn around, the air is filled with clouds of dirt and dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins to retract her arms from behind her, reeling them back to herself, and as she does this, you notice they are coming fast to try and hit you. You try to react quickly, but are too slow, a double fisted strike hitting you in your stomach, sending you careening back a bit.<br>\r\nIn midair, you twist your body, and aim to land on your feet, landing hard, nearly causing your legs to give out. The air is knocked out of you, and it takes a precious few seconds to regain your breath, seconds the Slime starts to take advantage of. She begins to charge right at you, raising her arms to try and tackle you. You think quickly, digging the sword into the ground on your right, and toss the dirt toward her face, aiming to disorient her. It works, as her charge halters for a second, enough time to side step her attack and manuever around to her back. You begin the process of kick and digging dirt into her back again, your body's muscles beginning to tense with each swing, sweat pourind down from your forehead, but you do not relent in your attack. At this point, you start to notice that her gelatinous flesh no longer has the sheen of a Slime, but now holds a grungy, muddy appearance, and as she turns to try and attack you again, you start to see her body is beginning to slow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou back pedal from a horizontal Tendril whipping, the attack moving so slow, you saw it coming a mile away. Now is the time to attack. Holding your sword perpendicular to eye level, you take a stance, and charge out, avoiding a right hook from your opponent, ducking under the attack, and using the momentum to spin your body around into a full force diagonal slash. The attack hits, pushing the slime back a bit, surprise showing on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hit me? How did you managed to hit me?\" She cries out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik takes this moment to take a breather, but keeps his guard ever up. \"I figured that if my attacks couldn't connect due to you semi-liquid body, that I needed to change the consistancy to something a little denser. All those attacks I was making at you weren't meant to connect. I was simply getting you covered in dirt. But your smart... You can figure out the rest yourself...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression becomes one of terror, yet defiance. In desperation, she launches another jab towards you with her left, but you avoid it easily enough. She then takes another jab with her right, and you manage to side step it, taking a step foward as you do. She continues this assault, rapidly trying to strike at you, but her attacks are too slow now to really connect now. You take one last breath, and prepare a flurry of movements, striking her repeatedly all over her body, using basic Kendo strikes and hits, moving faster than she can manage to react. Pumping the last of your adrenaline, you push yourself into slashing out at her horizontally, managing to split her body in half. Even with the wooden sword, her body was weakened enough to easily cut through like a hot knife through butter. The upper half of her body lands on the ground as the lower half melts back into a dirty puddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to see that her upper half is heaving in breaths of air, her chest rising up and down. Looking at her face, you see a look of despair and defeat, tears rolling down the side of her face. She knows she has been beaten. In her current state, she wouldn't be able to put any form of a fight anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her, it was kind of sad  to see her in this state. But at the same time, she was the one who attacked you. You can't leave her like this. But what to do? If you finish her, you can put her out of her misery, and she will never harm anyone else again. But showing no mercy to this monster? What would that make you? You could probably help her. Slimes don't need much to heal. In fact, all it takes is some water, which you had a canteen full in your pouch. It would be a simple matter to pour some on her body to help her reconstitute herself. But if you did that, she might try and attack you. Could you really gamble that she might be willing to let you go after all that has happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's it going to be? Fight or Mercy?</span></div></div>",

He carefully walks over to the fallen Slime, her eyes peering with fear toward the approaching human. She tries to get up with her arms, but they lack the strength and constitution to support the upper half of her body. She looks up to Eric in fear, and closes her eyes in expectance, awaiting for something to befall her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting off the cap of the canteen, Eric begins to pour the water over her head, and drizzles it over the rest of her prone upper body. As the water careens down, it begins to wash away the dirt and mud created from the battle. The Slime Girl's eyes open in surprise, not having expected water to come down on her. Desperately, she cups her hands and begins to let the water pool, drinking it down with vigor. As she drank down the water, her body began to regain its gelatinous palor, and upon inspection, the lower half of her body began to reform. Granted, the process of restoring her body stretched what she had out, giving her entire physique a now very petite and feeble appearance, but she was now restored to a movable state. Eric allowed the Canteen to pour completely out until it was empty. Sure, he needed that water to keep hydrated, and he didn't how long it would take to get to the port town, or near any form of drinking water, but the Slime Girl needed the water now more than he presently did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Slime Girl began to stand on jiggly legs, stumbling a bit, her expression still confused. \"Why? Why did you do that? You could have finished me off, you had your chance... so why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric thought on his response. \"Because I don't see a point in killing you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you could have just left me! You didn't have to pour water on me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... but then you'd be left vunerable for other monsters or creatures... I couldn't exactly leave someone so defenseless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Slime Girl looked Eric in the eyes, trying to scan him for any deceit or deception, but found none. She then sighed, her expression much more calm than it was before. \"I'm sorry I attacked you... I was just looking for an easy meal... let's start over from the beginning...\" she then smiles toward him, and extends her hand toward Eric. \"Hello... my name is Goella...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: Pronounced GO-ELL-AH)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the hand, Eric watches for any hidden agenda, but sees sincerity in Goella's offering, and so, takes her hand in his, giving it a firm squeeze and shake, finding that her hand was gooey yet cool to the touch, almost soothing like a lotion. \"My name is Eric... it is nice to meet you Goella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the water... I know you humans need water like us slimes, so I really appreciate it. And again, I'm sorry for trying to eat you...\" Goella states in solemn gratitude with an apologetic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem, really. I'll be fine without water for a while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to know... Well, I best get on my way... I have to go find a stream or something to reconstitute myself to full health... If ever you run into any more slimes in this forest, just mention my name, and they'll back off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that......\" Erik began to think on this. He could ask to come with her so to help find a stream for the both of them. But truth is, he really needs to get back on the road and get out of this forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould he ask to join her? Or Should he go on his own way?</span></div></div>",

After getting a good look at its body, you can now see what's attacking you: a naga. A monster with the upper body of a woman and a long snake tail as its lower body. Her tail is covered in dark green scales that are shining from the water. Her upper body has four arms and looks like it belongs to a warrior woman, wearing only a leather bra and gauntlets on all four of her hands as armor, probably to keep from hindering her movement. She is wielding four sabers in each of her hands and is wearing what looks like to be a bronze crown in her blonde hair. She yells at you \"Ah, a slime <i>and</i> a human? This is an odd pairing. Usually one of you would kill the other by now. No matter, this just good news for me, a human for my food and a slime for my entertainment! I won't refuse such a lucky find.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Naga brings up her swords in a defensive stance, preparing for an attack. Eric's mind is racing, not expecting to find such a strong opponent this early. He turns over to Goelia, maybe she knows how to fight them? But Goelia is no more confident than Eric. Her face has fear all over it and her body is shivering (or jiggling in this case) with fear. \"Goelia!\" you call out to her, \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can't fight this. W-we need to run human. Now!\" she cries out in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you can try\" the naga responds, causing Goelia to jump in fear, \"But just so you know, I'm probably can move way faster than you on foot, and you have that river behind you too.\" Eric and Goelia look around, even if they could outrun her, the river severely limits their options. Fighting is the best option here, as bad as that sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric turns to Goelia again and whispers \"Hey, I think I have a plan. I just need you to get her attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? H-how do I know you won't run away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need you to trust me.

Finding it much harder to move and see now, the naga decides to bring her and the slime girl down and crash into the ground in an attempt to knock the slime girl off of her. She manages to cause a hard enough impact to knock a few bits off, but Goelia still manages to keep her grip. The naga takes it further and begins plowing through the ground to scrap off the slime girl. Meanwhile, Eric desperately tries to keep up with the two while also avoiding the naga's flailing tail in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a few moments of struggle, there's bits and pieces of Goelia everywhere until she finally has to let go before being separated into too many pieces. The naga is still covered in bits of the slime girl though and looks absolutely livid. She brings herself down up close to the now greatly reduced slime and brings up her swords for an attack. Luckily, this was just the chance Eric needed. The naga felt the human jump off her own tail and turned around to see a him coming down wooden sword in hand. He brings it down into the center of the naga's face, knocking her back down to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga drops two of her swords and brings her upper right and lower left hands to her face to put pressure on the pain. When she pulls her hands back, she sees blood that dripped out of her now broken nose.

Goelia however, after reforming a bit of herself was quick to celebrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won. We won! HAHA! We defeated naga!

Now, since you are in possession of such nice weapons and seemed so protective of this river, do you mind telling us where you keep the rest of your stash?

I just moved here from home, I didn't hurt anybody either except for a couple of animals and a slime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait really?\" Goelia asks surprised, \"Then what was that act you put on back there?

Assuming she is telling the truth, then her swords were all she has. One would be a good replacement for your broken wooden sword and the rest might be sold for a decent price. Then Goelia interjects and whispers \"Hey human, even though she looks totally pathetic right now, naga's are still one of the best melee fighters among all monsters, she might be useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you suggesting we recruit her too?\" Eric whispers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? It's not like she's in a position to refuse, and she's a four armed naga, those are especially rare. It would be such a missed opportunity to not take her. But if you just want to take her stuff, I suggest making use of her body in another way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, are you suggesting-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?

Well I didn't think I would be recruiting monsters on my quest on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik thinks of an alternative \"Hey Sari, you said your mother was a fighter in your village right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The BEST fighter\" she says crossing all four of her arms. \"Show my family a bit of respect. What? Are you considering going there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, it's an option. It'll just be for a day at least. Just to rest up and buy supplies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you guys are monsters, you can vouch for me right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, our village doesn't accept all monsters you know\" Sari says. \"That's kind of racist Erik\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I didn't know, sorry.\" Erick says. \"So who do they accept?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we do accept... um... Okay we don't accept most monster types, and Goelia would probably fit in too. But that doesn't give you the right to assume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sorry again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't guarantee that you'll be let in, even with me and the slime\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Goelia\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a tough choice.

Before he or his monster party members can react, the figure puts a knife to Erik's throat and wraps her legs around his body to pin his arms as he stands on his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is a rare sight,\" says the figure in a very feminine voice. \"What's a slime, a naga, and a human doing in this part of the country?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let him go human!\" Goelia yells as she brings her arms up to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, which human are you referring to ms slime? Me? Or the one at the tip of my dagger?\" says the figure, as she presses her blade against Erik's neck. She tightens her legs around Erik and he feels her large breasts press up against his back. \"So let me ask you again, what brings you three here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, we're here to cut you to pieces lady!\" says Sari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure presses the dagger even harder against Erik's neck \"Well, considering that's your goal in the end, I suppose I can slit this boy's throat if I'm just going to die anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can make the finishing blow, Erik quickly says \"We just want to get into the town!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could tell that much boy, I meant why do you, a human, want to enter with monsters?\" the figure says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they're my traveling companions. We're on a quest to kill the witch queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik couldn't see the woman's face, but he could hear her start giggling, which proceeded into a very hard laugh. As she's laughing, she lowers her dagger from Erik's neck and lets him go. As Erik backs off from the woman, he's finally able to get a good look at her. From her outfit, he could deduce that she was either a thief or an assassin. She was wearing black leather boots and leggings that perfectly revealed the shape of her legs and hips. On her upper body she wore a cowl with its hood down to reveal a head of short red hair, and underneath the cowl was a crisscross halter top that exposed a good amount of her massive breasts. She was also missing her right arm above the elbow and the stump in its place was wrapped in leather cap. Her left arm was adorned with leather straps with metal studs on it and was sheathing her dagger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she said, \"In all my years, I've seen many adventurers come here to kill the witch queen, but never with a party like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, that's what we intend to do,\" Erik said. \"And...um... we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoelia could see the nervousness in Erik's voice and interjected, \"And if you wanna get in our way, we'll gladly take you on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman just laughed at Goelia's remark. \"My word, you guys are pretty looney, aren't ya? Tell ya what, because you folks gave me such a laugh, I'll sneak you into town. In return for a favor of course.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Just like that?\" Sari says ignorantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of favor are you asking\" Erik says, now more confident from Goelia's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we can discuss the details later. But if you don't want entry, I suppose I can leave you all here now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik looks to Goelia and Sari, and both nod in approval. \"Okay, we'll accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! My name's Sythia by the way.\" She holds her arm out for a shake, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erik,\" he responds. He instinctively brings out his right hand, which makes for a weird handshake, but Sythia didn't seem to mind. He then introduces Goelia and Sari, who are both still suspicious of this one armed woman, not that Erik still isn't suspicious either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the introductions, Sythia walks by them and says, \"Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one-armed woman leads the party into an area exceptionally thick with trees and bushes. In it, Sythia reveals a tunnel hidden with fake bushes that she replaces once they all enter. She lights up a torch and takes the lead again. \"These tunnels have been used by smugglers for years. The town watch will never find you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where will we go once we enter the town?\" Erik asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I know someone who can help with that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several twists and turns, the party exits the tunnel and find themselves in...</span></div></div>",

The staff here will be sure to treat you all well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they usually accept monsters as guests?\" Erik asks. Meanwhile, Sira is on the brink of panicking with the looks of everyone glaring at her threateningly, but Goelia seems keen on returning those glares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not usually. But again, I know someone. Speaking of which, where is--\" before she can finish her sentence, a hand shoots into her top and starts groping her breast, to which Sythia responds by reaching for her dagger, but she's stopped by another hand grabbing her only arm and a seductive, feminine voice that says...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sythia, where have you been sweetie? You promised you would be back before my break was over.\" the speaker was a dark skinned woman who was relatively slim, and was wearing a more modest attire compared to the rest of the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dorothea, I'm sorry honey, I just needed to help this guy sneak his monsters through the walls. Speaking of which, Dorothea honey-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Dorothea says after seeing Sari and Goelia, \"I took in a lot of weirdos for you, but monsters are another subject entirely\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please honey,\" Sythia puts on an uncharacteristically pouty face for her lover, \"It'll just be for a couple of night, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea's expression doesn't seem to change, so Sythia switches tactics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns around and puts her hand on Dorothea's cheek and puts on a more seductive look. \"If you do, I'll take off work for the rest of the week, just to spend more nights with you\" she says while biting her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea blushes, \"Fine. Two nights. One for tonight, and one for tomorrow. But after that they leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSythia hugs her lover with big grin on her face. \"That's why I love you hun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up you big titted goof. The rest of the week better be the best nights of my life.\" Dorothea pulls a key out of her pocket and hands it to one of the waitresses. \"Show these three to Sythia's guest room.\" Did she have a room specifically dedicated to people her girlfriend pulled from the streets? Or...forest in Erik's case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSythia raised her arm stump to gain Erik's attention, as her arm was still holding onto her girlfriend, \"Erik, about that favor\" before she could finish that statement, Dorothea grabbed Sythia's head and pulled her into a deep passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she let go, the innkeeper said \"Oh no you don't. No work for the rest of the week remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Including tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now come here my one-armed sex slave\" Dorothea dragged the thief off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell ya later, I'll keep in touch!\" was all Sythia could get out before disappearing into Dorothea's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress who would escort the party was a petit girl who was shaking in her heels at the sight of Sari and Goelia. Erik did his best to calm her down and Goelia tried to appear as nonthreatening as possible. Sari however was quick to stroke her ego at the girl's fear, to which Goelia responded by whipping the back of her head. The argument following was enough to get the waitress laughing and ease her nerves enough for her to show them their room. It was surprisingly large, with two beds, a view over the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the two beds started an argument between the two monster girls over who should sleep in the beds. Erik offered to sleep with either of them, but who should it be? Goelia was nice and all, but her liquid body could make the experience uncomfortable, or she might accidentally dissolve him. Sari was also an option, but she might accidentally squeeze Erik to death. Who should it be?</span></div></div>",

Until we meet again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then went their seperate ways, Erik going back toward the road, and Goella going deeper into the forest. Erik managed to find his way back to the dirt road, and continued along his path toward the Port Town. As he walked off, he failed to take notice of something watching him from behind the cover of the trees. A Half and hour later, as Erik continued his long trek, he suddenly caught sight of something in the forest to his right before it hid behind the tree lines. Whatever it was was a bright white color, which stood out among the green foliage of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiousity, Erik carefully stalked towards what he saw, keeping his footing light so not to draw too much attention. He took a turn, and cautiously peered around the tree. What he saw caught him by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tall and slender, with pure white skin and fur that would softly cover parts of her body, and long white hair that came down in curls, reaching the arch of her back. The most noticeable parts about her, aside from being in the nude, was that she had cloven hooves where her feet should have been, long pointed ears covered in fure at the tips, a long white tail with a cloud like puff of fur at the end, and black luster eyes with only the twinkling of stars in their abyss. The last feature though was what tipped you off to what she was, for adorned on her forhead was a long, spiralling, straight horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unicorn...\" Erik said in a whisper, trying not to catch the attention of the beauty before him. Currently, she seemed more interested in butterflies that were passing by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnicorns were a rarity, even among the monsters of this world. For a human to see one, it was either a sign of Good fortune, or a mark of ill omen. Erik though started to carefully back away toward the road. Though Unicorns were passive in nature, if one caught sight of a human, then depending on the human's own nature would determine how it would react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it deemed a human wicked or vile, than it would chase down that human with its horn, and kill them without hesitation, and wouldn't stop until the human was dead. Even more unlikely, if it deemed a human worthy, it was legend it would grant said a gift. Erik though wasn't willing to take that chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erik was sneaking off, his foot suddenly stepped on a random twig, the snapping of the branch sounding like Thunder in the area. He looked up to see the Unicorn was already a few feet in front of him, her black eyes staring right into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow Does she respond?</span></div></div>",

This seemed to have a negative effect, as the moment his hand touched his sword, the Unicorn's eyes suddenly went from a beautiful night sky, to a pitch black void. Warning alarms went off inside Erik's head, and he began to draw the wooden sword, but before he even drew it from his back's sling, the Unicorn's form started hazing out, and before Erik even knew it, a great force hit him directly in his chest, and pinned him into the tree behind. A great pain exploded from his chest area, and as he peered down, shock evident on his face, he saw the Unicorn had impaled him right through the chest, more accurately, through his very heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it... the Quest was finished before it even started.... You didn't even stand a chance... Your vision slowly began to spot at its edges, the light fading from your eyes.

Not that he wanted to mind you, but just an inkling of survival instinct was kicking in, and if fight or flight was needed, he needed to be prepared for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik was about to reach his hand over to the grip of his sword, but suddenly stopped himself. Something was telling him that in this situation, he needed to not show any sign of aggression. That any form of antagonist behavior would be seen negatively, and the Unicorn would attack without hesitation. Erik next considered fleeing, but then he remembered hearing that Unicorns were said to be so fast, that it was considered impossible for a human to outrun one. Besides, another feeling inside was saying any attempt to run could be seen as a provocation for the Unicorn to give chase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, what Erik needed to do was to show no hostility, but at the same time, show no fear to this monster. The Unicorn suddenly tipped her head, as if observing Eric in curiosity. She then began to stroll closer to him, her eyes lazily looking to the side, looking at something else for a moment. Erik stood firm, his heart racing a mile a minute. When the Unicorn was standing mere inches from Erik, she turned her gaze back toward Erik, and slowly began to raise her hands towards Erik's face. She lightly cupped her hands on his cheeks, her Midnight eyes gazing deeply into Erik's own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as Erik gazed into the Celestial bodies that made up her eyes, he suddenly began to see an image forming in the pools of her eyes. Within the image, it displayed Molly and the Village, who were awaiting word from him at home and for his safe return. Continuing to gaze deeper, he saw his early life; happy and joyful times from his early childhood, when he had lost his parents to a monster raid,  being taken care of by Molly and her family, her father eventually leaving on the Quest to slay the Witch Queen, to his time training hard to be able to fight with monsters so as to return the land to peace, followed by many other memories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the next image he bore witness to was one he couldn't recall or remember. It depicted the Witch's castle, and standing before it was an army consisting of not just humans, but monsters as well, and at the forefront of this army, leading them, was a young man bearing a four pointed star shaped mark on his forehead, a sword in hand, a cloak blowing in the wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik was shaken from the visions when the Unicorn suddenly spoke, her voice sounding like the echoes from a well. \"<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><i><b>Your journey will be long and arduous... but if you wish to hold the chance to defeat the Witch Queen, you must first travel to the Island of Thanatos... once there, seek out the Labyrinth of Despair, and take claim of the Mystic's Cloak... it will be one of the pieces you will need for victory.</b></i></span></span></span>\" Her face inched closer to Erik's, and before she got too close, she stopped, and then leaned her horn down, touching the tip of it to his forehead. \"<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><i><b>I leave this gift to you...</b></i></span></span></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a slight burning on your forehead, like a red hot metal brand, and as you look up to see the Unicorn's reaction, you take notice that she is gone from sight, and yet again, you are left alone. You reach up to your forehead, and feel something different. Reaching into your pouch, you manage to pull out a small hand mirror. You look up to your forehead, and see a branded mark had appeared on you brow. The Symbol of which was a diamond shaped four pointed star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she do to you?</span></div></div>",

It was not much farther now until he was within the safety of the Port. Suddenly, Erik heard the rustling of bushes, and he managed to jump back in time to avoid a sword coming vertically down on him. He looked up, and what he saw made him instantly tense up. Coming out of the bushes were 15 men, dressed in worn garbs of rags and hand me down clothing, some wielding swords, and a couple further back notching Bows and Arrows. Erik knew what now stood before him. Bandits... Highwaymen... Looters... Thieves... however you wanted to label  them, it was obvious they were attacking to steal Erik's possessions. Erik then took notice of something that each of these men shared. They bore bands or bandannas with the same mark on the imprint. A wilting Rose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi!\" Started the bandit that attacked you, speaking in a very rough voice, \"That was quite the display of dodgin' ya got there Kid... But considering ya only have a wooden sword... and there be 15 of us and one of you... I'd say ya best option would be to hand over ya valuables... In this here area, there be a toll for passage to the Port Town... Courtesy of the Rose-Thorn Gang...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik gripped his wooden sword tightly, more preparing to hit and run than to try a direct confrontation. Observing the situation, ten of these men were armed with swords and other lethal close range weapons, while five further back were notching their arrows, all of them aimed directly towards him. It was not the best case scenario. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you can't afford to hand over anything, mainly because who knows how much these rogues might take, and also because you packed only the essentials for your quest, and everything you have is crucial for your journey. That, and you really didn't want to end up wandering into town with nothing on hand. But what to do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Eric didn't notice though was that there was a figure hidden in the brush among the bandits, and as the figure's gaze observed Erik, their eyes caught sight of the Star shaped mark on his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up a sec boys!\" A feminine voice suddenly spoke up, catching Erik's attention, as well as the other bandits. Suddenly, a dark skinned woman dressed in blue silk and black leather tights, and also wearing a dark blue cloth wrapped around her head hiding her identity, had walked out of the cover of the brush. Erik took notice that the cloth wrapped around her head bore the same symbol as the other members of the Rose-Thorn Gang. It was hard to tell, but it looked like she was examining you with her eyes, more than likely evaluating what you had. She then began to speak again, her voice haughty, yet slightly serene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had to guess... This drip probably just started out today... meaning he probably doesn't have much of value on him...\" This caused some of the bandits to bare a look of disappointment. \"However... it would not do to leave this young man unscathed... isn't that right boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bandits cheered in agreement, someone even yelling out, \"Yeah, yur right Boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soaked in the praise of her men, and then returned her attention back to Erik. \"So then, boy... How do you propose we settle this? Since you are going into the port, I will assume you have something valuable... perhaps a purse full of gold might make things worth our while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat option was definitely out of the question... you need that gold not only for a new sword, but also for lodgings tonight, supplies for the trip, and to charter a boat to get to wherever you needed to go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or perhaps you'd like to challenge one of my men to a one on one duel... we will only take a portion of your gold, IF you can defeat an opponent of my choosing... but if you happen to die, we will just pick your carcass of everything you own...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that option would be more preferable... you could probably beat one of these thugs mono e mono, and with them only taking a portion of your gold, you could probably still have enough to purchase everything you might need... though, you might have to skimp on the sword and inn... However... this woman seemed awfully confident to put a potential pay off on the line... You looked around at all the men in the area... you could probably take any of them on one on one... did she mean herself then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she then stepped closer to you, and began to speak in a sultry whisper, lightly breathing into your ear. \"Or for option 3, you could offer me something else in exchange for your safe passage, free of charge, if you know what I mean?\" As she said this, hers peered downward, her index finger suddenly running down your chest, her finger leaving once it reached your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait? Was she hitting on you? Hm... well, considering the men she is associated with, You guess you couldn't blame her... but do you really have such little pride, that you'd sell your body to this woman just so you wouldn't have to pay a cent? Well, considering that despite her being a Bandit, she was very easy on the eyes... with those sultry curves, firm rear, plump breasts the size of Honey dew melons... It could be worse... But still, what kind of hero would yield so easily?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do...?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then let out an annoyed sigh, shook her head, and whispered in Erik's ear. \"You should have gone for Option 3... it would have been well worth your time... but if you really want to play the hero... fine!\" She then turned to the group of brigands. \"Hey Jumbo! Get out here!\" Her men let out a cheer after hearing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait... Jumbo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your ears catch the sound clanking metal and heavy footfalls, and from behind a tree line, a massive eight foot man comes stomping out, covered head to toe in a battered suit of armor, only his arms and the areas on his legs exposed with some armor on the knees, but from that little much exposed, you could tell this man was incredibly muscle bound. Hoisted on his shoulder, he held aloft a massive battle ax that from the sheer size of the ax's head, could cleave your whole body half, vertically and/or horizontally. The massive armored man let off a slight growl in Erik's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik's jaw opened in surprise, and though the woman was wearing a wrap masking her appearance, he could tell she was smugly smirking just from her tone of voice. \"Hero, meet Jumbo... Jumbo, potential loot-able carcass... I'd accept it if you changed your mind... however, I'll only accept option 1 at this point...\" and then her voice began to mutter to herself and whine. \"Not choosing option 3 slightly stung a bit... damn heroes and their idiotic bravery... I can't even get a good lay anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mentioned before, Erik couldn't afford to go with option 1... not unless he was willing to live like a hobo for the next couple weeks in the Port Town. No, he was on a quest, and it wouldn't wait for him to waste such time. Re-steeling his resolve, Erik drew his wooden sword, getting himself into a fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... your funeral... Jumbo! Try to make it quick... I don't want any valuables getting covered in too much blood...\" The woman stated, walking away from Erik, getting cleared from the duel about to commence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, the situation seems pretty bleak. The man in front of you not only had bulking strength, a massive ax, and armor covering the vital parts of his body, and you only had a wooden sword, there might still be a chance. With all that heavy armor, and the massive ax, his movement and attacks will be easily telegraphed, and should give you ample opportunity to maneuver and move. Your body had recovered enough from fighting the Slime earlier, and though you were still slightly scuffed up from said fight, all you had to do for this fight was probe his defenses for weak points. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the fight began, Jumbo charging for you with ax raised high, moving quite fast for a man his size. Regardless, his speed wouldn't be able to match yours. Swinging his ax down, you roll to the side to avoid, and then take this opening to charge forward, taking a strike at one of his exposed portions of his leg, striking at his left calf. It seemed to jar the man, but not enough to stop him as he began to lift the massive ax again, stepping his other leg toward you to reposition himself to swing the ax horizontally at you. This maneuver was easily telegraphed, and you could tell that by the sheer weight of the ax that trying to swing the ax with one hand and to move his arm across his own body to hit you was very awkward and as a result, lacked the force, speed, and power behind the swing. You easily duck under the attack, and strike him at his left leg again. One of the greatest of human weaknesses was the fact that during a fight, humans greatly rely on their legs for maneuvering, and using momentum to put force into one's attacks. Without the legs, a human would be a sitting target with limited attacking capability. If you repeat damage to the same area, you may wear him down enough where he won't be able to maneuver anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumbo stumbles a bit from that strike, but from the tensing in his arm muscles, you could tell he was about swing the ax again, this time from a position where the force of the ax will come faster and harder. You have to move quick. With haste, you lean your full body back, barely avoiding the backhanded swing of the ax. Just as you were about to make your next move, Jumbo's other arm suddenly launches out and manages to get a hold of your right shoulder, restraining your sword arm. Shit! You were so focused on his ax, you forgot about the unarmed hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat can you do? You could try to switch your wooden sword to your left and strike at the opposing arm. Or you could try striking at his armored head and hope you disorient him enough to let go.</span></div></div>",

Lemon sLime sound to you?\" This comment caught her slightly off guard. Okay, not the greatest pun. In fact, it was probably cringe worthy. But considering that your life is on the line, a bad pun is better than nothing at all. Plus, she definitely wasn't expecting her victim to be joking at a time like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe left side of her face jiggled in a manner that resembled her eye twitching, and her expression was one of annoyance. \"I don't think you get the gravity of the situation human... either that, or you're a dumbass... I'm going to play with you in a manner that will make you suffer... and then I'm going to swallow you whole.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, good, she's getting mad, but not mad enough. Time to press it some more. \"Oh come on... I've heard you Slimes like to have a 'Goo' time!\" If Molly was here, she'd probably scold me for abusing the English language. Granted, the bad puns were having the right effect, as the Slime girl's entire body was starting to jiggle and vibrate from her annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I'm done talking to you human...\" She then transformed her arms into a whip like tendril, and began to lash them out toward you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou back pedal a bit, making sure to keep your distance out of the range of her whips. Alright, she's angry and on the offensive. That's good. Just got to keep dodging her attacks, and force her to overextend herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps Erik could do something to hasten the process. He could draw his wooden sword, and slash at the Slime's whips, cutting them off. At this range, they'd be stretched out and easier to cut through. Granted, this might put him at more risk, since he'll be directly fighting against her, and dodging simultaneously, splitting his focus, and not to mention the Slime proved to be smart, so whose to say she won't change tactics?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing Erik could do is try to goat her into chasing him and launching projectiles. Slimes may be fast up close, but have one trying to chase a target, and they are not known for being great sprinters. Not to mention, Erik would have the cover of the trees to help in avoiding said ranged attacks. However, if a single shot manages to hit Erik, the slime will hinder his movements, and he'll be caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik swerved under a horizontal whip attack, barely avoiding the tendril by an inch. Whatever he does next, he better do it soon, because his stamina may not hold out by the time the Slime would start to tire.</span></div></div>",

The slime girl pulls off your armor and smiles devilishly.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to take your fluids!\" The slime girl said.<br>\r\nHolding you down, she molded one of her arms into a tentacle, which she slammed into your face. You could feel her slime permeating every hole in your head, your mouth, your nose, your ears, all of them. Slowly, she absorbed the moisture from your face. That was really uncomfortable, but it was nothing compared to what she did with her other hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime girl molded her other hand into a two pronged tentacle. She ripped off your pants and went to work. One of her tentacles went right into your ass. You screamed loudly as she violated your virgin butthole, drying it out with every passing second. The second prong of her tentacle went into... your penis. The thin prong went down and sucked your urine right from your bladder. It hurt like nothing you had felt before. Then, when she was done with that, she bent her head down and sucked your now erect cock.<br>\r\n\"Curse you, boner!\" You screamed. This was no time to be excited like that.<br>\r\nThe slime girl didn't have to suck long to get that juicy, white fluid out of you. Too much masturbation back at home meant you came without much provocation. When she was done, the slime girl slowly moved off of you to admire your dry, but still breathing body. She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun! Since you were so nice and didn't fight back, I'll let you live, okay?\" She said. You just sat there covered in slime gasping for air. The slime girl wandered off humming a merry tune to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter catching your breath, you stood up. Now you had no armor and no pants. This just wasn't your day. Also, you were incredibly thirsty. Slowly, weakly, you crawled along the road wishing for water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, when you felt ready to give up and die, luck turned in your favor. A passing merchant noticed you on the road.<br>\r\n\"Good heavens! What happened to your pants? And why are you covered in slime?\" He said, dismounting his horse.<br>\r\n\"Water! Do... you... have.. water?\" You gasped.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got some! Give me second!\" The merchant said.<br>\r\nHe reached into his saddlebag and pulled out a canteen. You desperately drank as much as you could.<br>\r\n\"Thank you! I was attacked by a slime girl and she sucked me dry!\" You said.<br>\r\nThe merchant looked at your wooden sword.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, you can't just go out here with only a wooden sword. You're lucky you survived. You could've been eaten! Say... You interested in buying a sword off of me?\" The merchant said.<br>\r\nYou got out your coin bag.<br>\r\n\"I have some gold.\" You say.<br>\r\nThe merchant snatched it out of your hand and gave you a bronze broadsword.<br>\r\n\"You had just enough for it.\" He said, smiling.<br>\r\n\"Don't you have anything a little cheaper? I still need to buy food and pants eventually.\" You said.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I saved your life. You owe me one, so you buy that sword, you got it?\" The merchant said.<br>\r\nYou looked the sword over.<br>\r\n\"It's not cursed or something, is it?\" You said.<br>\r\n\"Heavens, no! It's just that nobody wants to buy it because it's so expensive. Now, if you're willing to part with those boots, I can let you have my spare pair of pants!\" The merchant said.<br>\r\n\"Forget it.\" You said.<br>\r\nYou just walked off. Pants or no pants, you would continue your quest. This merchant just wanted to take advantage of you. At least you had a decent sword now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you came to a small hamlet on the edge of a meadow.</span></div></div>",

The  far side of the room was covered in shallow water, but that wasn't the point of interest. No, the point of interest was the giant monster girl in the middle of that pond. She appeared lanky and shimmered with an aqueous sheen. You couldn't tell whether it was water or slime. She was 20 feet tall, but was on all fours. What would've been normal skin was instead covered in green scales with some brown and yellow patterns around her. She would've been a D-cup if she were normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard noisy slurping, licking, and moans of pleasure coming from the giant frog girl, as well as a series of screams and cries coming from near her. Further investigation of the frog revealed a 14 year old, halfway past her lips, and his clothes just beneath her. Her lips wrapped around his waistline, and he was trying his hardest to push himself free. The noisy sounds of one-sided lust clued you in as to exactly what that girl was doing. You heard her giggle, a malicious giggle, the more that boy cried and pushed. To your horror, an arm slipped past her lips. His screaming intensified when the frog began sucking the boy through her lips, and you could only watch in horror as his fearful face slipped past her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to lick at the boy stuck in her mouth, and you saw his outline press against her cheeks. After a few moments of that, she held out a hand underneath her, and spat him into it. The poor boy was absolutely slathered in sticky monster girl saliva. She tilted her hand, letting the kid fall onto the cave floor. He got up shakily, confused by the sudden shift in environment. However, when he noticed that monster looming just behind him, he instantly booked it. He ran towards you, further up the cave, screaming for help. Meanwhile, the frog just watched, a hungry look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to reach out and grab the boy, but something in the frog's eyes told you she was going to try something. Sure enough, her mouth opened up, and her long, flexible tongue flicked forward. It latched onto the kid's ankle, causing him to trip over. Then, just as quick as it came out, it reeled itself back in, pulling the screaming boy with. Once again, he was waist deep in her lips, and once again she happily licked and slurped at the poor boy. You knew monsters were horrible, but seeing one of them actually play with their prey like this... this was just barbaric!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't see a lot of hiding places, but facing her head on could be a problem.</span></div></div>",

She turned her large body towards where she discarded that boy, who lied on the stony ground, him panting and looking like he'd been through a one-sided battle. A prominent bulge in his pants was now obvious to you, him being tossed out of the frog's grip and all. However, it didn't sound like that'd be for long. You tried to rush in the path of her tongue, but she whipped her tongue to the side, hitting your stomach and tossing you backwards a little, you falling onto your backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, you can run along now,\" she said. \"I've got a much tastier treat right here. And if you try to stop me, then I could simply gobble you alive~\" She spoke with a perverted lick to her lips before turning towards the boy once again. Her tongue protruded from her mouth, before wrapping around his ankle. The boy was brought to attention as he recognized the gross, sticky feeling around his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! NO!\" he squealed out. He flipped onto his belly and tried to crawl away, the frog purposefully giving some slack to her tongue so that he could crawl. However, after a few seconds, that tongue began retreating to her mouth, her dragging the boy along with. He screamed out as he began to get pulled towards the giant frog, his fingers digging into the floor beneath him as he was pulled. And you could only watch right now. She was able to easily leap away from your attacks, and she had you completely out-ranged. She could probably seal your fate right now if she weren't more interested in the boy's taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you'd need to improve your skills.

You remember your tattered monster manual and quickly pull it out and flip through until you find an article on Earth Elementals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe page is very worn, probably from that time you dropped it in a puddle while it was raining, but you're able to make out a decent amount of information. Earth Elementals are almost compared to slimes, being made out of soft dirt, mud or clay with grasslike hair. Earth Elementals have the ability to absorb people into their body just as slimes do, and can use this to absorb bodily fluids from anywhere on their bodies. Earth Elementals are also known for being perverted, their favorite form of sex is forcing the man to give her anal, usually trapping him between her abnormally large buttcheeks. Because of the Earth Elementals ability to bind people like slimes, men captured by them are usually carried around between their buttcheeks, as Earth Elementals are very protective of their catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the page was too worn to read, even the danger level was unreadable. You put the book away and continued watching this Monster Girl as she plucked more fruit from the surrounding trees. She let out a sigh and began talking to herself. \"I really wish the others would stop snatching up all the humans. I can't believe they were going to raid the village too.\" Your eyes went wide at that remark, if the monsters were raiding the mining town, it would perfectly explain why there weren't any monsters on the road!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly decided what you should do next...</span></div></div>",

You stab into her butt with your wooden sword and you're shocked as you can't seem to pull your sword out! \"O-oh! Is someone there?\" the woman questions as she grabs you with her hand, bringing you up to her face. \"Oh! Hello there! I never thought a human would want to visit me!\" She said with a warm smile as her other hand went to her rear and pulled the sword out. She eyed the weapon and to your surprise, tossed it in her mouth and chewed it up! \"You even brought me a snack! You're so nice! My name is Mary.\" This earth elemental sounded very airheaded to you, as she completely missed the fact that you were attacking her, not bringing her food. You struggled to get out of her grip, but she had a tight grasp on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so lucky that I found you! I've been begging for a man for a long time, but I was never fast enough to catch one.\" Mary said with the same warm smile as she began to tug at your pants, pulling them off and tossing them into her basket, she opened her hand as she brought you closer to her face. Out of instinct, you attempted to jump off her hand, but found that you were glued to it thanks to her slimelike nature. Even though she was made out of a mud, her dirt skin actually felt like regular skin. \"No running away! Now that I got you, I'm never letting you go!\" Mary said as she brought you to her mouth and began to lick at your crotch. To your surprise, her tongue left very little residue. Only a few traces of dirt were left on you as she continued to lick at your crotch, resulting in you getting hard. \"You're perfect! I can't wait to try you out...\" Mary said as she used her finger to play with your now erect penis. \"Please stop! I need to get to the mining town!\" you pleaded as Mary giggled a bit. \"You're not going anywhere now! I caught you fair and square, and now you're going to be my husband!\" You began squirming hard, this isn't how it was supposed to go! If you couldn't even get away from this Earth Elemental, how were you going to save the land from the evil queen? As Mary began lowering you towards her backside, you began to beg and plead that she release you. Your pleas however, were ignored as she parted her massive rear and dropped you in. She slammed her cheeks together as you fell in, your head poking out from in between them. \"Don't want my husband suffocating now do I? Don't worry though, now that you're there, you'll be safe!\" Mary said as you felt your penis being moved. Mary wiggled her backside a bit and finally lodged your penis into her anus. You could feel shivers go up Mary's spine as she began to play with her butt, rubbing it sensually. Your penis began to slowly move in and out of her hole, which surprisingly was much different from the rest of her body. It felt very soft, almost like jelly. You began getting close to your breaking point as Mary began rattling your penis around inside of her, you struggled hard but your arms and legs were bound by the insides of her buttcheeks. Sandwiched between them, you could only give up and experience the rest of the pleasure that Mary would bring you. You both orgasmed at the same time, Mary had a hard time remaining standing but managed to regain her composure. \"..Wow.. That was amazing! You're no ordinary human, that's for sure! You've got some high quality stuff in you!\" Mary said as she picked up her basked and began to wade through the earth once more. \"Cmon, let's go home!\" Mary said as she began to make her way to your new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to sob quietly as Mary \"walked\" home. Her butt rhythmically bounced and jiggled as she walked, and with your penis still inside of her butthole, massage you. Before long, the bouncing made you cum again into her, and again. You were being milked just from the simple action of Mary walking. As she hummed a happy tune, you finally accepted your fate to be this Earth Elementals husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the rest of your life sandwiched between Mary's buttcheeks, and while occasionally you are taken out for food and non-anal sex, you come to love your home. The feeling of being trapped between this mini-giantess of an Earth Elemental's buttcheeks is a feeling that you couldn't describe, and the immense pleasure you get just from your penis rattling around in her butthole from her walking was the best sensation you had ever felt. Maybe you could have saved the land, but you were much happier spending your life in between your gorgeous Earth Elemental wife's buttcheeks. And she felt the same way, always making sure to get your opinion before she did something... Except for sex or releasing you of course, she let you know that she was the boss there, but the way you felt while having sex made you not care at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were happy to let her dominate your life.</span></div></div>",

That little puff of fairy dust had just shaved a full inch off your height. An expression of intense fear filled your face as you realized what was going on. Stifling a laugh from how pathetic you looked, the fairy leader gestured to her sisters to come take a look as well. Once again all of the fairies gathered in front of your face and, upon seeing the pathetic look on your face, began to laugh hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, what's the matter human?\" one of the fairies asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we're just going to have a little fun with you.\" another one followed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe...

This time every time a fairy passed in front of your face she would blow a cloud of fairy dust onto you to shrink you more, and every fairy that passed behind your head took the opportunity to kick you in the back of the head with her tiny but surprisingly powerful feet. The fairies all giggled sadistically as they watched your size dwindle away, all while enjoying the expressions that were generated by their sisters' increasingly painful kicks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the fairies' kicks weren't that bad, just a minor pain in the back of your head. However, the smaller you got, the more these kicks began to seriously hurt you. Eventually you were crying in agony once again, begging for them to stop, but they just shook their heads and continued their torture. This went on for what felt like an eternity. One fairy was always in front of you blowing shrinking dust into your face, another one was always behind you kicking the back of your head with all her might, and throughout all of this all the fairies in between those two were constantly laughing and taunting you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you shrunk so small that the vines the fairies had tied you up with slipped right off, but even then there was no escape. Before you could even move two of the fairies broke formation and grabbed you tightly by your arms. It was here that you realized something that you had been suspecting for a while now; proportionally to their size, these fairies were significantly stronger than any human would be. Despite their delicate girlish frames and the fact that you were still more than twice their size, their strength was more than enough to hold you in place. Struggle as you might, you couldn't even hope to make them budge. Their arms that were so much smaller than your own had you completely overpowered. The fairies giggled once more as they felt your futile struggles cease, you submitting to their superior strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably didn't expect us to be this strong, did you little guy? It must hurt being so weak compared to a cute little fairy.\" the fairy on your left arm teased, squeezing your arm a little tighter and making you scream from the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just another benefit of fairy magic, buddy. Magic-enhanced strength. Nothing, not even a dragon girl, could match our strength at our size.\" The fairy on your right arm said as she leaned forward and licked a tear off of your cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! If we weren't so small, we would easily be the most powerful monster girls on the planet! I bet not even the Witch Queen herself would be able to stand up to us!\" The fairy in front of you said as she blew more shrinking dust into your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, much fun as it would be to be able to be able to grow and show everyone how much better we fairies are at everything, at least we can shrink down jerks like you and put you in your place when you don't show us the respect we deserve.\" The fairy behind you said as she kicked your head so hard that you felt like it was about to fall off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the fairy leader appeared in front of you once again. This time however, instead of just a pinch of fairy dust in her hand, she held two massive handfuls of the stuff. Your face paled in terror as you saw the amount of dust she was holding before your eyes. If just a little pinch of dust was enough to take an inch off of your height, you didn't even want to know what kind of effect this much dust would have on you. The fairy leader saw your expression and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you deserve this, right? You brought this upon yourself. None of this would even be happening right now if you hadn't been so mean to me before. You don't get to complain now that the tables have been turned and you're the one getting picked on. You're going to be the plaything of every fairy in this forest for the rest of your life, rather you like it or not. Now... Become a toy for us, human.\" The leader said as she lifted her hands above your head and poured all of the dust onto you at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, you began to shrink rapidly. Where seconds ago you were twice the size of these fairies, you were now dwindling away until you finally stopped shrinking at...</span></div></div>",

You're greeted with a view of her sex, but she quickly moves her hand so that your facing her ass cheeks. \"Oh NO\" you go pale as you realize what she's going to do. \"Oh YES!\" she said and using one hand to split her massive cheeks apart, you see her anus. \"This should help that attitude of yours.\" she said sadistically and shoved you up her anus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer intestine smelled like a dead body that baked in the sun for few days and was dug up out of the garbage. \"OH GOD.\" you cry as your able to taste the foul air everytime you breathed and puked inside her ass.

You had no idea how long that you were going to be imprisoned inside this sadistic fairy's ass, but you knew the only way you were getting out was when she let you out. So, playing nice for now, you waited without knowing that she was heading back towards her village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an unknown amount of time, you felt more than saw a giant wall of crap heading for you in the darkness. Crawling away, you pressed yourself against her anus and watched as the turd drew closer and closer to you. It was almost when it was on you when her anus opened up and you fell out into blinding daylight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding hard on the dirt, you saw your captress squatting above you. She smiled down at over the helm of her dress, then her face scrunched up and the turd you escaped from landed on you. Pulling yourself out of the crap, you realized that you were in a fairy village as fairies of every shape and size flew through the air over small houses embedded in the trees. Your attention snapped back to your captress as she stood back up towards you and said, \"Did your <i>little</i> punishment teach you some manner?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately kneeled and groveled, \"Yes mistress. I swear that I am a changed man and will do whatever you ask of your humble servant.\" You babbled on while a satisfied smile lit up her face but inside you were scheming your escape and possible attempts to avenge your trampled pride. Bowing with your head in the dirt, the fairy knelt and gently picked you up. Looking at her sweet face, you wouldn't have expected her earlier cruelty but she was a monster girl and you were her slave (for now). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe twisted her head away when she caught a whiff of you and your face grew red from embarrassment. \"You need a bath.\" she muttered and dropped you into a small pool of water. \"I want you spiff and shining by the time I get back or else you going back in with the filth.\" She gave her ass a smack and flew away while you washed yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered if now was the best time to escape, but the fairies flying around you would just immediately catch you. Suddenly you felt a small tremor and the surrounding fairies suddenly became frenzied. They were fleeing from something as the tremors grew stronger and stronger, but you could her something else and it sounded like someone was <i>moaning</i>? Your confusion was brief as you saw what was causing the tremors come crashing through the trees and entered the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you saw was a beautiful woman with horns, a pair of translucent wings, and covered in fur. A lesser succubus had invaded the village and you were just standing there gawking while she came hurtling towards you. You scrambled out of the way as she crushed the spot where you were just standing and continued to rampage across the village. You looked around to see the rest of the fairies had already left the village and you were still curse at a small size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the figure of the lesser succubus again, you realized that she was coming back. Before she reached you, her foot got caught in one of the fairies houses and she sailed over of you. Crashing into a tree, she laid limp and still as you cautiously approached her. She was out cold, but monster girls had a knack for recovering quickly and you were wary about her waking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawing closer, you realized how tiny you really were as she towered over you. On closer inspection, she was a complete beauty with soft, silky hair framing a sweet and innocent face of a young woman. Even though she looked like an angel, she could be as sadistic as the fairies that captured you and you weren't ready to be taken prisoner again. While you were thinking this, she starting stirring and an idea came to your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could possible hide the fur covering her or hide away before she woke up. </span></div></div>",

Rei, do you still have that collar? \", she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wait a minute, who said that you-\", before you could finish speaking, the big chested pink hair Imp grabs your hand then hugs your arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, no need to be soo mean Mr Hero, we only help you.\", <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu-\",<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could answer,  Rei quickly puts the collar on you, slightly strangling you as she tightens it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done Sarah.\", Rei says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now all that's left to do is remove the armour. \", <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, then begin to remove your armour. You don't have time to argue or change plans. You needed to trust them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you remove the armour, Sarah start tying up you hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey! \", you yell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sssh! Just trust me.\", she whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you can see the bushes a few meters away from you shuffle. You stay frozen, as the Imp carrys on binding you. You know something is in the bushes watching you. And it's most likely the Werewolf you heard howling before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes,  Sarah has finally finished tying you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Ash, you can come out.\", Sarah says happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your shock,instead of a massive Werewolf, another small blond hair Imp holding a horn dashes from the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow can't believe a human actually fell for it.\", she says laughing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I don't understand what is happening.\", <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember the 'Werewolves' ?  Well turned out it was just me blowing through this toy horn.\",<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, you realise you were tricked and was now completely vulnerable to these three Imps. They had literally tied you with your own rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, the pink haired big breasted Imp, yanks your hair and says ....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They actually are quite attractive, lightly tanned form the sun and slender.  Of course since Bunny Girls didn't wear shoes her soles were covered in dirt and dust.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lower your head and plant kisses on the top of her feet.  She giggles and coos in delight.

Brown Bunny Girl presents one of her filthy feet to your and you start to lick it clean.  The taste of dirt is quite disgusting but the natural pheromones a Bunny Girl's feet create still make it pleasurable.  In fact as you clean the dirt from her feet you start to enjoy what you are doing.  You shake your head trying to clear your thoughts.  You had a quest!  You couldn't fall for a Bunny Girl and be her foot slave for life!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Bunny Girl sees you try to focus your will and steps on your penis and ball sac with her powerful feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now stay still little man until you fall under my sister's spell!

If you tried to move she would crush your testicles... it would be as good as being castrated.  Maybe a high powered cleric type hunter could regenerate your fallen manhood but there was no guarantee.   And with such a debilitating blow it was doubtful you could escape anyway.  On the other hand Brown Bunny Girl looked surprised at her sister's statement.  Maybe she really was innocent.  Could you maybe plead with her for mercy?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you had to do something - you couldn't end your quest here!  </span></div></div>",

The musky scent of the brown girl\u2019s feet began driving you deeper and deeper into a trance as the skillful manipulation of your head by the white girl\u2019s toes melted your thoughts away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrown girl giggled as you stuck your tongue out as far as it would go, eagerly pressing it flat against the girl's soft sole. The zesty flavor overtook your senses as the white girl sat down on your legs, bringing both feet to rub up and down your solid shaft. Every time the soft skin of her feet rubbed against the tip, you felt a shock of pleasure crash through your body, the taste of the brown one's feet becoming further irresistible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw he's having so much fun!\u201d brown bunny squealed as she brought both hands up to her chest in joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it little adventurer, give into my sister's feet. She wants you after all, you should feel honored,\u201d white bunny cooed as she continued her ministrations. You couldn't help hut fully believe her words, the balls of her feet rougly grinding against the tip of your aching penis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giggling brown bunny girl kept dragging her sole along your exposed tongue, the toes coming to rest playfully along it. She gently wedged your tongue between her first two toes. The long appendages gripped your soft tongue like a vice, giving you a new but welcome taste of this beautiful girl's dirty feet. As the last vestiges of your free mind are destroyed you absently realize that the bunny girl's pheromones have kicked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose all will as you sit there fully receptive of this monster girl pair's treatment. As you edge towards climax you begin loyally slobbering all over the immensly adorable foot sitting on your face. The sight of the subtle wrinkles appearing as the girl scruched her toes into your messy hair furthered your hunger for their taste. Soon nothing mattered besides the foot spreading its brain melting flavor across your tongue and the dextrous toes flicking skillfully away at your manhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnconsciously your hips begin thrusting, sending your penis digging into the white girl's succulent soles. You think you hear the white one derisively laugh at your desperation but you focused on swirling your tongue around the soft heel nuzzled into your open maw. Through the cute toes, you occasionally caught glimpses of the adorable brown bunny's face. Her eyes seemed to have tears in them as she smiled gently down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe joy in her expression sent you over the edge. Unable to contain yourself anymore you blast your payload into the delicate feet of the white bunny girl as you moan into the tangy sole of the brown one. After several more thrusts, each one sending tense pleasure through your system. The white girl's skin pulled against your sensitive head as you did so. The brown bunny girl had begun laughing happily as she saw this occur, her eyes closed as tears fell down her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite bunny girl looked with a satisfied expression at her sister and back down to you where she had begun wiping your discharge into your cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrown bunny girl knelt down and grabbed you in an embrace while you basked in the afterglow before planting a deep kiss onto your lips. As her tongue slipped into your mouth, you felt yourself lose all sense of identity, the pheromones fully seizing your system. The girl backed away looking into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to your new life, my loving husband!\u201d she excitedly said as she hugged you again. Her breasts pressed against your chest, sending blood straight to your member yet again. You no longer wanted to move away from this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized that this was it. This was the end of your adventure. There was no way you could go on. To leave this happy girl after she had just accepted you into your life, and to never get a chance to lick her feet again, the thought was appalling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all your efforts, this pair of weak monster girls had seized controlnof your life, springing their trap all too easily. The remainder of your days were filled with near constant worship of brown girl's feet, but white girl had refused to meddle with the relationship since. With no one to pleasure your cock, you spent the next ten years licking and massaging your wife's feet with no release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agony of being unable to cum while enjoying her feet was overcome by the violent love you felt for them. Unable to release without them but never granted the right to was truly hell on earth, but you persevered all those years, just for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE END</span></div></div>",

It is obvious she is one of those that is not under the control of that witch you want to slay judging by her response. You suspect that due to she is extremely strong she was probably able to easily resist your nemesis' method of controlling monster girls. She could prove to be a very powerful ally and due to her strength could cause weaker monster girls to not bother you. In other words you may have a chance of taking down that witch. You decide to start off with, \"You must not like what that witch did to many monster girls huh?\" She said, \"Yeah she caused many monster girls like those bunny girls that attacked you to do stuff like that. Only the strongest ones like myself were able to shrug that off. Some lesser monsters also managed to resist somehow. I'm Magasame by the way, but you can call me Masa.\" You say, \"But first off could you get rid of the thorns on these vines?\" Masa said, \"Oh right forgot to do that!\" And she removed the thorns on the vines. She said, \"I admit that was impressive seeing you break free from those vines that silently. You are quite flexible aren't you?\" You nod and she says, \"You know, seeing how we have some things in common how about us get closer to each other? Besides don't you want to be the father of some of the strongest monster girls out there?\" You realized she was clearly interested in you. She continued with, \"I could tell you have some pretty good traits and abilities for someone that got trampled on like that. You may very well be the very person who can finally free this land of that witch. But as I can tell you don't know how to use your full potential at the moment. Not to worry I can spar with you so you can get to your full potential more easily.\" You realize that's an offer you can't refuse because of how you can quickly reach a level of power where you can more confidently feel you can take things on and be a father of some extremely powerful children can really turn the tides in your favor so you accept her offer and she says, \"Thanks now shall we get started? Which shall we do first? Make offspring or spar? The second choice I will go easy on you and as you get stronger I'll hold back less and less.\" You decide to choose...</span></div></div>",

Were you too late and everything was already over? Or did you somehow mange to arrive before the attack? Was that Earth Elemental lying? Was this all some sort of elaborate trap?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goodness! A traveler this late at night?\" a sudden voice broke you out of your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, you turn to face the speaker. If you had to describe her in one word, it would be filthy. Her clothes were tattered rags, her long hair was matted and frayed, and her skin was covered in dirt. The poor woman didn't even have any shoes!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not safe to be out this late.\" The woman's voice once again snaps you from you thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I know.\" You reply. \"Its just that earlier, I overheard a Monster Girl say there was going to be a huge attack on the village.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" The woman replied with a tilt of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't seem all that concerned.\" You point out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit of a long story. It would probably be better if we headed inside first.\" The woman says, \"My name is Anna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erik.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the introductions out of the way, Anna takes you to her home on the village out-skirts. It was an old rundown one-story shack. There were holes in the walls and a chunk of the roof was gone and covered with a single wooden board. The inside wasn't much better, as the building didn't have an actual floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It started about a year ago.\" Anna told you as she lit a candle, lighting up the old building. \"I used to be the best blacksmith in the village, and my husband was the finest warrior. Countless times Monster Girls attacked the village, and every time my husband fought them off using the weapons and armor I made him. All that changed when the Earth Elemental attacked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth Elemental?\" You interrupt, \"The one I saw didn't seem <i>that</i> bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it clearly wasn't the same one.\" Anna replies. \"This one had somehow made its way into the mine. We were all caught by surprised when she emerged from the tunnel. Our warriors fought bravely, but it was no use. We had no way to actually harm her.  She soundly defeated all of them. After the battle she had decided to claim my husband as her own. I pleaded for her to spare him; that he was my husband and that I couldn't bare to be without him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna stopped telling her story as she began to sob uncontrollably. Unsure of what to do, you awkwardly wrap your arms around her in what you hope is a comforting hug. Anna clings to you and buries her face in your shoulder. After several minutes she finally calms down but doesn't let go of you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She raped me.\" She says as she looks you in the eye. \"She raped me utterly and completely. I was helpless as she had her way with me. The next month she returned to show off what she did to my husband. She had fucked him senseless. His mind wiped blank from the constant sex. He couldn't even recognize me. And then she had him watch as she raped me again. He just stood there with a blissful look in his eye. She came back and did the same thing the next month, and the next month, and the next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what does that have to do with you not caring about the village.\" You ask, half out of curiosity and half not wanting her to go into hysterics again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They think I'm turning into a Monster Girl.\" Anna tells you. \"It started as a baseless rumor, but now I think there might be some truth to it. This dirt? It won't come off no matter how hard I scrub.  And whenever I get hungry I get these urges.\" Her stomach rumbles as if to emphasize the point<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urges?\" You ask as she leans in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To bed a man.\" She whispers into your ear. \"To tease a man with my butt. To have a man blow his load inside my anus. Normally, I can resist, but lately, its been getting harder and harder to find food; the villagers are trying to starve me to death. And now a young hero walks right into my home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kisses you. It was brief, but long enough for you to feel how soft and tender her lips are.</span></div></div>",

She gave your penis a little kiss before turning around and sticking her rear in the air. You finally came back to your senses and guided you member into her butthole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tight fit, and you let out a moan as her anus clamped down on your entire shaft. Slowly, you began to thrust in and out of her. Your penis quickly hardened, causing her anus to feel even tighter as it repeatedly squeezed your dick.

She squeezed and squeezed and squeezed; milking you of all your semen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exhaustion and the orgasms were too much for you and you passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up some time later on the dirt floor of Anna's shack.

My newfound charisma, intelligence, wisdom, strength, dexterity, agility, constitution and of course luck should not only allow me to consider fighting enemies I wouldn't dare try to before, but also ensure I can probably be far more likely to gain new allies and become able to talk to people that would've once scoffed at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Anna left the ruins and she said, \"So Erik?

Several times you thought you saw movement out of the corner of you eye, but you never found anyone else out and about this late.

The bed had been surprisingly pleasant to rest in, and it almost lured you back to sleep with it's comfort, but you willed your groggy self up. You dressed yourself back into your normal (and only) set of clothes, rearmed yourself and gathered the remainder of your things, not forgetting Molly's letter, before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning passed as you planned it would: you sent Molly's letter, had managed to grab a decent sword from the armoury for a respectable price, still holding on to your wooden one as well just incase something arose, and were currently slipping through the crowds to the docks with a slight spring in your step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the tiniest sense of achievement in your heart that the day had, so far, went so well. All that remained now was to board a ship to Joyeuse, the port city closest to where the capital (and with it, the Witch Queen) rested. If it costs as much as you've heard it would, you should still have plenty of money to spare after you've bought a ticket. Sighing slightly while recalling some of your many dreams of slaying the evil queen and becoming a great hero, you hoped the rest of your journey went as well as it had so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawing closer to port, you notice a rather large group of (what you believed to be) adventurers like yourself has gathered outside a large, old and prestigious church. Curiosity getting the better of you, you take a small detour from your registered path and walk up to the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" You manage to get the attention of a girl about your age with long golden hair \"What are you guys doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl turns to face you completely, her amber eyes accompanying the bright smile she gives you \"Haven't you heard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" You don't think you would be asking if you did \"No, I haven't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mayor's giving a huge reward for getting rid of a monster girl that's held up in the old place.\" She glances over her shoulder and points to the church \"But, from what we've gathered, she's a <i> real </i> tough one. So we're gonna take her together and split the reward. It's so much money you could split it a hundred ways and it'd still make your eyes bulge.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rest a hand on your chin \"Do you know how she got in the church in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs \"Beats me honestly.\" She retrieves her spear from it's position of leaning against a wall \"I just want some money and a good fight!\" Her smile gains a cocky layer to it and fire flares in her eyes \"You wanna join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe promise of money is certainly enticing, and the chance to fight a strong monster girl, with the help of others, would definitely give you some experience for when you'd probably have to fight one solo. But it could possibly take all day, so you might have to get another inn room tonight and put your voyage on hold for a few days.                           </span></div></div>",

Small clusters of citizens stand a step away, each individual listening to the conversation taking place past the row of bodies and forming their own stories. With your old friend curiosity tickling your nose, you find a suitable spot and push onto your tiptoes to see over the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMermaids, armoured in designs you've never seen before, float in tight formations around the piers. The different sizes, from that of ten year olds to small houses, and the different types, you make out sharks and dolphins and whales but there's probably more, plus the large number of them adds to your theory they're here for something important. From what you've heard of them, different types of mermaid don't usually come together unless order to by the so called 'Sea Ruler', or something similar.              <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large, sharply dressed bear-of-a-man stands the closest to the water, before a particularly viscous looking shark mermaid. It's easy to guess these are the two arguing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just cut off our main trade routes! You'll run everyone here into the ground! Or worse: under it!\" The man tugs on his neatly trimmed facial hair as he continues squabbling with the monster girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut yer face, already!\" The shark snaps back \"Ruler's nice enough to provide all ya with plenty o' food if finding them takes to long, so ye'll only starve if the want to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they're not here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're here all right!\" She sharply points to a large, ghostly looking boat on the rightmost pier, currently blocked in by a whale mermaid and three killer whale mermaids \"That's their ship or am blind! The hag on your kingdom's throne's played 'er part, now ya play yers and we'll be gone, simple as!\" She crosses her arms defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, who you've figured is the mayor, groans before starting up the anger-filled conversation again, riling up the shark mermaid again by doing so. Tired, you shuffle forward and tap on of the guards on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" You whisper. The man turns his head to catch a look at you, but this body stays firmly in position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently, a group of monster girls stole something important from the Sea Ruler, so her army's looking for their hides. She made an agreement with the Witch Queen to find the thieves, and it seems that their ships been found here so...\" He turns his head back to the docks, but continues on \"Queen's forces will catch them if they leave the city by land and the Ruler's will catch them if by sea, but they want them found as quickly as possible. Most of the able people are trying to get that other monster girl out the church, and us guards of got to keep an eye on the Queen's and Ruler's groups, so there's no one to really look for -.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it.\" You cut him off quickly. You can't leave until this mess is cleared it seems, so you may as well do something useful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't ya be as offerin' as that kid!\" The shark mermaid seems to have over heard. Her eyes: scleras black, iris's red and pupils white lock themselves onto you, and she drifts to her left side to appear straight ahead of you. \"If ye and yer guards we're as offerin' as 'is kid, 'is'd be sorted in a instant.\" She beckons you with a finger \"Come here, boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards hesitate slightly before parting to let you through, and you, hesitantly yourself, slower draw closer to her. Her hair is short, but wild and sharp, and composed of two tones: a dark blue at the front and top, and a light blue, almost white, at the sides (and presumably back). Her armour is more stylised than the other mermaids's: it's metals are a dark blue, and yellow 'x' is painted on it just above where her heart should be. You catch her sharp, pearly whites as she grins at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to a stop just before the cold stone ends, you ask her \"...Who are you looking for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a few, but'll only give ya one to not be a hassle to ya'.\" She whips out a wrapped up piece of paper from somewhere you don't see and hands it to you. It's... somehow dry. You unwrap it, revealing it's a wanted poster. \"The captain o' those stupid thieves: Elizabeth! She's a dog girl. Bring 'er, or anyone from 'er crew if the find 'em, here and the reward's yers.\" You finish scanning the image on the poster and return your sights to the shark girl, just in time to catch her checking you out. She gives a seductive look when her eyes meet yours again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now get!\" She signals you off. You comply, though you don't like the feeling of her eyes checking out the rest of you before you pass through the guard's line and back into the city. A fair distance away, you stop and think of where Elizabeth and/or any of her group could be hiding.                     </span></div></div>",

It's said she rarely leaves the shrine and rarely interacts with anyone besides her shrine maidens, so no one really knows her personality, but the rare tales of meeting her tell that she's very graceful and beautiful. <br>\r\nAs for the shrine maidens, you hear they're a variety of attractive Monster Girls who loyally guard the Ryu and the shrine to the best of their abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you think, where to? </span></div></div>",

Wildly, it kicked and flailed and growled angrily at it\u2019s capture: the Ultimate Monster Girl, who stood as a shield between you and the bound monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour protector turned her head around to look at you. \u201cEscape\u2026\u201d She softly muttered around her outstretched and preoccupied tongue. \u201cUs\u2026 <i>Together</i>\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lips couldn\u2019t help but curl into a small smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d Dr. Kiss and Cum, on the other hand, clearly wasn\u2019t pleased by these developments. \u201cYOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THIS!\u201d She screeched at her disobedient creation. \u201cYOU ARE MINE! I MADE YOU AND SO YOU WILL OBEY ME!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ultimate Monster Girl glared over at the woman in the stand. Then, with a flick of the tongue, sent the Cerberus flying towards one of the arena walls. Her three faces smacked loudly into the stone, and slowly she slumped to the ground, stars swirling in her unconscious eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast dealt with for the moment, the victorious creation dashed towards the stands with incredible speed, easily clearing the distance thanks to her powerful bunny legs. A single flap of her harpy wings was all it took to let her soar up off the ground, looming high over Dr. Kiss and Cum before descending upon the madwoman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no you don\u2019t!\u201d The doctor cried as she whipped out a small remote. \"I'll have you both torn apart before you can even think of escaping!\" With a sinister smirk, her finger came down on one of the device's many buttons.</span></div></div>",

The doctor says, \"What have you done?!\" Upon seeing her hands turn to stone. Her creation says with a mocking tone, \"Thanks to the medusa part of me, I've decided to turn you into stone because I had enough of your games. Sayonara Dr cum.\" Dr cum says with a screech, \"Youll pay for thiiiisss....\" As her body finished turning to stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The ultimate monster girl said, \"Now that that's done how about we bust out of here together?\" You were surprised that she started speaking properly very quick. You then figured that her mind probably had the intelligence of a kappa as well. Right as you finished that thought she grabbed you and put you into some sort of pouch that was a part of her body, right under her breasts. You said, \"Seeing how you are considered to be the ultimate monster girl you need a very fitting name that suits you. I know the perfect name, Magasame or Maga for short.\" The now named Maga said, \"I like that name. Now let's bust out of here.\" You decided to relax since the pouch managed to go up to your shoulders. Due to her speed Maga managed to escape with you in tow in only a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think, \"Phew! Not going in that place again, but it was worth it since I have Magasame on my side who is supposed to be the most powerful monster girl yet. Maybe I can fight the witch queen, no I need to get stronger first, way stronger.\" Just then you realize how thirsty you are. Thankfully Maga managed to find a cave on a cliff at the time you realized that. You say, \"Maga, I'm rather thirsty, can I drink your milk?\" She said, \"Of course. But I do need semen to keep myself sated so how about we have intercourse as you do so?\" You knew there was going to be a catch but this one was reasonable so you decided to go for it. It was then you found out why her breasts were huge, they were the result of minotaur dna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you and Maga finished up with sex and she saw how tired you were so she put you back into her pouch. She said, \"Good night,\" as she opened a hole inside her pouch where your penis went inside so she could continue to have your semen as you slept. Her heartbeats that you could hear helped you sleep as she made her way somewhere. When you finally woke up you saw...</span></div></div>",

The Ultimate Monster Girl was intercepted before she reached her creator by a Lamia with two sets of leathery wings. The two unnatural Monster Girls crashed into the arena floor as your ally struggled to get free from the coils of her ambusher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could try and help, you were rushed by another experiment: a Cat Girl whose arms had been replaced by the giant limbs of a grizzly. She wore a dazed expression as drool slipped out of her mouth. With a heavy handed swing, she sent you flying across the battlefield. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour unwanted flight sent you skidding across the ground. You stopped in front of a Centaur, whose horse legs had been replace with rabbit legs. She immediately reared back and tried to stomp on your face with her soft feet. You managed to roll out of the way in time and quickly scrambled to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA croak drew your attention skyward. The source was a modified Frog Girl who leapt into the air.  At the peak of her jump, her ass inflated, tripling in size. Her big bubble butt was heading straight for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blindly dove out of the way and collided with a wall of firm yet soft flesh. The impact knocked you on your ass. You looked up to see a <u><i><b>massive</b></i></u> pair of breasts. The titanic tits were so large that you couldn't even look past them to see the woman they were attached to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a nervous gulp as the released experiments surrounded you. \"That's it, babies!

She looked to see a pair of gargantuan knockers slam themselves atop you, trapping you between them with only your head and feet still exposed. Her eyes widened in fear as she watched the other experiments close in on their captured prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 Don\u2019t\u2026!\u201d She cried, a weak and desperate plea. The other Monster Girls either didn\u2019t hear her or didn\u2019t care, as leaned down to assault what they could of the boy, hungrily lapping and licking away at the exposed flesh. You could only let out a muffled whimper as the owner of the mighty mounds encasing you \u2013 revealed to be a cow girl with three long tongues \u2013 forced her slimy organs into your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lamia let out a hissy laugh in her ear. \u201cSssssshush, you <i>traitor</i>. This is what you two get for trying to betray the master. Now be a good girl and watch. Then, <i>maybe</i>, the master will let you have a turn with him\u2026 after <i>I\u2019m</i> through with him, of coursssssse!\u201d With another sadistic laugh, the Lamia squeezed her captive tighter, electing a gasp of pain from the ensnared girl. Then she cast her gaze towards the pile of lustful monsters. Stupid creatures, of far lower intelligence than her, they couldn\u2019t figure out how to get to the rest of boy\u2019s body submerged beneath cow\u2019s tits, all of them too greedy and overwhelmed with primal desire to get the cow girl off. If she was lucky, <i>she</i> would end up being the first to take his virginity. She licked her lips at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 said\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnake eyes flung back to her captive, head down and limp within her coils. \u201cWhat wassssss that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head shot up, her wild green hair flung sharply with the movement, and her eyes snapped open into a glare of pure, unfettered rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 said\u2026 <i><b>DOOOOOOOONN\u2019T!</b></i>\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was piercing scream that sent the Lamia reeling, a sonic blast that tore its way painfully into her eardrums. Coils came undone as the Lamia flung herself away, wings clamped over her ears as she tried to stop the pain assaulting her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree from her bindings, the Ultimate Monster Girl turned her raging voice towards the group atop you. She knew it would hurt you as well, but she needed to act fast before the Lamia recovered. You closed your eyes and braced yourself as the noise drilled into your skull and the skulls of your attackers. The crowd quickly dispersed as the sound bore down upon them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll, except for the cow girl, who was stuck, unable to lift up her unbearably heavy breasts. The Ultimate Monster Girl helped her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy kicking her in the face, sending her careening off you and across the arena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe undeniably soft weight lifted off you, you open your eyes. You can\u2019t hear anything but a sharp ringing, but you can clearly see your partner above, tears streaming down her face as she keeps saying something. Slowly, the ringing fades, and you can hear her loud and clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u2026 Sorry\u2026!\u201d Is what she softly cries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply smiled up at her. \u201cIt, ah\u2026 It\u2019s okay\u2026\u201d You say, and rest a hand comfortingly on her wing. She smiled back down happily at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came grunts from the other monster girls in the arena. They were beginning to rise to their feet (or tails) as they recovered from the ringing as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s\u2026 get out of here.\u201d You weakly say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ultimate Monster Girl nods and, after placing you on her back, with her fox tail curled around you for extra safety, takes flight. This time, her target is not Dr. Kiss and Cum, who is still recovering from the sonic scream, but a window at the opposite end of the arena. She soars towards it, bunny legs primed into into a drop kick, and the\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs the first thing Dr. Kiss and Cum hears once the ringing has subsided. She glances towards to source of the noise, eyes widening as she finds a broken window. Anger swells in her heart. \u201cWhat was I thinking giving her the ability to sonic scream?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet them, my darlings!\u201d She screams towards her experiments below, and points towards the broken window. \u201cDon\u2019t let them escape!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the mansion halls, the Ultimate Monster Girl sprints through corridor after corridor. That paining looks familiar. Hadn\u2019t she just been down this way? Her bunny legs might let her go fast and far, but they\u2019re no help with not getting lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-There!\u201d You say, pointing to the giant window at the end of the next hall. \u201cThat looks like it leads outside!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour companion nods, and takes off down it. In only a few seconds, the distance was closed, and after another powerful drop kick, the pair of you find yourselves\u2026</span></div></div>",

Gum Girls were a sub-species of Slime Girls who, at the cost of being slower when it came to moving and shifting shape, were made of a much tougher and stickier substance while also being far more resistance to magic. Tales of gigantic Gum Girls told of entire cities and countless people easily being swallowed up in their viscous bodies, never to be seen again, as they giggled all the while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith sword alone, you highly doubt you could possibly take her, especially when she\u2019s already glued to your back.

A surprisingly clean white coat covers her upper body, buttoned up in such a way that exposes as much of her cushiony cleavage as possible. Large, circular glasses are stuck to her eyes, and through the reflective glass you see a simple pair of black eyes staring directly into yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you're boxed in on both two sides, as well as above, with your back and sword firmly gripped by a large blob that is her lower half, you're definitely at the Goo Girl\u2019s mercy.

Ancient stones, battered and stained with dirt and time, littered the track alongside the river, the last remaining remnants of the once cherished and holy road of long ago. A few sparse, wrecked pillars occasionally passed you by as you trekked onwards. Most had been reduced to little more than stubs of rock, but some were still standing, looking as if they would crumble in the faintest breeze. A forgotten language decorated these surviving obelisks, but even if you had the ability to understand it, the words had been smudged and worn by the might of the passing years \u2013 and the few that had endured had seemingly been scared and scratched, as if something wished they be forgotten as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that seemed untouched by the decay were stone lanterns that split the path and the river from the forest. Each and every one sat alight, nesting within their tops a gentle blue flame. These unnatural flames did not dance nor diminish when the wind rushed across the dusty path, like any normal flame would surely do. They simply burned away contently, oblivious and ignorant to the actions of the world around them. Curious, you brought an open palm close to one of the flames. They radiated heat, just like a normal fire, but seeping into your hand was also a strange, overwhelming feeling of euphoria. It felt good beyond words; so good that you almost wanted to just snuggle up with the lantern and never leave. Thankfully, you snapped yourself out of it, and pulled away from the warmth. You figure these obviously magic flames must part of defense system to keep Monster Girls from attacking anyone intending to visit the shrine. Best not to get too close again \u2013 least you end up cuddling with a rock for the rest of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that farther ahead, after stomping up a slight incline, you spot a waterfall careening down from a gigantic mountain in the not too distant distance, the source of the river you were following. And below that, a small stone bridge connects the path to a certain large compound: the shrine! Vigor renewed at the sight of your goal, you break into a sprint and speed down the slope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop to catch a quick breath when you reach the bridge. Looking across it, you see a figure at the entrance to the shrine. You ready yourself, wrapping a prepared hand on the handle of your sword, and advance, feeling the cold clack of your shoes against stone with every careful step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s when your halfway over that you can clearly make out what exactly the figure is.

A broken sword, it's remaining blade barely that of a dagger's, rests within her left hand. She is certainly shapely and beautiful, but you won't let that cloud your judgement. Her yellow eyes survey her visitors, and when they catch you a chill rides down your spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe church's door loudly slams itself shut.

You can't do anything about the advancing angel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But do not worry...\" The angel, wings curled back into their resting positions, comes to a stop before you, and lifts a hand to feel your cheek.

Her eyes closed and her breathing gentle, you and your group guess she's asleep and advance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get about two steps forward before her eyes burst upon and her head snaps up. Her amber eyes gloss over the group of armed humans before her, meeting your's for a brief moment, before they shrink in fear to go along with the terrified look upon her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer back loses touch with the alter, her tails slowly draw themselves away her lap and your sure you see her muscles tense.

The silence that haunts the church hall is deafening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bang from upstairs, most likely the archer team, startles your group, and the fox girl takes her chance. She's on her feet in a instant, then springs into the air, backflipping across the alter. The millisecond she hits the floor, landing on her feet perfectly, she dashes to the door on her left and smashes through with amazing strength, speeding off deeper into the church. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you all a few seconds to recover from the monster girl's incredible exit. When you do, most of the group expresses relief that a brawl did not ensue, while Jeanne huffs with disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A two-tailed Kitsune? All that money for <i> a two-tailed Kitsune! </i>\" She crosses her arms in anger and scowls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we be happy?\" You tell her \"An easy job for a lot of money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Erik! It's supposed to be challenging so that we can get stronger!\" She responds, tapping the butt of her spear on the floor. You give small nod in agreement. If you didn't get stronger then you'd never reach the Witch Queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Jeanne!\" You and Jeanne are ripped from your little conversation bubble by a new voice from upstairs. Looking to it's source, you see rather built man with a fedora on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Justin?\" Jeanne replies to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up!

You enter a room similar to the first room, but it's much colder and darker. Before you can get the best look around, your partner tackles you into the shadows.

The bumps seemed to have stopped entirely, but you the occasional creaks of the wooden floor as you draw nearer the bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the stairs end, you quickly nip into the shadow the wall provides against the ground floor's candle light and let your back gently touch it's form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully peak out to see the inn owner...                            </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I take it everything is in place, yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA seductive, yet threatening female voice comes from the hooded figure before the innkeeper. Her dark violet robe covers up most of her body, highlighting her shapely form while also hiding it, and her black cloak seems attached to it solely by the grey fur draped across her shoulders. While her hood guards most of her head from your sight, you can see a small smile on her purple-coated lips, along with a few locks of light blue hair and her pale skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her stands six people, each one hidden by a different coloured cloak. You can at least make them all out to be female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next one closest to the innkeeper wears a sandy-brown colour, and prodding out from it, at around waist level, is - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- the body of a scorpion. You quietly gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I've set up everything like you asked me to.\" The innkeeper responds, causing the smile on the woman's lovely lips to grow \"What do you want me to do now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, simply run this place as you normally would, but be <i>absolutely sure</i> to keep people away from the basement.\" She waves a hand to the other members of her group, who all proceed to and down a door you guess leads to the basement. Save for the Scorpion Girl, who stands firmly at the her side. \"But I guess...\" She puts a hand to her chin and is silent for a moment before continuing \"... if, perhaps, a decent male who no one would miss were to stay here for the night, could you inform us of him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe innkeeper nods in silent obedience, and you see gears turning in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. That will be all. Thank you for all you've done.\" She concludes and moves herself to the downwards stairs, her right-hand scorpion-woman following behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Morgen, wait.\" The innkeeper's voice stops the two in their tracks. They both turn in your direction to look at him, so you pull your head completely behind the wall as quickly as you. Your sight of them gone, you listen as intensely as you can. \"There was a young lad today...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh</i>?\" The voice of the woman, you now know as Morgen, in tinted with curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An new adventurer, most likely, considering what he was armed with...\" Your fingers scrape into the wall as the innkeeper speaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what room is this young adventurer staying in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe innkeeper gives them a room number. <i>Your room number</i>. 'Oh no...' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serket.\" Morgen must be speaking to the Scorpion Girl now \"Go and bring the boy down to us. We'll see if he strikes any of our fancies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Serket's response, and the advancing tapping of her scorpion legs against the floor fills you with so much fear. You gaze around frantically, desperate for anywhere to hide. A Scorpion Girl isn't something even the most experienced monster slayer could take on easily, and you're hardly experienced. Underneath the stairs is the only option you have right now. So you take it: rushing to it and staying as quiet as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe patter of her heading up on the stairs above sends chills down your spine. Eventually they become too quiet to hear, so at least she's away for now. Slowly and quietly, you push back the door and peek out, just in time to see Morgen's back disappear down the to the basement and the innkeeper pass into a back room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently ponder how to go about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing after the innkeeper seems somewhat pointless: he's clearly a small fry compared to the other two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving was a definite no-go: the inn doors would no doubt be locked, so you'd need to swipe them off the innkeeper or find them, and wasting time doing that when a Scorpion Girl is after you is very unwise. Not to mention the streets at night are crawling with Imps and other Monster Girls: doing all that work just to get molested and raped on the streets is unappealing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing down to the basement after Morgen, possibly finding out what she's up to, sounds more productive. But you can't forget that you don't know what she's capable of: she could, and probably would, have many powerful tricks up her sleeves. Not to mention that the rest of the group is also down there, and heaven knows what they're capable of themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmbushing Serket, if successful, would drop the basement group's numbers down to six, and you won't have to worry about her ambushing you in the basement. But if not, if you fail or she sees you first, it's pretty much over: she'd be on you instantly, and there's not a snowball's chance in hell you'd beat her in a straight fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have much time left. You decide to... </span></div></div>",

Reaching the top of the basement stairs, you sneak a glance at both the door to the back room and the arch you had just crossed over from. With no current sign of the innkeeper or Serket returning, you start your descent. Hopefully there'd be somewhere to hide at the bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinking deeper with each gently step, you find this stairway to be far different than the one that leads upwards. The space struck you first: while the other's stairwell was wide and changed direction along the way, the walls of this one hugged it almost suffocatingly-tight and forced it to stay on a straight path. Next, you found, was the material: cleanly carved wood had met with your feet multiple times on your first descent of the night, but here all you felt beneath your soles was cold stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you see light, signalling the end of this cold descent and the beginning of the basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final step passes under your feet, and you quickly search out a place to hide. All you find is a large wooden box casting a deep shadow from the light, so you take it and dart behind it as safely as you can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to recover, then lightly poke out to see Morgen and three others at a table, just under a lamp embedded in the wall. The one closest to her wears a white coat, while the other two wear a green one and a blue one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgen and the female in the white cloak discuss something you can't hear from this position, but from the look of things, Morgen hardly seems happy with her. You watch them argue from the darkness for a good while, till Morgen finally seems to have had enough and storms off, taking Blue Cloak with her. White Cloak seems to simply shrug before twirling around, wandering off in the opposite direction with Green Cloak in tow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure it'd be best to keep an eye on one pair so they don't ambush you later, and maybe they might even lead you to something important. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo: left, after Morgen and Blue Cloak, or right, after White Cloak and Green Cloak? </span></div></div>",

Ahead of you Morgen stomps along the stone floor, clearly frustrated over that squabble back there. The figure in the blue cloak makes no effort to keep pace with her and simply follows behind her slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn that brat!\u201d Morgen barks angrily as she comes to stop, allowing her companion to catch up. The witch paces back and forth and nibbles at her thumbnail. \u201cShe should have more faith in me. I\u2019m the one you got this plan off the ground!\u201d She huffs and crosses her arms. She reminds you more of a spoiled child than a cunning witch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve hit a few snags here and there, sure.\u201d She turns completely towards the wearer of the blue cloak, who has now caught up with her. Though she\u2019s looking in your direction she thankfully doesn\u2019t notice you, both due to the shadows concealing your presence and her attention being focused solely on her companion\u2019s face. \u201cBut now\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out to the smaller figure, Morgen pulls down her hood. Curly red hair spills out and flops down to her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen. No, it can\u2019t be\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgen cups the girls chin with one hand and runs a finger along their check with the other. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve got you, my perfect little sacrifice\u2026\u201d You see the witch\u2019s lips curl into a nefarious smile and an evil glint shines through her hidden eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s all within our reach!\u201d With her joyous exclamation, she twirls the girl, like they\u2019re dancing. You get a brief look at the girl\u2019s face in the dimly-lit corridor. At a familiar pair of forest green eyes, now surrounded by unnatural purple scleras, and the zombie-like expression on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fear is confirmed; it\u2019s Molly, and she\u2019s under the control of some sort of spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grit your teeth. Blood boils with anger and your grip tightens on your wooden sword, threatening to splinter it into pieces. Your soul demands you attack the witch right now. With all her cohorts, you might not get a better chance than this. But your mind intervenes. You have no idea what Morgen is capable of. What possible good could a wooden sword do against her? What if she puts you under the same spell as Molly with a snap of her fingers? What if she uses Molly as a human shield and you accidentally hurt her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair begins moving again.

You block it with your wooden sword, which starts to glow and shrink into something smaller under the effects of the spell. You toss it aside and charge on, managing to close the distance before the surprised witch could fire off another one. Grabbing her face, you use all your force and momentum to push her against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head makes contact with a sickening crack! But it\u2019s not enough to knock her unconscious. \u201cY-you!\u201d Morgen snarls like a wild animal. \u201cYOOOUUU!\u201d She tries to aim at you again but the impact has made her delirious, giving you enough time to pin the taller woman and her arms to the wall. You\u2019re honestly quite surprised it was actually this easy to detain her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing against her like this, you see her face clearly now as you catch your breath.

With only his nose free to breathe, he falls out of your sight behind the inn's desk with muffled protests and a quiet thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You raid my tomb, snatch away many of my prized possessions, steal my <i>very sarcophagus</i>, and you <i>don't</i> even know my name? How more insulting can you be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pure power in her voice sends a chill down your back. You take in what you can of her appearance from this angle: dark skin, dark purple hair that passes her hips, revealing black clothes, lots of exotic gold and blue jewellery, bandages coating her wrists and lower legs. A staff of gold and sapphire rests in her right hand, and a large red cobra with piercing blue eyes keeps itself close to her. Her very atmosphere makes you uneasy to the core. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at the two females behind her. Besides their eyes and mouths, they're covered in lose bandages. From the crooked way they're standing, the empty look in their eyes and the agape mouths, you can easily tell they're Mummies. But the only thing that can create and control Mummies is... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Pharaoh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour uneasiness transforms itself into full-on fear, and you grip your wooden sword tighter as you turn your attention back to the Pharaoh, who has made a seat for herself on the desk. Now you can see her ruby red eyes and ample breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer snake disappears for a moment behind her desk, and soon surfaces with a book in it's mouth for it's master. She takes it, rewarding the reptile with a gently rub of the head, before opening it and flipping through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn uncomfortable silence slowly passes as you watch the Pharaoh intently, the only noises being the distant snoring of other inn guests above and the mouth-breathing of the Mummy Girls. The Pharaoh soon finishes the book with a loud snap and rests her chin on the back of her hand, her eyes closed and a gentle smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry if I'm boring you, young hero.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her words enter your ears, she opens her eyes and locks gazes with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart almost stops in terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need to spy on me. If you want answers, come out and ask.\" The warm smile never leaves her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly glance around, and find the snake and the Mummy Girls are also staring at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, come out of the shadows...\" She beckons you with a finger \"Or must I drag you out myself?\" </span></div></div>",

Knowing full well that you most likely won't speak up without some encouragement,<br>\r\nthe woman speaks up. \"You must be getting quite a few splinters in your chest with the way you're hugging that hunk of wood.\" the woman says with a bit of a giggle as you look down and realize that you're not holding your sword anymore, instead you've been hugging it close to your chest like a stuffed bear!<br>\r\n\"I-uh I'm s-sorry for staring at you earlier, Ma'am.\" you finally manage to stutter out, trying to be as polite as possible so you don't end up losing your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright dear, I made quite a bit of noise. I'm surprised I didn't wake up the rest of the people here.\" The woman adjusts herself in her seat a bit before speaking further, her breasts happily bouncing as she does. \"So I assume you want to know why I just mummified the innkeeper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh if it's not too much trouble for you, yes please.\" The woman laughs a bit at your response. \"So you're as polite as you are cute! I like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here because this man has stolen not only my sarcophagus, but a number of treasures that are quite important to me. His book lists the items he stole, but not where they were hidden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown a bit. If someone stole your bed and various other things important to you, you'd probably want to find the person who stole them too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if you figured it out young man, but I'm not entirely human. I'm a Pharaoh, and I rule over the desert not far from here. Without my Sarcophagus, my powers are much more limited. And without my powers, my control over the desert weakens. And that means it will soon descend into chaos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was why she was so angry. Your hero senses quickly push aside the fear and a memory hits you. You saw something glinting underneath the floorboards in your room, underneath your bed. \"I'm sorry about what happened to you, but I think I might know where some of your stuff is...\" you mutter out as you're still in deep thought. The woman's eyes widen a bit as she leans forward. \"Really? And where might it be young man?\" she asks as her snake also leans forward with a bit of a hiss. \"I saw something glittering under the floorboard underneath my bed. My room is the last one to the right upstairs.\" you say as you point towards the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman lets out a hum as she clicks her fingers. Her two mummy servants quickly rush up the stairs, one of them picking up her snake as they trudge along. The woman then gets out of her seat and walks over to you, intimidated you back up a little but end up hitting a wall. \"Don't be afraid child, I just want to get a better look at the young man who's trying to help me.\" she says with a coo as she inspects you. \"I don't believe I ever introduced myself, my name is Akila.\" she says as she bends down so that her face lines up with yours. You resist the urge to look down her robes as you let out a small smile in return. \"My names Erik.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the conversation continues, a loud thunking noise alerts both of you as the mummies carry down a large golden sarcophagus. Akila's eyes light up as she walks over to her sarcophagus and hugs it. She turns back to you and walks back over, quickly snatching you up into a hug. \"Thank you Erik! With your help I can stop worrying!\" You zone out a bit as your face is pushed against Akila's large breasts. After a few moments, you attempt to pull away from Akila but her grip on you is very tight. Akila lowers her head a bit and purrs into your ear \"If you don't mind Erik, I would like to reward you for your devotion and help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can respond, you feel something slither up your leg and quickly make its way onto your shoulder. You quickly realize that this is Akila's cobra, as it sinks its teeth into your shoulder. You let out a yelp which is stifled between Akila's breasts. \"Sorry dear, that was just a little something to help you relax.\" Akila says as you begins to feel your legs give out on you. You feel yourself quickly pulled forward as Akila drags both of you into her Sarcophagus, the lid shutting quickly behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkila hugs you tighter against her as she begins to undress you, the venom from her snake leaving only your head moveable. Akila begins to undress herself shortly after undressing you, both of your clothing falling to the bottom of the sarcophagus. You feel a shift in movement as the container begins to move. \"Don't mind them, Erik. They are simply transporting us back to my home.\" Akila says as she begins to fondle your member. After getting you hard, she finally begins to have sex with you, wrapping her legs around you tightly before she begins thrusting you into her almost madly. If you could think clearly right now, you would probably guess that Akila has been physically starved for quite a long time given how she's acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkila pushes your head deep into her left breast, her finger snaking between them to pry your mouth open. A nipple quickly replaced the finger and you take that as your cue to begin sucking. Under the relentless assault, you begin to orgasm multiple times in short order, something that must be a product of either the venom or Akila's own magic. Before long you finally give in to fatigue and pass out, Akila showing no signs of stopping even afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly wake up, a warmth embracing you as your eyes are met with the same dark skin as last night. You move your eyes around a bit to see red silk covering you and Akila, who is asleep and hugging you closely to her. You look around the room a bit more to see the same sarcophagus you were trapped in earlier leaning against a wall inside of what appears to be a tomb. From your knowledge, ancient tombs were generally just stone corridors leading into stone rooms decked with artifacts and gold, but this room appeared no different from any other persons room. A bed, a stone desk with a mirror on it, and a bathroom a short ways away with a large hotspring inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Royalty sure has it nice...\" you groggily think to yourself as Akila begins to stir. Her eyes flutter open as she hugs you tighter to herself. \"Glad to see you're awake, Erik dear.\" she yawns. \"I hope my reward was to your liking. Perhaps maybe you'd like another round?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much fun as sex is, you contemplate whether you should try to get some answers out of Akila or accept her offer.</span></div></div>",

You do your best to keep the foot out of your mouth, which further confuses the young bunny. \"H-Here.\" She softly states after sitting down.

I don't...umm...\" The young bunny girl struggled to come up with a good excuse for her absence, she could barely maintain eye contact with her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The older bunny girl's eyes suddenly set on you and you practically shiver under the gaze of the more experienced hunter.

That lasts for about a second before the older sisters foot is on your face, you can see her predator like glare from between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't stay here, we have to make our way back to the warren before nightfall.\" One look at her younger sisters face tells her all she needs to know. \"If you want to bring your catch with us he'll need to be asleep for the trip, we can't risk him escaping and telling the other humans where we're hiding.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, I think I remember how to do this.\" The young bunny girl reaches into a little pouch that hung from a leather belt that you now notice she wore. From it she obtained a strange looking berry that you have never seen before. She pulls one leg close to her and carefully places the berry between her toes before moving her foot back over your face. After the sisters rub their feet on your for a little bit you are back under their spell and gladly let the berry holding toes into your mouth.

You observe the warren the first time as few have ever seen one up close before...few who weren't caught by bunny girls anyways. It like a large camp in the middle of the woods with huts of varying sizes scattered among the trees. No building was a permanent structure though, they were made to be disassembled and moved whenever the warren needed to escape from anything that threatened them. Refocusing you notice that you are coming up on a hut that looks bigger than the sisters home you were just in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are pushed through the door you see why, this building seems like some sort of jail or a holding place for unowned prey in your case. However your eyes are more drawn to a third bunny girl, who looks to be about the same age as the two that brought you in, looking rather bored as she leaned back in a chair with her feet propped up on the table in front of her. Her eyes immediately lit up and a smile appeared on her face as you were brought in front of the table she was sitting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, they decided to hand you over to us after all.\" She giggled to herself apparently having a hard time holding in her excitement. \"I'm glad that was the case, it's been so boring around here without a cute little adventurer to play with.\" You couldn't help blushing as she continued to tease you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I heard he submitted to a young girl's feet without even putting up a fight.\" The two girls holding your arms join in on the teasing, jostling you around a bit. \"You'll fit in with us perfectly then, we'll take good care of you from now...As long as you're a good boy that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we test your loyalty little adventurer?\" The seated bunny girl points to her feet as she wiggles her toes. \"Go ahead and start by kissing my feet, it's been a while since we had someone so eager to please us.\" The other two bunny girls start pushing you towards her feet, will you submit so easily a second time?</span></div></div>",

You can hear the chitter of what must be hundreds of rabbit girls deciding your fate just mere feat above you. You groan and sit up, back against the furthest wall from the voices and look around. There must've been a fair amount of previous people thrown in here, you can see claw marks all along the length of this hole, and indents from where bodies were. All you can do is sit and sincerely hope this isn't your fate, but the again, would a fate under feet be better? You sit and ponder this question, now staring up towards the sky, now realizing a good number of the girls are actually standing at the lip of your dirt abyss, watching you while they discuss. Very uncomfortable with this revelation, you turn, only to be greeted by the sigh of bunny girls standing all around the hole. You now realize just how much trouble you're in, that would be a lot of girls to service, and you start enjoying this time down here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of much heated debate from what appears to be two sides, they reach down and drag you out, throwing you onto the hard ground. You immediately start crawling away, but don't make it very far before you're grabbed and pulled up. \"Queens gotta give you her blessing before you go anywhere silly boy\" a particularly buff rabbit says before dragging you by your arm towards the largest hut in the village. This, through your pain, brings hope. They did make a mention of going somewhere, and you pray that somewhere is far far away from here. When the door to the hut is opened, you're presented to this decrepit, gray, old rabbit who grins maliciously at your small and broken body. \"This your Queen, apologize to her for disrupting our peaceful kingdom you treacherous human.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are taken aback at this wildly accusatory command and how biased it is but begin to speak nonetheless. Then the buff bunny from before puts her foot on your head and forces you down to foot level with Queen, who extends her gnarled soles towards you. \"Actions are stronger than words remember? Go on apologize, and make it sincere.\" She snickers and kicks you over to the old bag of bones the throne. You grimace at this, there's a whole slew of rabbits behind you about to watch you \"apologize\". Your face goes beat red, but you pick up the wrinkled, blistered foot and gently kiss its top. But the crowd starts booing and so the Queen pops her other foot into your unsuspecting mouth. Barely keeping back gagging on it, you suckle her toes, which she gladly rubs along your teeth.eventually, moaning, she pops a particularly large blister on one of your canines, spraying pus onto your tongue. Your body goes into a heaving motion, but you don't stop. You really don't want to die today so you keep sucking on her toes, even when she switches feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like an enternity, her gravelly old voice speaks. \"You quite the charismatic human, and I simply have no choice but to pardon you of your crimes.\" Your spirits are lifted, you're a free man. \"I hereby humbly bestow you the honor of being part of our clan instead.\" A knot forms in your stomach and you head spins. You start to get up to back away, but the Queen, even in her old age. Is extremely quick and she brings a now clean foot slamming into your balls. \"Woah woah woah we all know you're excited to start life here.\"  She shares a good cackle with the others. \"But you haven't even heard who you're helping out first!\" You groan,curled up in a ball on the floor, cradling your manhood. She pretends to think carefully about who will get you first, a hand on her chin, but then she cackles again and sentences you to a day with the family who brought you in. When you're brought through the crowd by the little bunny with her little sister towards your house, you notice that even with your battered body, you could probably make a dash into the thick undergrowth and leave this place behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway there you start seriously considering your plan when the older girl can't hold back her excitement anymore. \"Oh you poor human, you don't understand just how vile these babies can be.\" She scrunches her toes as she walks, which causes her little sister to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Margaret that's nasty!\" She says between giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marissa it's going to be so much fun you don't understand. We get to have him for a full day and night. Do you know how much work we can put into him by then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl, Marissa apparently, loosens her grip on you as thinks about the opportunities. \"Yeah actually, maybe you can even teach me how to..\" she doesn't get to finish because you break from her grip, push her into Margaret, toppling both of them, and make a mad break for the thick brush of the forest. You push aside branches, run through thorn bushes, and run for your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you make it or do two very angry rabbits catch up to you</span></div></div>",

After a brief chase through the forest, you know you're not going to win a race against rabbits so you throw yourself down in some bushes, laying extremely close to the ground and hoping that the leaves and dirt are good enough camouflage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret catches up to your location in seconds, yeah you couldn't have won the race, and she's not even breathing heavily. \"We're dead Marissa! We're dead! Do you understand!? We can't go back now, we'd be replacements for that sad excuse of a human!\" She stomps the ground angrily, narrowly missing your hidden crotch. You hold your breath, if they discover you, it's all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister reaches her sister's position fairly quickly, now crying softly. \"I don't wanna lick Queens feet.\" She starts sobbing at her future if they go back. \"It's not fair! It's not it's not!\" She stomps the ground too now, each one getting close to your face. You close your eyes and brace, but her sister calms her down to a point where they split up again, looking for you. You lay there for what must be an hour until everything quiets down. You can't help but feel a small amount of pity for the two rabbits. Sure it was either you or them, but no one should have to endure that, especially someone as young as Marissa. You only hope they left to start their own village as you stand up and continue your journey far away from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you get horrifically lost in this forest or do eventually enter the gates of what you hope is a friendly city?</span></div></div>",

You slump a little defeated, and step into the bottom half of the inn, a bar. Looking around, you see a fair amount of humans, with the occasional monster girl sitting here or there. Again, your sad boys gets a few odd stares, and you shuffle up to the counter, ready to beg for a place to stay. The bartender doesn't even entertain the idea and motions for you to head outside if you don't have any money. You sigh, dejected, and start heading out to the street, pulling your shirt close, ready to rough it on the cobble roads. Then a soothing hand is placed on your shoulder, and you turn, curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman gives you a gentle smile and offers you a deal. If you can share a couple of drinks with her, she'll gladly pay for a whole weeks worth of rent for you here at this inn. You gladly accept, and she introduces herself as Maria, then orders two on her tab for the both of you. \"So Erik, what brings you out here?\" You happily explain why, glad someone has finally decided to help you out. Then she even offers to get you hooked up with some really good gear, she knows a couple people here in town, so she's willing to pull a couple strings for you. You're flattered, and only after a couple of drinks and good conversation you look down, seeing thick fur covered thighs and goat hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's a Satyros, a monster girl. You get a little uncomfortable now because your last contact with monster girls wasn't the best experience, but you're surrounded by humans here and she's really nice, so you sit relatively easy.  She tell you her story now and she's grown up and lived around here her entire life, so she can help you around town if you need. You feel really relaxed around here, but you feel as if you've had one too many beverages so you, as politely as you can, ask if it's okay if you wander off to your room now. She laughs and guides you up the stairs, stopping at the last door at the left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bathroom's the room across you bud and I'd gone ahead and gotten you the biggest room in this fine establishment.\" She opens the door, and you're again astounded at her generosity. You can't believe how nice she's being to you, there's a massive king sized bed on the far wall with silk sheets, a fine rug in the middle of the room, a large window encompassing a wall, and nice litttle candle lights. This is everything you could've asked for, and you stumble off toward the bed after wondering out loud as to how you could ever thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a click behind you, the door being locked, and you turn and stare in your drunk stupor and tired mind. Maria stands there, a grin across her face. \"I think I know exactly how you can thank me, you can even do it right you!\" She saunters over to where you sit on the bed, easing you down with one hand, sitting atop your chest when she has you laying down. She leans in towards your face and whispers the word sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou babble about being thankful but wanting this and staying a virgin until marriage and way of but she slips a hand over your mouth and gently pushes your arms down. \"It's okay hone, we'll marry soon then. Until then, let's have an early honeymoon.\" Wth that she loosens up your pants, and pulls them off. She grabs your shirt to pull that off to, but you weakly put up your hands as resistance. She laughs in your face, swats  them away and continues. Within minutes youre nude while she's fully clothed, minus her lowerside which wasn't clothed to begin with. She then lowers her furry waist onto yours, her gloved hands hold your wrists to your sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to babble and she giggles, gently moving her waist side to side, your penis becoming hard in her, instigating a moan. She takes off her shirt after a couple of minutes, letting two decent sized boobs swing as she now grinds you, moaning louder and more often. She takes her hands and holds yours, pulling herself up you, then pushes away, causing friction to build up quicker and quicker between you two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she orgasms, she dismounts and brings your face forward for a sloppy kiss, before patting your head and tucking you in.

She stops you right outside your room and asks why you're so excited. \"Well duh Maria, you said I can get all my gear today!\" She laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah right, right. I got a Gyoubu Danuki friend named Sam who essentially runs the market around her, she'll slip you stuff no problem. She operates out of a yellow stall, it's the first one, you can't miss it.\" She forces a kiss and sends you along your way. You walk outside and look around. There's seems to be a lot of commotion from your right so you head there, and low and behold, a massive sprawling market is just a block down from the inn. And hey, there's what should be Sam's market, a massive yellow stall, and there's all kinds of sick stuff laid out along the tables. There's axes, swords, shields, cheat plates, helmets, a grappling hook, anything you want made out of any material. You're like a kid ion Christmas and you start picking up what suits your fancy. And almost immediately your hands gets sharply smacked, making you drop your gear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, you look up and see an old graying woman. \"Hey Maria said--\" you don't get to finish as your shushed and led into a back ally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah so your Maria's kid, you get a special deal then. My bad.\"  A deal? Maria said nothing about a deal. \"I'm Sam, you can have whatever you want. I usually charge 1 gold per ounce but for you, you just have to spend half an hour with me per ounce of stuff you pick up.\" You nod, that's fair enough, and when she offers your hand for a deal, you shake it. Then you realize, the sword alone is probably..two and half pounds, forty ounces, twenty hours with her. You swallowed and stop up. Keep an old lady company for a day, that's okay. And the armor you didn't even look at, that would be too much. You pointed to the sword and Sam smiled and toothy grin. She picked up the sword, closed down her booth, and beckoned you to follow her, which you did, you just didn't expect to pay for it right now. She led you to a fairly decent mini mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened the door, it was the grandest house you've ever been in or even seen. Kikimoras, a maiden monster girl, swept the floor and all her glass trinkets carefully. It was grand, and you looked over to her to see she had slipped back into her more comfortable, natural form. She motioned you towards to the couch and disappeared for a moment, leaving the kikimoras to tend to you. They gently had you sit on the floor, and took your shirt, whisking it away to god knows where. Then the tanuki was back and sat herself above you, and used your face to take off her sandals. You saw a dark imprint of her foot inside the sock when she held it above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" When Maria told me you were coming around, I knew I couldn't change, so these are left over from a long shift yesterday.\" She curled her toes and pinched her nose. \"Icky huh? Well you signed up for it.\" She brought her foot down pretty hard onto your face, the other following close behind, and cupped her toes around your nose. The smell was revolting, but you guess that indirectly, you did sign up for this, and you resign yourself to twenty hours of being used.You see her open a book and know it's definitely gonna be twenty hours of no fun. It gets pretty boring laying down with socks upyour nose and so you start watching the kimikoras clean the house. Still boring, but better than staring at the ceiling. Then same starts rubbing her socks and scrunching your nose. You wonder what gotten into her, but then you read the cover. It's smut and she's getting excited. You roll your eyes, but are then gagged by one of her feet. It tastes overwhelmingly of sweat and you gag slightly. It's rather unpleasant combined with the rug burn you're starting to develop from the rough cloth of her sock furiously rubbing you cheek. You speak up and she blushes, coughs, and sets the book aside. She must've partially forgotten you're here.  Then she shows a little bit on anger at you interrupting her by standing up on your face, showing a shocking amount of pressure for such a small body. You raise your hands to push her off, but two kimikuras quickly stand on each of your hands. Sam stretches and bounces off, calling you to dinner. The two maids get off of you and warn you above crossing her, you're only two hours in, you don't want to piss her off for the next eighteen. When you're lead into the dining room, she has a seat across from where you will sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you sit down, the maids sweep through with food, laying out a spread that would be any thanksgiving to shame. You stare hungrily at it, and Sam giggles. As soon as you start choking down, you nearly spit it out, that tanuki just kicked you in balls. You struggle to contain the food, and she giggles again, now rubbing and stroking your shaft as she takes apart a steak. Eating just became a little harder but you make it through the meal, sitting back just as your about to explode in your pants, but she retracts her foot just moments before you do. You writhe in your seat and send your hands to go fix your frustration, but again the maidens come and restrain you, now tying your hands behind your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look pleadingly at Sam, who just shrugs. \"If you were a good boy and obeyed my will, this wouldn't be happening. Have him taken to my bedroom bath.\" She dismisses you and the girls begin to drag you up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We warned you. We really tried. But the bathroom is the beginning of the end, yes it is, yes it is.\" They set you down in the bathtub and derobe the rest of you, walking out to leave you with the small raccoon dog who has now appeared in the door way, a hungry grin on her face. She climbs into the bathtub and turns it on, dousing both her and you in lukewarm water. She plops her weight down on your face, and starts scrubbing herself down, slathering both you and her in shampo and soap. She prioritizes herself, her hair and pits being cleaned first before moving to more..sensitive areas. She spreads her vaginas lips wide and unleashes a torrenting pee  onto your face, before covering it and you in soap and sliding herself completely over your face. She rides your face quite brutally to orgasm, her bush agitating your face, causing it to redden quite severely. From there she turns around, releases a particularly nasty fart, and launches herself out of the tub using your dick as the springboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour maids appear, drying her off and dressing her in a nightgown, and then turning off the shower, drying you off with themselves instead of a towel. This is the first indulgence you've seen them allow themselves, and they moan when they dry their face with their wolf fur covered cleavage and feet. Sam gets a good chuckle and leaves them to it. Their feet stink like a wet dog after a while, combined with all the work they just did during the day. It's awful, but not as bad when run out of dry spots of them except for their butts. They run your face under them like toilet paper, completely unkind any progress in the shower, then carry you of the bathroom and spread eagle tie you to the bed, where Sam awaits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they leave, she pulls her silk sheets over the two of you, her spooning your left side and reading the smut from earlier again. You know better to speak up this time, but it's not long before her long fingers find her way downstairs, and she fondles you like a master. Almost like a psychic, she always drops your shaft moments before you explode on her nice blanket, but you're now fastened to the bed. She continues this for the rest of the night, until she finishes her book around one o clock in the morning, then she once again mounts you, forcing her to eat her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both fall fastly asleep around 3 after a couple rounds of having you eat out  Sam, her screams waking up the neighborhood. You awake roughly around eleven, an hour before you're supposed to stumble back to the inn, because the merchant has decided to use you as a mat to work out all the kinks in her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually upon being fed and untied, you quickly exit the house, and only go faster when she calls out that you're welcome to by again with the same deal anytime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you sleep elsewhere, because you're too tired to deal with Maria's urges? Or do you succumb and risk your chances with Maria anyways?</span></div></div>",

There's an overgrown park with an algae ridden pond in front of you, and that seems like the best choice in this shady part of the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping the rusty fence for an apparent lack of an entrance, you make your way through the knee length grass and weeds towards the waters edge. Grasshoppers lazily leap out of your way as you wander through the eerily quiet neighborhood. Maybe it's an abandoned part of town, that wouldn't surprise you considering it's condition. As you step ever closer, a decrepit bench appears in the corner of your eye. You wouldn't ever dare sit on such a shaky thing, but it's nice to know that something once attended this place. The pond is a mere puddle, opaque with green moss and slime, but you stare into it regardless. This morbid quiet lulls you into an odd state, one of considering what your next plan was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were violently snapped out of by a voice though, one that appeared to have no origin. \"Hey look what we've got here, a human. Not just any human, a male!\" That didn't sound good, and you whipped around in circles looking for who said that, or an exit. That only got a giggle before the grass and the water started to rustle. \"Well I'm zoey, nice to meet you!\" A green hand popped out of the scene, offering itself up to a friendly handshake. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a moment of you staring at her in cautious confusion, she repeated herself. \"I'm Zoey, nice to meet you! Are you lost or something, usually humans don't come this far into town,\" her voice lowered and she looked slightly away at the decrepit buildings. \"at least not this part of town...\". She perked up again when you took an unsteady step towards her, your own hand extended despite your hard learned lessons about not trusting monster girls. You admitted, albeit through mumbles, that yeah you were kind of lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe perked up, dropping your hand after a rough handshake, and gesturing around her. \"Well this is obviously downtown, probably not where you want to be. Are you looking for Town Square, Central, Rim, Fringe, Uptown, Commercial...\" She went on and on, listing garble to you, and you lost your words again trying to explain your situation. \"Ohhh, not even from around here? I guess that would explain it...say you know what? I'll give you a complete tour of the town, if you want, and I'll lead you to wherever you want. How's that sound?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing extremely knowledgeable about seemingly generous offers now that you've been through your fair share, you ask about the catch, to which she grins. \"Haha, yeah a catch....hmm...well I'm a kappa, yeah? We do like our wrestling. Say, you beat me in a wrestling match, and I'm yours.\" Once again, she extended her hand, and you took a moment of consideration. Zoey reminded you that this wasn't the best part of town, there were some pretty bad figures around here who wouldn't be so kind. You mulled that over, and she was at least a foot shorter than you, so you shook her green, webbed hand. Her face lit up with joy and she guided you over to a part of the park where everything some somewhat cleared out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few steps back, she stretched her arms out, rolling her wrists, and spoke up. \"First one pinned loses, ready?\" Slightly nervous you shook your head and took a defensive stance, bending your knees and elbows. Still giddy, Zoey seemed unphased by your decision, and gladly approached, her thin arms and small body almost laughable for the task she's so excited about doing. About three or four steps out, she lunged, and you now noticed her well defined legs had some power behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour defensive position was decimated as Zoey barrelled into you with her full body weight. The two of you fell to the ground in a tangle of limbs, each one trying to gain some leverage over the other. Dirt and blades of yellowed grass were kicked up, covering the two of from head to toe in coarse grime. After the initial confusion and shock, you easily were able to tuck one of her arms under yours, but she drove her free hand into your neck, forcing you to drop the trapped one. Now a sputtering mess, you had no control over the kappa getting up and placing one webbed foot across a wrist and the other your bruised neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited for the coughing to die down before smirking. \"You done yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having come this far only to lose to an overgrown turtle, you returned the smirk.  \"The rules said first one pinned, and looks like I'm still going\" With that, you brought your free arm up into a brutal punch to her ankle, liberating your wrist and throwing her balance off, causing her to fall off and away from your neck and nearer to the pond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving landed in a particularly muddy part of the park, she wasn't too enthused. With one outstretched arm, she grabbed your ankle and dragged you to her, causing you both to be back at square one...a tangle of limbs. Zoey wrapped her arms around your chest, and you fought back by twisting one of her legs, but rolling around on the soft, mushy ground of the park and through the scratchy grass was more foreign to you than her. Energy was fading fast, and your defenses against her grappling gradually became slower and clunkier. You grabbed at her face, but she dodged and returned the favor, latching onto yours with her hand and driving your head into the mud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving learned her lesson from last time, she grabbed a wrist with each of her hands, sat on your chest, and now brought her recently mud caked feet onto your neck and face. \"How about now, you done yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to resist and pull your head away from the onslaught, but her feet were quite large and the webbing only helped in securing your face. Dejected, you grunted something along the lines of surrender, only for her to hysterically giggle and part her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, what was that? Are you really surrendering yourself to me?\" She brought up both of your hands and forced you to clap with her surprisingly strong twigs arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly alarmed, you started sputtering and stating that wasn't the deal, to which she responded in quite the condescending voice after shutting you up by jamming her soiled foot into your mouth. \"Aww, did you think I wasn't going to get anything if I won? Afterall, you were going to win me if you won. It's only fair the deal goes both ways.\" She started scraping the mud off into your mouth, which quickly filled with gunk, causing you to choke and squirm violently under her. Zoey scoffed, jumped off of your chest, grabbed one of your arms with both hands, and dragged you over to the bank where you two first met. There, at the pond, she kicked your pathetic self with your clogged throat into the pond which was equally clogged with green algae. Water quickly rushed into your openly awaiting mouth, rinsing the mud out but refilling your lungs with the mossy plants of the un-maintained water piece of the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to stay above the water between the war going on in your respiratory system, you could hear Zoey having the time of her life, head thrown back in laughter at your troubles. \"Swim on back, the walk over to the pond muddied my feet all over again and they need attention. And don't you dare make me come in there. You though getting beaten by a girl shorter than you was bad the first time? Pff, just wait until you make me mad.\" Reluctantly, you grasped and pulled on the water weeds until you were back on the shore just below your tormentor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy, now lick to your heart's content.\" She slid down the embankment a bit so that her now brown toes could run through your hair while her heels could harass your face by leaving long, brown smears. Your mouth eventually found its place center mass on her heels, which she forced past your lips and back onto your teeth. Your tongue worked in overtime trying to clean the mess Zoey somehow accumulated in the short walk over, and it didn't help that while you cleaned one, she rested the other in a small hill of mud. She was having fun though, constantly gently slapping your face with her free hands or tugging your hands out from under you. Not only was the filth that she was wrestling down your throat awful, the stench of her feet were unparalleled. It was the all of the smells of a sulfuric, rotting, damp, despicable swamp focused into one spot. It was dizzying, even more so than being a human shovel and disposal for this creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a whil;e, her laughing died down and she placed one strong foot firmly on the center of your face, bidding you to rise to your knees. With her signature smirk of what you know knew to be trouble, she rested her other foot near the one square on your nose and with a single strong kick, she catapulted you back into the wretched pond. Instantly flailing and trying to get yourself back into a position of some control, it was all quelled as you felt Zoey grab you in a tight embrace and lean your back up against the embankment, with only your shoulders and head above the water. You could feel her free hand moving around below the water as her other one pinned you firmly. First her tattered suit came off, with her throwing it over you back onto shore. Then, still grinning, she started to remove your pants, then removing the pinning hand, she threw herself into a frenzy of disrobing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, you tried to push her off in a last attempt for freedom, but she didn't take that too well, dunking your head deep under the water while she wrestled to join her hips with yours. Furiously fighting back, your attempts were soon squashed as her strong feet battered your submerged head into a state of quickly fading semi-conscious. She dragged you back above the surface, only to kiss you as she continued to have her way with what you still had under the water. As she continued to bounce and thrash your waist, she deemed your head being under the water was for the best, where her feet could have fun with you too. Her efforts soon came to her becoming a shaking, orgasmic, mess as her unrelenting feet, or the weed infested water entering your lungs, or perhaps a combination of both finally kicked you into unconsciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awakened naked, covered in algae, and waterlogged in a patch of dead grass with Zoey standing smiling over you. \"Hey sleepy head, you up for a kiss?\" She raised a green, but only slightly grimy foot to your lips and you, in your still spinning and groggy head, gave them a peck. Not expecting such obedience, she giggled and stepped back. \"Well look at you, a quick learner after all. Come on up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved you up, then grabbed your wrist, pulling you the rest of the way. \"You know I've been thinking, and I know a deal's a deal, but you're just too adorable to force into husbandry. I need a real challenge to keep around here, and well, you're just not one.\" Zoey stole a glance at your face, which was still choosing whether to be dejected or happy at her back handed compliment, and laughed. Putting an arm around your shoulder, she continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, I know. You're really upset over this, but I'll sweeten the deal. You made a really simple mistake, you took a right into this park when you should've kept going in a perfectly straight line. That'll lead you right out of this town in a block or two.\" She pointed down a beaten up road and slapped you on the back. \"But if you want, I can probably make some room around here so that not only could I have my husband, but also an ever faithful foot toy...\" That only hung in the air for a moment before you, still very confused at her sudden generosity, started to break away and head off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, no no no, not so fast. Aren't you going to thank me?\" She extended her foot once again after twisting it in the dirt. There was the catch. You could go, but only after she was certain that she used up all of your potential. With some hesitation and some tugging at the shoulder from the kappa, you kneeled down and cupped her heel, giving yet another quick peck to her foot before rising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, are you really not that grateful? Surely you have more respect than that.\" She twisted her foot and forced you down on your back again. \"Kiss away, footboy. And oh, if you want to get some saliva on it, I'll even throw your clothes back into the deal.\" Groaning at the turning of the situation, you forced your lips to pucker on her heel countless times as she switched back and forth between the two of them. Little bits and pieces of grass eventually wedged themselves between your lips, and upon noticing, Zoey jumped at the chance to help \"fix it\" by jamming her webbed toes into your mouth and scooping the vegetation out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquirming turned to thrashing as she tickled the back of your throat with her toes, and she took it upon herself to sit down again on your chest and take the time to meticulously use her big toe to swirl and swish the grime out of your mouth. Whether she knew it or not, her feet were also dirty and only added to the pile. Luckily your panicked, choking movements eventually won out and she slid back off of you with her legs resting across your chest. Lifting one to her face, she thoroughly inspected one arch for any sign of neglect before sighing and getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment she walked away, then returning with a pile of ruined and soaked clothing, she announced that you were free to go and that she was very pleased with your gratitude. Then, unceremoniously dumping the clothes at your feet, she bid you farewell and turned on her heel back towards the pond. You quickly put your shirt and pants on and started off towards the road she pointed out. You only made it about four or five steps before a sharp pain in your legs brought you back to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, thinking about it, my feet were just cleaned and I wasn't really feeling like soiling them again so soon. Why don't you carry me to the gate, and then you can go?\" Zoey plopped herself down on your back, eagerly awaiting for her steed to start up. She may have been smaller than you, but not by that much, and she straddled her legs around your neck in such a way that you could hardly breath. Unsteadily, you got up and started off towards the gate. All you could see on the tiring journey was her feet bobbing and swaying with your rocking movement as you crawled. She giggled and patted you on the head every once in awhile when you stuttered or neared collapse, but it was over pretty quickly as it was really a fairly small park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped off, dragging you by the shirt cuff up so that you wouldn't totally collapse. \"What a good, good boy. Now that wasn't so hard was it?\" She held you up so that she could stare into your eyes before smiling and dropping you to stand on your own. \"Now, that path directly down that way will lead you out of the city, but I know a much safer and faster way what do you say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a step back, with a hand up to say \"no thanks\", but she laughed you off and grabbed your muddied shirt again, dragging you the middle of the street. There, Zoey lifted a rusty man cover and looked back into your eyes with those same glinting, hazel eyes and a wicked grin. \"Now this is much simpler. You just hop on down, take two lefts, a right, go straight for three quadrants, then take your final left. You'll end up in an incredibly safe and monster free place not too far from here. That'll get you all rested up. Ready? That's what I thought!\" She pulled you close before kicking you into the smelly and dark hole leading to the unmaintained sewers of the poor part of town. Before you could even get up, she slid the cover back across, leaving you in the pitch black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing back coughs and gasps of disgusts, you searched for a wall with your hand, coming into contact with the slimy bricks that encased you down here...now what did she say? Two..no three lefts, a right or two...but turn where and when? You started to wander, feeling around for a place that you could duck into, or even find a light. Almost as quickly as you were thrown down here, you were hopelessly lost, stumbling and stuttering as you felt your way through the pitch black labyrinth. There wasn't a single bit of this horrid place that wasn't slimy and it wasn't entirely rare that you would slip down into one pile of slop or another. Stuttering became staggering, almost zombie like, as you tried to get to anywhere that even resembled shelter or an exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wandered for what felt like forever until your senses were rewarded with sounds at the far end of a long corridor. With no better options, you went towards it and were rewarded with a faint, flickering light that appeared to come from the same source as the sound. You got nearer and nearer, realizing that the sound was that of slapping, a wet slapping like that of flesh fitting the same grimy tiles you just spent hours traversing around. As you came around to corner to finally investigate the noise, you once again missteped, this time firmly wedging your ankle in a small hole as the sound abruptly stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started right back up again as the sounds of your struggle became apparent, but your ankle wasn't budging. An extremely pale arm extended its way forward, grabbing and pulling the beast behind it forward with slow momentum. Next was the slime green hair, barely hiding her dark brown eyes but neglected to cover her voluptuous breasts and her antenna...her antenna. That second part stuck with you as she cemented her hands around your waist, yanking you out of the hole and dumping you on the floor. Now bleeding from the ankle, you looked up at her, noticing the now obvious hulking mass below her stomach. The top half might've been that of a woman, but everything below that was the body of a slug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flashed you a dopey yet all too knowing grin as she fed your ankles under her body. You raised your hands to push her away, or yourself away, but her body was unfightable vacuum, a steel trap, and your legs were hers. Still smiling, she took your hands in hers before shoving and tucking them too under slimy self. The pure weight of her alone was crushing, but a sucking sensation also started while she finished up engulfing your chest, stopping just at the shoulders. Almost without a problem, the rippling muscles of her underside ripped away your pants, suctioning away at your groin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped and spat, furiously struggling with what little strength you had left after Zoey and her sewer, but it was futile against your new captor. This slug girl was stupidly strong or just knew how to handle a scrawny little man like you. Either way, she had you and she knew it. You spat and cursed, but she just continued the slow, sucking process of milking, turning your breaths from that of anger to unwilling groans of ecstasy. The small scowl she grew at your resistance faded back to a happy open mouth while she used your hands to grip your shoulders. Now using them as launch pads, she rocked slowly back and forth, adding just enough oomph to drive you over the edge. Despite now being covered in slime and grime, you provided plenty of your own slime to the slug girl, who, between your uncomfortable gasping, said nothing, instead blocking your mouth up with a cold, clammy hand as she started up round two with even more rocking and suctioning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to wrestle your head out and way from her hand, but<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all you haven't gotten off yet despite multiple people getting off from you, so try to make the best out of it, hoping that Maria will grant you this. Yeah that's it, that's what you can get out of all of this, so you hurry up and head inside the bar. When you step in, you look around for your new friend while stifling a yawn. Her purple velvety clothing is nowhere to be seen so you guess that she's already in your room or the one adjacent, which is hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you set foot on the top stair, you're seized from around the waist and dragged to your room. \"Naughty naughty boy, you kept me waiting for soooo long.\" So that's where Maria was, waiting for you to walk into her ambush. You wonder if she accidentally grabbed any other people waiting for you, but you hear your door open and you're carried and tossed onto the bed. \"Naughty boys don't get orgasms of course, only nice and patient friends do.\" She passively aggressively grabs your balls in her hand, giving it a semi hard squeeze before tossing them aside and climbing upon your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan at her sentencing, she just snatched away all your hope in an instant, but before you can speak up, she's already tugging at your clothes, there's no way to back this train up. You roll your eyes and set your head back against your incredibly soft pillow, letting Maria enjoy herself. She did after all, ensure your gentle settling in to this city. With only one sock partially hanging off your foot, Maria's satisfied with your stripping, and stands up to remove her shirt. The only problem being, she has hooves, goat hooves, and she's unknowingly crushing your right testicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharply inhaling, you white knuckle the sides of the bed, unable to say anything through the pain of having a goat woman put her full wait on your nuts, a hoof adding to your utter pain. She looks down at you, taking your rapid inhalations as ones of pleasure and throws her crotch down onto your face, which doesn't feel much better, and starts wildly humping you. You run out of breath as she starts to get close to her orgasm, and start thrashing, which only causes her in her monster girl state of list to jump harder and faster, her hands and legs circling your skull, holding you fast to her loins. You start fading out when she screams in utter bliss, nearly drowning you in her juices, and backs up to your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching you regain your composure, she coughs, apologizes for her roughness, quickly wrestles her fur covered tits back into her shirt, and departs, leaving you to your means for the night. You get up and cross the hall to clean yourself after such an ordeal. Sincerely hoping no ones looking at your sopping face as you open the door to the bathroom, you close its door behind you. And you know what? Screw it, if no monster girl will do her job and finish you off, you'll do it right here in the bathroom, and promptly stick one  hand down your pants as the other finds the light switch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as it clicks on, you pause in pure regret and shame. Maria sits on the toilet to your left, blushing madly and snickering as she stares at your occupied hand. You mumble and bumble over words to explain yourself, but she stands up, takes your wrist, and guides you back to her room, not yours. There she turns and faces you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me and Sam were talking a while ago about what she does to dirty men like you.\" She snickers and quickly lashes your hands to her bed post. Then she strips you for the second time tonight, and lashes your feet to to other two bed posts. \"She shared with me some very interesting strategies to really mess them up. Oh she must've had fun with you. Ready for some deja vu?\" She spoons you on your left side, a different approach to Sam you must admit, and pulls her thick woolen sheets over the two of your for a \"fun\" night of antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep bumbling and asking for mercy, and she just looks you deep and the eyes and smiles condescendingly. \"Oh humans, they never know their boundaries. The monster girls say when you can cum, not you.\" She leans over and opens her dresser, pulling out a particularly filthy sock. \"Gym socks of an orc. I paid one specially to wear this for a couple weeks just for the next man who tries to double cross me.\" She stuffs it in your mouth and binds it there. You start wretching and gagging, that's quite possibly the worst foot taste yet. It's a fetid and rotten taste that could keel over one of those slimes or devil mice, who love filth. Now trashing and wailing through your new gag, you can sense Maria getting off on this, and it's not long before she starts humping your side and fondling your destroyed balls and shaft, never letting you gain release, all the while bringing herself off multiple times throughout the night. Eventually you both pass out from exhaustion on the horrifically stained and ruined  bed early in the morning <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awake later in the afternoon in a deep and passionate kiss from the Satyros,who passes chewed up breakfast from her mouth to yours,some of it catching in the sock that you still are sucking on, much to your disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually lets you up, and mentions that you never brought back anything, not even a sword from sam. You very audibly groan in complete disappointment. You'd have to go back and get it. Do you do that and spend more time in this town with your protectors or do you decide it's finally too much and you try leaving, even without fear or money?</span></div></div>",

Now you have to go back to that wretched house and quite possibly suffer nor at the hands of the slu merchant. You try to keep a calm face. \"Oh would you look at that, I must've left it behind at Sam's house.\" You force a laugh and start to get ready, dressing yourself in front of Maria, who wouldn't leave. She's blatantly enjoying denying your orgasm now, even giving you a time limit on how long you were allowed to stay in the bathroom. Shaking your head at her nonsense, you convince her that she doesn't need to follow you to her friends house, and very reluctantly make your journey up to the place where your sword hopefully is. It's a massive gray house that stands in perfect condition on the corner, and anyone passing by would never guess that it's run entirely by monster girls. You go to knock on the door, but before you can it's opened by one of her maids, who looks upon you pitifully before allowing your entrance. Three of her maids flank and encircle you as soon as you step foot in the house, stripping of clothes in such a fashion that it resembles a piranha swarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam is standing behind her, a malicious smirk on her face. \"Forgetting something? Your sword is in the chest over there. Of course there's gonna be a fee for the unexpected overnight holding of your goods though, don't think you get off of this one easily mister!\" You roll your eyes and follow her finger, sure enough there's a big oak chest sitting next to the foot of her stairs. This fee won't be fun but you really want to check out the sword. But as soon as your lift the lid, a girl pops out, tackling you to the hardwood floor, much to the tittering of eveyone in the room, especially from what you now realize is a mimic. You go to start shouting at Sam, but the mimic takes off her ribbons in a flash, tying them around and around your mouth, leaving her nude and standing over your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't move to your limbs to resist either, powerless to resist whatever will come your way. \"Erik, this is Stephanie. Stephanie, Erik. Now Erik dear, play nice, our mimic here came from very far away to give you a taste of what is to come later tonight.\" With that, she turns on her socked heel and walks away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight?! You think to yourself. This cannot go until night, you have to get out before then. You start madly struggling against your invisible bonds, only to have them ceased by a gentle, but firm push from Stephanie's foot into your chest. You look up at her, and now having an audience, she jumps up into a cannonball position, expertly plunging her and her body weight onto your penis. You grunt in pleasure through your multi layered gag, Steph now slowly grinding herself along your waist. You can't move any, so her speed is what you get, no matter how agonizingly slow she goes. After an hour of this, you come near erupting like a volcano, but she dismounts and remounts on your face, leaving your balls blue, and finishes herself using your nose. \"Only a taste remember silly? Not a full meal.\"She snickers at your misery, waiting for your erection to go down before doing the process all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter four hours of this, she releases you on command of Sam, has been back for a while now, watching you squirm under her minion. \"Huh I could've sworn your sword was there....maybe it's this way, follow me. Still nude, you follow the raccoon merchant through her house, each maid blushing and turning away upon seeing you. Sam stops at a large wooden door at the end of a massive hallway and throws it open, exposing a room of very beautiful women. You sigh, your treasure is very obviously not in here, but to have any chance of actually getting it, you have to play along. Besides, you've gone through too much now to give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls the heavy doors closed, takes a seat at the head of a large table, and with every other one of the thirty seats filled, you stand awkwardly behind her. The other seats are filled by other prominent looking monsters, such as a dark priest, an akaname or two, some humans who can't actually be human, a kappa, a slime, a very bored cyclops, a couple of chatting youkos and inaris, a harpy, some other assorted monsters, and a bunny girl who is staring you down with utter hatred. Sam gives a very audible and disappointed sigh, and snaps her fingers. Two of the kikimoras from separate from the others preparing the table for a feast, and pull you aside into the kitchen to have a chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam is having party today and expects some entertainment. The band hasn't shown up, and most men in this town were smart enough to get miles away years ago. This city is a massive hub for monster girl society. Now, you've proven that you're really good entertainment, so what you're going to do is crawl out of this kitchen on all fours, that'll be really funny for them, and squeeze yourself under that table, that'll also be fun for the girls you'll have to get by, and get to work on all their feet. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to argue that, but close it again. You're extremely outnumbered, and the only door to his room is really heavy. You're trapped and everyone knows it, so the kikimoras kick your legs out from under you and shove you out of the kitchen. Now most of the food has been laid out already, so everyone's eating and discussing monster politics and life, but it all stops when they notice you. The whole dining hall erupts in laughter and they all extend their feet towards you, scrunching and flexing their toes, making the lewdest remarks about what's going to happen to you with that their feet. You swallow deeply and reluctantly advance towards the closest entrance to the table u too Sam clears her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Erik why don't you be a dear and come around tho enter from this side?\" She points towards the far end of the left table, where the inaris and the youko squeal in excitement. \"These poor soles worked  alllllll day long their spa, and their work is very hard, so let's honor them by having a first go with you.\" She raises her glass in a toast to the work of the spa girls, and cheer spreads around the table. But of course, as you crawl around to where they sit, some of the other girls turn and watch you in your humiliating journey there, jeering and throwing their shoes at you. When you do make it, the small group of fox girls wrap their legs and feet around you, practically dragging you to them and kicking you under the table. There, the inaris take no time in kicking off their wooden sandals, their boss the youko kicking off the black flats from her dainty feet. With their combined seven pairs of feet, they pin you under them, your face going to the yellow and callused face of the youko. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation above quickly whips up in sick fantasies  about male torture, yours at the moment. The smell of feet is overwhelming, but you can't do anything about it, your hands are being stepped on, your mouth covered by what feels like a callus. One adventurous inari even goes so far and to play with your still nude penis, using her socked feet to stroke and jostle your shaft. You groan into the foot on your face, causing a stifled laugh in its owner. She then offers up a story of a particularly terrifying story of what she's done to man. From what you can hear, she managed to convince a man to let her tie him up. Everyone snickers at the poor bastard, that's a death sentence to a males freedom. But this man had tried leaving her after dating her for years and years, so when she did finally did catch up to him, god knows why he allowed this. Anyways, it then goes she got completely nude for him, teased him for hours, and made him lick and worship every part of her body. She snickers when she has to get though the rough parts, like her pits and her feet, which are the worst for her personally. He was choking near the end of it, where she then mounted him and rode him until near orgasm, jumping off at the last second. Then, staring deeply into the mans eyes, she wrapped her soles around his member, and snapped it in an instant. All the girls break into hysterics, and she, through laughing, claim that his screams still make her wet even today. Finally, she untied and threw him into the famous \"devil bug sewer\" near the offskirts of town, where he was probably gang raped with immense pain for the rest of his sad days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, announces it's the next turn for a story, so if they would kindly release you to the next girl, that'd be nice. They kick you away, the inari never finishing you off, and the youko taking out the foot she popped into your mouth at the climax of the story. You crawl around underneath the table, dazed and barely avoiding the grabbing feet of everyone, until a furry set of feet gain a very secure grip on your head, and pull you towards them. She then confirms your fears, and relays the story of how you joined and left their clan, stomping on your face at the point of your rebellion, then betrayal, and at exciting parts, where she apparently was one of the girls who initially stomped your body. By the end of it, you thought for sure your head was about to pop like a grape from a very angry set of very smelly feet.  The girls all now have a very different view of you, much different than just a toy. So the next round of grabbing, smelly feet is much rougher and more violent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime tells a tale of how her and a holstaur traded off a very unfortunate farm boy for years until they he disappeared in the middle of the night. When she starts going into detail about the gang rape traditions of her and her friend, she grows her slimy foot to envelop your face, smothering you, her other creating a vacuum one your penis. But she finishes her story too fast and kicks you back into the crowd. The harpy tells of her claws and how easily they can tear balls apart if push comes to shove, tugging roughly at yours to prove a point to you. </span></div></div>",

They then compete to tell the most gruesome tale of what they have done to a man, each one further exciting the monsters, and further petrifying you. Whenever you struggle, one of them gifts you a swift kick in the balls, the others laughing at the sound and clamping your face harder with their slick and sweaty feet. One shoves hers down your throat, another gently strangling you with her feet, a third teasing your shaft, the others forcing their feet into your hands to massage. You're forced to service all of them, you have no choice until you're finally kicked backwards, exhausted and filthy, into the center of the table. You look around in the darkness, thirty pairs of feet all scrunching their toes, greedily grasping for a turn at you. Disgusted you sit there, in relative safety until the now rowdy crowd of slightly tipsy girls start demanding your return to them, now peering and reaching under the table for their prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few brief moments, you reluctantly decide that you don't want to make them mad or any more impatient, so you return to the masses, allowing the next set of feet to pull you in. The stories go well into the night, each one worse than the last. One claims that her and her friends slew an entire village in one night by stomping and suffocating the locals, purely because one of them didn't want to mate with her. Another throws out a story about how she once took a stick, imapled a mans balls, and pinned him to the ground while her and her friends took turns riding his face, eventually leaving him to a pack of werewolves. Most of the tamer stories involve luring a man into marriage, and tales of romance. You scoff at these, you can't understand how a man would want this. Afterall, your mouth is full of a dark priests toes when you hear this tale, so it's almost funny to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually a kappa goes under the table and retrieves you, setting you atop the now empty table. You refuse to meet anyone's hungry glances when Sam announces the final meal, dessert. Two akanames unfurl their massively long tongues and each take a battered and bruised ball, licking and sucking it, much like you just had to do to their feet. The other monster girls follow suit, and mount the table in an advance to you. The kappa places her webbed feet on one of your outstretched hands, much to your displeasure and pain, a cyclops taking the other under her very under the weather soles. The two akanmes sit on top of your legs, and the youko made a mad dash to your hips, penetrating herself on you. You start to moan alongside her, but as soon as your open your mouth, the bunny girl is there, and with such an intimidating smile that could scare a dragon, she places one her sweat stained soles along your mouth, forcing a good sucking from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of the more human looking monster sit alongside Sam and watch the spectacle of a bird of monster girls tear you apart, gently masturbating under the table. You thrash alongside the youko in orgasm, and laughing sadistically, she places two soles on your penis and pretends to snap it, causing the whole hall to erupt in laughter. She then gets up, still breathing heavily, and joins the bunny girl in torturing you with her feet. The next girl rides you, then the next, then the next, then the next. And you continue getting gang raped until all the girls lose whatever order and rationality in their minds due to lust, and throw themselves upon you, rubbing themselves wherever they can in an attempt to orgasm, even Sam, the humans, and the maids get in on it. You, at the center of this sweaty orgy, are nearly crushed and drowned under their bodies and love juices, each one erupting in orgasm multiple times, as do you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you do inevitably pass out from exhaustion, you awaken in her living room,  a leash running from your neck into the ground, and a small group of girls occupy the smooth white couches surrounding you, shoes, all flexing toes at you. A smells flows through the air, one all too similar to you now, the rancid odor of feet. Sam coughs and speaks to catch you up. \"My my Erik what a night you blessed us with, you'll be awarded greatly for it.\" She leans forward a little, and kicks you into a particularly rowdy group of girls, who pin you to the floor to play with you. \"We went for round after round of orgasm on you, even after you passed out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She shares  a laugh with her guests. \"But we're not done with you just yet. I figured that you'd be a perfect husband for some of my more honored guests last night.\" She gestured towards the girls who are going to town on your face with their feet, who giggle with glee. \"Best thing is, you get to choose for being such a good sport last night! Now there's a lot here, but I'd like to introduce you to a very close friend of mine.  Now Ashley is a very fine youko specimen, I'm sure you remember her from last night, her and her inaris are from the local spa. A very nice woman and real provider.\"  She nudges you with her socked toe and you groan and look up at your enslavers. Ashley is nyphomaniac, and you'd spend the rest of your life under her, so you look back up for your other option.. \"Oooor you can stay here with me for the rest of your life, entertaining at all of my parties. Wouldn't that be exciting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really don't want to marry either girl, you want to get up and leave, but you're secured to the ground, so you'll play along...until your first chance to escape of course. They all retract their feet to let you sit up and make your decision. \"Now buddy, whenever you make your decision, bow and kiss the feet of your new wife. Grovel to her, make her feel special. Don't want to get your marriage off on a rocky start do we ?\" You really hate yourself for coming over here yesterday, now you're enslaved to absolute psychos who have an obsession with feet. Since when did monster girls love feet so much? You make some sounds of disagreement at your situation, but eventually you kiss your dignity goodbye and kiss who's foot, sealing your marriage and your fate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're in a terribly dire situation, facing two paths of eternal enslavement to very sadistic women. Sam would be the death of you, her parties and strict rules would quickly wear your already damaged body down to nothing. Ashley is a sex addict, and her inaris seem like they'd be demanding, but you figure your wife would be very selfish of you, so it's a relatively easy life. You pick up sams foot, and bring her foot to your face, acting as if you're about to kiss it, then you throw it to the floor, causing a shocked gasp to escape from the crowd. Ashley screams in excitement and starts lightly kicking and tapping your face with her feet, which you reluctantly kiss. If looks could kill, sams stare would be a nuclear holocaust, but your new wife excitedly cuts your old leash, redoing it with a hot pink one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVisibly shaking with joy, she stands up and thanks Sam for such a gracious gift, who in return forces a smile and congratulates her on her husband. \"Sorry friend, but I really really want to put this thing to the test. You're okay with that though right?\" Her host dismisses her with a hand and goes back to a conversation with the rest of the monster girls, a fate you just narrowly avoided. But your other fate, the one you chose, involves you being led through the streets naked to Ashley's spa. It attracts a few teasing remarks and odd looks, but you get there nonetheless and are now being dragged, choking, to her office in the corner of the establishment. It's a pretty good looking establishment, polished oak hardwood floors, shrubbery and massage tables scattered throughout, with inaris tending to every customers needs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you can't look for long, as you're dragged into her room, the door shuts, and you're uncollared, but quickly shoved under a desk. Ashley hangs it up next to a whip and handcuffs, both intentionally in plain sight of where you sit. You're very surprised when she doesn't return immediately, so listening intently, you hear her shuffle through papers in a file cabinet. You wonder what it could be while looking at what you can from under her desk. It's not much, straight ahead of you it's her office chair, a gray and battered thing, to your right it's a very healthy plant, and to your left it's a...oh she's already kicked off her shoes. She then comes back and slides a piece of paper to you, marriage certificate already bearing her signature. You, terribly distraught, sign it and hand it back to her. She leaves to go find a messenger to get this to a court, telling you to sniff her shoes to get you stirring for when she gets back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes at this, and when she leaves you take this as an opportunity to find anything of use in here. You spring up and start going through all her drawers and file cabinets, and there's not much, to your disappointment. There's your typical stuff, tax papers, a stapler, some pins, a couple pens, a calculator, one drawer with just shoes and other sex toys, and some glue. You sigh at your new life and sit back down beside her flats, which you throw away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before the door opens, and her kimono hits the floor. Oh right to it, good. She then sits at her seat, her dripping maw eye level with you, her feet resting on your knees, and you edge forward, ready to eat her out. But then she puts a foot up and pushes you back to the back of her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh uh hubby, give me a refresher of what you can do to feet first, I need to decide if the inaris are going to spend the night with you to train or not.\" God she really is sadistic, but you take one foot with both hands, and massage it thouroughly, working out any possible kinks in it. You take an hour or two doing that, just kneading her feet, then having her gag you with one and smelling the other. It's not the best scent or experience, but certainly not the worst. From what you can tell, although they're sweaty, she keeps them well cleaned, and they only slightly smell of actual grime, a more prominent smell being a faint hardwood-sweat smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's only after those hours of your working, and her moaning, does she take her legs and wrap your head with them, pulling your face roughly into your ripe and soaking cunt. You grip the chair and start licking, her squeaking around to gain even more friction. By now you hear her paperwork get crumpled in her hand, and her pen drop onto the floor. She's now moaning loudly and guides your head with her hand and instructing you. Screaming, you think her legs are going to decimate your skull based on how hard she holding you to herself , her love juices getting rocketed down your throat, followed by a torrent of piss, much to your thrashing and her amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then sits breathing heavily, until she coughs, stands up, and goes to close the blinds to her establishment. \"Haha probably should've paid attention for that huh? It's okay though, pretty slow day, mostly just my workers who could've seen that. Hey, would you mind being a dear and grabbing that pen I dropped?\" You reach out for it, but Ashley's quicker, and she pins your outstretched hand underneath her foot.  You look up at her, and she gazes down from between her massive nude breasts with lust in her eyes. She then takes you right there on the ground, mounting your face for round two. This time she does it much slower, riding your face quite casually. Of course you don't have air trapped under her and you start frantically tapping her and pulling at her waist, which only causes her to clamp down and speed up, eventually riding you vigorously and roughly. Nearly blacking out, you gasp for air when she dismounts, which she takes as an invitation to stick her feet in your mouth and on your nose, completely changing your air to that of which smells like her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, she gets up and mounts your dick. \"What a honeymoon we're having my love, but I'm ravished, fill me up won't you?\" She then rides you to your orgasm, which comes pathetically quickly, and she sighs in disappointment at you. For  \"punishment\", she raises a foot above your face. It's incredibly callused and yellow, but still incredibly yourhful, not a single wrinkle is to be found of her soles or arches. She hovers it above your face, wiggling her toes and thinking out loud about what she could do with these dogs of war if she set her mind to it. You gulp in fear, remembering what she said last night about breaking a mans dick in half. She then puts her foot down, walks over to her flat, pulls out a sock from where her toes would normally sit, comes back, stuffs it in your mouth, tapes it there, then pinches your nose shut with her toes. It's potent, much more than her feet, and tastes strongly of dirt and has the aftertaste of a different kind of wood, sandal wood. Yeah it's not hers, it's one of her workers. But you can't think ok why she has her workers sock in what's been established as her shoe because you're quickly running out air. After a brief struggle, you make the awful mistake of pushing her off your face, and she almost falls over. Now she's mad and goes to town, kicking and stomping and smashing your balls into a fine paste until you stop moving. Then she takes the last bit of consciousness from you by suffocating you under one of her larger calluses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awake you have your hands and ankles handcuffed together behind your back, and when you try to move, you very painfully realize your balls are also handcuffed to your ankles and hands. Did your \"wife\" decide to hand you over to her tired and undoubtedly horny workers or are you bound in her house?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley might be the more pleasant choice, she'd never let you go, and Sam might leave you untied accidentally someday. That would be your chance, all you have to do is survive this mad sex circus of a house until then. You bow low and gently place your lips upon the top of Sam's socked foot, provoking excited chatter among the monster girls. The youko doesn't seem too displaced, probably because she's going to get fair use of you either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww how adorable, you'd really want to marry into this? Do you know how happy that makes me?\" She moans out to the group. \"Girls I think we got another party tonight! Gather up everyone this time, it's a big celebration!\" With that she takes your leash into her hand and stands up. \"Me and my new husband have to get ready!\" With that, she drags you away from the snickering and clearly aroused crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, we have to get you a new name, yours is too...independent now. Then we have to get you clothed.\" She looks up and down your nude form with a mix of distaste and interest. \"Finally, we have to get you ready to accommodate such a wild crowd, we're going to have basically everyone we can find for this bash, and it's going to be weeks long. God the kimikoras have a long day of preparations for tonight. Oh well, sit.\" You hesitate and she adds discipline to the list before delivering a swift nut shot and shoving you into a very large dressing room and shutting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lady stands in the corner, her bottom half a spider, her top half a woman, and Sam introduces her as a personal tailor and best friend, Natalie. Natalie smiles, spider crawls towards you, and starts measuring. \"Well who's this darling Sam?\" She gropes you and snickers, \"not the best catch you've ever brought home either\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Grime and he'll be the husband of the house from now, now he'll need a special outfit for around the house duties, but you're acquainted with that design yes?\" You hate the name Sam's given you, and you fear her costume for you. Natalie gets to sewing and weaving the new clothes from silk being produced from her rear, which is hypnotizing, and Sam starts changing into more casual wear in clear sight of you. You avert your eyes from both of them, which eleictis a giggle from Sam. \"Can't even look at your own wife huh? Pathetic.\" She yanks at your leash and continues dressing with you now under her, staring up. It's intimidating, and your face goes beat red, your groin stirring at her meat folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie turns and laughs too. \"Ooh what a nice couple you two make, not afraid to show affection. Sadly I got to see if this fits.\" She pulls you away and slips a harlequin of clothes on you. You look like a jester, most likely the intention, and your dick and balls are exposed by a hole in the front, another likely intention. They both stand back now and ponder if that's suitable before guffawing at your humiliation. Sam asks Natalie to finish the final details, drawing a vile grin from the spider girl. In a flash of speed, she tackles you to the ground and binds you there with her spider silk. Sam steps on your face then sits couple feet away. Standing over you, four legs on either side, she markers a crude design to your face before retreating to go get some other supplies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh I need to freshen up, you don't mind helping right? After all, you are a devoted husband?\" She peels a sweat stained sock off her foot and jams it into your mouth, the other following suit. \"If you thought what we did to you while you were conscious was evil, you wouldn't believe what we did to you after you passed out.\" She looks up, fantasizing about how she's going to up it tonight. \"My feet are probably the sweatiest they've ever been from the dance party game we had on your chest. I'm telling you, you really missed an opportunity with that Ashley girl. She knows how to have a good time.\" She laughs at that and starts massaging her soles on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two can't seem to stay apart for long huh? I wish I had as a devoted husband as that.\" Natalie is now holding a paint can and a red ribbon. She squats down to your shaft and opens the paint. Sam conceals your eyes with one foot. \"Haha oh yeah, no peeking silly boy.\" She pats your shaft head lightly, and applies the first set of paint, which is shockingly cold and causes you to jump, causing everyone to laugh. Then repeats this a couple more times to only your balls, before wrapping your shaft with the ribbon, which only then does your \"wife\" let you see her friends masterpiece. She painted your balls blue, how funny, how incredibly funny, even funnier with the red rocket ribbon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer and Natalie get up and stand to the side, snickering and gesturing towards your bound self on the floor. The word discipline and feet are the only ones you hear, and when they come back, they relay the plan to you. \"Okay so here's the game plan, you're going to start by crawling around the table again like last night, but instead of going right to sex, we got some games instead. I have a whole warehouse of slaves a couple towns over where the main port is, and we're going to give the winners some of them.\" Natalie, getting into this, sits as best as a spider can, resting one hand on your penis, crushing it against your waist. Sams still stretching her sweat infused feet across your cheeks, starts describing the games. \"So the first game is a simple strength test. Whoever can pin you the quickest gets a slave, that'll get them excited for the next ones. Then we have a dance party, and I'm hoping the bigger girls don't cave your chest, followed by a calm game while you recuperate. The finale is a chase through the house, finished by you being passed around. We might have an after party of course, with a grander strength competition and a study regarding how quickly a man can pass out from suffocation. Doesn't that sound like great fun?\" She takes both feet, grabs your head, and forces a nod from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really, truly, honestly hate yourself for coming back, but you're resigned to your fate now. Natalie cuts your binds, and with Sam graciously thanking her,  Sam leads you out of the room and back into the living room, now empty. Two kimikoras are summoned and take you back to their quarters downstairs, a lavish basement decked out with master beds and hardwood floors, gems decorating the marble that encompasses the wall. \"Discipline huh?\" One leashes you to a bed, presumably hers, sits, and nudges your ribbon with a big toe. You twitch, but decipher her nudge as needing a good foot rub and pick her foot up, attempting to work past her scales while massaging. She looks at her companion in confusion.\"Thats pretty disciplined to me, don't you think?\" The other agrees, and they both shrug, guessing they got a free hour or two with you. The maids periodically switch out, each getting a small foot rub or licking from you, anything to alleviate the work on their feet for a while. The scales provide a challenge, and feel very odd to lick, though the taste isnt much different than that of another monster girl, if not a bit rougher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they reluctantly spit you back out to the clutches of Sam, who eagerly grabs you and sets you down to service her in the living room. She gets your tired tongue to berid herself of any sweat she didn't rub out on your face earlier. \"Hey honey, you wouldn't be opposed to further cleaning me right? After all, it does say i love servicing on your forehead.\" She prods your exposed balls with one foot and you nod slowly, fearful of any answer to her. She smiles at your obedience and kneels to your level, pulling your face into her arm pit, which you immediately start licking. After a while of licking all her potential sweaty areas, she stands and drags you by your leash to the great dining hall that you passed out in last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sends you off to the kitchen again while she takes her place at the head of the table, waiting for the guests to start trickling in. Sure enough, the table fills incredibly fast, but the maids goes across the hall and open the doors to the ballroom, set up as a dining room for tonight, which still doesn't accommodate the full roster of guests, so they fill up the living room and some of the other kitchen/dining room which connects to the living room. It's a mad house and you're supposed to service all of them in what's supposed to be a multi week long party. It's absolutely terrifying to you and you think about just hiding in the kitchen, but a couple of kikimoras see you cowering and threaten to physically throw you out into the crowd if you don't go willingly. You take a deep breath and crawl out the kitchen doors, into the horde of horny and rowdy monster girls, knowing full well they all went through great lengths today to dirty themselves up just for your misery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of girls stop chewing and boasting about their accomplishments with men when they see you in your costume and burst out into laughter, a deafening sound when done by so many. A monster girl of almost every type seems to stick their soles out at you at once, a sickening smell fills the air, one of grime and sweat, filth and scum, eagerly awaiting your tongue and hands to service them. Gagging, you force yourself to crawl towards the large oak table against all their teasing and jeers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You tell Maria that'll you'll go over there immediately, and be back in a  hurry to spend the day with her, to make up for your mistakes.

Listen I got a great youko friend who runs a spa entirely run by her and some Inaris. They got enough staff for the customers, but they desperately need someone to help the staff needs out.\" You become a little fearful of that, but you need money pretty badly, the quicker out of this town the better. You follow all the directions she gave you, three blocks down, left, right, left, left. Yeah that's it, a pretty nice looking white brick complex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the doors and have look around for this youko, the boss, and see an office to your right, which you knock on its door. A soft and silky voice invites you in. Upon opening the door, you groan, there's a fox looking lady with four tails, and feet propped up on her oak desk. You go back to the last time you saw this with the bunnies and you back up a step instinctively. She smirks and beckons you forth into a chair with her finger. At least her feet are covered with a pair of flats. Her voice then breaks the uneasy silence, \"Hey, you must the boy Maria spoke about. I don't know if she told you, but we are in desperate of personnel for our staff. They massage feet all day, and it really gets them craving it too. You understand don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You gulp and start to get up from the chair, and apologizing. Then she opens a drawer, pulls of a big bag of gold and plops in front of you. Maybe you can endure this. Just for one day though. Then you're buying your stuff and leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, you got here before my girls even started their shifts.\" She peels her heels off with the corner of her desk. \"Let's finish this interview with a skill evaluation shall we?\" You think hard about the money you're getting, and scoot your chair over to where she can reach you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plops one foot on each of your knees. For being the head of a spa clinic, they're in rough shape. Big yellow calluses rule the landscape of her soles, but her toenails are painted with a fresh coat of brilliant shade of green, so you guess that it balances out? Shaking your head, you pick up one foot and start massaging it, kneading her small foot in all the right ways. It's not long before her other foot finds your crotch through your pants, rubbing slowly at first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe motions you closer, now biting her lip, and asks you put her foot in your mouth. You reluctantly oblige and start sucking off each of her toes, swallowing small amounts of toejam here and there. They're actually quiet clean feet compred to the rabbits, but now she's rubbing with ferocity. Just as youre about to burst, she lifts her foot and switches. Now one foot rests in your mouth, her other dangling just in front of your bulging manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan with impatience,you haven't come yet ok your journey despite having been with many girls. You raise your hands to help yourself, but she angrily kicks you hands away, then wraps her legs around you head, pulling you rather abruptly off your chair, and falling face first into her groin. You struggle for a moment before resigning yourself to this. She's wearing a dress with no panties on underneath, so your job is clear and easy. She tugs you in the direction of her dripping cunt, and you start sucking and licking as if it's a foot. It works wonders, and she's brought off in to time, kicking you away in her bliffsful throws of orgasm. You begin to stand before she shoves you down with her feet. And there you lay until you hear the whistle of lunch break, when she kicks you out into the waves of workers heading to the break room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're quickly picked up and taken along by a small group of inaris, who are kimonos with socked sandals. After a short trip of being carried, you're laid down on the ground and have each arm and leg tied to a separate table, where about twenty blonde haired girls sat around and stared you while eating their assorted meals. You start to ask what you need to help them with, but one older girl kicks off her wooden sandals, having them land loudly in the corner behind you, and brings down one socked foot across your face. The sound of many many wooden clacking sandals hitting the ground follow, and you feel warm and sticky cloth cover you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one who first put her foot on you, raises her other foot, and you can see the dark outline of it through the whiteness of her sock, before she brings it under your nose. The smell of a couple hours worth of work fill the small breakroom, and although it's nothing like the rabbit feet, it's still not pleasant, and you inevitably start squirming under their grasp. Some of them take off their socks, dip their feet in their remaining food, and have you suck it off their arches and toes. It's the first food you've eaten too ,besides snacks here and there, since you started your journey and you eagerly slurp it up, much to their joy. Before long though, the bell rings, and one inari unties one hand for you to help yourself before rushing off to join her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're some tough knots, but you get through it and wander out of the break room back towards the youkos office to collect what's yours. When you enter though, the Youko is completely nude, sprawled along the floor, the sack of gold resting up against her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes, go to pick it up, and are grabbed and pulled down to the floor alongside her. \"One last time from your favorite girl okay buddy?\" You meekly think of grabbing the gold roughly and leaving, but she has an army of Inaris outside, and she'd definitely tell Maria. So you sit and let her strip you, and mount your face. This time she's not so gentle and roughly rides you until she soaks you in juices. You grab the sack of gold, quickly clothe yourself, and open the door, ready to step out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe calls after you. \"You can suck our feet anytime you want! I got plenty of gold!\" The door is open, so everyone in the complex heard her remark. Your face goes red, and you hurriedly walk back to the inn.</span></div></div>",

You know you only have seconds before they're upon you, and yet  in trying to lose them by taking drastic turns and maneuvers, you make a fatal mistake. When you were running, you neglected to check what your path consists of, tripping over a small branch in the ground. You turn to see where the two girls are, and sure enough, they're standing angrily above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to scramble backwards, that Margaret ceases that action by firmly putting her foot down on your crotch. Now squirming under the threatening pressure, you start to beg and plead for mercy, which they scoff at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made us run through the thick underbrush, chasing you after you rudely pushed us over, and you now expect mercy? Ha!\" She takes a stick from the floor and swats you with it until your shirt tears, leaving lacerations across your chest. Then her and Marissa  each take a hand and drag you back to town, not giving you the decency to walk back. There they essentially throw you into their house, an old wooden shack with a dirt floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you embarrass us in front of the village!\" Margaret stomps your balls. \"How dare you make your captors seem incapable!\" She switches off to let Marissa have a go at you. \"How dare you disregard the gift of our feet!\" They both bring a foot down on your crotch. \"How dare you! How dare you! How dare you!\" With each accusation, another shot to your groin. Eventually it ceases, and you, seeing stars, have no more resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both then drag you to some chairs and crudely tie your wrists to the legs, securing you there, where they sit and attack you with their still angry feet. Marissa is furiously rubbing her feet along your cheeks and her older sister has pantsed you, and expertly giving you a rough footjob in such a way that it hits every bruise they just gave you, sending excruciating pain through your body instead of pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n But she doesn't give you the satisfaction of cumming, and leaves you her sister, disappearing into the kitchen to make dinner, Marissa's already feeding you her toes though. You now wish you didn't run, her feet are drenched in sweat and dirt and vegetation from the forest and you wretch at the taste. Giggling, she teases you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw Margaret would you look at him? He's in such misery, awwww poor baby, you shouldn't have ran huh? Now you gotta lay here allllll night, licking and sucking our feet. How do they taste? I can't imagine it's too good, there's soooo much sweat on these little things.\" She scrunches her foot on your face, leaving a sweat stain along your face, and the house fills with laughter. \"Oh I could've simply killed you earlier.\" She demonstrates it by pinching off your air for a brief moment. \"Sniff. Sniff deeply. Then suck, suck to your hearts content my little slave.\" Now she laughs with maliciousness. You reluctantly obey, using your tongue to remove the filth from her arches and toes. It's a vile job, there's just so much dirt, now salty from her sweat, it's gagging. Margaret relieves her after a couple of minutes to stir the pot while she gets a turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretches herself along your now smelly face with her smelly feet. \"You thought my sisters toes smelt bad?\"she laughs \"no no no, these things could kill from the smell alone.\" She proves her point by jamming her sole up against your nose,and it's true,you almost faint immediately from them. They're just so ripe and earthy. \"Now suck, and breathe deeper.\" She takes her other foot and invites herself to your mouth, grabbing your tongue with her toes and using it as a scraper, ridding herself of the thick, cakelike layers of dirt and sweat that had accumulated over the day. Her little sister now waddles back, but before she goes, she takes a look at your balls. \"God, we really did a number on these huh sis? They're almost a fine paste honestly. Maybe it's just better if we amputate, what do you say to that boy?\" You frantically mutter your no from your occupied mouth, Marissa giggling for her feet are being mumbled into. \"Yeah maybe not yet,we still have to have him impregnate us right sis?\" Marissa blushes a deep crimson red and excitedly nods, her older sister agreeing. \"But we're going to have to sterilize your wounds, we don't want that getting infected.\" She pulls up your pants and leaves to finalize the soup dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay under marissa, who is veracious in what she wants, tugging at your hair, ears, and tongue with her bunny feet, a truly disgusting thing. It isn't much longer until she's called off into the kitchen, and they both come out holding a red hot pot of soup, which they set down dangerously close to your crotch. You pull at your restraints, trying to talk them out of whatever they're going to do, but they lift the pot and your pants, pouring the scolding soup directly down the front of your adventuring pants, giving a nice burn to your already destroyed dick and balls. You scream, a scream that makes both of them visibly excited, before they silence it with a sole to the mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it too much for them and they move right onto games? Or do you need to clean them off more?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You lie in this deep pit,deep enough that you can't get out, but narrow enough you can't move freely. Then again, you can't move, you're competent bound up and you probably have a lot of broken bones from the bunny dance party. Speaking of bunnies, you can hear them chittering to each other about what they should do with you. It's ghastly either way, but you're honestly too battered and tired for this, and you fall fast asleep your dirt hole prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're rudely awoken by some tugging on the ropes that bind you, they're pulling you out. You hope and pray you get a third chance, but you also know some monster girls don't even give you a first redemption, so you anxiously look around to see the facial reactions of the girls, which isn't too helpful. Some are smiling ear to ear in a very evil way, and some are looking a little disappointed, either things could go both ways so you look to who's pulling you up. It's a team of three or four really buff bunnies who, as soon as you're out of the hole, start dragging you towards a large hut. In this hut, you are forced to your knees to bow to a girl they call the Bunny Queen, an extremely old and decrepit rabbit. She extends her foot, which is full of blisters and calluses. You instinctively pull your head back, but one of the buff girls shove you down and over to her, where she cups both of her wrinkly feet over your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a shaky voice she states that you have committed inexcusable acts of disobedience to the rabbit kind along with assault and multiple other offences. You stop listening after a while, because the smell of granny feet is making your stomach turn and you know if you vomit on the queen, there's definitely no appeals, so you focus on survival instead of the trial. That task is much harder than you originally think it could be because that sick lady pops an especially blistered toe in your mouth and starts swirling it around. You're about to turn away to get a break from her but you're pulled out from under anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear that worm? Guilty! Guilty and the punishment is death!\" The crowd starts cheering and your face pales. You're dragged outside, crowd taunting and screaming in anticipation, but above it all, you can hear the old queen cackling. Then your tied spread eagled in the middle of town and the crowd circles around you, all grinning now, and at any moment looks like they'll spring on you. You know what a couple of feet feel and smell like. It's not fun and you're not looking forward to finding out what's a towns worth is like. What seems to be like the newest adult in the town is shuffled forth, quite nervous, but the crowd insists she get first dibs. After all this will be her first man. She circles you for you what seems like enternity, looking for an ideal spot to be in before the crowd gets in. Then she stops and plunges, dead weight, down on your crotch, spearing her. With her scream of pure ecstasy, the crowd pours in. At least twenty-thirty-fourty pairs of feet cover your face in an instant, blinding every sense you have. One foot alone covers your eyes, twenty fight for dominance of your nostrils, and the rest tug at your ears and hair. The smell alone makes you feel dizzy, the feeling of all the grabbing and fighting makes your head feel like a warzone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of a warzone, the rest of your body gets covered by feet, hands, and every other body part that can be put on you. The girls of the town go to town on your feet, tickling you to no end, and the second you open your mouth, a new level of hell is opened to you. Like water pouring in on a sinking boat, toes, heels, arches and fingers fill your mouth to the brim, exploding your taste bud. Everything these barefooted girls have walked through is now being scraped off in your mouth. And you can't help but laugh through the misery, because girls are tickling you to kingdom come. A soup of dirt, sweat and everything else accumulates in your mouth, and some of the girls pinch it and laugh at your god awful predicament. Some even contribute by spitting in it, and this goes on until a big bunny comes over and dips her foot in your disgusting soup filled mouth, then smearing whatever stick across your face, which then results in everyone doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms are stood and sat on, along with your legs, but your hands are the real treasure from your limbs. While they wait for your penis to to open for them to impregnate themselves, they make excellent use of your fingers to bring them to shrieking orgasm. Eventually your hands are coated in rabbit love juices, the smell only furthering the lust of the hundreds of rabbits all squabbling for a turn at some part of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youngest girl is quickly brought to bliss on your crotch, and is almost dragged off for the next to impale themselves on your penis. Every bunny is determined to impregnate themselves through you. Bunnies almost marathon your little dick, creating a pool of love juices around your base, the only factor being that they slow down enough so that you don't pass out. A couple of girls take it to themselves to have a little extra fun and turn your stomach into a trampoline, making you cough and sputter and roll your head around,which sends the horde into yet another laughing fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis goes on for days and days, eventually with them getting rougher and rougher, of at all possible. The monster girls start with getting horribly drunk at night using you as a living excercise machine/training dummy. Some pump your dick until you pass out, then you wake up tied completely differently, usually a soccer ball or something along those lines. It doesn't go well for you, being passed roughly around and kicked into goals. Then they'll mount your dick again and ride you until dawn in a giant orgy of sweaty soccer players, ending up with them all falling fast asleep. Then they'll all wake up and be too lazy to go use the bathroom somewhere else when they have your mouth at their disposal. Gallons upon gallons of urine fill your stomach, until they want a trampoline again and you'll puke it all up, which they're more than glad to wipe your face in by the way. On the fifth week of this, they start getting really creative in how disgusting they can be. They'll disappear into the woods for days, only to come back with torn up, probably infected, blackened feet, which they'll happily make you suck until they're nice and clean again. You vomit a couple times, which only encourages to them to get them to be worse and worse. Then they capture bugs and small creatures, which they'll place next your face before bringing their heel unto it, all the while, making certain that you know that'll be you when they're through with you. But before going to catch more bugs, they have you suck the dead bug off their heel. They finished the seventh week by locking you in a room with the queen and letting her have her way with you. Your mouth popped her blisters, got rid of and ate her calluses, and chewed off her longer nails, which you also ate. Then she fucked you to next Sunday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the tenth week, most of the rabbits were pregnant, if not already popping out children. So you're work was done, and you were made very clear of it. You woke up that Monday with a small branch that was whittled into a spear being rammed lengthways through your shaft, eventually pinning your balls to the forest floor. Your screams briefly filled the forest for miles around before one of the bunnies sat upon your face and clamped your head like a vice. When she stepped off, juices soaked your faces, and you were gasping for air, not realizing most of the town had now assembled around you.  Then they released you on the promise that, if you got away, you were free. If not, you die. You got about a 30 minute head start, but that ultimately didn't mean anything, for you were quickly found and tackled by multiple rabbits, who dragged you back to the delight of everyone. They threw you down, unbound and let everyone pile upon you. Feet crushed your bones, mouths chewed your digits, hands ripped out your hair, words tore apart your will. Your journey ended in a massive sweaty, dirty, and vile bunny orgy that included food, drinks, a dance party or two, fun games, and one very unfortunate adventurer. What was left of you at the end was a withered, small, corpse that smelled strongly of urine, vomit, and sweat. You were carried through the town, with some small final screwings and foot rubbings out of respect for your endurance, and eventually buried under the gateway to the town, so that everyone entering and leaving would be able to stomp on your memory. </span></div></div>",

It's quite obvious now that you were bluffing, because now you're totally broken at their feet. They one in charge snorts and orders that you be brought around to her side of the table. The other two nudge you up with their toes and half drag/half lead you over to where the head bunny girl is sat upon her chair. When you collapse again, pitifully attempting to appeal to her senses, she rolls her eyes and kicks you under the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sad and pathetic. It would've been much more fun if you resisted. Oh well, hurry up and lick my feet then. Cmon I know you can, remember the little bunny that totally annihilated you earlier? Imagine what I can do if you don't hurry it up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she kicks you a little bit harder, now impatient with the lack of progress. You hurriedly start lapping at the pitch black soles of your new master. She has obviously been doing some work around town, the taste of her arches and heels were disgustly ripe and you pulled your head away after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed away from her work at the desk, picked up her foot to look at it, saw that no work had been done, and glared at you. Then she pulled her leg back as far as it could go, and kicked you square in the face, crumpling your nose and any reluctance left in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up the foot that had just nearly knocked you unconscious and began the process over again, although this time much more eagerly. You managed to get past the sweat infused dirt that caked her sole, just in time for her to jam her foot into your throat, gagging you. Her other foot slams into your crotch, initiating convulsions in your body that last for what seems like hours. Then she removes her foot and lifts the other to your face. </span></div></div>",

She giggles at this, then turns back to doing whatever she's doing at her desk. Not wanting to anger her further, you tenderly take her sole and raise it to your mouth, doing whatever you can to avoid further damage to yourself. After a while of licking, sucking, and overall worshipping, you notice her moaning. She's obviously enjoying her newfound recreation underneath her desk, and you vainly hope that this means they'll go easier on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually retracts both of her feet from you and begins scrutinizing them. She's blatantly looking for mess ups, though you don't know if that's possible, you could eat off of them now, not that you would want to, considering the dirt, grime, and sweat that was on them not 20 minutes earlier. Then she stops suddenly, and smiles down at you on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job pet, I'm glad i didn't have to crush your skull in today, I really wasn't in the mood to wash blood of these today.\" She stops talking for brief moment, flexing her toes extremely close to your face, showing you where your brains could've been if you hadn't complied. \"But now I'm done doing all this hard paper work up here,I think it's time I get some rest and relaxation don't you think?\" She uses her feet to grip either side of your head and makes you nod up and down. \"Aw you do? Isn't that sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, there's not a moment to think or talk before she throws her legs behind your shoulders, pulling you closer to her hips.

Just as your about to make contact, the door gets a violent knocking.</span></div></div>",

Her pet's mouth was just about to pleasure her beyond all realms she had previously known, but she had to release her lips from a bite and answer the door, which she wasn't too happy about doing. She took your hair in one hand, yanked you away from her vagina and stood up, dragging you by the skull towards the front of the room, where the knocking had grown impatient. She only acknowledged your noises and movements of pain through a couple expletives, but those could've been mostly from being denied an orgasm. When the rabbit girl got to the entrance, she tossed you by your hair into a wall, where your body crumpled, rattling the hut. A heated discussion started as soon as the door was opened, obviously about what to do with you, and the census came up with you having to be initiated into the clan for being such a good little bunny slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour one captor turned into four captors and they all picked you up, escorting you out back where a very primitive cage was stationed, your new home. There they collared and leashed you with a spiked vine, then branded a slave marker into your neck with burning hot coals, ending the process with the honor of kissing all their feet and thanking them for such lavish awards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good good slave, I mean special community member.\" The tormentor shared a snicker with the other three girls. \"Now, before you can be introduced to the rest of our society, you need to be properly trained don't you? Yes you do, yes you do.\" She bent over and slapped her knees, as if beckoning a dog. Then to further cement that idea, she wrapped your leash around her wrist, opened the cage, and had you follow them on your knees to a secluded area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter crawling behind them for an hour or two in the forest, with them pulling on the leash every so often, digging thorns into your neck, they stop in a clearing with a small brook making up the southern border. This is where another one steps in. \"First step is discipline. You will learn to obey whatever we say. First command, clean our feet, the walk through the dirty forest made them all filthy. Now roll over so we can do this easily.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to turn around to lay on your back, but apparently it's not quick enough, and they all kick you down into the desired position. There, the four toned ladies sit and extend their feet towards you, a filthy pile of soles. You wretch at the dirt  caked feet, the irritated and reddened soles, a couple leaves hiding between their toes, the stomach turning smell, and you turn away instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a clear mistake and the girls quickly go to correct it, pinning your head underneath their powerful arches, each one scrubbing away the days work on your nose and cheeks, swirling their toes in your hair. You would naturally struggle, but the putrid smell completely wipes you out and you lay in defeat. They do this until they feel that you've learned what discipline is and start their next challenge. You gaze up at them with your now pitch black and smelly face, a funny sight for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that we've gotten feet out the way, lick us clean.\" The one who said this stretches her arms up, presenting you with an armpit. You suppress a groan and sit up, pressing your face against her sweaty hair under her arm. Two girls each grab an arm, pulling them behind your back, and the third pressing your head against the armpit harder. The smell isn't pleasant, but the taste and odor you prefer to feet most definitely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there you're passed around to each armpit, then your face is aggressively grabbed and made to face the biggest and most buff bunny girl there, where she locks you into a deep kiss. There she unleashes a torrent of spit from her mouth to yours before shoving you away. \"Swallow.\" A simple command, but one she watches you reluctantly perform with hungry eyes. \"He's doing better since this morning, I'll give you that.

Thhe two who held your arms earlier now sit atop your hands. The buff girl stands up and out of your view, hopefully staying out of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey command you to do your absolute best or the buff girl will destroy you, and you eagerly comply, licking and massaging wherever and whatever you can, as quick as you can, starting a mass humping frenzy across your body. Just as they're about to release themselves, you feel an abused weight come crashing down onto your stomach. You scream into the damp underside of the first monster girl, and tense your fingers in the other two girls, causing all three to break into a piercing screech of ecstasy, soaking you in the aftermath of love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm, girls would you say he's ready? He's passed all the tests, but we've been working pretty hard today, how about a teensy amount of...destruction?\" You gulp in fear, and fear is right, one grinds her heel into your hand.  You open your mouth to beg, but you really want this to be over, no more obedience training, so you close your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah teach him customs!\" All the girls chant about customs and so the heel crusher caves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay pet, we're a pretty relaxed society, but you have to figure out what happens if you disrespect people around here.\" She motions to her friends, who approach  your balls. She sits down and holds your head so you can watch. They all lift their feet and hammer into you, causing even more screams pierce the forest. It's now dark and so they start heading home, and almost as one has you slung over her shoulder, the bushes rumble and trees shake. </span></div></div>",

You managed to get through the first foot, but this is too much, and despite being kicked into high hell a few moments ago, you hesitate again. The smell of her foot is quite possibly the worst thing you have ever experienced,worse than garbage, worse than sewage, worse than rotting fish, it was vile and you back up into the furthest corner of the desk (which isn't that much further but it feels safer nonetheless). She probes around with it and soon finds you, lowering her foot onto your now weeping face. The look isn't that much better than the smell, it's blacker than a crow, full of little pebbles and dirt, and is glistening with sweat. The closer her foot gets to you, the more details are revealed to your poor eyes and nose. You can see little bug legs that she has crushed underfoot, blades of grass that'll you be forced to swallow, and the stale smell of sweat becomes unbearable. She's wiggling her toes as she descends upon you like a cat on a mouse, but you grasp her ankle and hold it there. Shocked, she doesn't force her way further down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"if I have to kick you back into place one more time, you won't be moving anywhere anytime soon, so release my foot at once and beg for mercy.\" Her eyes pierce into your soul, you gulp and look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a quiet and reserved response, you eek out, \"wait wait wait, please, I'll do anything, just no more feet, I beg of you! Hard labor, cleaning boy, even toilet scrubber! Anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs. \"We have been enslaving young men, no young boys like you for eons for only two purposes, more bunnies and more feet cleaning.

You're a sobbing wailing mess on the ground with a bunnies foot placed firmly on your head. You never expected your journey to end like this, a slave to one of the weakest races of monster girl out there. But you lay there, letting it happen, and she inserts her filth infused foot into your mouth, using your teeth to scrape off every wreckage she has attached to her foot. For what has to be hours, she removes calluses, toe jam, pebbles, dirt clods, dead and dying insects, food scraps, toenails that are a tad too long, and everything else that has the unfortunate fate of getting stuck to her foot, all while using your mouth. To make things worse, everything that she removes, she makes you swallow like the garbage disposal you now are. <br>\r\nEventually,stepping on your face with one foot, and your crotch with the other, she stands up and grabs both of your wrists. She then drags you outside and leaves you there, loudly declaring that anyone who wants you can have you.

You quickly become the center of a violent lustful brawl of kicking, pulling, grabbing, biting, tackling, all of which you bear the brunt of. Finally one group of rabbits appear to win out and pull you away to a calmer area. Are they a group of bunnies that just got done working,leaving them extremely sweaty and in need of someone to help clean them off?

You don't waste a moment in rising up from under the desk and making a dash for the door, no longer thinking about consequences or anything besides freedom, now just across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it within reaching distance of the doorknob before you fall on your side, abdomen obliterated. That rabbit had made a startlingly fast recovery and had kicked you with the might of a small train. You reach weakly and rather vainly for the doorknob once again, dreams of freedom shattered, but she quite literally stamps them out by stomping your hand back onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you've really messed up human. You've really really messed up. I tried to be patient with you, I tried to ease you into this society, but noooo you had to continue being difficult.

You can barely scream or begin to try and crawl away before she steps hard on your chest, knocking all the air out of your chest while pinning you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look at up at her with a face of utter defeat, eyes full of stars, and head full of regrets. Before you can do anything she walks up your body, stomping on any sensitive parts, to your face, where she begins hammering away. All the dirt and grime you left on her feet come crashing down onto your cheeks and nose, mouth and eyes. The smell of sweat and blood fill the air, she shows no mercy in her role of executioner. With her powerful legs, things break quickly, and even you can't tell if you're drooling or spitting back up the sweat she just jammed down your throat. She promises to be back to curb stomp your brains out, but not before she takes your miserable crotch out of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks back over your body, breaking both arms and fracturing your legs in the process,, just to make sure you're not going anywhere this time. She then sits in front of your groin, facing you, and grins a maniacal and twisted grin. She takes a firm hold of your penis with both feet, now caked in your blood and her sweat, and starts pumping. Even in your state, it takes immediate effect from the skill and muscle going into the task, but before anything is allowed to come out, she lets go and watches you squirm. When you start to calm down again, she takes both feet, but instead of gripping you and pumping, they grip and break the shaft in an unsettling crunch. Then she uses her heel to pulverize your balls, completely neutralizing anything even if you were to live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely conscious,you watch her in the corner of your eye. She walks around you, admiring her work, then pauses and lifts her leg high into the air. With the speed of a bullet, she brings it down a couple ribs, shattering them. Laughing in sheer joy at finally being able to elimate a pest like you this way, she places the arch of her foot across your neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish you would've just stuck your tongue out and licked my soles huh? Huh?\" She kicks you in the side of the head for every huh \"Huh? Hmmmmm, you know what? I'll give you a second chance, I admire your bravery actually for standing up to me. Say you're sorry and that you'll marry and service me for the rest of your life and I'll spare you!\" Shelifts one vile, dirty, wretched foot above your head, an offering of mercy. You can't say anything because you're jaw is broken from her attack earlier, but you mumble almost as if your life depends on it. She lowers her foot and  cocks an ear towards you. \"What's that? Nothing? You want me to kill you huh? Oh well, we could've had so much fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she raises a foot again and flexes it, showing off each toe as she wiggles it around, and displaying her arches along with the ball of her foot, things that could've been, then rests the arch along your neck. With ever so slitghtly increasing pressure, the air disappears from your lungs, and with the air, your life. She then pisses on your poor excuse for a corpse and lays you as part of the road to the village for days to come, each traveler getting to step on you even in death.</span></div></div>",

The cute bunny girl hops into your path excitedly, grinning and brimming with confidence now, and you see her dirty sole heading straight for your face like a runaway train as she delivers another kick.  You barely manage to throw your arms up in a full boxer's guard to protect your face, but her powerful legs send you flying into a nearby tree, the remains of your practice sword dropped at your side.  You slump to the ground, slipping in and out of consciousness briefly only to find yourself looking up into the bunny girl's smiling face.  This is not how you pictured your adventure at all; wandering monsters are supposed to be easy prey for heroes! If such a weak monster defeated you so easily, how could you ever stand a chance against a stronger one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't get away from me now, cutie~\" she playfully taunts you in her singsong voice.  \"Don't fight it this time; let me mark you with my scent so the other girls know you're mine.\"  Standing over you, hands on her hips, she raises her foot over your face and slowly lowers it, wiggling her cute toes at you.  You try to muster the will to fight back, not liking all this talk about her owning you, but after having been bested by her so easily your pride is as destroyed as your weapon; whatever fire you felt driving you to undertake this quest has been replaced with fear of this bunny girl's feet.  And so you do nothing as her dirty bare foot descends upon your face and starts to wipe itself on you again, leaving a nice dark footprint which causes her to giggle.  She smiles warmly down at you as she continues to spread the scent of her foot, her claim on you, all over your face.  \"Aaw, you really do like me, don't you! It's okay, you won't have to worry about monsters anymore now that you have me to protect you.\"  What's left of your pride stings with every word she says; you scarcely feel like a man anymore, and yet as your self image crumbles, you begin to feel grateful for her kind words and her mercy.  She's being so nice to you despite having kicked your ass, and even though you are thoroughly humiliated by having this weak monster's feet wiped in your face, they are so nice and soft.  You start to feel strangely... comfortable; it crosses your mind that this could be some kind of pheramone sedating you, but you can't seem to focus for long, and so you just relax, accepting your place under the bunny girl's soft feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits down on you again, resting her cushy ass on your pelvis, and after a few more minutes of wiping her feet in your face, you feel her toes gently pressing on your lips.  Without a trace of rebellion left in you, you open your mouth and start to worship her feet, licking her soles and sucking on her toes alternately.  \"Good boy!\" She praises you, and somehow despite being praised like a pet, you feel less taunted and more... happy.  You even smile, trembling at her words a little bit as she pets your brow with one of her toes.  \"You know,\" she says as you continue to lick her feet, \"for us bunny girls, clean feet are a sign that we're married.  Our husbands are expected to clean them for us every day, so if we have really clean feet, everyone knows that we have a devoted husband who always knows his place.  Hee hee, my sisters will be so jealous of me!\" The thought of being her husband would have bothered you before, but now it just feels nice; you even feel happy to see your \"bride\" so excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, the dirt disappears from her feet, leaving her tan soles fully visible, and before much longer, they're completely clean.  You do her soles, her nails, and even between her cute toes, and as you surrender your will, you feel all too happy to do it for her.  Even fulfilled, like you really could do this every day.  The taste of her feet permeates your mouth, and her scent is well rubbed into you now.  Words can't even describe her excitement when she sees that you've cleaned every nook and cranny; she clearly did consider this equivalent to a marriage, and as she picks you up and kisses you full on the lips, it suddenly hits you that you felt it too.  Whether through clever use of pheramones on her part or just your absolute surrender to her will, you find yourself happy to be her husband; she will protect you and take care of you just as you will obey and care for her the rest of your life.  That night you are all too happy to consummate the marriage, and every day after, you lick and rub and worship her feet so that they were never dirty for long.  You spend the rest of your life as the husband and foot slave of a cute, weak, but still far stronger than you, bunny girl.  It's okay though; you are always happy she put you in your place.</span></div></div>",

You're not sure what her motives are, but this is already the second time she's ended up fighting because of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's too dark for you to quickly find where you left your sword, so you run up and tackle one of the bunny girls from behind.  She falls to the ground with a yelp, and another bunny girl turns to help her, kicking you off the first bunny girl's back and letting her climb to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two bunny girls stamp on your chest and arms until you curl up into a ball for protection, then begin toying with you.  A foot presses onto your face, jamming itself up against your nose no matter how you struggle.  Another lands on your groin, rubbing your penis through your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirm desperately, unable to get a breath of air that doesn't smell of rabbit foot, shamefully aware of how tight your pants feel as the other bunny girl's foot massages between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you think you're about to either cum or pass out from asphinxiation, you hear a pair of loud impacts.  Both bunny girls fall to the ground next to you, and Lledra stands over you, breathing a little hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere she was fighting earlier, you see the other four bunny girls running away at top speed, looking somewhat worse for wear... one even appears to have Lledra's dagger sticking somewhat humorously out of her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drow is silent for several moments, as if not sure how to deal with the situation.  She's probably not used to anyone helping her for free.  You even have a faint notion that she's trying to work up the nerve to thank you, but feels too awkward to go through with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes trace down your body, coming to rest on the area between your legs, which still sports a noticeable bulge.  One graceful foot snakes forwards, tapping against your erection and making you jump.  You think you can see a microscopic smile flit across Lledra's face for a moment, but it's there and gone too quickly to be sure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On top of being useless at fighting, you got that hard just from being stepped on by those braindead rabbits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch in embarrassment at the comment, and yet again, you see a brief flash of a smile on Lledra's face.  Evidently teasing you is more comfortable ground for the drow than thanking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you're not going to travel very fast like that,\" she nods at your tented pants \"so I'll lend you a hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLledra squats down between your legs before you can object, and skillfully lowers your pants down to around your knees, leaving your cock bobbing about in the open air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wai-!\" Your protest to slow down fades into a gasp as the drow wraps one slender hand around your penis, squeezing it experimentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me when you're going to cum... this shouldn't take long.\"  Lledra's voice is impassive, but a slight smirk on her face lets you know she's making a jab at your stamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand begins sliding up and down your shaft, making you involuntarily move your hips in rhythm with her strokes.  She alternates squeezing and releasing, speeding and slowing down, seemingly able to pick up instantly on what feels good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLledra's hard-to-read face is definitely showing some mix of amusement and satisfaction as she stares at your flushed and desperate expression.  Every time an involuntary moan or gasp of pleasure escapes your lips, her faint smile widens a bit more.  It seems a drow's sadistic tendencies can be expressed by more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLledra's hand-job technique is every bit as impressive as her fighting skills, and you soon find yourself on the edge of an orgasm without any hope of holding back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start to lose control, you recall Lledra saying that you should tell her before cumming...</span></div></div>",

Even her cheeks have the faintest hint of a red flush to them.  Was she that flattered to hear you ask for her help?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that settled, the two you set off a quick jog, Lledra obviously slowing to let you keep pace with her.  You stop just as night begins to fall, Lledra expertly setting up camp in a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finishes, Lledra quickly strides in your direction...there's quite a bit of intensity to her movements, to the point that you're a little worried.  You can't help but sound a little timid as you ask.  \"Time for training?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLledra nods wordlessly, and to your astonishment, begins stripping you out of your clothing.  You struggle for a moment, but the stinging finger-flick she delivers to your hand makes you pull your arms out of the way.  You wonder just why you need to strip for training, but Lledra doesn't seem in the mood to ask questions yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're stark-naked in moments, then Lledra begins disrobing as well.  Maybe this is some kind of wrestling practice where clothes will be in the way?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts pause as you get a look at the drow's naked body.  She stands confidently, flaunting her body, which is a perfect mix of being fit and full of feminine curves.  As an elf, her face is far more beautiful than any human you've met, and her dark skin gives her an exotic allure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize your penis is swelling with arousal, and you try to hunch down with a hand over it to hide it, but the drow grabs your wrist and pulls it away, reaching down to fondle your erection.  You can't hold back a light moan as the drow's hand skillfully caresses your shaft, and you see her lips curve into that barely visible smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a rather late flash of insight, you recall your wording from earlier: 'please train me later tonight'.  While you were thinking of training at the time, the drow most likely took your words to be related to the handjob she just gave you.  Even if she doesn't seem the type to go around indiscriminately attacking human males like most monster girls, the drow seems to have a bit of a weak spot for human boys asking her to 'train' them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suspect you'll be in for a rather intense night if you leave things as is...</span></div></div>",

A gentle but urgent voice whispers into your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh, don't make a fuss.  I'm here to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head slowly to look, and lose your urge to shout almost immediately.  Standing next to you is a rather attractive woman, who would look strikingly similar to Lledra... apart from her light skin, blonde hair, and a bust a few sizes larger than Lledra's already reasonable pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly an elf, and if the bow on her back and the green tunic with a short skirt she's wearing are any indicator, a wood elf.  You relax a bit further; wood elves haven't generally been known to attack humans without reason.  And if this one wanted to hurt you, she had plenty of opportunities to hit you with an arrow long before you ever saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you've calmed down, the wood elf removes her hand from your lips and smiles soothingly.  \"I'm Eletha.  I noticed that you'd been captured by that <i>drow</i> - she gives a grimace of distaste while saying the word - and decided to help you escape!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a little startled by that; captured?  Lledra's helped you out of a few tight spots, and you've been following her on your own free will.  When you speak up to say so however, Eletha puts her finger to your lips, silencing you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you must be scared, such a young, cute, adorable - you see her face turn a shade of red as she realizes she's getting carried away - human boy being led around by a drow, too intimidated to make a run for it... but don't worry, I'm here for you now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wood elf has apparently jumped to a conclusion on her own and pulls you into a hug as if to soothe your fears.  You end up getting your face pulled directly into her soft and ample cleavage, and you hear her let out what sounds rather like a pleased moan as your attempts to pull free cause you to wriggle about with your face between her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hasn't shown any hostility yet, so you're hesitant to attack her, but she's surprisingly strong despite her slender build, so you end up in the admittedly pleasant situation of having your face in her cleavage for nearly a minute before she reluctantly releases you.  You try to calm your mind in order to eliminate the tent that's popped up between your legs, but don't have much success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-faced and a little breathless, you try to say something to clarify the situation again, but Eletha seems to be in a bit of a hurry and gently cuts you off.  \"Drow are dangerous and unpredictable, so we should leave before she wakes up... sorry about this, but if you panic and make noise right now she might catch us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she leans forwards and plants her lips on yours, passionately kissing you.  Her soft lips feel divine, and her tongue soon slips into your mouth... your head swims with a sudden drowsiness, and you realize the wood elf is using her kiss to inflict some kind of sleep magic on you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the rather impetuous elf's arms take hold of you and lift you up in preparation to leave...</span></div></div>",

The other choice is that Erik can decide to stay with Eletha.

As you get you barrings, the Bunny Girl rolls you onto your back.  You stare up at her as she stands over you, with a foot on either side of your head.

Slowly, ever so slowly, you manage to pry her foot from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like that?\" She asks you with a tilt of her head as she puts her foot on the ground, and you let out a relieved sigh now that you can stop struggling against her leg. \"Then what about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bunny Girl performs a back flip and lands at your feet.

Checking on the Bunny Girl you find her merely unconscious.  \u201cMan even a monster like this is tough, it\u2019s unlikely a human would of survived that strike.\u201d  Discarding you wooden sword you looked down at the Bunny Girl \u201cwell you\u2019re going to make up for breaking my sword\u201d.  Moments later her hands and feet where bound with a rope from you bag.  You hefted her onto your shoulder and headed off down the road, praying not to face any more monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later you were approaching the port.  It had been rather pleasant actually, no more monsters, the Bunny Girl wasn\u2019t that heavy, pleasant weather, and the lovely birds to listen to.  \u2018YAAAAAAA\u201d all of that suddenly ended has the Bunny Girl woke up.  \u201cNONONO this isn\u2019t happening, please let me go\u201d, she continued to whine and plead in a very annoying high pitched voice.  You did your best to simply ignore her, knowing that doing otherwise would only encourage her, but her fidgeting was more difficult.  Has she squirmed around it became rather hard to hold onto her, and has you readjusted your grip you found yourself suddenly griping something very round, and very soft very tightly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEEEEP!\u201d  With a sudden violent thrash the Bunny Girl managed to break free and fall to the ground.  It was rather impressive how fast she got back to her feet and began trying to hop away, even though the ropes still had her completely hobbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome back here\u201d you ordered with an exasperated voice already stomping after her, knowing she wouldn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re a pervert and our battle wasn\u2019t fair so I don\u2019t have to listen to you\u201d She prattled on and on with her eyes closed still trying to hop away.  You snorted at the accusation, if anything the battle was in her favor.  Reaching her gest before she got off the road, you grab hold of her and roughly throw her onto her back behind you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing your boot on her abdomen and leaning down you spoke to her \u201clisten, I didn\u2019t want to fight you, you attacked me, and because of that my sword broke, not to mention what would of happened if I had lost.  Now then you are going to make it up to me, and this can either be easy\u201d you put more of your wait over the foot on her abdomen until you see her wince \u201cor hard.\u201d  You ease up on her \u201cso are you going to cooperate?\u201d  Eyes wide with fear the Bunny Girl hastily the nodded her affirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stayed still and silent the rest of the way into port.  It was easy to forget she was even awake now.  Has you made your way into port however, you could feel her start to shake and her head swivel around rapidly.  Understandable really, this was likely her first time in a human town, or even around more than one human.  You once more ignored her and proceeded to the blacksmiths shop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the girl into the corner you marched up to the counter, throw your bag of coins on the counter and declared \u201cI need a sword.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blacksmith looked through your bag and said with a sour face \u201cyou\u2019re going to need a lot more coins then that if you want a sword.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou griped the counter tightly \u201cwhat?  I saved up for years to have enough to buy a sword.  How am I supposed to fight monsters without a sword?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blacksmith shrugged \u201cthings are getting worse all over.  Fewer shipments of ore come through, and more people than ever are after swords.  I can sell you a knife for what you have but nothing more.\u201d  The Blacksmiths eyes drifted over your shoulder and lingered there.  You turned to see what had caught his attention.  The Bunny Girl was cowering in the same corner you left her in staring back wide eyed at the Blacksmith.  For several seconds more the Blacksmith stared at her before asking \u201cis she yours\u201d without averting his gaze?  When you said she was he said \u201cmaybe we can work out a deal here.

You really weren\u2019t sure what to do now, and that meant your thoughts were scattered and random.  After several minutes of wondering, not really paying attention to your surroundings, you where roused by a tug on your shirt.  Looking back you saw the Bunny Girl.  After leaving the smithy you had untied her, not wanting to carry her anymore, then forgot about her in your pondering, it seems she had continued fallowing you.  For the first time you were struck by gest how young she looked.  Although it was nearly impossible to tell how old a monster girl is  gest by looking at them theme, she had the appearance of a fourteen year old girl and very sad.  Her long ears hung limply behind her head and her eyes where firmly directed down refusing to look at your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you noticed her pointing, and when you looked you sow the town\u2019s main squire being decorated has if for a festival.  A large banner overhead read Monster Girl Tournament.  Brow furrowing in confusing you turned back to her and asked \u201cwhat about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe-Well\u201d she grabbed her left form arm and started twisting a bit before continuing \u201cYou said I have to pay you back, and there should be a prize for wining\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore thinking about it further, you talked to one of the people setting up and found out the tournament was tomorrow (how convent) and the prize money was indeed quite large.  There were many things to consider not least of wich wheter a Bunny Girl could even win.  You took her aside sat her on a bench, and sat down beside her.  \u201cBefore anything else I want to ask you your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced up at you, her eyes a bright amber color. \u201cSylvia\u201d she said quitetly before looking to the ground again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached out gently grabbing onto her chin and guiding her eyes back up to you.  Sylvia stayed there when you removed your hand.  \u201cNow you understand that it is going to be dangerous and you might get hurt?\u201d  She nodded her head.  \u201cAnd that there really isn\u2019t much chance a mere Bunny Girl is very likely to win?\u201d  She nodded slower this time, and her head drooped again, but she looked up at you when you spoke again.  \u201cAnd yet knowing that you still want to enter to try and make up for attacking me?\u201d  She nodded again harder than before, but that sweet expression on her face isn\u2019t what you where hopping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, we\u2019ll need to do sum training for tomorrow\u201d you stood up and rummaged through your bag \u201cbut first you\u2019ll need this\u201d.  You pulled out a plain white spare shirt of yours for her.  You would also give her a pair of pants but there is no way any pants of yours would fit her legs.  Luckily the shirt was so large it nearly came down to her knees.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting it on her wouldn\u2019t stop fidgeting with the cloth (must never have worn clothes before.  \u201cWhy do I have to ware this itchy thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll let you into the library naked\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 \u201cLibrary?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small port town did indeed have a small library but it wasn\u2019t much really.  The whole place was barely the size of the cabin you use to live in, and it at least had a second floor. At least there wasn\u2019t anyone else here to compete with for the only table.   You reached into your bag and pulled out an old book.  Although fairly new the covers had all been worn down by frequent handling.  Handing it to Sylvia you said \u201cthe Complete monsters guide book, volume one, perty much have it all memorized by now, but brought it along anyway.  You can start reading that while I look for other relevant material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou where stopped from moving away by a hand grabbing your sleeve.  You looked back at Sylvia questioningly.  She stared back at you with her big amber eyes and said simply \u201cI can\u2019t read\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 this is going to be a little more complicated\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~1 hour latter~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArge my head hurts!\u201d  Sylvia exclaimed flopping back tilling her chair onto its back legs.  \u201cWhy are we doing this?  When you said training I though you meant Like exercise, and fighting and stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that, you\u2019ll tip over-\u201c \u201cNo I won\u2019t\u201d.  your brow twitched.  \u201cAny physical training the day before a tournament would only weaken the body for the event in question.  Your body simply would not have time to recover.  Therefore we are going over tactics on how to engage monsters common in this reign has our only available means of preparing\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing has Sylvia was still tipped back in her chair, and seamed fare more focused on keeping her balance then listening to anything you had to say, you decided to make your point with a swift kick.  Her chair flew back sending Sylvia tumbling across the floor.  \u201cNow then what are the basics every adventurer needs to know before setting out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuuuugg\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~3 hours latter~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many more books spread out over the table now.  \u201cLet\u2019s review now.  We\u2019ll start with your own Breed.  Strengths, weaknesses, and battle strategy\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeed, agility, and strong legs.  Lightweight and unstable when attacking.  Wait for an attack then go for the legs. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.  Also rember to keep all that in mind and try to figure out what the enemy is trying.  Now Bats\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeed, flight, and sharp claws.  Arms are nearly useless, will usually give up rather than risk damage to their wings.  Go for the arms and pin them to the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u201d.  You continued studying like this for another two hours when you started to notice Sylvia dozing off in her chair.  It was quite late, so you quietly returned all the books to their place, and scooped Sylvia up in your arms.  She stirred in your arms giving a faint mumble that vaguely sounded like a question.  \u201cWe are done studying for today, time to sleep for tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little louder this time she managed to say \u201cbut what about slimes.  We didn\u2019t cover them.  I\u2019ve seen them in the woods\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou passed before answering, there was a reason you hadn\u2019t brought them up.  \u201cSlimes are almost impervious to physical assault, and getting close to them is about the worst thing you can do.  The only options are magic or a few other counter measures we don\u2019t have accesses to.  However Slimes are typically considered to dangerous to tame, so we aren\u2019t likely to see one tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sleepily blinked at you a few times before saying \u201cok\u201d and cuddling into your chest, promptly going to sleep.  Well that was not the reaction you were expecting.  Poor girl must be to tired to properly comprehend.  Oh well you where confident you did everything you could to prepare for tomorrow.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

None of the food here is what you would eat for sustenance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral booths and a lot of sweets later Sylvia was now more concerned with the sights, sounds and tastes of the fair then all the people has she eagerly dragged you around with one arm, the other holding onto the bag with all her treats for latter.

They stood stone faced ans still beside there master who spoke animated to a small gathering showing off.  Sylvia's energetic behavior by comparison drew quite a bit of attention.

Some part of you wanted to be angry, but you couldn't bring yourself to say they where wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden jerk on your arm Sylvia exclaimed \u201ccome on Erik I wana-\u201d but you never found out what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttention!  The Tournament is about to begin!  Will contestants and spectators please make there way to are arena!\u201d  Has everyone filled off Sylvia's large amber eye's looked up into yours, and she must of saw the doubt there.  Before you could do anything she pressed her bag into your abdomen for you to hold.

Having been assigned blue you and Sylvia proceeded to the blue side to wait for your turn to fight.  Which didn't take long has you where immediately called to a Benjamin Thomas and his Goblin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceeded to the arena and checked out your opponent.  The Goblin was short, shorter even then Sylvia, yet still had larger curves.  She was barley covered by two stripes of rough leather, and eagerly swung a bone club of some kind, red eyes glued on Sylvia has she licked her lips.  Sylvia was scared and backed a little further away from her opponent, which was meat by the laughter of the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge steeped into the middle of the ring \u201cAlright the rules are simple contestants shall fight until one yields, is unable to continue or forced out of the arena.  The Judge may call a halt to the match at any time.  Failure to head the judge results in immediate disqualification.\u201d  You looked around and took notice of the many fully armored solders that surrounded the arena.

Anyway we have to hurry if we are going to make it to our match\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the semi finales of our locale monster girl tournament\u201d  bellowed the announcer to the crowed.  \u201cin the blue corner with have a surprising contender, Erik and his bunny girl.\u201d  At the sound of your name you steeped out into the arena.  Sylvia happily bouncing in front waving to the crowed, to no small amount of cheers.  \u201cYes a young boy oh looks like he just walked of the family farm and petite little bunny girl have made it all the way to the semi finals, I fear their luck has run out has their next opponent is Russle and his slime!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d  The rest of the announcer's words fade from your perception has you stare across the arena at your opponent.  The man was wearing a set of robs that just screamed HAY I'M A WIZARED!  At his side has a bright blue slime, extremely plump with a massive plum of simulated wavy hair that covered half her face.  Both wore a smirk of self assured victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but you said there wouldn't be any s-slimes here!\u201d said Sylvia her voice cracking slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe symbol on those robes, this guy is clearly from a magic school.  The only reason this ass hole would be here is for an easy victory.  The symbol in question vaguely resembled a water drop within a gout of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle began and the slime slowly advanced a sly smile on her face, and a messily exaggerated sway of her hips clearly not taking this seriously.  Sylvia backed up away from her \u201cmaster what do I do?\u201d  The obvious fear in her voice hurt you.  You couldn't bring yourself to answer or even watch, eyes focused on the ground.  There was nothing that could be done.  There was no way to fight slims without magic.  Your palms hurt your fists where clenched so tight, has you struggled over whether you should forfeit or not.</span></div></div>",

She was smiling at you \u201cI think I can handle this, so don't worry okay?\u201d  She seems so calm now, you don't understand.  Stunned in surprised you watched has the slime got even closer, before Sylvia turned around, placed her hands on the ground hiking her but high in the air, and began to dig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive stream of dirt flow between Sylvia's legs right into the slime's face.  The slime let out a murky yell while trying to block the dirt, clearly distressed.  She pressed on trying to grab Sylvia, but there was no chance of that happening, has Sylvia just bound to a new spot where the same thing happened again and again.  That was when your eyes widened in shock.  The dirt was being absorbed into the slime.  Over time her color was turning a dirty brown, her movement\u2019s more lethargic, and her form less defined has she started to droop all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of this the slime continued to peruse Sylvia, driven at this point my immense rage.  Just has it seemed the slime was about to get her Sylvia jumped completely over the slime.  After running to the other end of the arena, she sprinted back shoulder down, and talked the slime has hard has she could.  The slime was sent back a couple feet far enough to be knocked out of the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer screamed your victory and the crowed cheered for you has well, but you where to stunned to move.  You where so certain there was no way to win, but then.  Sylvia bounded up to a grate big beaming smile on her face.  All you could do was stammer out \u201chow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a soft giggle she explained \u201cit was how we protected out burrows from slimes.  They don't like it when you get dirt on them.\u201d  I continued to stare bewildered.  Sylvia looked back at me with concern.  Just has she was about to speak again I hugged her, knowing I wouldn't be able to answer any question she asked.  I didn't know what I was feeling right now myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour filthy now Sylvia\u201d I said wiping some mud of her shoulder.  We didn't have time to clean her up has we where immediately rushed off to the final round.  It was no surprise who our opponent was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man from before and his fox girl.  The announcer introduced him 'the viscous Mordici, and his killer fox girl'.  The term killer was an appropriate description for how that fox girl was looking at you.  Before the matched started Mordici jeered at you \u201cthanks for taking out that slime, boy.  It might of actually been a problem for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the match started the fox girl crossed the area and struck Sylvia across the face before either of you could react.  While still reeling from the impact the fox girl garbed Sylvia by the throat and throw her into the center of the arena.  She tried to stand but before she could, the fox girl grabbed her ankle and twisted her onto her back.  One foot stomped onto Sylvia's arm next to the shoulder, she tightened her grip and began to pull.  Sylvia was screaming in pain.  The fox continued twisting, and pulling all with a wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing you knew the fox was much closer to you.  One hand gripping her side where blood dripped between her fingers.  Your bloody knife was clutched in your hand.  She turned to face you.  There was no more joy on her face, only hate, eyes burning red with anger.  She slashed at me, but I side steeped the blow and slashed back at her arm.  You have no idea how you manage to keep dodging her let alone get some cuts in of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile doing that you are also vaguely aware of Sylvia trying to stand, only to fall flat when she puts any weight on her right leg.  You make sure to keep the fox away from her.  There is also the growing sound of Mordici yelling at the fox girl to stop.  And the thought of why the guards haven't intervened yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing even more enraged the fox girl lunged recklessly right at you, slaming into your chest, and knocking you to the ground.  She straddled your abdomen a vice like on your wrist burning with pain till you dropped your knife.  Her other hand scratching deep into your chest.  The anger superseded from her eyes has sadistic pleasure again took it's place.  She licked her lips, then opened her mouth, showing of her many sharp gleaming white teeth has her head slowly descended towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour visions of doom where cut short by the sound of a whip.  The fox curl arched back hissing in pain.  Behind her you could see Mordici with a whip shouting angrely.  Again growling in anger the fox girl stood up to face her so called master, still shouting in at her.  With one swift bunch the fox girl spralled him on the ground where he did not move.  The fact that she did not advance on him tooled you she was still after you.  You had less then a second to act while her back was turned before she would again be on you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two of you simply stand there and stare at each other, each waiting for the other to make some kind of move. Eventually, you grow board of the standoff and slowly raise a hand up as if waving. You give no outward sign that you noticed the Bunny girl tense and look like she was a hairs breath from fleeing. Most Monster girls wouldn't take kindly to such actions after all. Still, you feel much more at ease at meeting your first monster girl. Now if you had the misfortune of running into a Goblin girl, or something of that nature you'd most certainly be much less calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Miss.\", you say in greeting. Out of all the Monster girls in the world, Bunny girls were the ones Humanity had the most knowledge on. They were rarely aggressive outside of a playful manner and seemed to generally enjoy human interaction. Most bunny girls tended to be happy and even a bit bubbly personality-wise, though there was the very rare accounts of some being more shy and timid; much like this one seemed to be if you were reading her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow just because the Bunny girls weren't normally violent unless provoked or cornered, that didn't mean they weren't dangerous. When hungry a bunny girl was just as ravenous as any other monster girl. A bunny girl of her size could easily swallow you down if she grew hungry enough. Still, you were less likely to die from a bunny girl then any other Monster girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving a greeting you simply watched her, waiting to see what she would do. The bewildered look on her face made it clear that she hadn't expected you to attempt friendly conversation and was now very unsure about what she was suppose to do. Thankfully, the young bunny girl eventually gave a friendly, if hesitant, greeting back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello.\", answered the girl as she shuffled in place; she was clearly afraid of you and likely ready to start running at a moments notice. She seemed nice enough though, so you pondered on trying to make conversation with her for a bit. Figuring you had no real reason not too, you continued talking to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This road is a bit of a distance from the closest rabbit warrens, isn't it? Mind if I ask why a young bunny like you is hopping around here, especially since you seem rather jumpy?\" You hoped the questions wouldn't set her on edge, but they were rather valid questions as the warrens were on the other side of the village you'd just left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl fidgeted a bit, glancing around like she expected something to come jumping out at her any moment. You weren't that scary were you? You pondered this while giving the girl a more through look over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to be about 5' 6\" in height (not including the foot long rabbit ears at the top of her head) making her just a few inches shorter then yourself at a height of 5' 10\". Her frame was small and thin with a moderately sized chest. Nothing to big, still bigger then most of the other girls you know from town. Her legs were long and looked they'd be smooth to the touch in the areas her pelt didn't cover. It went without saying that her legs were also dangerous, all that hopping making her muscles strong and toned. You'd be willing to bet that she had a nice firm, yet soft rump topping those legs. She had a set of well proportioned hips that were not too wide yet wide enough that one could clearly see they\u2019d be well suited for one day carrying and birthing young. They lead up to a thin but, fit waist and a firm stomach that could be seen despite her pelt covering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, her build gave her an enticing hourglass shape with thin arms that still showed hints of toned muscles underneath soft skin. Her face is what really caught his attention though. It held a soft look to it due to it retaining some of its roundness from childhood. It gave her a look of childlike innocence while still managing to look like a beautiful angle. Her lips, though not overly large or full, were soft and could easily draw one in for a kiss without any thought on the others part. The cute nose and large eyes that on closer inspection where not a pure yellow, but a golden amber color only helped to make this young bunny girl very attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" The hesitant sound of the bunny girls voice quickly broke you from your observations of her form. \"Well... I-I'm here because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Why is the Bunny Girl here?</b></span></div></div>",

After this I will assist you in any way I can.\" You shoot your seed into Alice and you shoot out a lot into her because it makes her stomach swell to the point where she looks like she's due with a single child.

They had no place here in the wooded valleys and plains.

They l've in the mountains. Your can't possibly be saying you went up there and pissed one off, that would mean you've been running for days, maybe over a week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! There've been some fights over territory between the ogre clans. This one got pushed out of her lands and forced all the way down here. I-I didn't even know about her till she tried to eat me two days ago.\" She explain, barely holding herself together near the end. You can't really blame her either. Ogres were pretty stupid but, Lord were they persistent little fucks. If you had a hungry predator that was normally over twice your own size and needed specially forged weapons or super strength just to hurt, you'd be pretty freaked out yourself. That made you think for a moment before doing what would either be the best decision of your life, or the action that would cause to come to a screeching halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny girl, who you still didn't know the name of, was broken from her attempts at holding back her sobs and frightened cries by you grabbing her hand and soon practically dragging along behind you. \"W-what are....?!?\", you cut her off before she could likely start to panic. \"If it's only been two days then that Ogrenette won't be too far behind. We need to start making tracks. I was on my way the the nearest city, a port town before meeting you. If we can get there before the Ogrenette catches up with us, then we can force it back through shear numbers.\" You look back at the girl to see she is giving you an odd look. You can clearly see confusion, fright and the barest hints of hope in her golden-amber eyes, as well as a myriad of other emotions swirling around inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I never did get your name. I'm Erik, just turned sixteen a few weeks ago.\", you offered with a friendly smile. Your heartbeat quickens a bit at seeing a small smile make its way to the girls pretty face. \"V-Velvet, my name is Velvet.\" \"Well Velvet, stick with me and I'll do everything I can to get you out of this alive, I promise.\", you say as your turn your eyes back towards the road. Your only response is a slight tightening of her hand around yours and her trying to match her pace with your own. You help out a bit with at last part as though her feet are remarkable human-like, they still have those pads on the bottom, making them better suited for hopping then walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you continued on your way, you can't help but wonder what sort of crazy adventure you just got yourself into.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had only been a few hours since your fateful encounter with Velvet, the bunny girl. In that time the two of you had covered a lot of ground towards the port town. In another 2 hours the two of you would find safety behind the walls of the small port town. Seeing the distance the two of you had managed to cover, coupled with surprisingly loud, bestial growls coming from a very embarrassed Velvet's stomach, you figured a quick snack break was an order. Besides, Velvet may be really cute but you had no desire to end up filling her belly. You were likely already pushing things seeing as how you doubted the poor bunny had any time to eat while fleeing the Ogrenette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, who would have guessed that a hungry monster girl would be so picky in what she ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Velvet, but that's really all I've got right now.\" You can't help but feel bad at learning how little of the travel food you brought along actually appealed to her. This was only compounded by the dejected pout on her face as she miserably nibbled at some dried fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because I'm a bunny girl doesn't mean fruits and vegetables are my preferred foods,\" the girl muttered while forcing herself to chew and swallow what you had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again I'm sorry. I didn't pack with having a pretty bunny girl companion in mind.\" You hoped the compliment would help lift her mood. Judging from the slight pause in her chewing and the light pink dusting her cheeks you'd say it worked. \"Besides, you've already tried the dried meats I brought and you remember how that went,\" you say, waging the jerky in your hand. You make a mental note to look into what meats you could bring on your trip that Velvet would enjoy. Human meat was after all not something you planned to serve without good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this. The inn I'm planning to stay at has a tavern on the bottom floor. Once we get all things we need, armor, weapons, supplies, etc. I'll get you a big helping of meat at the tavern. Then you can rest in the room we rent. I doubt you've been able to get much sleep after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet seems to perk up greatly at hearing this and before you know it your back on the road with an excited bunny girl pulling you along. Despite how hard it is keeping up you can't help but smile at your companions back. This trip would have been far more lonely without her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, Velvet is also thinking about her companion and how grateful she is at having met him. Her mind is running with countless possibilities of what the two of you might go through together. One thought however causes her cheeks to redden and her heart to speed up. She inwardly promised herself that if you did keep your promise to her, then no matter what others might think of her for it, she would take you as her lifelong mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as how Velvet was getting lost in her fantasies of romance and adventure, she failed to notice the shifting in the foliage just ahead. Thankfully, you manage to pick up on it just in time to plant your feet and pull back. This caused Velvet to come crashing out of her thoughts as she stumbled and nearly fell backwards. She was only still standing due to you grabbing ahold of her before positioning yourself between her and whatever was hiding in the bushes. Drawing your wooden sword you stand at the ready for whatever might jump out at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What jumps out at you?</b></span></div></div>",

But you're not ready to give in. Hands shaking, you dash forward and jab your weapon straight into her muscular abs. The flimsy woods bounces off, blunting its edge and leaving nary a scratch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ogre laughs at your strike and raises one of her massive, dirt-covered feet. She slams it towards you and you barely managed to dive forward, landing just beneath her ass. Velvet, who was behind you, takes the attack instead. The bunny girl is pinned to the ground as the giant bitch starts to twist the ball of her foot, grinding your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her attention drawn away, you stare at the ass above and come up with a strange idea. For the second time this battle, you jab at her, this time aiming straight at her asshole. Her leopard bikini is unable to hold back the wooden rod from blasting straight into her asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Gwaaah!'' The ogre yells, falling to her knees. You twist the rod, hoping to cause some pain, but the following pants are more... pleasurable in nature. She seems to be enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh oh, you want fuck me human? she asks, turning her head back. ''After this, me am gonna shove you way up!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the time Velvet needed to act. Unhinging her jaw like a snake, she leaps forward and takes the beasts entire head into her mouth. The ogre struggles, but a few more twists of your sword ruins her coordination.

As soon as she does she tumbles back, her distended belly looking comically large. You would have laughed if not for the distinct ogre outline and its violent thrashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Waaah'' Velvet moans and you immediately set to making camp.

In fact, the ogrish outline has started to soften and it is clear that her stomach is well at work melting down its contents, even if it has yet to shrink in size. Velvet herself has dozed off into a quiet slumber, drool dripping down the edges of her mouth. Following her lead, you crawl into your little sleeping sack and pass out, yourself exhausted by the events of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, your are lulled from your dreams by a flurry of swears coming from a nearby bush. Readying your battle tested sword, you raise from your covers, nearly undressed. As you approach, the voice is clearly Velvet's. Relaxing a bit (who knows, maybe she developed a taste for meat) you call out to your companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Uh, is everything alright?'' you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of awkard silence, the leaves of a nearby bush part, revealing the bunny girl. Velvet is back to (mostly) normal, though her belly still bulges from a bit of undigested ogre. It seems 10 hours wasn't enough time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''D-don't go in there. It's not too pretty...'' she admits sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Taking care of business?'' you joke, trying to lighten the mood. ''Seems like you got a bit more to work with, though.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jab a finger towards her gut, expecting to hit taut skin. Instead, your pointer digs into the flesh, plunging a few centimeters deep. You were wrong. It's not undigested ogre; Velvet has gained a bit of weight! Its like someone stuck a cantaloupe in her abdomen. The barely visible abs that had defined her toned stomach had disappeared under a belt of fat. Velvet's face goes crimson as she begins to yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Y-you should have rubbed my boobs! Or my butt! Or anywhere! Now all that meat went to my tummy...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wait, what? What do you mean?'' you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet sighs as she takes a seat on a nearby rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Monster girls aren't like human girls. We can direct where our fat goes with massages. Why do you think we're always so busty? Or have such nice butts?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's something you never contemplated, but in hindsight, it does make sense. Every illustration you've seen in your books showed them as busty and shapely, but rarely in the gut or thighs. Only the most powerful of them approached human obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sorry, I didn't know,'' you apologize. ''But you're alive, right? I mean, that ogre who was chasing you is nothing but fat now. You're safe.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet's ears perk up like bean sprouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You're right,'' she admits, climbing up. ''We don't gotta worry about that from now on, now do we?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly question the ''we'', considering she no longer needs protection, but an ally is an ally. With the issue dealt with, you quickly pack and resume your march before...</span></div></div>",

The Gods seem to be on your side as you manage to avoid coming across any more monster girls as your slice through ropey vines and climb over mossy rocks. Velvet hops diligently behind you, her figure a little more jiggly than yesterday. You take a few glaces at the belt of blubber stuck to her waist but after the third time or so you find it covered by one of the rags from your rucksack; Velvet managed to deftly lift it from you without you noticing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy midday, you and your companion arrive at the imposing stone gates of Port Minvera. The largest town in the region, it serves as a gateway to the more dangerous regions of the Kingdom. Or rather, it did; with the spreading of the evil Witch-Queen's army, travel to her lands was forbidden. You are going to need to find someone willingly to skirt the law to help you, and for that reason, you and Velvet make a bee-line for the seedier parts of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a human village, Velvet's entry poses no problems. As a ''vegetarian'' monster girl, her kind can survive without meat, which means they can live alongside man without eating them. Only carnivores such as Ogres and Lamia were banned from entering. Still, prejudice remains as many harsh glaces are thrown your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing through the nice part of town, you see no sign of monster girls. It is only when you enter the dock area that you finally find some: a small pack of Bunny Girls, though much thinner and malnourished than Velvet. Without access to meat, they've lost most of their curves. They're stuck outside of a monster whorehouse, offering their services to any man passing by. Sitting above them on a balcony is a supreme busty Cow Girl, lording over her fellow monsters below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Velvet search the nearby bars for people willing to skirt the ban, and after a few false leads you manage to come across a man and his crew willing to do it. Smugglers, they claim to be, and they offer you a deal: if you can find their recently missing captain, they will take you wherever you want. The problem is, he went missing...</span></div></div>",

You pass out long before that, thankfully, leaving you unconscious as you are reduced to nothing but a formless, goopy mush of protein. Even your bones are broken down by the powerful acids of her monster girl gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground of the forest floor shakes as a monstrously large beast steps through the brush. An ogre girl, clad to head to toe in nothing but a loin cloth makes her way through the forest near Malak, hunting her prey. Her green skin helps her athletic but hourglass form. The only thing bigger than her biceps are her plump, watermelon sized breasts. They sag slightly under their own weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ogre girl is beset by the familiar scent of the bunny girl she's been hunting. With a smile, she calls into the forest around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on out, little bunny! My gut hungers for you. Please don't let it wait any longer,\" the ogre girl taunts, looking all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the tall woman failed to gaze upwards, allowing the bunny girl to strike. She drops from the forest top, slamming the flat end of your stolen sword into the ogre's head. The force is too much for the giant as she tumbles unconsciously to the forest floor. The last vision she see's before fading out is of the bunny girl herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recognizes the face, but the body has undergone some major changes. Her flat tummy has swollen out an inch or two with soft, pudgy fat. Her thighs and hips are more rounded as well. The girl's breasts are bigger as well; not as large as the ogre's, but certainly bigger than they were a few days ago. Finally, she notices the powerful, rounded biceps. It seems the bunny's been working out quiet a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet looks down at the unconscious ogre with a victorious grin. Giving her new muscles a playful kiss, she follows up by doing to the ogre girl what she did to you. With the beast unconscious, it doesn't take much effort to swallow her down. Though her belly is almost to its breaking point and she can't even move, Velvet manages to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tumbles against a nearby tree, dozing off to sleep as her stomach begins to break down the ogre that had been hunting her for days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wakes up in the pale moonlight of the night. Her stomach, as expected, has shrunken back down after having digested utterly the ogre. Again, her body has been enhanced by the large meal. Her thighs and love-handles are now covered in a thick, squishy layer of fat. Her gut, which before the fight could have been described as simply chubby has bounded out, giving her a pregnant like appearance. Her breasts are the final thing she notices, now having expanded to just above the watermelons that her nemesis was sporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe runs her hands over her plump, curvacious form as she rises to her feet. Her thoughts return to you, the human whose sacrifice made this all possible. With her body both stronger and sexier than it's ever been, she giggles to herself triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Erik...\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTales of the curvaceous bunny girl would soon travel through Malak and beyond. Renowned for both her looks and her strength, men would tell stories of her sexual abilities, while the women would tell tales of those husbands and sons that never returned, simple food for her gullet. A new terror (or pleasure) has infested the forests of your home village, all thanks to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGame over.</span></div></div>",

However, you werent reckless either. It wasnt like you go up to her and slay her right then and there. Not with the weapon you currently have. Wood swords wont do much damage to monsters that have specialize in that specific element. The best you could do now is just ignore her only you can get a better sword. You felt the plant-girl's red eyes glare your direction in disappointment as she continued her phony struggle, but you dare not give her any eye contact. Just leave that venus guy-trap to the next sucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the path was pretty clear. Not a single monster in sight. Either it was a bad season for them or other more experienced hunters got to them first. Either way, it made the trek to the port much easier.<br>\r\nIt wasnt a long walk to the port, anyways. The lighthouse on the hill guided the way.<br>\r\nThe port consisted of a small bazaar in the streets selling several kinds of important goods acquired from the trade ships at the dock. The bazaar had a wide range of goods to sell ranging from imported fruits &amp; vegetables, exotic foods, herbal medicines, jewelry, even special repellent sprays to keep monsters in heat away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, there were loads of fellow adventurers crowing the port, set out to accomplish the same goal as you. There was a wide variety of them, too. Males and females, big and small, fat and skinny, while most looked to be in their late 20s-early 30s, there were some as young as 7 or 8 and as old as 70 or 80! This was a highly competitive job, but only the best can get anywhere with it.<br>\r\nFocused with your mission, you ignored all the others and made your way to the big fancy armory shop. The ONLY armory that sells actually steel weaponry within hundreds of miles! You couldnt buy a lot, cuz you'd still need some cash left over to rent a boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armory had a huge selection on display. Heavy armor, sturdy helmets, sharp axes, fierce hammers, crossbows, the works. Unfortunately, you've only been training thoroughly to use a sword, so a sword would be your best bet. However, the section that displays it's legendary killing blades was empty! No sword in sight.<br>\r\nCurious, you head to the cash register to inquire to the big bulky bald cashier casually reading his newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I help ya?\" he asked in a thick, broad, attentive voice.<br>\r\n\"I wish to buy one of your swords,\" you explained, \"and I dont see any of them on display.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry kid. We're sold out of 'em.\"<br>\r\n\"!!!\" The words struck you like a... sword! \"YOURE OUT OF SWORDS?!!\"<br>\r\n\"Yep, theyre in high demand,\" he casually explained, ignoring your freak out, \"sold out the last one about 3 hours ago.\" DAMNIT!! TOO LATE!! If only you had gotten up much earlier. Like the crack of dawn, maybe. \"We still got a lot of the other stuff if youre interested. Got plenty o' crossbows we need to get rid of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lowered your head in shame. Swords were practically the only weapon you spent most of your life training to master! You dont really know how to use anything else! Why couldnt you have trained to use various weapons?! You sighed hard, pondering what you should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*DING!!! DING!!! DING!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the port's alarm bell rang! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MONSTER ATTACK!!! EVERYONE GET TO SHELTER!!\" shouted someone outside. You could hear screaming, blades clinging and loud fast footsteps as villagers and fake 'heroes' ran for cover to avoid the upcoming monster raid!<br>\r\n\"Barricade the doors!\" the manager ordered his employees.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" they blocked both the doors with heavy suits of armor as their boss locked the bars on the windows!  After securing the armory, the employees whipped out their trusty crossbows while the big man behind the counter reached for his silver warhammer... JUST in case!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe port was under attack. Serious business. And the worst time in the world to be without a proper blade! If those beasts trash the port, you wont be able to leave the island! And your dream of defeating the Witch Queen will come to a sudden halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many of them are there?\" the big man behind the counter asked.<br>\r\nAn employee through the window and squinted his eyes, \"Er... just one.\"<br>\r\n\"Just one?!\" the big man raised his eyebrow in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... and it looks like she took out about a dozen adventurers!\" DOZEN adventurers?! \"Holy crap... she's staring down Captain Carpenter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparked your curiosity. You looked through one of the windows to see two figures staring down eachother in the middle of a pileof fallen barely conscious adventurers. To the right, you saw a grizzled grey haired, slightly built (for someone his age) and battle scarred sea captain showing no fear as he smoked his pipe. Facing him was a figure nearly completely covered in a black cloak and cowl, wielding two long exotic-looking blades, one in each hand, stained with fresh blood from their victims. Most of her was covered, but part of her head showing looked human, with black hair with little red streaks, and silver eyes with black slanted pupils. her long-nailed hands had shiny silver scales and you could see a long scaley silver tail sticking out the back of her cloak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...H...HOLY CRAP,\" you whispered in horror, \"IS THAT.... A DRAGON?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Nathaniel Razor Carpenter,\" she spoke perfect english despite a hint of scottish dialect in her accent, \"you stand accused of violating Rule #321 of the New Asun Code of Conduct. Do you or do you not still own idols and artifacts relating to the banned worship of the pagan false god, Zados?\" Oh crap. Somebody STILL practicing that strictly outlawed religion?! That's a death wish under New Asun law!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a true blooded follower of Zados's Word,\" the captain didnt so much as flinch when he answered, \"no law has changed that.

But I will do no such thing. You cannot ask me to abandoned my principals.\"<br>\r\nHera pointed her sword to the pile of fallen fighters, \"Take a good look at those around you! These foolish warmbloods couldnt stop me from taking your head! Nothing at this point can save you except for you swallowing your blasphemous pride and doing what youre ordered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm afraid to die, lizard?\" the captain crossed his arms<br>\r\n\"Captain, please! Just throw away that stupid doll!\" one of his sailors begged.<br>\r\n\"You heard your warmblooded servant,\" Hera spoke, \"take it out and burn it. And I will leave you and your precious port be.\"<br>\r\nBut the captain stood his ground and repeated, \"I will do no such thing.\"<br>\r\n\"HIIISSSS!!!\" Hera actually hissed in anger, \"would you rather I burn the rest of this damn port instead?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeez! It looks bad out there! As a self-proclaimed hero, you couldnt just stand there and let Hera kill him and quite possibly burn down the port! You had to do something! Anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you dont have a weapon that can take down a dragon!! And if those fairy tale stories told you anything, dragons are one of the most powerful monsters in existence... second/third only to fallen angels and death machines from the future!<br>\r\nYou sweated like crazy thinking what to do.</span></div></div>",

You were never good at speaking to large groups of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you could at least do your best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Everyone!\" You shouted, immediately wincing at your stutter. \"O-Or, um, I guess just you two. Erm, the Captain and Miss Dragon, t-that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, as you can see right here,\" you say, gesturing at the idol that was sliced cleanly, almost perfectly in half, \"the, uh, idol has been destroyed, s-so there's no reason to fight anymore, I think...S-so could you stop fighting? Um, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgh, why is talking with people you don't know so hard!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain and the dragon lady look at each other. Sparks seem to fly between the two, before they nod at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain lowers his fists, and the dragon girl retracts her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In accordance with the Civilized Monster Girl Code of Conduct, Section One Page Five, as the source of the issue has been dealt with, there is no more reason to fight, and therefore, all fighting a monster girl-that is, myself - shall cease immediately. Your city is safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and everyone else stood there in shock for a solid five minutes or so, before wild cheering broke out. The dragon girl snorted softly in satisfaction, while the captain walked over to the broken pieces of the idol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm, uh, sorry about your idol, Mister Captain, Sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain ignored you, reached into his pocket, and brought out...was that a sardine? Gross. He then turned to the ocean, and chucked the sardine into the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mermaid leaped out of the water, flipped several times, showing her gleaming blue scales off to the world, and caught the fish, waving happily at the captain before diving back into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blue, huh...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, a small smile made its way across the captain's face. He then turned to face you, and you felt intimidated by the large figure looking down on you, smiling though he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright lad. Turns out you did the right thing.\" He picked up the pieces of the idol and gave them to you. \"S'pose milord's tryin' to tell me that I gotta keep my faith here,\" he said, gesturing to his heart, \"rather than here,\" he finished, pointing at the pieces of the idol that were in your hands-or rather, arms, seeing as how you were clutching them to your chest, the other hand holding the naginata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in any case,\" the white-bearded sailor grinned, \"Brief though it was, that fight was one of the most enjoyable ones I've been in in years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As it was for me,\" a voice came from right behind you, making you jump in surprise, whirling around to face the dragon girl that had somehow appeared directly behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my apologies for startling you,\" the girl said, bowing. \"But, as I was saying earlier, I agree. You are quite talented...for a heretic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As are you...for a zealot,\" the captain retorted good-naturedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we could continue our battle another time?\" She offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan.\" The captain replied. \"'Course, it'd have to be somewhere outside of civilization. Don't wanna hurt innocent people, now, 'else we might have to have this young lad step in again,\" he added, ruffling your hair at the end to accentuate his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally,\" the dragon girl replied. \"And speaking of this 'young lad,'\" she added, kneeling down to be at your eye level, \"According to Rule #53 of the New Amun Code of Conduct, as a civilian selflessly helped to resolve a problem that they were not directly associated with, a reward is due for your actions.\" She left off putting a hand to her chin in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to protest and say that you aren't a civilian, you're a hero, but before you could get a word in, the dragon girl lifts up a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, that will do. You weapon, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hand her your naginata and take the moment to pack up the pieces of the idol you've acquired, watching the dragon girl mutter some words under her breath, causing the naginata to glow white for a few moments, before the glow fades away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" she says, handing you back your weapon. \"I've enchanted it. Kids like you tend to like magical weapons, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the remark about you being a kid, you inspect the naginata. \"What spells did you put on it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few minor spells,\" the dragon girl admitted. \"Self-Maintaining, Eternal Sharpness, Stone Slicer, Unbreaking...I'm no enchanter, but I do know a few of the more useful spells of that school of magic. The most powerful one I know is Unbreaking, which I naturally added to your weapon. Ah, and it does have an Auto-Return spell cast on it, so if it's ever knocked out of your hands, you can call it back at any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth was wide open at this point. That was a lot of enchantments! Guess now it's time to learn how to use polearms...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" You exclaimed, bowing deeply. \"Thank you very much, Miss Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Cynthia,\" she replied, waving a hand. \"Miss Dragon feels too generic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Miss Cynthia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're very welcome,\" she replied, beaming right back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" the captain began, \"I don't have any fancy magics or anything to give you-I mean, I have things I consider treasures, but they ain't anything you would consider valuable-at your age, at least.\" He then puffed out his chest and pointed his thumb at himself. \"But what I do have are my memory-\" he tapped at the side of his head, \"-and my good name: Captain John Carpenter. Should we ever meet again, and you need help of any kind, I and my crew'll try to help you out the best we can.\" He knelt down so he could whisper in your ear. \"And if you ever get into a fight with one of the many water monster girls out there, tell 'em you're a good friend of Sehdrinn. It'll help you out, trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod at the captain and thank him as well. He rises up and turns to his crew. \"Come on men, off we go!\" The men cheer and pile on to the boat, and Captain Carpenter ruffles your hair again. \"You're definitely a special one, lad. I hope we meet again.\" And with that, he turns back and boards his ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wave at the sailors until their ship disappears over the horizon, and then turn to face Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right, you know,\" she says. \"There is something special about you. I'm not entirely sure what it is, but it's there.\" She smiles. \"I hope we meet again as well-all of us. That way you can keep us from getting too out of hands when we fight again.\" She spreads her wings. \"Take care, child, and good luck.\" And with that, she soared up into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was exciting, and you definitely felt a thrill when the people started cheering. But it was getting late, and you really wanted to crash at the local inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, looking at the naginata in your hands, you feel bad for stealing it. You only intended to borrow it for a little while, but now it's enchanted to automatically return to you. You feeli like you should go apologize to the blacksmith before heading to the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other hand, you don't think anyone saw you steal the naginata, so you could pass it off as it having been yours the whole time...Maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, it's quickly growing dark, so you may want to decide quickly what you want to do before it gets too late-at least, if you want a restful sleep.</span></div></div>",

But even if you might have even the teensiest tiniest chance of winning a fight against a dragon, you still had to find a way out of this weapon shop first. What with the place being barricaded due for the staff's safety as well as your own, it's not like theyre gonna let you out just cuz you say so!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly look around for an alternate way out. The front doors were blocked as were the windows. You notice a small window behind the bulky man at the counter in the room marked 'Employees Only'. That was isnt barricaded! Since youre pretty small yourself, you reckon you could squeeze through that tight space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will ask you again, human,\" you heard Hera threaten the captain, \"I'm going to give you to the count of three to hand over your idles of heresy!\"<br>\r\n\"You can give me to the count of 100!\" you heard the captain snapped back, \"I'm not giving them to the likes of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everybody was too distracted by the action outside, you make a quick dash past the big guy and dart to the small window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid, what are you doing?!\" the manager shouted, \"get back here!\" You ignore him and squeeze through that small window, \"Kid, youre gonna die out there! Andre, stop him!\" The big guy rushed to try to drag you out, but he was too slow and you were too agile! With one quick squeeze, you were out of the weapon shop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ONE!!\" Hera roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran as fast as you could toward the dragoness and the captain. You realize last minute that you forgot to get a weapon, but thankfully RIGHT on cue, you spot a perfectly good unused sword aside a fallen unconscious soldier. It was a little heavy, but thanks to all the practice swinging you had, the weight was no problem for the likes of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TWO!!\" Hera roared.<br>\r\n\"C'mon, sir!

Before you so much as blink, the figure in the cowl zipped around and pounced at you! You could barely see the shocked look on the Captain Carpenter's voice for a millisecond before the cowl came down on you!<br>\r\n\"Yipe!\" you let out a yipe and fell on your face as you felt your throat between two incredibly sharp blades that could no doubt slice yours into metal confetti! Hera's slanted pupils widened with surprise and intrigue as they glared down at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another hero, hm?\" the rage in Hera's voice lightened, as if slightly joyed that another warrior dare challenge her.<br>\r\n\"L...L...Let the captain go!\" you stuttered, barely keeping a grip on your sword. You almost gulped when you felt the blades press a little closer to your neck!<br>\r\n\"Youre a little young to throw your precious life away,\" Hera spoke, \"so young... and youre raising such a nasty weapon against a messenger of the Queen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gritted your teeth, but because of the swords, you dare not say anything out of fear you might cut your neck on them! It was tough enough trying to breath without moving your throat muscles too much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously such rebelliousness comes from bad parentage,\" she continued, \"how shameful of your miserable species to train your own kin to sacrifice their lives so meaninglessly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hera! Your battle is with me! Leave the child out of this!\" Carpenter shouted in your defense, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My battle is with all who show such disrespect to the Queen,\" the dragoness remarked, \"obviously this whole cursed city seems to walk over the generosity that her Lordship greatly provides.\" She lowered her blades from your throat. But just when you were about to be relieved, she continued, \"...And even worst of all, they teach their own children at such a young age to defy order!\"<br>\r\nYou wanted to say something, ANYTHING, but at that very moment, you couldnt get a single word out. All that built up courage, determination, and adrenaline you had only an hour or so ago vanished without a trace. For the moment, you were at the mercy of this dragon. For this moment, you were no hero... just a victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHera could smell your fear. You could almost see her salivating under the guard. You wouldnt be surprised if she wanted to sink her jaws into you! Worst time in history to get slowly drawn in by her pheromonal scent! You didnt wanna think sexy thoughts out of fear she\u2019d tear them out of your brain wrinkles, but it was too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squinted her reptilic eyes as she gazed with pure intrigue.<br>\r\nShe stepped closer and you stepped back, until she put the edge of her blade to the back of your neck! You stopped right before you could draw blood from it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle boy\u2026\u201d her voice sounded slightly less intimidating as she extended her leg, \u201click my feet.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-what?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLick my feet, child,\u201d she spoke generously, \u201cand I promise I wont kill you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to keep your cool and not look down at her foot, but your brave fa\u00e7ade was broken.

Maybe she's the bold hardass type that's always serious and never laughed a day in her life and her body aint used to a silly thing called 'humor'. Regardless, it IS a good sign, isnt it? Maybe it's sort of a sign that you somehow moved her. Youre hoping that maybe she admires the way you've stood up to her despite having little to absolute zero chance of defeating her and decides to let you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahah....\" Hera put her somewhat scaley hand to her forehead and continued chuckling, \"...haha hAHAHAHA! *SNOORT!*\" Holy crap. Did smoke just come out of her nostrils when she snorted? \"HAAA HAHAHA!!!\" she tilted her head back and laughed hard. You gazed horrifically at the set of big shiny razor sharp jaws and long forked tongue barely concealed behind her veil! \"Hahaha!! Do I have a reason to fight? Do I... have a reason... to fight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh dear. Her aura was intensifying even more than earlier. Even some of the surviving knights gave frightened stares at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>DO I!</b>\" not even looking back, Hera chucks one of her swords over her shoulder... and the flying blade stabs Captain Carpenter right in the chest! \"Captain!!\" his fellow sailor rushed to his aid, practically clueless out to save their boss while a sword is stuck incredibly deep into his body.<br>\r\n\"<b>HAVE A REASON!</b>\" Hera threw her other sword right over your head... decapitating one of her own knights a ways away!

Looks like you not only failed to save the Captain, you've expedited his untimely end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse even, his murderer had her undivided attention to you.<br>\r\n\"Such bold ARROGANCE!\" she chuckled as she removed her veil... her lovely serene face tarnished by the sadistic reptilic grin, \"From simple prey!\" You began to back away as her scaley clawed feet scratched through the ground she stomped on. \"A delicious little baby mouse with a tongue so fowl! How INTERESTING.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the corner of your eye, you could see that poor mother hiding behind shattered debris, hoping she wont be spotted by that unstable dragon descending on you.<br>\r\n\"Brave little HERO! *snort!*\" she ended her sarcastic commented with another smoking snort, \"I DO have a reason to fight!\" She undone her black cloak revealing her thin but slightly muscular body clad in a dark sari dress with several little shiny jewel decorations and little insignias of the Witch Queen Empire.  Most of her body looked humanish despite a little too pale skin and even paler colored white scales. You really REALLY tried hard not to stare at the way her hips swayed invigoratingly as she walked to you, but even the long smooth yet scaley tail behind her swayed just as energetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy reason is to purge this world of such disgusting arrogance in the face of Law!\u201d big white scaley dragon wings ripped out from Hera\u2019s back.

Unbelievable. The stories were true. Despite narrowly avoiding the outrageously hot breath of fire, you froze up at the sight of the charred earth and corpses devoured by the flame!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horrible realization of truth came to mind. If you want to be a hero,  THIS is what youre up against! THIS is only a small fraction of what youre up against! Could you honestly stand up to this kind of threat and still call yourself a hero?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHera snorted again, emitting smoke from her nostrils and kept smirking your way. The next split second a few hundred pounds of scales, claws , teeth, and insanity lunged at you, causing you to tumble in the dirt again. This time, when the roll ended, you found yourself pinned to the ground by your dragoness adversary straddling you! The mixture of incredibly hot flame and potent pheromone tortured your nostrils!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer claws dug into your arms, resulting in only pain should you dare budge them! Her long slimy tongued licked up the runoff from your bloody neck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsk me again, Mouse pup!!\u201d she panted with anticipation, breathing hot smoldering breath in your faces, \u201cask me again if I have to reason to fight!\" You wanted to tremble, but even that took some nerve and your nerves were shot! Part of you wanted to crawl into a little corner and hide there for the rest of your life. But in your head, you could still see that mother and her baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it!\" Hera practically begged you to push her further, \"Please do it!

Her forked tongue rolled out of her mouth as she laughed and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHA! AGAIN!!\" she shouted with intensity, \"AGAIN, the mouse pup shows such arrogance! Hahahaha! Interesting... most interesting! More mouse MORE!\" Hera roared with impatience and excitement... which made you feel more and more weak and timid deep down, \"SHOW ME MORE OF THAT DELIGHTFUL ARROGANCE!!!\" Oh good god, she's crawling toward you with that barely-veiled creepy reptilic grin on her face, \"I want to feel the harsh breath of that fowl tongue blow blasphemy in my face once again before I chew it off!\" You almost gasped in horror that she's getting such a thrill out of your outbursts! Do ALL dragons have this sick mindset?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you've come this far! You cant back out now!<br>\r\n'Fear is the mind killer,' you think to yourself, 'fear is the mind killer.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard and looked the dragoness right in the eyes once again, staring hard at your glaring reflection.<br>\r\n\"I bet I know what your REAL reason to fight is, you cold-hearted, slimy, filthy, big-nosed, high-and-mighty, hyena in dragon scales!\" her fellow knights let out gasps as Hera's smirk widened. \"Your reason to fight is just like your reason to live: ...to lick the cunt of your precious QUEEN!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Queen! ....Queen! ...Queen!</i> the echo of your roar could possibly be heard for miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HERA!!

It's done!\" The dying Captain gazed in horror at the sight of his precious little cute female templar plushie burning. Before it completely burned to shreds, you read the stitched wording on it's stomach. 'Happy Birthday Daddy! Zados Volt!  Love, Nina'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh damn. So THAT'S the reason he refused to burn it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHera finally stopped laughing. Her laughing fit didnt gradually dimmer, it just stopped instantly. Like someone flipped Hera's switch back to 'Cold, serious badass'. If some random bystander just popped up out of nowhere to witness, he'd never believe this cold stern dragoness had a psychotic giggle fit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood back up and dusted herself off. \"You couldve saved yourself a dozen soldiers and a thick-headed captain.\" She picked up the sword that beheaded a fellow knight of hers and said a quick prayer for her. One moment she didnt give a damn she killed her own subordinate and the next she's praying for her soul to find rest! She then stepped toward the panicking sailors gathered around their captain with her other sword sticking into his rib! An eerie silence except for silent jittering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may keep that blade,\" Hera generously offered, \"it should afford your captain a proper funeral.\" You gritted your teeth at this beast of a female but only until she turned her attention to YOU again!<br>\r\n\"As for YOU...\" you froze up when she zipped only inches away from you! \"you are now known to me, mouse pup.\" She sniffed the sweat from your forehead, \"Your SCENT is known to a Commandant of New Asun and esteemed messenger of Queen Morgana I. I would suggest you rethink your 'reason to fight' while you still have a life to live.\" They were words of advice you would not forget until the day you die. EVERYTHING you have just witnessed in this city is something you would not forget until the day you die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStone cold, you were as you gazed while Hera extended her wings again, let out a loud high-pitched reptilic shriek and she and her fellow knights ascended into the air. They flown off, abandoning what was left of the city. No experience points were gained. Just painful memories that would linger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou! Boy!\u201d one of the sailors aiding his fallen captain shouted to you, \u201cC\u2019mere!\u201d You were still a little froze up for a moment. \u201cNow!\u201d You ran to him like a good boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sailor looked to Mr. Carpenter. Despite his terrible condition, the captain looked you square in the eyes as if he possibly moved by your speech and willingness to stand up to Hera. He let out a loud hacking cough and reached into his pocket.<br>\r\nHe pulled out a silver stringed medallion with the symbol of the templars on it. According to what you studied from school, those medallions were worn by honorary members of the Resistance. With a shaking twitching hand, he was offering it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp her\u2026\u201d his eyes turned to the remains of the burning plushie, \u201c\u2026please\u2026\u201d With his dying breath, he had offered you one hell of a life-changing invitation. If you were still bent on being a hero, this would be a both a great step forward and a huge risk on your life. It wont be long before the Witch Queen knows of you and your fate aint gonna be a pleasant one if she knows youre on the side aiming to destroy her! Then again, with the help of the posse that Mr. Carpenter\u2019s daughter is a part of, you just might be able to destroy her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPEAKING OF WHICH, how exactly are you gonna explain to Nina the fate of her dad?</span></div></div>",

I thanked her and took three apples, she walked out <i>with</i> the basket and vanished again. <br>\r\n\"She isn't eating?\" I asked Molisa, Grace was unlike any adventurer I've seen. \"No. She's actually a magic-golem, barely has interest in food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For real!?\" I blurted out, I couldn't even tell she was one! \"Yeah! Had her since Asun was under the king..\" she looked out at sea the entire time she spoke. \"That history-\" Grace came back In as she started without the basket, I was almost done with my last apple and just put the cores in my shorts pocket. <br>\r\n\"Now we need to make new history by landing on Kilofill!\" The sailing felt like minutes but the day had passed by nearly halfway, in the distance some spiked rocks pointed out from the sea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel anything Grace?\" Molisa asked as the ship came quickly at them, alot stood ten feet out of the water. \"Nothing big, shall I tell them to slow?\" Molisa shook her head no while the ship bolted past the rocks, some were starting to point wildly around and the coast, cliffs with the same rocks.. the pointed inwards to a rapid wide river with smaller ones going off! No wonder many didn't come back, with what's left of boats, big &amp; small, sticking barely to rocks.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense something! Left!\" Molisa jerked the boat right and I held onto the bar, seeing two massive, black scaled tentacles come and slam the boat between rocks!<br>\r\nI was thrown and didn't see it, but Molisa straightened out as Grace sprinted out of the room and the tentacles went under, it was painful to hit the medal.. got up though, I am not gonna let this Scylla defeat us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jack had already ran inside, seeing the rapids approach quickly with jagged rocks, I slammed my sword back in the deck, leaning over the side to catch Grace! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship flew over the rapids as she used the swords weight to make her fly at me. <br>\r\nHer weight made me lose grip, but she swung from my grip and <i>demolished</i> one of the rocks ahead. \"Stay front!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning to the front, she climbed and ducked- the ship bounced high and I flew-- she grabbed my leg and lulled me down, the shop slammed on flat water..<br>\r\nFaceplanting the deck hurt bad, but what I saw was well worth it. <br>\r\nThe river drained into a huge lake and the coast was visible, behind some massive vined trees. Looked like a abandoned stone pathway, seeing some stones there. \"That was impressive.\" Had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Nonchalant, the members came back up including Molisa, comforting a mourning Jack.. \"Mack! DAMN Treasues!\" He yelled, not much to say.. \"Atleast we made it, it's good enough a cause.\" Yin said, Konos staying silent &amp; Migen smirking some.. \"Whatever.. let's continue.\" Migen closed the sails as we approached the shore quickly, then slowing, the boat softly landed mostly on the sand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Land ho!\" Molisa yelled happily, despite the loss it still was a bit good to survive. Keeping my sword out however, this land is new, everyone had their weapons drawn when jumping on the sand. <br>\r\nI followed the same and saw a ruined path, I stood behind Lin and Konos behind me as Molisa led. \"Grace, got something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all slowly walked in. \"Nothing, just a structure.\" Heading down the path, the sword dimly lit ahead and the sun, to. Many of the stones were covered with moss and the land grew, no trees on the path, everything felt ancient though.<br>\r\n\"Cautious.\" <br>\r\nOver the hill was a long, vine covered stone wall. It had to be twenty feet tall, a massive hole surrounded dents in the stone and gave entrance to the weird ruined fortress, symbols etched the bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all walked down &amp; through the hole, there was a center tower.<br>\r\nTorches were <i>lit</i> inside. \"Still no auras.\" Molisa grunted, continuing in. Looked behind to see nothing around the corner but bushes..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside smelled like wet grass and wasn't pleasant. The hall split into hallways, one leading to stairs and the other turning right. <br>\r\nMolisa went down the hallway into the building, \"Eerie place, seems kept up.\" The floor did barely have moss, the building was very quiet part from our footsteps. \"Somethings here.\" Molisa said while the end of the hall opened into a circular room, a ring with some kind of altar met between eight even lines.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoof had torches, illuminating images of ancient cyclops beast fighting against armies of men. The cities destroyed, and what looked like a god approaching them with a sword. <br>\r\nThe rest obscured by foliage and two hallways, both turning right, I approached the altar. There was a dark blue liquid in there and barely any of it, it didn't move but reflected my face. Somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erik! Come!\" Molisa yelled, and touching the altar.. crazy thought to drink it.</span></div></div>",

Dang, feel a bit light. \"Idiot! Least your not dead..\" I followed the group as they walked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you drink that, Erik?\" Konos asked me, glancing behind him, being alert. \"I felt like I should.\" Was all I mustered,  the feeling died down slowly.. the hall turned and was short. <br>\r\nInfront of us was a massive open room, pillars with weird inscriptions on them circled weird bone-looking spikes jutting out from the ground. <br>\r\nAt the other end of the hundred-foot looking room was a bigger door, a complex mosque was somewhat covered by foliage.. Torches were lit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything Grace?\" <br>\r\n\"No-\" (Credit to friend for idea)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the room, the ground rumbled weakly and the middle began to crack. \"Creature, stone!\" I ran to the side as Lin went to climbin' the vines on the wall, Konos fanned on my side as Grace &amp; Jack followed Molisa.<br>\r\nWhatever this <i>thing</i> was, it stood out from the ground and had white slots as eyes.

Pinned between two swords, your choices are either die or accept public humiliation and possibly eternal slavery. Your hot headed cockiness has completely melted in mere seconds, but you succumb nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour puny sword clatters against the cobbled street, the only sound in the now tense harbor, and every eye is upon you and the dragon. She allows a horrifically malicious grin to spread across her face, now lowering her swords to her sides, allowing you to drop to your knees. You take a large gulp, not daring to look her in the eyes. Your knees give way under her cold stare, and you fall in between her massive reptilian soles. The smell of sweat swallows you, but there's no turning back now unless you wish for an early death. A timid tongue eventually finds courage to explore the scaly tops of her foot, and barely holding back the urge to vomit and run away, you manage to work your way down to her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a smart, smart human.\" She taps your head with the foot not being serviced and turns to face whoever hasn't gone into hiding yet. \"Do you see this!? This is a merciful end to disobedience from your new rulers! If you wish for you and your loved one to live, you WILL obey!\" She annunciates that last part by roughly flipping you and smothering you with her new foot. \"What a good, smart human. Sniff, lick,serve.\" You can't see her face from underneath her massive sole, but you can only imagine a nasty smile with a glint of sadism in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore was bad, but now being underneath her was truly gut wrenching. The stench of work penetrated all of your senses, its damp and suffocating fumes sniffing out any resistance left in your already exhausted brain. Tears began to pour out of your eyes and you feebly started to raise your hands to push her off. Of course, this wasn't appreciated and she delivered a swift kick with her clawed toes to the side of your face. A gash was torn open and blood started to flow freely from your cheek, it's scent definitely started a whole new kind of frenzy in her. Her toes, hanging off your chin, now clenched and held you even closer to the bottom of her slick foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon the demise of your futile and small rebellion, you again poked out your tongue and started to explore. What were small beads of sweat made your tongue recoil with great speed, their saltiness and putridness casuing decimation upon your taste buds. She felt this and a small moan finally escaped her huge frame, taking you and everyone in earshot off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swiftly recovered and coughed. She kicked you out from under her, and you came to a sitting pose a couple of feet away. In a voice loud enough so hat everyone could hear it she began to speak.  \"Now, tiny human, do you still feel the need to rise up against the rightful owners of this world?\" You shook your head quickly, wanting this to be over as quick as possible. \"Good, good. Now, should the people give regular tribute to the monster girls of this regions as an apology for what happened here today?\" You nodded before even thinking about what that meant, and with a cacklle, she threw her head back and came back with a look that froze you where you were. \"Then the first tribute shall be you!\", she moved towards you as quick as lightning and snatch you up in her powerful arms, \"I will be back in a month to pick the next tribute! He will be for the amazing grizzly girls at the edge of town, they've been looking bored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that final damnig sentence to this poor port town, she held you tight and thrusted off the ground, flying towards the heavens. Once you were in the clouds, she started taking hungry glances at you, always quickly looking away when you noticed. After half an hour or so you had the bright idea of speaking up. \"H..he...hey what are yo-\". You didn't even get to finish because she dropped you, and you plummeted like a stone towards the ocean below. You started to scream and flail, your big mouth just got you killed. The bright blue that once spelled relaxation for you was now about to crush every bone in your body. You closed your eyes, hoping at least to die without knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to feel flecks of saltwater hit your open wound, causing immense pain, just as two telephone pole like arms snatched you up and carried you along. \"Don't ever speak up to me again! You are mine and I will do as I wish to you without question! Do you understand me!?\" She looked deep into your eyes and after a moment seemed to get what she was aiming for. She stared at your petrified face for a moment until she snapped back into sadistic mode. Her tongue now was the one that left her mouth, finding its target on your salted wound. It lapped up the blood around your wound, causing both a sense of pain and of calm. Her body shuddered after finishing this, and you tried to turn away. A burst of red flame lit up your world as it made contact with your cut, sealing it with the utmost displeasure your nerves could comprehend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scream almost came out of you, but a hand clamped itself hard over your quivering self. \"That will scar up, but it's healed. Consider it...a mark of property, slave.\" She drew that last word out with a long stroke of her tongue along your eyes. You cringed and she laughed, once again throwing you away from her. You didn't panic for long, your body roughly coming into contact with hard stone before tumbling down a hole. After getting a wall, you look around. It's a massive chamber carved in what can only be a mountain, its walls and floor covered in gold and treasure. Only a single path was cleared, and it led to an elaborate throne, behind it crudely fashioned room entrances. Your gaze went to go see where you came from,but she was upon you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing tackled by a dragon wasn't on your list of plans today, but you get thrown around like a doll regardless of what you want. She now studies you meticulously from her perch on your stomach. \"Hmmm, yes you'll do. I was originally going to auction you off, but we'll see just how well we get along huh?\" She extends one claw from her huge hand and drags it along your undamaged cheek, careful not to damage you now. \"Erika, and you?\" She stares in your soul through your eyes, daring a lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E..er...Erik.\" You stammer out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. No, footboy I like more. Follow me.\" She dismounts you and walks over to her throne, plopping down besides the protests from the age old chair. A chest of gold is grabbed by her foot and dragged over as a stool. You stupidly think it's for you, but she stretches herself across it before you can even get close. You suppress a sigh and kneel before her, already knowing what's she going to ask for. She smiles and points regardless. Her scaly soles are incredibly intimidating. Each toe ends in a claw that could kill you with ease, possibly centuries of filth form tiny hills between each of her toes, her actual feet slimy with sweat and grime from work and adventures. This is the first time you're properly seeing them, and it makes the whole experience much worse. You take a hard gulp before offering you face as a sacrifice to these behemoths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eagerly accepts and starts massaging herself with your face, her smell now forever intwined with you. It's nauseating, but you oblige, you've seen her mad and you're stuck thousands of feet away from society.  Erika now moans and squirms freely, enjoying every waking moment of your humiliation between her reeking pair of twins. You get brief glimpses of her face from between the rubbing frenzy, and such lustful sadism strikes fear deep into you. Any hopes of escape become dashed, and she suddenly squashes with a sole. It drags you off the chest and pulls you in towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up with a pit in your chest, her eyes glinting with playfulness. \"See the entrance over there? I haven't closed it off for a special reason.\" She leans forward, her hot breath hitting your face in pants from her excitement. \"You make it out of this cave and you have a chance at a free and new life. I'll even fully equip you if you make it, I've got a ton of armor and weapons here, dragons promise no tricks. Go ahead, stand up.\" You stand, weary of her. \"I only needed to make an example out of you so the towns people would fear me. I mean, you would sweeten the deal, but I can get another one of you anywhere. The other girls on this mountain come by boys a lot slower than me though. Anyways, does this sound like a deal?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eagerly nod and stretch, wariness gone. \"Okay then, one last to seal the deal and we'll be good to go.\" She smirks and extends a foot, rolling her ankle in a circle for added effect. \"Big toe please, she feels like she hasn't gotten much attention lately.\" She scrunches her toes then splays them wide open. You nearly groan and pick her leg up to your level, giving a quick peck to it, setting it down, and getting a few feet away for any added advantage. She evaluates the situation with an expert eye before speaking. \"Three, two, one, go!\"</span></div></div>",

This took her entirely by surprise, and she tackled the cold, hard ground. You desperately looked for anything that could help you in the pile of gold rubbish. Coins, necklaces, a vase or two, rubies, diamonds, nothing, and then you found it. You grabbed the hilt of a small sword just as Erika grabbed onto your ankle and yanked you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay on your back, your armed hand still hidden under the dragon's wealth, staring up into the vicious eyes of your captor. She grinned a victorious grin, and you became unsure of your ability to win this game  under her withering gaze. \"Well would you look at that. Dumb human didn't even make it an inch, typical, but expected.\" She rolled her eyes and sat down on your chest with all her monstrous weight, crushing any air you had out of you. \"It's really a shame, I know a whole family of pandas not from here. You could've made it in a day if you went straight west. They would've loved you. Instead you went straight back into my captivity.\" She drove the point in with a rough bounce on your chest, causing quite the cough from your little body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika giggled as if she wasn't a century old dragon, but a little school girl. A toe rose to your face, danced its way across, and eventually returning to its original perch next your ear. It's unpleasant fragrance wafted up to your nose, causing utter discomfort on a primal level. She watched all this emotion play across your eyes with a far off, lustful look. Then, in a flash, the toe was brought back, this time the whole foot came with it. It completely encompassed your face, drowning out anything from the outside world when combined with the other foot, when she so graciously added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo air came to you untainted, and her feet dripped of sweat from the heated chamber that they made around your face. Smelly, salty, and overall putrid beads of her work made their way down onto your face, flooding whatever crevices they found. Erika took full pleasure in this, you could feel her restlessness upon your chest, and her iron gripped hands relaxed themselves upon your legs. She grinded into your stomach, causing you to heave and take in even more of her stench than you would ever want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sputter and cough, muffled by the fleshy walls of her scaled feet, really just glorified slabs of meat. Reality starts to fade out, the noxious gasses are finally winning, when suddenly she removes herself completely from your now very worn out body. You take greedy gasps of air, vowing never to take clean oxygen for granted again. She stand over you, each leg straddling a different side of your torso, idly watching you get reoriented after your extended torture. \"We can't use you all up in just a couple of minutes can we? After all, I'm looking very forward to tonight.\" A leg lifts, an ankle stretched, and your crotch stroked. You jump at the suddenness of her advance, to which she decided to ignore and bends down. \"Give your master a kiss and maybe I'll forgive you for trying to leave. Maybe.\" A flicker of hatred appears in her eye, disappearing just as fast as it came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the beast above you leans in for her kiss, you lean up and give her a passionate surprise. She rapidly blinks in confusion, you just shattered her idea of this being torture for you, and you take advantage of that. You sling your unhidden arm around her shoulder and pull her in for another, which she blindly accepts in this new romantical world unfolding before her. You feel almost bad for what you're about to do, but just as you pull her in you throw your concealed arm into the air. Gold bits fly everywhere, and Erika foolishly takes this as a gesture of love. Her heart, completely misguided by your false courtings, receives the end of a blade as her eyes watch the coins dash upwards towards the ceiling of the dim cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you break contact, her head whips around to face you. The fate of this dragon is well known to Erika, for she seeks no revenge in her last moments. You push away from the quickly fading behemoth before her corpse crushes you and stand up amongst the centuries old gold. You quickly gather what you can, your sword and a basic set of armor, before preparing to embark. You take one last glance at the fire breathing reptile and touch your scar, a permanent reminder of the underside of her foot. Hey, maybe if the other monsters smell dragon on you they won't take you as their own. That's a positive thought and with that, you head out into the mountainside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coldness of the high peaks tear into your being, quickly sapping you of energy. You're nowhere near the top, nor nowhere near the bottom. You hold your tunic close to your face and begin your track East, away from the panda family in the west. After an hour or so this purposeless wandering in the barren rocks of this frozen wasteland, what do your hear.</span></div></div>",

You were just a weak human, while she could subjugate giants to her will. It didn't even seem fair to you. The next morning,you hung your armor back where you took it from, telling Erika that you were swearing off your quest to raise a family with her, to which she responded by pushing you down for another day of love making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen years had passed since that day. Thanks to your frequent love sessions, you and Erika had gathered a small army of about twenty dragon daughters, every single one you loved unconditionally. During their schooling, you told them about your rather brief adventure before meeting their mother. But then, something strange happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of weeks after your latest romp with Erika, you had expected her to lay another egg to add to the family. But it never came. Instead, her belly started bloating, and continued to do so. There was only one conclusion you could come to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pregnant... the human way. After the initial confusion of how this happened died down, you guided your wife through how this type of pregnancy worked. You stayed by her side while your daughters worked together to provide for the family. You held her hand up until the fateful day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after nine months, Erika had given birth to... a boy?! And a human boy at that! Both of you, as well as your horde of daughters questioned this outcome, believingit impossible for a monster girl to give birth to a boy, let alone a human one. This was unheard of throughout history. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, human or not, he was just as loved among you and your family as any of your daughters. Erika allowed you to give him the name Frederick since he was the only boy. While he was human, you soon found out that there was dragon blood in him, as he was much stronger than any human baby you'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost two decades had passed since Frederick's birth. While his dragon blood made him stronger than any human, it still didn't put him over his dragon sisters, a fact they used against him along with the steep girl/boy ratio to always tease him. He still loved them, but he could do without constantly getting pinned by one of his younger sisters you had after him. But, there was one thing that worried you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the others, you had told him about your adventure. But where your daughters cooed and awwed at the love story ending, Frederick was angry when you got to the part about abandoning your quest to start a family. He called you a coward for not seeing things through. He made his own vow to save his fellow humans from the monster queen's army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, while everyone was asleep, Frederick got up and began to sneak around. Finding your old sword and armor, he dawned the gear and prepared to depart through the snow down the mountain, his dragon blood keeping him warm. Before he left though, he wrote up a note to you and the girls, apologizing for leaving, but saying he had to do this. With that, he began to trudge through the snowy mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

Mom and dad are worried sick right now.\" She says as she reaches out to grab your arm and fly back, only for you to pull your arm away from her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I'm doing this, and I don't care what you, mother, or our coward of a father think about this. You might not get it because you aren't human, but to know that my kind are suffering from a tyrant, I can't just sit on a mountain and let it happen. I'm sorry, but I'm going.\" You tell her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do she and the others take this?</span></div></div>",

Hold out your hand.\" You're hesitant, but you suppose if she wanted to kill you she would have by now. You hold out your hand and she places two rings in your palm. The first was a gold band with what looked to be a ruby gemstone. The second was silver with a sapphire instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ruby ring will help you get off the mountain.\" Erika explains. \"It's been enchanted by fire elementals, meant to be given to their slaves and lovers so they can withstand the heat they give off. As long as you wear that ring, you'll be immune to any extreme temperatures like the fire elemental home or even the snowy peaks of these mountains.\" Without hesitation you slide the ring onto your left ring finger. The effects are almost immediate as you feel your body's strength returning and the cold fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. The other ring is a bit more... personal. My mother gave it to me when I became an adult and was ready to move out. She wanted me to give it to my mate in case he ever got lost or was in trouble. Simply wear the ring and rub the stone, and I'll be able to hear your thoughts and know where you are. If you get into trouble or have second thoughts about your feelings for me, use it and I'll come find you.\" You can't believe she's giving something so personal to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want me to have this? What if you ever find a mate other then me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll find the witch that enchanted this one and get her to make me a new one. Oh right, one last thing. Here, to help you after you leave the mountains.\" She pulls out a medallion. It looked like one of those serpent-like dragons you heard actually co-existed with humans in the eastern lands, this one white as snow. It was coiling itself around a green gemstone that it held in it's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a dragonstone.\" She continues. \"Normally, it is meant to further enhance a dragon's natural abilities, but it turns out that if used by a human, it actually gives them watered-down versions of dragon anatomy. You skin will become more durable like our scales and your strength will increase tenfold. Some have even been said to sprout their own wings. It'll take more then a few orcs to stop you with this. Just clench the stone in your fist and it'll do the rest. You only get 30 minutes transformed however, then after that you have to wait 24 hours before you can use it again.\" You accept this along with the rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for everything Erika.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Remember what I said though, if you ever change your mind, just summon me and I'll come. Goodbye.\" She flies off, back towards her cave. You slip the dragonstone around your neck and put Erika's summon ring in your pocket. Thanks to her, you were more powerful than ever. Now then, back to climbing down the mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You sat in defeat, freezing and alone on a desolate mountainface in god knows where. You just slayed a dragon, yet you are about to die from the elements. Such a cruel twist of fate leaves your soul as barren as this place you find yourself trapped in. You pull your shirt over you, trying to keep as much warmth as possible while you try to figure this whole thing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no warning whatsoever, the light snow fall turned into a full blown blizzard. Icy winds whipped away at your body, the snow quickly accumulating around your legs. You pulled yourself in close and hoped that this wasn't the end, and if it was, hopefully it was a quick one. In the right ball you were in you couldn't see anything, so you were shocked to say the least when you got a tap on your shoulder. You looked up to see a monster girl, a yeti. You tried picking up your sword to scare her away with, but she gently yet firmly took it away and set it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she sat down next to you, her extreme body warmth melting away any resistance. \"I'm simply here to help,\" she tried to explain as she cuddled up next you \"I mean no harm, I just don't like dead bodies on my front lawn. You understand right?\" She searched for response in your eyes, and getting none, she became worried. \"Hey! Buddy? Are you okay?\" She shook you, and got a mumble. This caused her to jump in excitement, and she slung you over shoulder. The trip home had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you were in a very tight embrace. You struggled only for a minute before calming down and remembering where you were. You turned to look into her adorable eyes, eyes that radiated the same warmth as her body. This girl just saved your life. That dawned on you as you stared into the deep blue eyes of your savior. \"I'm Lily,and that's Mackenzie,\" She let you up to look around, but still had an arm wrapped around your waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunched over a furnace, a cyclops rose up and waved with an odd sense of mundane happiness. \"You are free to stay however long you'd like, your clothes are over there by the way. Food is the left room over...\" she continued like that fact you were nude did nothing for her. You genuinely took that as peculiar, but as long as they weren't having problems with it, Lily was really warm. You allowed to let the hand around your waist take you back down into the bed, where she cuddled you with utmost care. You were on a quick recovery from the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an excellent sword you had, ancient armor too. Can I ask where you got it? It's the work of an artist, truly.\" Mackenzie had finally spoken up, probably uncomfortable in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you smell it? He's a dragon slayer! That's the only reason he could've come down the mountain, right...wait what's your name?\" Lily shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told her and were quickly talked over again. \"Hey Erik, do you mind if I upgrade some stuff of yours? The armor being ancient and all, it won't stand up in a fight. It's no trouble at all, actually how about some food? You must be ravished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth but Lily interjected. \"All of that would be great, thank you so much for being a dear.\" She turned her atterntion from her friend back to you, holding you even closer and tighter than before. Heat came off of her in ample supply, and under the blankets it was almost too much. Mackenzie was back quickly and handed you a sandwich before returning to work. She was a big and sweet woman, albeit covered in dirty, ragged clothes. Lily watched with an odd look, but didn't say a word as you chowed down. You were in conpelete heaven. After what you went through with Erika, this was utopia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dozed off in the yetis friendly arms due to the warmth and food in your belly, not awakening until much later the next day. The blankets were off the bed, and the two women were in a very friendly conversation about how well your new gear was turning out. It was still leather, but hardened with keratin plates. Light, but super effective. You got up to go try it on, but Lily sat you down, her friend insisting it could be brought over. As she came closer, you couldn't help see the cyclops's massive breasts sway with every step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both shared a laugh. \"Having fun there?\" Mackenzie offered up. Immediately you started an apology but again they laughed. \"No no don't worry, it's a compliment really. It just gets so hot in here, I had to peel off my top. Feel free to look, everything is the guests in our house.\" She gave you a rare thing, the cyclops allowed a reassuring smile to show through her otherwise emotionless face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she handed you the chest plate and it was suprisingly versatile. You were to able to move and everything but still felt protected. You and Lily both clapped, and Mackenzie let through another rarity, a blush. \"Cyclops are just such good blacksmiths aren't they?\" Lily called after her retreating companion. She turned to face you. \"And I hear you're an amazing cuddler. Can you tell me all about the bad bad dragon?\" You laid down and Lily pulled over some lighter sheets, taking your hand and guiding it to her breasts . They were smaller yet perkier than Kenzie's, and Lily snuggled up really close as you ran your hand through her mounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of your quiet play session, she unlatched herself from you, slightly pulling away. This hurt you and went to hug her, which she halted. \"Do you really want to hug me? Think long and hard about it\" She \"accidentally\" brought her knee up and gently across your crotch. You didn't hesitate in hugging her again, failing to catch the last part about hugging back equaling marriage to yetis until it was too late. \"Okay you said so. Hey Mackenzie you heard that right?\" An affirmative answer gave rise to a smirk in Lily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to pull back from her, but you were the one that sealed the marriage. Now it was time for the honeymoon, and Lily held you very very close, placing a small kiss upon your lips.she sent one hand down on an expedition back to your crotch. Before she could do this however, you took advantage of only one hand holding you and broke away, launching yourself off the bed towards freedom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the blankets came with and you become a tangled heap of panic on the floor, which allowed Lily to control you with extreme ease. \"Hey Mackenzie can I ask a big favor of you? Can you hold my husband down? He seems overcome with joy that he's finally with the love of his life and we still need to copulate. Yeah really big favor i know, but I'll share him with you if that's better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cyclops took no time in coming over to assist. They unceremoniously dumped you out, Mackenzie securing your hands to the ground with her knees, and your \"wife\" took her position at your loin. You look up with pleasing eyes, only to get one uncaring eye stare back. Lily sat back and gripped your shaft tight with both of her furry feet. You groaned aloud and started asking foreignness, and if you could do this without a third party. Mackenzie sniffed out any of that nonsense by sitting down on your face, her sweat soaked overalls making quick work of your attempts at a second try of escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both snickered, and Lily started pumping, furiously jacking you off with her warm feet. Her friend dismounted your face (after making sure you weren't going to rebel again) to let you see what was going on at least. The warmth and viscousness of the yetis feet quickly brought you to the edge, where she stopped. Then she watched you stay erect from a little bit of Mackenzie crotch play on your face while she masturbated to near climax at the mere thought of finally having a man around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you two joined at the hips, where she finished just seconds before you did, and loudly gasping, she collapsed onto your stomach. Her friend took this as a signal, put the blankets over you two, and went back to work. Lily took you in a vice like grip, ensuring you were going to stay for a night of fun. Her warmth and your exhaustion quickly lulled you off the sleep. When you awoke, who's turn was it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You get only half a step or so in before you feel a gust of wind fly past you, causing you to stop. Erika quickly ran past you towards the exit, where she sealed the exit by rolling a boulder over the fron of it. You frantically look around for anything that could keep her at bay, but you both know the futility in that, so she slowly advances on your poor soul. You retreat into a far corner, but you only delay the reunion with her scaled feet. The realization that your journey has already come to a screeching halt dawns upon you, and you suddenly you have nothing to lose. You get up and charge like a bull into the side of Erika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she doesn't budge, she's an ancient and powerful dragon, instead she grabs the nape of your neck and carries you back to the throne. \"How pathetic, you honestly thought you'd earn points with me by struggling? By trying to hurt me? How dare you! I am your entire world now, do you honestly want your world to be hell?\" She backhands you, sending you reeling to the hard floor. The first thing you see as you turn back around is the the worn out scales of her feet. \"Perhaps if you really show you love these things, I can consider not dropping you into a horny colony of giant ants huh? Sound like a deal?\" She flexes her toes in your face and you throw yourself at them, your anger now dissipated into depressed acceptance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up one foot, heavy as a cinder block or two, and start to suck and scrape the underside of her toenails. A mistake, crud had been accumulating there for eons for all you know, and not one you will ever forget. Your tongue shot itself back into your body just as quick as you sent it out, and you recoil from the sheer taste of it. This elicits a giggle, and she drags you over, pinning you underneath her. She roughly jams her foot into your mouth, a very tight fit, and does it herself. Her long, knifelike, and mistreated nails rub away centuries of grime with the help of your two bottom teeth. It's absolutely horrific, and you do your best to resist. It's to no avail, she's stronger than anything, and she easily keeps you right where she wants you despite your weak attempts at pulling her ankle off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be a good foot boy, swallow what I give you with eagerness. It'll be your only food from now on, my filth. Show me affection and beg for mercy, beg for the chance to do anything besides my feet. Humans, disgusting.\" She taps her foot on your lip, shaking any leftover dirt into your mouth before switching out, now using her left. They smell of death, who you wish would grant you a sweet release right now, and taste even worse. Little bits of filth, soaked for ages in sweat and coated with whatever she's been stepping on, now take residence in your mouth by the handful. The tiniest bulge in your cheek appears, you simply cannot swallow this poison fast enough, there's just so much. You start to gag and heave from the rotten flecks of toe jam, causing her to temporarily relieve you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You puke on my floor, you lick it up. Speaking of licking, give me your tongue.\" You reluctantly turn to face her, your soul broken by her. Your tongue gets pinned to the ground by one foot, the other massaging itself on the back of your head. She grinds her sole on it, whatever muck didn't get absorbed earlier, she gives you now. Your hair becomes slick with her sweat, your tongue numb with the torture it's receiving. After a long while of her rubbing her feet on you, she pins your neck down with an arch of her now mostly clean sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ponders for a moment, her heavy feet resting on your Adam's apple, thinking very hard about what is needed next. With a grumble in her stomach; she's now aware of what she wants, and so she beckons you to follow her into one of the small rooms behind the throne. They're crudely carved into the rock, but lavishly adorned. What appears to be a dining room has a long oak table, gold plates, silver chalices, and food already laid out. It's the thing of kings, but Erika reassures you that you aren't getting a piece of the roast chicken or any of the cake and wine. You go under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate for the briefest of seconds, your hunger fighting back fear, and so she punches you with the strength of a truck. You collapse face first into the table, slinking below it with only semi consciousness. She takes her spot at the head of the table, her massive feet once again the entirety of your world. You sit cross cross apple sauce and take one in your hand, kneading it with your thumb. No matter how much \"love\" you give these tortur devices, you are certain they will always carry the same odor as before. A stale, damp, suffocating air surrounds you as you try to please her twins. Revolting, but much better than being under them you must admit. Now, you take your thumb in small circles around  the center of her foot, trying desperately to remember how to do this from your few experiences before this hell. Apparently it works, or the chicken does, as she starts to elicits small grunts and moans in increasing frequency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to ignore the obvious, you just massage harder, resting both feet on your knees so you can treat both of them at once. Little presses here and there from your thumb, your fingers intertwined with the gaps between her toes, you give it your all. As long as she's happy, she won't give you over to people who would gang rape you to death. You try to take that as a positive, but reality comes back to haunt you as she tugs you out from under the table. A look in her eyes tells you she's not going to play nice, and she shoves one greasy hand into your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou latch on to her thumb with your lips, now realizing just how hungry you really are. You suck with growing intensity and passion, trying to gain as much chicken grease as possible before she takes it away. Finger after finger, you notice that she's not going to, she's pretty into this. Her moans increase in such a volume that it shakes the walls. It's too much, all this prolonged worship, and she shoves you to the ground right there and then. Your pants come off barely intact along with your shirt, and it's not too long before  you lay naked under her excited body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA freshly licked hand expertly explores your jewels, easily the most valuable jewels in her collection to her right now. Even that doesn't hold out though, and she eases her way over your shaft, penetrating herself on you. This big and heavy of someone sitting with deadweight on your hips sends waves of pain throughout your body, but you not dare interrupt her lustful rocking. You try to grasp onto something, but the smooth rock of the mountain yields nothing. Erika sees your attempts and takes your hands in hers, now increasing her speed twofold. The heat emanating from her is able to melt stone, her noises able to shatter rocks, and the smell of her sex hangs heavily in the room. You do all you can do not focus, but your penis remains rock hard, trapped in her for however long she wants. You think your hands are about be crushed in hers as she nears orgasm, and that she may expel fire from how rapidly she's riding you right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's little of your worries as she roars, nearly bringing down the cave as she expels her love juices in a torrent, with you returning the favor soon after. You both lay next to eachother for a moment, attempting to catch your breath for what you hope is not round two. That would kill you. Instead, she pulls you in close, softly cuddling. This is the most relaxed you've seen her, no sadism at all. You do nothing, careful not to mess up this calmness. Suddenly she snaps up, somehow energized yet again. What could she possibly want now </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as you thought she was sleeping, you get tossed across the room into ta hard wall. You audibly groan in protest, but Erika doesn't seem to care. She's frantically searching for something, muttering curses under her breath. This scares you, you didn't think anything could scare a dragon, but low and behold, something has her attention. She darts out of the room, and follow to see her now brandishing two great swords and specially crafted armor. You gulp and she faces you. As she speaks, her uneasiness shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have some uh business I have to attend to okay?\" She gets a look to confusion. \"Of course it's okay! I'm the boss around here! Don't get into anything you're not supposed to touch understand?\" She wrestles some iron boots into her massive feet as she finishes up. \"I shouldn't be long, don't go anywhere, don't touch anything. You know what actually, sit.\" She looks with amusement as you quickly comply. \"When I get back, you better be in that exact spot, oh and get your tongue ready for me.\" She flashes an evil grin, slides the boulder open, leaves, and seals you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she's not back, you'll die. It's an incredibly uneasy feeling, but you decide to explore out of boredom. She took some serious gear, heavy armor and massive swords. There must be a war on and she forgot about it in her lust. That's going to be funny to explain isn't it? You dig through her mountains of trinkets. There's about a bajillion gold coins, some goblets, a treasure chest or two, countless gems, the usual stuff. What really catches your eye is the seemingly random assortment of gear. There's a mismatch of everything in every material. Chainplate, leather, bone, tin, steel, copper, everything. You pick up a particularly nasty looking quadruple sided axe and set it back down before you hurt yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's another set of her customized armor, and her arm gauntlet alone swallows your arm when you stick it though. Her chest plate you can't pick up, and when you pick up her boot, you nearly faint right there. It's quite old and used, the accumulated sweat a weapon of its own. You toss it far away from you and decide to go for better. You turn and get a sick grin, her throne is open. You take an extra cautious look around before approaching it and sitting on it. You felt like you committed a crime, there'd be so much trouble if you were caught. You get up and kick it out of hatred for Erika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see the four room entrances. Ones the kitchen, and she'd know if you ate food from there. You open the second door to see a well worn bed surrounded by very expensive looking carpet. You step in and look around. The face in the mirror scares you, you already don't recognize it. A massive scar runs down one cheek, your hairs messed up, and you look like you just crawled out of a war zone. Stepping away, you nearly run into the drawer. She's a dragon, she doesn't wear clothes except for armor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curiosity tugs at you, and you rummage through it. Junk is the first drawer, men's clothes the second, women's the third, and extensive amount of rope in the fourth. More questions than answers is what you have achieved, and you stumble out into the next room. It's a bathroom with not much besides a toilet, sink, and shower. You doubt the third thing has been used much, and you move on to the fourth room. It opens up to a dark stairway, one you don't dare try. Back in the throne room, you wander aimlessly, bored out of your mind before taking a nap on the floor like a dog. If Erika found you in her bed, bad things might go down. You think about getting redressed, but that would prove you left your spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rue the day you tried to attack her in the port, but you nap regardless. When you awake, nothing. You rinse and repeat this for a day or two before you can hear the familiar creaking of the entrance unsealing. You sit up straight, unsure of who exactly is on the other side. A solid kick cracks the boulder, and from there you can see Erika push her way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's fatigued, covered in new scratches, carrying one cracked broadsword instead of two new ones, her tail drooping. As soon as she sees you is when she gets all her energy back. She sheds her chestplate, showing off how sweaty her body got before starting to take off her boots. As soon as they pop off, an invisible gas fills the windowless room, one that could knock out an elephant. You choke from where you sit, a good couple feet away from your captor. She flashes a sadistic smile and walks over to a chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens it and a mimic pops out. \"Lets see how bad our little boy has been while I've been away huh? Tell me all about it Mimic.\" Your life flashes before your eyes, you were never alone in this room, the mimic saw you break many, many, many unspoken rules and she's spilling it all. They both look over at you many times throughout their hushed conversation, and you fear the worst. \"Well okay, you're relieved  for now, thank you, I owe you a boy yes.\" The mimic enters her chest, and it disappears. The dragon slowly turns and gives you a gaze that could turn a medusa to stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did WHAT?! In my house?! Oh I so solemnly swear, come here!\" Her face glows with rage. \"I just slaughtered an entire city of rebellious humans and monsters, what makes you think you're special? What?! I could dispose of you easily. Do you want to be owned by a a mimic? A bug? Another human?! Huh?! What is your MALFUNCTION?!\" She kicks you over and steps down hard on your chest, your chest exploding with pain and cracking sounds. You grunt and she places her other foot over your mouth and nose, lettting two days worth of boot sweat french your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly start fading out from the sudden abuse, and it's not any better when she starts jumping. Every fiber of your being screams then fades to black. Suddenly you sputter upwards back into consciousness, an absolute stream of urine drenching your face. \"Lick up what you can't swallow then beg for your life. If you're lucky, I could maybe consider giving you a possible second chance with me.\" She takes a foot and drags your face through her piss. Both of the smells combined nearly knock you out again, but you stomach what you can. You lap up her golden puddle, still warm but cooling on the cold mountain stone. It's bitter, but nowhere near as bad as her feet. The potentency increased exponentially in the last two days and it's excruciating to work through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely get your tongue back out for her foot before you start gagging, heaving even. \"This is exactly what you get for such a pig like attitude. Disgusting footboy, going through my stuff. I ought to kill you outright, you better work harder.\" In a blind attempt to save your life, you wrap your mouth around the rancid foot. Every tastebuds simultaneously explodes in disgust, her sweat squeezing out into flood type conditions onto your senses. She gasps in approval, and shoves her foot in just a tad more. Unfortunately, she hits the back of your throats and that's curtains for you. You vomit all over her sole, collapsing in a hacking mess of apologies and begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point she body slams you, setting herself on your chest with the force of a school bus. She plunges her messy foot back into your mouth until pinched off your air until you start sucking.  You start wailing as you correct your error, as grave as it was. She sighs and increases the aggressiveness, furiously rubbing both feet all around your face. Everything you have wants to fight back, but there's no energy, andyou submit to her torture. The smell alone causes you to pass out a few times,and the whole cave is controlled by low hanging, foul smelling, sweaty air. It's sheer hell, and your destroyed body can't do it anymore. You go limp under her and she kicks you away like a used toy. Does she end up keeping you or does a nice donation need to take place?</span></div></div>",

You relieved them of a bit of gold, a steel long sword, a potion used to heal wounds and a strange glowing stone.

I promise, you'll come to love it.\" She giggled, her foot now mere inches from your face, her eyes glittering with lustful anticipation as she continued to grin playfully at you.

As her scent drifted into his nose, his body relaxed even further, every breath robbing him of his strength and resistance in the most pleasurable way.  Some small part of him tried to rally itself, but his arms did little more than twitch helplessly as another deep breath of her scent further robbed him of that resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he simply lay there, helpless, obedient, sniffing deeply, a small, dreamy smile spreading over his face as he surrendered to the bunny's aroma.  His breathing grew deeper as he desperately sought to breathe in her musk, each breath sweeter than the last, each one making him feel so wonderfully weak, so delightfully helpless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny girl giggled sweetly, gazing down at the now placid and submissive human with a loving expression.  She'd always dreamed of this moment; to finally find a sweet, submissive, handsome human to have as her own!  For bunny girls, watching their mate succumb to their feet was the biggest turn on, knowing that their male was becoming deeply enthralled by their scent, marked by their aroma, a love slave of their feet.  And now, after years of dreaming, she finally got a human of her own!  It was all she could do to keep up her ministrations, her every instinct screaming at her to simply take him here and now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that's right... nice, deep breaths...\" she whispered, her voice breaking a bit as her own arousal continued to build, her sex glistening with her desire, further filling the air with the musky scent of her sex in addition to the warm scent of her feet.  \"Nice and deep... in... out... in... out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breathing obediently followed her coaxing, his chest rising and falling slowly in time with his long, deep breaths.  His cock strained against his pants, his hips thrusting up weakly, instinctively seeking attention, yearning for her touch, begging silently with his body.  The bunny bit her lip, noticing his unspoken submission, her cheeks flushed a bright red, eyes shining with giddy excitement.  Her foot shifted slightly, her toes splaying as she allowed his nose to slip between them, letting him nestle in and drink in her scent even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting herself down on the ground, her foot still securely in place, never letting him escape her scent, she brought her other foot forward, stroking tentatively across the bulge of his pants.  She gasped a bit in surprise as he moaned, his hips immediately pushing up against her soft sole, and she giggled as she began to stroke him nice and slow, sliding her warm foot up and down the concealed cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-does that feel good?\" she asked, her voice husky, her eyes darkening a bit as the sheer power she held over him became more and more apparent.  Almost without thinking, one of her hands moved down, sliding her fingers along her glistening sex, a whimper rising from her lips as a bolt of pleasure flooded her at even the faintest touch.  She was so aroused right now, so enthralled by the power she now held over her new mate, her husband, her love slave!  Soon, she was stroking herself wantonly, moaning and whimpering.  Her foot continued to playfully nuzzle his face, making sure that not a single breath he took was not filled with her aroma, making sure that the pleasure he was feeling was intimately connected in his mind with her scent.  Once she was done with him, the mere scent of her feet would be enough to bring him to the peaks of pleasure, and that along would give her power over him that he'd never be able to break!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he ever even wanted to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had long since lost track of how much time had passed since his defeat at the hands, or rather feet, of his Wife.  Not that such a thing really concerned him anymore; his mind was too distracted by the constant desire he felt, the arousal that was ever present.  Any thoughts of adventure, of heroics, of being the hero he had set out to be, were long gone.  Now, there was only one thing he truly cared about...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm home!\" came a deeply familiar voice, sweet and warm.  His whole body burned, his cock springing immediately to attention as the sound of his Wife's voice filled his ears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Bunny Wife entered the burrow, her body a bit plumper, more curvaceous than it had been when they'd first met, her belly showing the faint swell of their first litter.  She gave him a warm, loving smile as she saw him, already on his knees, his glazed eyes gazing at her with adoration, and she giggled happily as she made her way to her chair.  Sitting down with a sigh, she brought one curvy leg up, her foot rising up, before she let it bounce before his eyes.  Her gaze glittered as she looked at him, and her toes gently wiggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her wordless command, he crawled over to her, his nostrils flaring as the scent of her foot practically drew him to her, like a moth to flame.  Soon, his face was pressed against her warm sole, his nose settling in between her toes, and he was soon breathing deeply, his mind drifting back down into the sweet, sleepy surrender he had come to crave.  He whimpered as he felt her other foot, soft and smooth, rise up to caress his cock, hard and ever naked for her.  Soon, he was sniffing happily at her feet as she lovingly stroked him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed happily, settling back against the soft cushions of her chair, happy to let her adorable little hubby worship her feet, reveling in the feeling of power, yet reveling even more in the love and affection she felt for him, her own little hubby slave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took good care of him, loving him, pleasuring him, and their lives were filled with bliss.  Her hand reached down to idly pat her bulging belly, the thought of their first litter of daughters giving her a warm feeling.  She looked forward to teaching their daughters the secret to claiming a husband in the future, and she knew that her cute little hubby would be all to happy to help her 'demonstrate' for them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE END</span></div></div>",

But trying to keep them all in your field of vision proves impossible.  One rushes you from your blind side and only the sound of her feet lets you know she is coming.  You immediately swing at her but she ducks and then hits you hard in the chest with a nasty kick.  You fly backwards and hit the ground but manage to hold on to your blade.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat proves to be very important because the rest of the Bunny Girls charge at you.  One tries to stomp on your face but a quick slash from your sword cuts her leg and she gives a cry and backs away.  You couldn't stop another Bunny Girl from kicking you hard in the ribs and you feel horrible pain in your side.  You are flung into the air and roll, all the while desperately clutching the only protection you have, your sword.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far you had taken two nasty kicks which may have cracked your rib and all you had to show for it was a cut on one of the seven Bunny Girl's legs.  Things were not looking good for you at all.  </span></div></div>",

You were generous enough to give a crazed bunny girl the chance to flee for her life only to get ambushed by a whole gang of bunny girls in return! If you cut and run, they'll probably just send out MORE mean sadistic bunny girls after you! Hell, they might even get the attention of one of the Big Four and SHE'LL get involved just cuz there's a cute defiant boy pretending to be a Hero on the loose!<br>\r\nNo siree Pete, you are not making the same mistake twice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tremendous power was surging through your arm. A power unlike anything you've felt that was of this world. Your hand began to twitch uncontrollably! At first you got a bit nervous that this unfamiliar foreign magic was emanating through your body, but the soothing voice that was allegedly the voice of an angel itself coaxed your tension away.<br>\r\nYou trust your faith in the angelic voice until your hand stopped twitching and you found yourself wielding a long bright shining surge of divine energy like a sword! It wasnt a steel sword, but it'll do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, rabbit,\" you apologized, \"I gave you the chance to flee. I cant afford to give you and your sisters another.\" You bring your arm back, ready to deliver the most epic godly swing of your entire partial adulthood! \"THE BLADE OF PENANCE RELINQUISHES YOU!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FWA-SHOOOOOOMMM!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith but one single swing of the heavens, The Blade of Penance strikes not one, but ALL of the sinful rabbit girls in one blow! Though you saw not physical damage, their frozen timid expressions quickly changed to completely emotionless as you saw glowing auras emit become sucked from their bodies and into your arm! The strange feeling you had to absorbing these odd auras was beyond anything you've ever felt! It didnt necessarily hurt, but it didnt feel like something you could get used to anytime soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after the absorptions, every one of those bunny girls fell to the ground and their bodies morphed into little actual bunny rabbits! Did you just devolve them or something?!<br>\r\nLuckily for them, they didnt die. Upon realizing this and the fact that this dumb boy aint weak, each of those bunny rabbits scattered! Hopefully that'll teach 'em to bully humans!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe divine surging quickly vanished and the holy power was gone. You took a couple of breaths as you reflected on what just happened. You just took down a whole gang of monsters in one go!<br>\r\n\"I... won...\" you panted, \"I won! I won!! I WON!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the angelic voice in your head clapping, giving you applause!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, child! You truly are worthy of the gift! The world is surely saved after all! Praise Zados!!\" Ignoring the forbidden Z-word, youre still uneasy about what just happened.<br>\r\n\"What was that, earlier?\" you questioned the angel voice.<br>\r\n\"What was what?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"When I sucked up those glowing things from those bunny girls and then they turned into actual bunnies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have just consumed their soul energy,\" the angel explains, \"it is the very essence drawing from within their very soul that makes them the beasts beyond what their natural animal brethren become.\" Kinda complicated, but you think you get the message... you know, because you werent stupid (or at least THAT stupid!).<br>\r\n\"You mean I just sucked up their magic that's making them actual monster... people?\"<br>\r\n\"If that is how you wish to word it,\" said the voice, \"this very energy you have consumed can also be used to make you stronger beyond that of any normal human being. In other words, their loss is your gain.\"<br>\r\nNow youre getting it, \"So, I'm now stronger than I used to be? Does this mean I can take on the dragon that's attacking the port now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeeerrrrrrrrrrr....\" she held that syllable for quite a long time, \"...perhaps not! Hera, like the other generals of the Witch Queen, is quite a high ranking above any earthly monster girl.\" You shouldve figured beating a dragon wasnt gonna be easy. \"Destroying her may require much more energy than you currently have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm gonna have to slay more monsters to get on the same level as her?\" Whelp, you made it your vow to defeat the Witch Queen. And if you cant beat a dragon, there is no possibly way you can slay the great Queen of Monsters herself. So for the time being, it looks like your role as a Hero will also double as an Exterminator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHero Erik the Great Exterminator! ...No, that name sounds stupid. Unlike you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEh, you'll think of a more fitting title later. Right now, you need to begin your extermination duty. Question is, where should you go?<br>\r\nYou recall reading in a Help Wanted ad last night about a town up north that's having problems with child abductions by wild harpies. That's a good place to get your name known!<br>\r\nThen again, you can see a big fire coming from the direction of the port. Guess the Captain got too stubborn and Hera made good on her word. There could still be survivors in dire need of your help too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was of the essence for our Hero! Where should he turn heroic heroicness towards?</span></div></div>",

Some of it seemed to be almost glued on and it took repeated licks and suction from your lips to get it off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bunny Girls continued taunting you and you started to grow somewhat dizzy from the noxious fumes coming from the Bunny Girl feet.

We all know he's in there, so shut it!\" Another batgirl, and the echidna becomes active, groggily uncurling from her sleeping position. Your breath catches in your throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I's just...!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT IT, BETH!\" The mother of all monsters' eyes open, thankfully missing you completely, and dart to her lair's entrance. She slithers towards the noisy bats, stretching and cracking her remaining stiff body parts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'S JUST-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you, girls?\" The echidna's voice is beautiful, but her tone towards the batgirls feels sharp enough to cut steel. The squabbling two fall silent immediately at her appearance, and they try their damn hardest to shrink to escape her attention.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you can.\" Another voice joins the conversation, and you recognise it as the batgirl you met before. \"We have been tracking down a human boy for sometime now, and it seems he is now hiding in your cave. If you'd let us-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my cave?\" The she-viper cuts the her off \"Then he is mine now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" The batgirl shrieks in pure displeasure. Seems she had her heart quite set on you. \"Please, just let us catch him! We-we'll let you have a turn with him after-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what...\" The echidna cuts her off again \"I'll catch him. He is in <i> my </i> home, after all. And if I don't find him... desirable, he is yours for the taking.\" She turns away from swarm and towards the cave \"But... if I <i> do </i> find him desirable, then...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes scan the darkness of her home, and you cling to wall, wishing you were a part of it right now. Then, those yellow orbs come to a stop: right on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> 'She can see me.' </i> Your brain cries. <br>\r\n\"She can see you!\" The angel adds. <br>\r\n<i> I can see you! </i> The flare in the beautiful viper's eyes confirms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spring from your position and make a mad dash to back of the cave, hoping against all hope there's another exit there. You give a fleeting glance behind you as you run, and catch the echidna's smiling face in the moonlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>... he is all mine! </i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mother of All Monsters quickly gives chase.                                               </span></div></div>",

A confrontation is inevitable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Think fast!\"</i> Your companion shrieks in your head. You whip around, sword drawn in one hand and the angel stone in the other, to see the Echidna standing here, watching you with hands on her hips. Her lips form an amused smile and her eyes assess you thoroughly, taking in every inch of you. Soon those yellow eyes met your's, and an incredibly uncomfortable staring contest between you and her seems to last forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt shatters like glass when she lunges forward in attack, releasing a barrage of strikes that you're barely able to block or dodge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething feels off. From all accounts you've heard and read, with snake girls it's all about their tails. A long, powerful and unpredictable muscle definitely gives an edge when used, and wrapping it around any human pretty much guarantees victory. Yet, the Echidna makes no attempt to use hers, instead only assaulting you with her fists. What is she up to? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's testing you.\" The angel answers. \"There would not have even <i>been</i> a fight if she was being serious.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the she-viper deals a powerful blow you're barely able to block that sends you skidding backwards, you're feet screeching on the stone floor.

Before you can react, the Echidna's green tail slams into your back and coils around your chest. The smooth, cool scales wind their way down your body, forcing the sword and angel stone from your grip. Panic sets in and you violently struggle against the heavy weight of Cybele's coils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your efforts are in vain. The coils press in against you, pudgy, heavy muscle squeezing into a perfect, possessive, and unbelievably tight form-fitting grip. You grimace as you are rendered immobile, though you find the pressure to be oddly pleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you finally notice that Cybele has closed the distance between the two of you. She leans forward and cups your face with her hands. Her face is almost touching yours, and you can feel her breath on your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I win,</i>\" she says with a smile. Her hands move to the back of your head and pull you in for a kiss. You squirm and try to resist, but there is nowhere for you to go. Her lips seize yours, and her tongue slides into your mouth. Her plump breasts press against your chest, and you feel your penis start to involuntarily harden. At the same time, the coils squeeze you, gentler this time, almost lovingly. It feels quite wonderful, for some reason. You feel the tail shift and slide around you, and suddenly the tip sneaks into your pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCool, soft scales form a cocoon around your penis, and you moan into Cybele's mouth when the cocoon constricts around it, strokes it. More of her tail slides into your pants, until eventually they rip and burst apart. You feel a coil slip down your shirt until it, too, rips apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tail winds around your ankles and suddenly constricts, rapidly pulling your legs together. You fall backward from this, and coils slide off of you for a moment. The ground is oddly soft and moving for a cave, and then you realize that the Echidna is using her tail as a bed for the both of you. You think about running in this brief moment of freedom, but before you can do anything Cybele is on top of you. Her coils shift under you, until you feel them wrapping around both you and Cybele. Soon you are trapped inside a cool, scaly coil cocoon with the Echidna on top of you. The coils force you to be close to her, pressing the two of you together better than any normal embrace could. She holds you in her fur-covered arms, and pushes your head into her breasts. You try to call out to your angel guardian, to anyone, for help, but your cries are muffled by the warm flesh of the Echidna's bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cock is fully erect now, thanks to the Echidna's ministrations. Her tail slides off of it slowly, and you stop crying for help in order to moan in pleasure. You can hear Cybele's voice, and it's clear that she's enjoying this immensely as she talks. \"Nobody can help you, little Erik,\" she says mockingly in her beautiful voice, pulling you out of her cleavage to stare into your eyes. \"You are <i>mine</i>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCybele shifts, and you feel her pussy rest on the tip of your cock. \"Do you know what happens to men who become an Echidna's lover, little Erik?\" Cybele asks you. You shake your head. \"The pleasure of being with one is so great that their mind blanks. They become good little mindless slaves. And that's exactly what's going to happen to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimper and plead, beg to be released and struggle against her grip in one last desperate effort. The she-viper smiles sweetly at you when you finish, and says one word: \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings your mouth to her own, and then uses her coils to push you inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTight, wet walls grip your cock, and the pleasure is unlike anything you've ever experienced before. Her pussy constricts around your shaft, snug as a glove, squeezing your dick as possessively as her coils squeeze your body. You gasp, then moan as the Cybele slowly moves her hips up and down. She moves in ways only a serpent can, undulating and rocking her hips against you. The coils around you pulse in a rhythmical massage, further enhancing both your pleasure and hers. You give in to the sensations and thrust into the viper as best as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy...\" Cybele moans. You can't take much more, and she seems to know it. Her pace is increasing, her pussy squeezing your throbbing cock as her coils push the two of your together faster and faster. Finally, she slams down onto you, her coils pushing you into her as deep as you can possibly go. You explode, shooting load after load into her pussy as it milks you, the Echidna loudly moaning as she also climaxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying in the afterglow, you're out of breath and find it hard to think. You try to remember what you were doing before you were in this cave, but your thoughts are interrupted by a deep, passionate kiss from Cybele. As the walls of her pussy stroke your cock into being erect again, whatever you were thinking about vanishes under a wave of pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour quest has failed. You remained Cybele the Echidna's sex slave for the rest of your life, fathering countless monsters in a hazy, blissful existence.</span></div></div>",

Her black hair was wild and matted, yellow eyes and tusks jutting up from her jaw, though you almost reluctantly admit to yourself you might not find her entirely unattractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping that opinion along is her attire, or lack thereof.

A tarp of hide and leather, crudely stitched together and tied at the side, hangs low on her hips. And what hips they are!

[Description copied from earlier in the interactive]  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a massive woman, much bigger then your average sized human with brown skin and long green hair. She has a basked beside her as she harvests fruit from the nearby trees. She has a shapely figure, like all monster girls, although you noticed that her butt is much larger then most!  You thought back at what you knew of this variety of Monster Girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarth Elementals are almost compared to slimes, being made out of soft dirt, mud or clay with grasslike hair. Earth Elementals have the ability to absorb people into their body just as slimes do, and can use this to absorb bodily fluids from anywhere on their bodies. Earth Elementals are also known for being perverted, their favorite form of sex is forcing the man to give her anal, usually trapping him between her abnormally large buttcheeks. Because of the Earth Elementals ability to bind people like slimes, men captured by them are usually carried around between their buttcheeks, as Earth Elementals are very protective of their catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering how large she was and how they had almost no weak points you bit your lip and wondered how you should handle this... you speak to the Angel Girl stone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any advice?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes a humming sound and replies, \"You need to fight her away from the Earth or it is almost impossible for you to win.  If you can trick her into a pond or lake she'll lose her ability to mold her shape and she won't be that much more dangerous than a Giant Girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy.  Not any more dangerous than a GIANT GIRL.  Those Monster Girls were even bigger and tougher than the Ogress you fought!  And that's if you could get her into the water.  But your course was set... how do you go about luring the Monster Girl to a pond?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was time you had a bit of a rest and maybe learn a thing or two from the Angel Stone.  You found yourself at an inn and had gold for several nights that included food and wine.  Life was relatively good at the moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter supper you communed with the Angel Stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any other abilities I can learn?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Currently you have access to two abilities and you can use each once a day before the holy magic is spent for the day.  In time you will be able to use them more frequently but it won't be immediate, you will need more familiarity with it and more experiences using them in combat. I can teach you another holy spell but you will still be limited to two uses of holy magic a day.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm so this would allow you some more versatility, which was always nice, but not anymore longevity in battle or if you fought more than a couple of times a day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not doing anything currently so I might as well... unless there was something else you could do?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou 'felt' her nod in your head, even though she had no corporeal body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, alternatively to learning a new form of holy magic I can help you become resistant to certain Monster Girl tricks and ploys.  Instead of teaching you a new magic I can train your mind so resist all types of ocular and acoustic hypnosis.  A powerful spell can still hypnotize you, as can scents but your eyes and ears will no longer be weak points.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell damn, that might be useful.  Now that you think of it a few of the snake girl type monster girls had the ability to hypnotize with their eyes and Sirens had their songs... scary stuff.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And finally the last alternative is that I can train you to fight better with your blade.  I have centuries of combat experience before I lost my body and while I cannot turn you into a blade-master in a few days it will improve your swordsmanship remarkably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tempting choice, you really wanted to take all of them!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However after I do one of these three things I'll need to rest some and you'll be without my guidance for some time.  You will still need to slay Monster Girls to improve yourself and improve your access to Holy Magics.  You are far from ready to face even moderately powerful Monster Girls.  Slimes, Harpies, Bunny Girls and Goblin Girls are all some of the lowest tier Monster Girls that exist and you could barely survive them.  If you want to one day free this land you must grow stronger.  Now make your choice hero!\"  </span></div></div>",

Her wings flap about excitedly as she does so, and you can see her breasts jiggling energetically.  Staring at them gives you a rush of pleasure, and makes the sensation of agony in your body numb to almost nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Harpy begins happily pleasuring herself with your cock while you slowly bleed out, your will to resist along with your pain sapped to almost nothing by the beautiful sight of bouncing breasts.

Her body was a shining silver. So was her hair which was splayed out in two sets of twintails. From her knees down, instead of legs, was some sort puddle of liquid metal.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Never seen a Metal Slime?\" She asked with a teasing smile as she noticed you confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo you have not. In fact, you've never even heard of a Metal Slime before. But as soon as your mind processed \"Slime\" you tried to bolt. You wouldn't give yourself good odds against a normal slime. Who knew what a metallic version was capable of?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoot up to your feet and tried to flee. Tried being the key word there. In the time it took you to turn around, she had already melted into a puddle, slipped between your legs, and reformed so she was eye-level with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter which way you tried to go, she was in front of you before you could take a single step. You finally gave up after your sixth try when she had burst into a fit of giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, hon. But I'm nicknamed Quicksilver for a reason.\" She explained once her giggle fit died out. \"You'd be really hard pressed to find a Monster Girl faster than me!\" She pounded her chest in pride, sending a ripple across her whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her \"hair\" reached out and began to caress your cheek. It was smooth and cool to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you want to do this?\" She asked as she folded her arms and gave you a cocky grin. </span></div></div>",

Depending on the size of the core, it will determine a slime's strength and intelligence. I was born inside a recently dead body of a human that was near water, so I can be classified as a human slime since I was born from a human body.\" she explained this to you to clear up your confusion. <br>\r\n\"I never knew a slime was born like that.\" you said to her and gestured for her to give you her hand. You grabbed her arm and give it a gentle poke. Her skin rippled like a wave and you watched it travel up her body.<br>\r\n\"So since you were born by inside a body and by water, you were able to have a human-like body and be able to shift your body like a normal slime.\" told her your theory. <br>\r\n\"You're very smart for a human.\" she said happily. <br>\r\n\"But you said that all slimes have a core, but I have seen some and never seen a core.\" you said. <br>\r\n\"Well slimes learn how to hide their core, so humans won't see them.\" she explained again. <br>\r\n\"Okay, but why are you telling me all of this? I thought that slimes hunted humans.\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"I was born a couple of weeks again and I haven't met any other slime. So I don't know what other slimes do, but some human boys came chasing after me. They had this repulsive look in their eyes, so I ran away and hid. I saw you on the ground and if you had that same look, I would have run away again.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, thank you for not attacking me. So would you mind if I give you a name.\" you asked sincerely. <br>\r\n\"Really! I would love it if you would.\" she answered excitedly and was jumping for joy. Her breast were mesmerizing as she jumped and you looked away to think of a name. <br>\r\n\"Can my name be Erik?\" she asked innocently <br>\r\n\"Sorry, but that's my name. How about Erika?\" you asked, thinking of no better name.<br>\r\n\"YES, I finally have a name.\" Erika was so excited that you had to wait a few minutes before she calmed down. <br>\r\n\"Erika, would you mind us going somewhere else to talk, because I don't want to be seen by soldiers right now.\" you asked her.<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Erika found a empty cave nearby and you both sat down to talk. You explained why you left your home and how you had to sneak out of the port town. Erika listened with rapt attention and asked questions every now and again, but mostly listened to your story. You had to stop yourself from staring at her nude body, which looked exactly like a normal human girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you going to do now Erik?\" she asked after your story.<br>\r\n\"Well I plan on heading to another town for supplies and information.\" You told her and looked down at the ill-fitting adventurers armor you got from the dead adventurers. <br>\r\n\"Erik\" you heard her say your name quietly. You saw that her face was slightly red, but she looked you in the eye and \"Can I come with you?\"<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you wonder. <br>\r\n\"Well, there's nothing here holding me and I want to experience the things you told me.\" she said seriously. <br>\r\n\"I don't see why not. Welcome to the team, Erika.\" you said. <br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" She cried and jumped to give you a hug. Your head got stuck between her massive breast and the sensation was heavenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika let go of your head and you snapped back to reality. You told her that she'll need to put on some of the extra adventurer clothes you had because she can't go around town naked (not that it wouldn't be enjoyable to you) and you gave her the clothes. She needed some help getting them on since she has never wore clothes before and after a couple of minutes she wearing decent fitting clothes. She was wearing basic leather armor with greaves and shin guards. You asked if she needed a weapon, but she declined and said she had her own way of fighting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich way do you go?</span></div></div>",

The scales decorating her hands and tail were a mixture of the darkest black and an extremely dull yellow, quite the contrast to both the other's shining silver. Her hair was a pure red and her blank, slanted pupils were incased within bloody crimson irises. She wore armour a combination of painted red and metallic grey, and a shield, proudly displaying the emblem of the Witch Queen for all her enemies to see, was tightly strapped to her right arm. A very simplistic short sword was sheathed on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEscaping this time, while holding a knight of the Witch Queen's undivided attention, was a snowball's chance in hell.

The drag - wyvern girl shut her eyes and took a deep breath for second, before they snapped open and she glared at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? It doesn't matter right know. Draw your weapon and face me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely had time to pull out your wooden sword as the wyvern knight charged.       <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Bah...\" The knight grunts with disappointment as she sheathes her sword.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wooden imitation of a sword snapped the second it came into contact with real thing, and every attempt to get some breathing room was thwarted by your opponent's insane speed and unrelenting attacks. Your few seconds of unarmed resistance were brought to a sudden - and painful - halt as she slammed her shield into your face, the force of metal slap flinging you into the dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, there you lay: clothes shredded, most revealing little red cuts to the world, nose bleeding and bruised, desperately trying to push yourself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour best attempt is thwarted by the wyvern girl bringing a foot down upon your back with a stomp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wooden sword, <i> really? </i> You thought you could survive this world with a <i> wooden sword? </i>\" She grips the bridge of her nose with two of her scaly fingers. You remain silent, doing your best to glare up at her with half your face pressed into the soil. \"Humans always do the stupidest things, I swear...\" She pulls her hand away and meets your half-glare, totally unfazed by it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though, guess I should give you some credit. You're not mincemeat after my barrage, so maybe you have <i> some </i><br>\r\npotential.\" She presses her foot down harder, causing some pain and forcing the air out of you \"Just not enough to have me interested.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But...\" She leans forward, studying your face \"You are kind of cute... when you remove the battle damage, of course.\" She kneels down, one foot still firm upon your back, and wipes away some of the nose-blood from your face \"That, plus your decent potential, means I could probably get a good trade out of you back at her majesty's palace.\" She gives a cruel smile \"Who knows! Maybe her majesty herself will want you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mixture of anger and horror fills you at the idea of being sold like a toy. You grit your teeth and increase the intensity of your useless glare in an empty hope it helps you in anyway possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour captor opens her mouth, probably to taunt you more, but something you can't see from your position grabs her attention, and she stands again, foot unfortunately still solid upon your back. Movement before you catches your own eye: an elf girl springs out from the forest and comes to a quiet stop just ahead. Her gaze falls on you, as if she is calculating your worth, but one glance at your captor destroys that idea, and she barrels onwards towards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowards the port. Your heart drops deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scavengers already?! Damn, news must have spread faster than anticipated...\" The wyvern bites her finger, obviously unpleased \"Hera must have been louder than she was supposed to be, that stupid dragon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith various monster girls passing her by, a crossroad forms in her thoughts: does she spend time restraining and transporting you in the hopes of a good trade later, or does she leave you and reach the port quickly in the hopes the pickings at the port are better?                          </span></div></div>",

She gives them a sharp tug to check they are secure, giving a relieved sigh when it turns out they are, and then drags you to your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here! Was that so bad?\" She's teasing you, knowing you can't respond properly while gagged. You silently glare at her in return. She simply smiles a mocking smile at you. \"Well... can't make everyone happy...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she socks you in the gut, knocking what strength you had clean out of you, lifts you over her shoulders in a fireman's carry and begins walking to the port.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*TINK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot grazes against something metallic.

The one you just dropped when the wyvern came charging in favour of your wooden one. You squeezed your eyes shut and tightened your hands into fists at how stupid you'd been.

The horrible smell of death and smoke, coupled with the nightmare-inducing images of blood and corpses decorating the docks, make you wish your weren't gagged so you could throw up. The knight seemed unaware or (most likely) uncaring to your little shimmers of discomfort and marched towards the end of the massacre-covered pier. She stops and looks around, clearly annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are they? No way they just left without me. No way they forgot me!\" You both hear and feel her blood start to boil \"If they left without me I SWEAR I'M GONNA -\"     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lin, you know it's very rude to shout ~ \" A playful voice causes the wyvern to turn rather violently in surprise, swinging you around around without the least bit of care. Once your brain clears from the sharp movement, you take in the new voice's owner now in your sights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin is a pale white, her hair is long enough to reach her waist and dull pink, and her exposed eye, as well as presumably the other one hidden behind the bang of hair, is a much brighter pink. A black cloak with it's hood down, somewhat similar to that of the dragon girl's from earlier, gives a teasing shot of her ample cleavage and the black tattoo decorating her collarbone. A number (you guess about ten) of large, squid-like tentacles, each hundreds of suckers, prod out from beneath her cloak, hovering around her body at various levels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who, might I ask, is this lovely boy?\" Her eye (well, eyes) locks onto you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wyvern girl, name now revealed, finally lifts you off her shoulders and stands you up, but keeps a hand tightly wrapped your arm. \"A runaway from Hera's attack. Planning on trading him away back at her majesty's palace.\" Lin's grip loosen's slightly, and a scary grin dawns on her face \"Speaking of that blasted dragon, is she on the ship already? I'd like to have some... <i> words </i> with her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she's on board, but if you two want to fight you can do it at the palace. I'm not letting either of you wreck my ship again.\" While answering Lin, the tentacle woman draws closer to you and stops just before you. The top of your head reaches her chin. Her hand, wrapped in a black leather glove, strokes your cheek before pulling down your gag. \"What's your name, dear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause. Lin squeezes your arm in a silent threat, so you squeak out \"E-Erik.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's smile grows happily at your response. \"Well Erik, I'm Calypso: kraken girl and mage of her majesty.\" She looks to Lin \"A hundred bottles of my wine for Erik here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin is taken aback, and you are as well, though more out of fear than Lin's surprise. The wyvern recovers faster than you do. \"Cal, I want to see all the offers fir-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two hundred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cal -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two hundred and fifty bottles of my wine and an enchanted weapon of your choosing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin pauses, considering for a moment, then sighs. \"If no good trades come within a month -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin sighs again. \"If no good trades come within a week -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't push it!\" Lin snaps \"If no good trades come <i> within a week, </i> I'll accept your trade, deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCal looks to you, and it's her turn to sigh, before she snaps back to Lin \"And you can only accept offers from those of her majesty's court. Not from guards or merchants or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cal! -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or I can challenge you for him.\" Lin pauses, and, you can't believe your eyes, shakes in fear at Cal's words \"You and I both know that in her majesty's court challenges overrule trades. ~ \" Cal shakes a finger at Lin teasingly, before the kraken's aura grows dark <i> \"So, think you can beat me Lin?\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY! Okay, okay, fine, deal, d-deal!\" Lin, the mighty wyvern girl, who kicked your derriere with relative ease, was close to a breakdown at Cal's question. \"N-now please, just sedate him so we can go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage's aura sprung from abysmally dark to sun bright at the knight's answer, and she turned, smile beaming, towards you. \"Ah, yes, of course.\" She reached her right hand into her left hand's sleeve, and withdrew a small bottle of black liquid. \"Sorry, Erik, but we need you to sleep for a little while, okay sweetie? ~\" You, in fear, tried to pull away and run, but Lin still kept you firmly in place. \"Transporting prisoners is just so much easier this way, you know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCal uncorks the bottle, and slips the wooden cork back into her sleeve. Seeing the black liquid, you guess it's some kind of ink, and you clamp your mouth shut as tightly as possible. Cal cups your chin with her free hand and presses the top of the glass bottle to your lips. She shows some disappointment when you don't open them for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Erik?\" She looks you in the eyes, her pink irises begging you as well \"Open up for me, sweetie.\" You feel Lin's grip tighten on your arm again. \"Erik, open up or I'll have to hurt you. And I don't want to hurt you...\" Cal voices gains a trace of sternness, and she quietly sighs when you silently refuse again. \"Okay, dear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her larger tentacles whips you in the gut with incredible speed. You can't help but gasp in pain, and she takes the chance to shove the ink into your mouth, before she tilts your head back and forces you to swallow. The substance within your belly, Cal and Lin both release you, and you collapse slowly on the cold stones of the pier spluttering, the sedative taking effect quickly. You look up at your captors, and weakly protest. \"N-no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCal leans down to you. \"Shush, shush... It's okay now, dear Erik...\" She smiles at you lovingly, and strokes a hand gently through your hair. \"Just go to sleep. Nothing bad will happen to you, we promise...\" She continues to whisper to you as you grow weaker and sleep draws closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to be somewhere else: helping people, battling monster girls and training to defeat the Witch Queen. You don't want to be here: about to be put on display like a toy and sold to the highest bidder. You wanted the strength to get away, to run away, but all that you would get was a rest assaulted by nightmares of your slave future. Slowly, darkness came, and you were pushed into sleep with tears in your eyes, Cal's voice dancing on your ears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep... That's it, Erik... Sleep... Good boy...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake, it's on the small bed of a cell. You push yourself up, and realise you're wearing a new piece of clothing: a small, brown robe now covers your once unguarded chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awake now?\" You hear a voice call to you from the cell bars, and turn away from examining your new robe to see Lin staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where...?\" You try to ask her, but you don't seem to have enough strength back yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Palace of the Witch Queen.\" Lin takes a bite of a small bread roll \"Capital city the Kingdom of Asun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eyes widen in surprise and horror. This was it: the capital city, the home of the Witch Queen. Most definitely guarded heavily, so there was no chance of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how long...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you out? About a day.\" Lin doesn't talk with her mouth full, it seems \"Cal's sedative kept you sustained, and all anyone did was move you and put the prisoner robes on you, so don't worry.\" She crammed the remainder of her food into her gob quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to ask another question, but Lin, swallowing her food down, cuts you off. \"Here's the rules, runt. Throughout the week, I'm gonna see what kind of offers I get for you. Cal's already got her's down, and it's an incredible one to be sure. I'm not gonna accept trades from anyone not in her majesty's court, so the guards won't try anything funny with you unless they want their heads caved in. I'm also not gonna accept from anyone I don't think can take Cal in a fight, else she'll just challenge them and win you from them anyway. So, honestly, Cal's probably who you're gonna end up with, 'less someone bigger in power gives a better deal for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's bigger in power than Cal?\" You find your strength, of voice at least, has returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her majesty or someone close to her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. Your stomach growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your lunch'll be coming soon. It's decent grub for a prisoner.\" Lin stretches \"Anyway, I'm off. Gotta crush a small rebellion before it goes out of control. I'll see you in a couple days.\" She waves before disappearing down the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still feel quite tired, and there isn't anything to do in there, so you close your eyes and go to sleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week passes quickly, and Lin appears before your cell again, arms crossed. She opens her mouth to tell you your fate.                                                                           </span></div></div>",

A monster girl stalks through the forest, intent on raiding the port like the others, before her advancing eyes lock onto you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the rumours she heard floating around the forest were true, then the port would have an armoury and a large number of 'wanna be heroes'.

Two small swords, barely larger than daggers, are sheathed at both sides of her hips. Looking at her face, you find pale skin, platinum blonde hair and yellow eyes staring back at you. She's certainly beautiful physically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer golden orbs take in all of you, before they move up and she meets your gaze.

Your wooden sword snapped the instant her first blow made contact with it, and it was undoubtably through luck that you remember your other, <i>better</i> sword in time to block her second. After that, the fight is just a blur in your memory: everything went so fast your brain barely had time to even register it, let alone record it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodging another blow, you quickly jab your sword at the wyvern girl, who throws it's course off with her shield and strikes at you again.

She tosses the metal protector to the side once it's free, and picks her sword back up by the blade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Names Lin!\" She throws her sword, and it thuds into the dirt harmlessly a foot away from you \"Use that to keep things fair, won't you Erik!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to the sword, and move to quickly snatch it up as Lin removes her gauntlets. The moment you grasp it, you pull back into your defensive stance with a sword in each hand, just as the unwanted pieces of Lin's armour hit the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sickening snap rings as scaly wings burst outwards from her scaly arms, and again when they sink back in. With a little flexing of her wrists, Lin is finished stretching, and her grin grows full again with anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready yourself, Erik!\" Her feet dig deep into the earth and her claws prepare themselves \"<b>BECAUSE HERE I COME!!!</b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wyvern rushes forward, reborn once again as a storm. </span></div></div>",

You could hear the whispers of other knights as you passed them, their comments varying from \u201cHe\u2019s cute\u201d to the likes of \u201cI hope Lin lets me help break him\u201d. You suppressed your fear and tried to appear calm, but the fact your hands were bound coupled with all hungry looks you spotted out the corners of your eyes wasn\u2019t making that easy. Relief washed over you when you were guided into what you assumed was Lin\u2019s tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit.\u201d She said, pointing to a simple wooden bed. You did as you were told, surveying the interior as you shuffle across the dirt floor. There wasn\u2019t much to survey; besides the bed, there was only a wooden table in the center of the room, and a metal chest at the opposite end that Lin was tucking her weapons and armor into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a click of the lock, the wyvern finishes sealing her equipment safely away, and turns to you. Now down to lighter, more form-hugging clothes, she advances towards you. \u201cThat was quite the fight, boy.\u201d Lin smiles sharply, lightly stretching in a way that helps show off her hourglass figure. She drops her rear on the unoccupied half of the bed to your left, then starts gently poking your bicep. \u201cWho taught you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI taught myself.\u201d That wasn\u2019t completely true, as you did learn a lot from a few Monster Girl-fighting books, but no physical person has taught you. You suppress a scowl as you remember every hero who passed through the village dismissing you as a lost cause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSelf taught, huh?\u201d The knight mulls over your answer. \u201cThat explains the rookie mistakes, but\u2026\u201d She trails her claw along your chest and leans her chin on your shoulder. You can\u2019t help but shiver slightly as her hot breath washes over your neck. \u201cYou\u2019ve got potential. Too much potential to just let go, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Her other hand slips around your back and plants itself on your right hip. The uncomfortable situation makes you want to shove her and run, but you have no doubt that would end horribly for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally, we\u2019d either kill you or let everyone rape you till you\u2019re an irreparable fuck-toy.\u201d How casually she says it makes your skin crawl. How many people had these monsters inflicted such a fate upon? \u201cBut I like you, Erik. You gave me the best fight if had in Queen-knows how long.\u201d Her smile widens as she recalls your battle. In your head, it\u2019s all a blur except for a few moments. Like how she won by kicking you so hard you threw up both vomit and blood. Your gut remembers that quite well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, here\u2019s my deal: become my apprentice. I could help you realize that budding skill of yours, in exchange for serving under me.\u201d Swiftly, the claw feeling up your chest cuts through the ropes binding your hands like they were butter. Checking your hands, you thankfully find them to be unharmed by the action. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecome Lin\u2019s apprentice? Serve a knight of the Witch Queen? Under normal circumstances, you would  refuse outright. But right here and now, what other choice was there? You didn\u2019t want to die, and you definitely didn\u2019t want to be broken down into a sex-slave for Monster Girls. So, as much as it pains you, you decide you\u2019ll play along for now, learning what you can until you get the chance to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing down the bile in your throat, you look the wyvern dead in her searing eyes and utter those accursed words. \u201cI accept.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin\u2019s smile grows sinister at your agreement. \u201cVery well. Though I\u2019ll need some...\u201d Warm and wet flesh, accompanied by hot air, touches your neck as your \u2018master\u2019 gives your skin a teasing lick. \u201c\u2026 <i>payment</i> up front.

Building intense rage from having to do <i>this-!?</i> You charge yelling! <br>\r\nComing right back at you- the clash is like lightning, unreal strength rushing forth as you sliced up to stop her jumping-up-then-down-swing- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThick red blood is drawn as the blade held back her clawed hand, Lin grunting in some messed-up way. She puts all her strength in her one claw, letting the blade dig deeper. A crooked smile comes forth with some smoke bellowing out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I've never seen a wel-\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"NO!\"</b> Screaming &amp; slicing down her hand, then circling to the side, Lin trips forward some! - ! - The time she recovers in is enough to let you slice at her leg armor- with a sickening clang &amp; force one sword slid through flexible platemail &amp; through her scales, the Wyvern screaming &amp; kneeling down from it- not before <i>hitting you!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer claw hit your upper-chest bone mostly but still drew blood, the stamina &amp; adrenaline use taking its toll on you as getting up after being hit is fatiguing, some blood loss not helping..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... <b>\"Good! GOOD!\"</b> Heras voice.. it comes from the woods, the black cloak concealing her until now. Lin yanks the sword out from her leg, letting a deep huff out, two more Dragons &amp; a Wyvern- armored &amp; brutish- landing near you, another Wyvern near Lin. Shit. Their tall &amp; intimidating &amp; your out of roid rage energy. The closest crimson-haired Wyvern gives you a creepy, sharp-tooth smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMera reached under her cloak, pulling out one of her blades, her expression one that gives you dread- <b>\"Warmblood, you fought well..\"</b> --the blade is brought down near your neck, one of the other dragons spoke, <i>\"Hera don't you thi-\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I'm in charge! Don't speak!\"</b> She snaps at her, looking back down at you, <b>\"Erik was itt-? ...\"</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops.. surprised that you reach for the little potion you found on one dead adventurer. <b>\"Your not serious? Are you?\"</b> <br>\r\nThere's some awe in her tone as she thinks your stupid. Hera moved the sword away, you- in <i>great</i> pain - popping the cork off of the bottle &amp; pouring it down your shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<i>Relief!</i> Wounds closing enough to stop bleeding mostly, with the pain numbing well, you struggle to stand. By Hera's motion they step back.. you.. swing your fist at her weakly, she just backs away with a smile, \"You.. you.. won't get away with killing those people..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks slightly more serious, Lin being helped over by a Wyvern, Mera replying with some challenged annoyance, <b>\"And you- a small Warmblood, will stop me?\"</b><br>\r\n\"Count on it.. Lizard, for Nathaniel.. if not.. my people.\" Your talking crap &amp; know it, going out with resistance is the best you can do. <br>\r\n<b>\"Lin-\"</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...  ...  ...<br>\r\n     ...   ...   ... Mera slit Lin's throat by the blade in one swoop, the Wyvern helping her sighing &amp; throwing the Wyvern down near you.. god.. she flips over, gagging, trying to yell.. <i>gods &amp; goddesses no..</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Either you or her.. had to be.\"</b> Mera bent down to you some, freakishly long tongue licking the blades fresh blood, <b>\"Get strong Warmblood. I'll get away with what I do as long as my Queen breathes..\"</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin didn't deserve that. As threatening as she was- she didn't deserve that. You just glare at Mera.<br>\r\n<b>\"Let's go! Fly!\"</b> All of them would jump &amp; ascend, their way of flying scary enough, Mera staying behind- <b>\"We'll see if your as big of a threat as you want to be, Erik. Davausta.\"</b> so she leaves to, massive wings unfurling out from under her cloak, her heavy jump pushing you back some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... ... \"Lin-\" she's almost gone. She has one of her hands on her chest, staring right up in the sky. <u>\"Er-ik.. t..ha..n..k..\"</u> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's gone- it's- emotional- even if your in pain. There's no honor in what Mera did. But, as much as you want to sit &amp; wonder about what will happen in the future- about Lin's dishonorable end- you got to get better. You have to continue to message Molly. Get better. Get to the fallen Kingdom of Asun! <u>Stop</u> this brutality between the humanoid races! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust having the glowy stone left.. you go off.. you'll need to try &amp; give Lin a burial later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After this ordeal your worn out past carrying them- using the blades as a support. No monster girls appeared at all on the way there, probably scared off. Hopefully she didn't <i>burn down the town.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out from the woods with blood stains on your clothes some wary villagers- having just now been left alone by the Witch Queen's forces- saw you &amp; most were shocked. <br>\r\nThe pain is returning very slowly, luckily the potion <i>helped</i> but wasn't enough to heal it fully.

It's terrifying- maybe a death sentence- but what else do you have to lose? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point fighting for others feels right. Hopefully the wasps don't give you any trouble. Never seen one before anyhow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wound, having already healed &amp; scarred well enough to allow stretch painlessly, is a surprise.

Buying two, one for later, you'd eat the other as you went to find the tailor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately he is still closed. Sucks for you, so, slightly disappointed, you go back to the Inn to get your swords. As you walked back in it seemed the Innkeeper was just getting up, he looked at you as if feeling pity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say- never got your name.\" He leans on the counter sighing, \"Erik.\" You reply, \"Thanks for letting me stay here, sir.\" As you go to the stairs he stops you, \"Wait.

Hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n... ... The adventures sword is left outside the smithy, Lin's fine blade should be enough to ward off anything. Armed with it &amp; the weird unknown glowy stone you set off on the East path, just a guy in worn leather trousers with a bag. It's a nice day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way through the woods the path fades, overgrown after probably years of neglect. There is an eerie feeling in the woods that slowly began to fade to the tall grass fields, it is actually quite beautiful here.. .. <br>\r\n.. Then out of the sky, just out of your sight to the right comes a Wasp Woman- <i>terrifying.</i> There are no human eyes, just large black bug-eyes under two large, twitching antenna. Her mouth is just two sharp traps, likely able to bite into you with ease. The way her bodies hair flows down around her head &amp; back is unsettling- one set of humanlike clawed arms comes out from her humanlike head, but apart from that, they don't look humanoid at all. Her lower torso has a large set of spiked mandibles &amp; thick wings, her other half is just to disgusting to want to look at, the mandibles there larger than her midsections. Stinger is easily sharp &amp; long enough to go through you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering in fear you shake some as she lands in-front of you, feet away. Why.. is the yellow monster more <i>scary</i> than Hera? <br>\r\nTwitching her head, her stinger half is turnt to you slightly, her looking at you intensely. She gets closer slowly, obviously cautious, you wonder if she can see your fear. <i>\"H-hey- I- don't want any trouble-\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuttering some.. she backed away some as you spoke. May she be a younger one?.. than she began to make a cackling noise, a loud one, with her mouth. Backing away from you.. the sound of flapping wings approached from around you quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... ...An army, essentially, appears around you. Not knowing what to do you just dropped your sword &amp; put your hands behind your neck, facing &amp; crouching down to the ground, submitting. It's the only thing you think won't get you killed immediately. <br>\r\nCackling sounds come from all around- maybe just a few feet from you- like they speak their own language. They all stop at the sound of one louder cackle, almost like a hiss. Looking up- - - a larger wasp, maybe the largest, more humanlike in her upper body- uses her mandibles to walk on her bottom half. Seeing her just maybe a foot away staring down at you, you freeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Kkaann youu sayyy- whyy hh-eree?\"</i> The wasp woman backed up some, lowering her head down to you slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep voice that seems to slither is freaky. But- you understand it-- you have to speak up. \"U-uh- Erik- I'm Erik- I'm here- to- to go to the land. The grasses- there-\" cautious, you move your hand to point at the grassland, being watched intently. She looks back at it, antenna twitching rapidly, she began to cackle when she turned back to you, a few other larger wasps joining in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter maybe half a minute of cackling- she made then stop again. <i>\"Hhummanns.. knnoow landss nott sssaffee.. upp.. Eeriikk.. upp..\"</i><br>\r\nDamn this is a bizzare-scary. You stood up, the eyes of all of the wasps trained on you, seeing this one- definitely the largest- grab the sword as she rose to. <i>\"Wwhyy..?</i> In reference to the sword you can see they don't like it. At all. Body language tells alot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That- that- it is for threats. Bad people- humans-\" trying to explain things simply is hard, especially since you have no clue how they'll react. She looks at you, &amp; the sword, though not human, perhaps with an expression of deep thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she threw it to the ground, walking to you, bringing her humanlike arm to your chest. <i>You don't move.</i><br>\r\nHer carapace-like hand ran over your (mostly) scar, the wasp staring at you with something you just can't identify. After a few seconds she cackles though lightly, looking to nod to you before moving back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ppasss, Errikk.. Ggooodd..\"</i> Following this is her cackling loudly, many if not all others joining, before they take off. The sound of the horde flying is quite a spectacle, freaky as it is. <br>\r\nOff they go, most to the right of the path, their nest may be over there somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n... ... ... ... <u>whew.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAble to continue you grabbed the sword, shaking off that potentially deadly encounter the best you could. Through the grasslands.. it is beautiful, healthy trees are far in-between each other &amp; varieties of flowers in patches gives the place some individuality.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The winds blows a hard gust.</i> <br>\r\n        No monster causes it. Nobody is around here- not even the wasps. A large tree catches your eye. Much like the one in the dream- small hill &amp; all. <br>\r\n... Wait .. Why is .. the sky .. turning greenish? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The wind screams with high pitch literally almost human. But it is not. It is demonic.</i> \"I~ can't~ believe~ you came~\" <br>\r\nA high pitched, singsong voice rides the wind, you take a defensive stance, but thinking this is a wind elemental.. swords cant do anything to kill air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? Your not that lady in the dream.\" A demonic eemental is less intimidating than a horde of wasps. You feel ready. Silence with calming air, but then another gust came- bringing with it abnormal heat &amp; a light laugh- ! - ! - !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The Queen~ she loves~ you'll see~\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air?! yanks you back, ripping Lin's blade from your hand painfully. Something.. blurring the air in a humanlike shape wields it. It spins it around unnaturally, in twirls &amp; flips. How are you supposed to fight this? <i>Wind?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your morning is painfully basic while preparing, all except for being shirtless with Lin's scar in the open. It being early in the morning there aren't many shops open, but one stand you find sells good-looking bread. Buying two, one for later, you'd eat the other as you went to find the tailor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately he is still closed. Sucks for you, so, slightly disappointed, you go back to the Inn to get your swords. As you walked back in it seemed the Innkeeper was just getting up, he looked at you as if feeling pity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say- never got your name.\" He leans on the counter sighing, \"Erik.\" You reply, \"Thanks for letting me stay here, sir.\" As you go to the stairs he stops you, \"Wait. Where are you planning to go?\" He sounds very serious, the inquire helping you think-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the grassland, I have a hunch someone needs help.\" The Innkeepers expression is visibly one of slight surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Really?\"</i> He said with disbelief, \"Where those wasp abominations are-? Erik- don't you know what they can do to one person?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. You never have seen one but have hope that they'd not bother with one shirtless adventurer- perhaps that is a bad mentality.<br>\r\nInnkeeper sighing again, \"That scar. Your fight. Don't let it get to your ego, son. Go do what you have to.\" Before you go, you ask, \"Hey, can you spare a small bag?\" He smiles, chuckling some, \"Sure.\"<br>\r\nThinking as you continued in preparation- this may be a ticket to death, but the thought comes again- someone who really needs help may just be worth helping. Hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n... ... The adventures sword is left outside the smithy, Lin's fine blade should be enough to ward off anything. Armed with it &amp; the weird unknown glowy stone you set off on the East path, just a guy in worn leather trousers with a bag. It's a nice day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way through the woods the path fades, overgrown after probably years of neglect. There is an eerie feeling in the woods that slowly began to fade to the tall grass fields, it is actually quite beautiful here.. .. <br>\r\n.. Then out of the sky, just out of your sight to the right comes a Wasp Woman- <i>terrifying.</i> There are no human eyes, just large black bug-eyes under two large, twitching antenna. Her mouth is just two sharp traps, likely able to bite into you with ease. The way her bodies hair flows down around her head &amp; back is unsettling- one set of humanlike clawed arms comes out from her humanlike head, but apart from that, they don't look humanoid at all. Her lower torso has a large set of spiked mandibles &amp; thick wings, her other half is just to disgusting to want to look at, the mandibles there larger than her midsections. Stinger is easily sharp &amp; long enough to go through you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering in fear you shake some as she lands in-front of you, feet away. Why.. is the yellow monster more <i>scary</i> than Hera? <br>\r\nTwitching her head, her stinger half is turnt to you slightly, her looking at you intensely. She gets closer slowly, obviously cautious, you wonder if she can see your fear. <i>\"H-hey- I- don't want any trouble-\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuttering some.. she backed away some as you spoke. May she be a younger one?.. than she began to make a cackling noise, a loud one, with her mouth. Backing away from you.. the sound of flapping wings approached from around you quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n... ...An army, essentially, appears around you. Many wasps of different sizes- mercilessly- attack you. No roid rage, no amount of preparation could help you win against a horde of fearless drones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply put, in no time is your body filled with bloody holes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Bad End.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The maid begins talking about breakfast seemingly unfazed by your appearance, ignoring your protests and attempts to break free you find yourself now in a large dinning room. <br>\r\n\"What would you like for breakfast master?\" the maid asks with a smile<br>\r\n\"my clothes, I'd like to get dressed\" you reply. This entire process is distressing, you never should've agreed to help that mad woman. Annoyingly your erection has not subsided, if anything you feel yourself growing inexplicably aroused. Could this been anything like last nights dream? If so perhaps this dream is related to that one in some way.<br>\r\nThe Scenario playing out right now seems fairly innocuous compared to last nights dream, there you were assaulted right off the bat, this time it was more like being caught in a spider web, whilst the spider was busy with another fly. Another fly? A nasty thought began to occur, the boy was the other fly right now, but the spider was aware he was here, this bizarre sequence must be a stalling tactic, to go along with it would be to play right into the \"spiders\" hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst this has been going on in your head, the maid has just been waiting patiently, clearly no intent to rush you. But you need to break this dream up, force the one behind it out to face you, at least then you will know what you're up against. You need a weapon, if this is a dream you should be able to try and make something, your sword drifts into mind, you imagine it in your hands, and suddenly you feel its weight, a bit heavier than usual. You look down to see a silvered blade shinning in your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid slowly stirs, as though the \"spider\" has just noticed a change in you, but you can't let the opportunity pass. The blade sings and cuts through the image of the maid which fades into mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was she not your type? Or maybe maids don't do it for you?\" You turn to see the woman, the boys mother standing there. The room is distorted now, half there, half shimmering revealing a myriad of dreamscapes beneath. \"You have my congratulations hero, you seem far more competent than the others, mind you, I'm sure my little sister has told you enough about our kind. Its a shame she couldn't be here to see me break her little pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister? Who and what are you talking about?\" you ask puzzled, raising your sword a little higher. Its weight feels good in your hands, it gives you confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister, your companion, Ivana Petra Pavala. When she told me about you I couldn't resist taking you for myself, she is such a naive little thing after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Petra had sold you out to this bitch, you could not believe it, she had seemed so loving and caring earlier. The betrayal hung over you, weighed on your mind, numbing you to the danger of this situation. \"You sick bitch, you used your own son to get to me. And all just because you were jealous of your sister?\" you hiss, trembling with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My son? ... Oh ... ahahahahaha. Oh my dear boy, where are my manners allow me to introduce myself\" Her body shimmered and before you stood a tall beautiful woman, very similar in appearance to Petra, however significantly more generously endowed, her body exuding a raw, sexual energy, that attacked your senses and stirred lustful thoughts in your mind. \"My name is Karlia Voight, I am a succubus. The delightful woman you knew is The Lady Arrabele Lestacht, the recent widow of Lord Jonathan Lestacht. I have been borrowing the good Ladies body whilst her mind is ailing from the grief at the 'unexplained' death of her husband. I have been rather busy entertaining her delightful son. I must say when I started off killing that pompous fool I never imagined that I would allow me to feast on so many brave, foolish adventurers such as your good self, who are so eager to be of service. Indeed in just a few months I have transitioned from the wretched form of life of a common imp to that of a fully fledged succubus.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman continued her monologue, seemingly oblivious to whether you were actually there or not. This maybe an opportunity to take her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The succubus throws back its head and its voluptuous body is racked with a fit of laughter. <br>\r\nIn shock you wrench the blade back, only to see the blade is gone, only a handle remains, the silvered length of the sword appears to have melted away.

If only you hadn't doubted yourself I might have lost control of this dream then.\" She looks at you with an amused expression, it reminds you of Petra, although there is no warmth or kindness in her eyes. \"Perhaps I was boring you? I would offer you a bed time story but you're already asleep.\" She smiles, clearly reveling in her power over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a seething rage, bubbling up inside you. Anger at yourself for being led into such a stupid trap, anger at Petra for her treatment, abandonment and ultimate betrayal of you, anger at this Karlia who is toying with you, and has brought misery to so many people.

'I don't want to get hit with that' she muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric advanced, the sword a blur in his hands, the sword arcing left and right, in a wild uncontrolled hurricane of metal and boy. In many ways it was a daunting sight for the succubus, however the fact that the boy chasing her was barely tall enough to come up to her breasts and he was stark naked, still supporting a large throbbing erection that he was seemingly unaware of made this otherwise imposing image also somewhat comical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubus calmly retreated, allowing you to give chase, slowly gaining on her. As you pursued you found yourself charging through several increasingly strange dreamscapes. The sword in your hand pulsed with a silver radiance as it sang through the air.

The crashing of undergrowth continues and man on horseback, clad in noble finery also enters the clearing. Neither of them pay any heed to you, watching the scene unfold.<br>\r\n\"Please\" the imp begs \"please don't hurt me\" she looks tired from a long arduous chase, and is plainly in no condition to fight the man.<br>\r\n\"Silence beast!\" his voice commands as he lashes out with a ridding crop, striking the poor imp across the face.<br>\r\nYou feel anger start to rise in you at the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a monster hunt\" you hear Karlia's voice behind you, none of the mischief she had earlier in her tone. <br>\r\nYou realize that this must have been her being abused by the Lord.<br>\r\n\"Rich men, often bored of the pleasures that their wives can provide will go in search of new more exotic experiences. Some lords will go after the peasants on their estate, who have little power to resist a nobles bidding, however this practice is frowned upon and can cause rebellion, so the more daring lord will go for something more risky\" she explains, a genuine anger cracking her seemingly unflappable composure<br>\r\n\"Monsters\" you say, mortified at the idea<br>\r\n\"Who would complain? Provided you survive there are no repercussions, you might even be hailed as a 'Hero'. However, a monster can be dangerous prey. Most Nobles will join together to hunt even a single weak monster, that way there is no danger of the tables getting turned on them. But that would mean sharing the prize, so sometimes, a particularly; brave, foolish or horny man will go on their own, hoping to catch something the can subdue and force to do their bidding. But enough of that, you will see all of that I'm sure.\" and with that she leaves you alone again to watch the rest of the memory play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The man dismounts and begins beating the terrified form of Karlia, the brutality of it, and her words makes you almost forget the fact you are currently trapped in her dream.

On the other hand, it is important that you understand what motivated Karlia and how she managed to achieve this power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurry after Karlia, the sound of the argument fading as you journey deep into the heart of the mansion, following the sound of her footsteps. You look at the hall and see proud paintings of past generations of the Lestacht family, silently watching over their successors. You weave past several servants and notice they all look to be attractive young women, all with a weary look on their face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you catch up to Karlia, knocking on a familiar door, the door to the boys bedroom.<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" comes the response of a tired teenage boy who has just woken up  <br>\r\n\"It is Karlia, Master. Your mother told me to wake you.\" Karlia states, she adjusts herself before entering. <br>\r\nYou follow, silently slipping through the door, into a large richly decorated room.<br>\r\nTheir in the bed sits a young man, about your age. The boy you originally came here to rescue. He looks like he has just woken up, though the light pouring into through the window suggests it is well into the day.<br>\r\nThe boy groans and stretches, before forcing himself to leave the warm comfort of his bed. The two of you could have been twins, roughly the same height and similarly built. \"How are you this morning Karlia?\" he asks yawning.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, what can I get you for breakfast Master?\" she responds, forcing a smile.<br>\r\nThe boy frowns, \"He has been doing it again, hasn't he.\" he looks at Karlia with a mixture of pity and anger \"He brings shame upon this household, upon the family name, treating his servants like that.\" He crosses over to Karlia and puts his hands on her shoulders \"Are you alright?\" he asks.<br>\r\nKarlia looks down in shame, as though the pity of this boy was worse than the humiliation of her circumstance.<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n\"Something has to be done about this\" the boy straightens up \"Karlia, pack your bags, you are dismissed, along with all the other servants, I am going to deal with my father\" and with that he stormed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He dismissed the entire household\" Karlia's voice returns \"Told us we were free to leave, and that Lord Lestacht would be dealt with, It was so ... 'noble', seeing a son trying to bear the weight of his fathers sins.<br>\r\n\"If you were dismissed, why didn't you go?\" you ask, confused as to how this, had lead to the current circumstance.<br>\r\n\"I did, I returned home, back to the forest. Samuel challenged his father to a duel for control of the household, I heard he almost won, however, he hesitated, unable to kill his father. His father refused to surrender and had no such qualm, so Samuel decided to forfeit the duel. Lord Lestacht, humiliated by his son, could not lash out at his household without risk of further scrutiny. He could not live with the weight of his failure, and where did that bring him? Back to me. He hunted me down again and dragged me back to the mansion, under cover of darkness. Someone to vent his 'frustrations' on.\"<br>\r\n\"Please, I can't watch that again.\" you beg, unwilling to see more abuse.<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, I have no interest in reliving that time of my life, all you need to know is that after a week of his abuse this happend\" and with those words the world again morphs and you find yourself in a large, even more richly decorated room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is well into the night by the look of it and you see huddled form of Karlia in one corner of the room. Despite the obvious luxury of the room, the bars on the window and iron plated door make this look more like an ornate prison cell than a bedroom. You hear the sounds of keys in locks and a drunken Lord Johnathan Lestacht enters the room, slamming it shut behind him.<br>\r\n\"Here imp\" he commands dropping his trousers <br>\r\nKarlia stirs, and reluctantly begins servicing the drunken Lord, it isn't long before he is groaning in pleasure and releases himself with a grunt. Karlia collapses, to the floor.<br>\r\nSeemingly satisfied he begins to pull up his trousers and makes to leave, uncaring of the unconscious form of his 'servant' on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was here he made his mistake\" Karlia's voice shatters your feelings of disgust, as suddenly you see the prone imp, lash out at the Lords feet, causing him to topple over. Quickly she grabbed a large heavy looking book and beat him heavily over the head with it, knocking him cold. She then dragged the unconscious lord to the bed and began restraining him, soon he was spread eagle on the bed, defenseless, Karlia scooted over, locked the door from the inside and now, no one and nothing could stop her as she began to exact her revenge. <br>\r\n\"I'll leave you to enjoy the show\" Karlia's voice fades again leaving you to watch as</span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t weep for him, for he was a man without honour or principal, he lived by his own desires at the expense of others.

You feel something, a presence behind you, and lash out, only for your sword to slice deeply into the chair you had just been sat in, the blade quivers just an inch above the head of a figure completely shadowed by your body. <br>\r\nYou wrench your sword back and jump away to see\u2026 a clean white skeleton, wearing dusty moss covered armour, yet you recognise it, there\u2019s only one set like it, yours, you look down in horror and see that your armour is gone, you are wearing simple undergarments; a light tunic that reaches your knees, and some short pants.<br>\r\nThe hollow eyes of the skull gaze out toward the moon, the cold fascination with what can only be your corpse holds you for a few moments before you force yourself to look further into the room, as far as you can tell it\u2019s the same room that you had been sitting in with Sam earlier, listening to Karlia\u2019s story.<br>\r\nA sound catches your attention the sound of footsteps walking slowly along a hall, it seems to be approaching the room although it\u2019s a fair way off, tentatively you peer out into the hallway, in the direction the sounds are coming from, then they stop, and the entirety of the vast mansion is silent.<br>\r\nYou smell something now, it\u2019s a familiar smell though you can\u2019t tell what it is, it is getting stronger, and it appears to be approaching from the same direction the sounds came from, under no illusion that something is coming, you silently step out into the hallway and back away from whatever is there, with no idea of what it might be.<br>\r\nThen slowly into the moonlight you see the beautiful form of Karlia, in her hands seems to be a bundle of rags, a cruel grin on sits on her face, you are aware of a gentle sobbing sound and from behind her shuffles the miserable figure of a man, a muscular, well built man, naked save for the pants pooled around his ankles.<br>\r\n Snaked around his penis, like a leash, is the smooth black tail of an imp, its heart shaped tip flicking his testicles. The man looks up and you realise it is Sir Justin, but his eyes seem hollow, like he sees nothing. Karlia seems to look right at you, hidden in the shadows of the hall and smiles. With that she leads the snivelling man into the room and closes the door behind her.<br>\r\nA cold breeze makes you shiver, and with a start you realise you are naked. Your penis slowly stiffens as you watch in disbelief until you find yourself with a throbbing boner and no explanation as to what is happening. <br>\r\nYou still have Sir Justins body, so clearly this is still Karlia\u2019s \u2018story\u2019 although try as you might to calm your nerves you feel there is something distinctively sinister at play here, similar to the quality the dream she had forced upon you and Samuel earlier. The thought of the boy makes you wonder if he is having the same experience. <br>\r\nPushing the thoughts from your mind you decide to try and find a way out, before she entraps you again. You turn away from the direction Karlia and Sir Justin had come and run further along the dark hallway, unfamiliar with the layout of the house you pass many doorways before coming to the end of the corridor a single large doorway stands before you, tentatively you reach out for the large handle.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want you going in there\u201d a playful voice stops you, you turn to face the smiling Karlia \u201cMy, oh my you are a clever boy aren\u2019t you, well not too clever, after all you got yourself into this mess, but still, much cleverer than those oafs who called themselves heroes and advanturers\u201d you back away from her, you penis shivering at the sight of her.<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go\u201d you demand, trying to sound authoritative, which is difficult when your naked and have an erection \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough of this story, and I have certainly entertained your \u2018games\u2019 long enough\u201d. She smiles and you feel you know her answer will be some trick, with a snap of her fingers the house dissolves and you find yourself back in the chair you had been sitting in earlier. You take a deep breath and you know that this is reality.<br>\r\nYou look across to where Sam was sitting when Karlia had began but he is nowhere to be seen. \u201cOh don\u2019t worry about him\u201d Karlia stands behind your chair smiling down at you \u201cThe story was a little bit much for poor Sammy so I put him back to bed with some extra special dreamies to help him sleep\u201d she chuckles clearly enjoying herself \u201cBut you mister, you are a problem, I just can\u2019t trust you to play nicely with my dreams, so I have decided to let you go\u201d you look at her suspiciously knowing that there will at least be a caveat. You\u2019re still naked for a start before you can say anything she hushes you \u201cI am letting you go, you\u2019re free to leave, but I\u2019m keeping your clothes, something to remember you by\u201d she smiles at your penis \u201cI would offer you something in return but I think I\u2019ve given you quite enough to remember me by, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d You nod, somewhat sheepishly, deciding to take the out being given to you, as horribly awkward as it is.<br>\r\nYou take your leave swiftly, you feel great guilt over Samuel Lestacht\u2019s predicament but you recognise that there is nothing you can do about it as you are now, and getting trapped here won\u2019t solve anything, the pragmatism surprises you, it is somewhat uncharacteristic to readily accept a lesser of two evils as the best solution, but you genuinely see no other way of saving him but coming back when you\u2019re stronger.  <br>\r\nYou are just about to leave when Karlia calls out to you something that makes your blood run cold and fills you with dread <br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I keep milking the poor little boy until there\u2019s just a pair of balls and his stiff little willy left. Then he spends the rest of his days as a silly little penis, making lovely cum for me. Its really all boys are to begin with, silly little cum factories, for girls to play with.\u201d The words come to you as a fuzz, a blur, lost amid the pleasure as slowly the last of your conscious mind fades into cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad end<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Breathing deeply, you stride out of the inn, and let the sounds of the town wash over you. Petra joins you and gives your hand a reassuring squeeze. <br>\r\n\u201cCome on then Eric, you can tell me about this after we get out of town\u201d she smiles, a kind and  gentle, it makes you happy to see her smile in a way that is not trying to seduce you. <br>\r\nSo the two of you leave the town behind and head up toward the mountains, your sense of ease growing with every step you take away from the that place, you tell Petra about what had made you feel so nervous, she listens, not interrupting you, until you at length finish. The imp ponders what you have said for a while, before smiling \u201cEric, I am if I made you feel uncomfortable, I am not exactly used to humans, but know that I have no intent of causing you harm, and I am willing to fight your enemies alongside you.\u201d She looks sincerely at you before continuing \u201cAs for your dislike of that town, I can\u2019t say, perhaps there was a monster stalking you, hopefully if it was, then it has decided not to pursue us.\u201d Her words make you feel a slight sense of unease again, and you can\u2019t help looking back down the road, to see if anything is following you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while you stare, back, the wind gently blowing through the boughs of the trees around you, until you feel confident that there is nothing there, then pushing those thoughts to the back of your mind you continue, further into the mountains. <br>\r\n\u201cwhere are we going exactly, Eric?\u201d Petra asks after a few hours of idle chat.<br>\r\nThe truth is you aren\u2019t that sure, all you know is you need to get stronger, beyond that end you have no plan. \u201cA city I guess, somewhere I can train to get stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you have such a clear goal\u201d Petra replies with a grin \u201cSure would suck to just wonder around aimlessly picking fights with monsters\u201d <br>\r\nThe banter continues until the sky begins to darken, up ahead you can see a small hamlet, clustered around what you hope Is an inn. <br>\r\nYou reach the place just after sunset, and are thankful to find it to be a small inn that has currently got no other customers, the Barkeep, a good natured young man called Aaron, just a few years older than you, seems glad of the custom and treats you to a warm meal before providing you with two comfortable rooms, for a modest fee.<br>\r\nYou and Petra say goodnight, and then you lock your door and lay down to sleep, a long and dreamless sleep.<br>\r\nThe sound of shouting wakes you, the morning sun is pale through a thick bank of fog, you blearily stubble out of bed and amble over to the window, in the road below you see a small group of men, huddled together, in front of a small group of riders. Sensing something is wrong you hurry to get dressed, the sound of snoring tells you that Petra is still fast asleep as you hurry out of your room and down into the street.<br>\r\nThe crowd stands between you and the 3 riders and you are able to slip out unnoticed, you notice the Aaron the barkeeper at the back, and you slowly walk up behind him.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d you whisper<br>\r\nHe jumps in surprise and looks back at you with relief. \u201cEric don\u2019t scare me like that\u201d he smiles nervously<br>\r\n\u201cWho are those riders\u201d you ask, noting now that they are all wearing dark red cloaks that hide their appearance.<br>\r\n\u201cWho are they?\u201d Aaron looks at you with incredulity, \u201cThey are from the Red Hand, they run extortion rackets on every Hamlet, town and Village up and down the Silver Coast, they are the most feared guild around, how have you not seen them before?\u201d<br>\r\nYou look at the riders, but you haven\u2019t ever heard of them much less encountered them \u201cMalak is too small and out of the way I guess\u201d you shrug<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019re lucky then, those bitches will take a man for every penny he\u2019s got, and then some.

Do you want to be reminded of your place?\u201d she asks in a menacing tone, rising to her feet, she throws back her scarlet cloak revealing her busty figure, tightly packed into a suit of fine armour.

However, just before you\u2019re about to hit home, you see that she is making no attempt to meet your attack, catching a movement In your peripheral vision you reverse your attack and swipe down instead, moving to  the side just in time as the blade slashes just grazing your trousers.<br>\r\nStepping back you check to see if you\u2019re cut anywhere, but you seem to be unscathed.<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad boy, but you\u2019ll have to do better than that!\u201d the swordswoman taunts stepping forward and unleashing a flurry of blows, and you barely manage to meet them the last one, a savage cut almost slipping through your defence. <br>\r\nThe other Red hand members now stop what they\u2019re doing and watch on in interest. Step by step you are forced to give ground and you desperately try to fend of the steel blur of a sword, your battered wooden sword steadily being smashed apart, splinter by splinter. <br>\r\nThe crowd watches on in silence, it seems they weren\u2019t expecting quite such a fight. However, it was only a mater of time till your luck ran out, already several of her attacks had slipped through, none making contact with you, but each managing to slice into your clothes, slowly ripping them to shreds. As you retreat from another series you find yourself backed against a wall, with nowhere else to go. <br>\r\nWith a triumphant cry Elaine moves to deliver the coup de grace, a devasting avalanching blow, with just a split-second decision you decide to \u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look up to see the blade, stuck fast in the solid heart of your wooden sword, Elaine's triumph turns to one of annoyance as she tries to wrench the blade back. Sensing your opportunity you explode forward,from your crouched position, twisting the tangle of wood and steel away from your assailant, and knocking her away from you with a burst of strength you\u2019d never felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Swordswoman topples back, losing her grip and her footing simultaneously. The sword, no longer trapped between the two combatants, comes free with ease, and with a movement more fluid than you had intended, you catch the handle and reverse the blade to point at its former wielder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence drifts across the square, not one sound interrupts the tension. The cold morning air finally stirs and gently billows out your cloak, and the gentle light of the new sun warms your face, dancing along the glittering steel in your hand. You can see the awe in the eyes of the villagers, the shock in the eyes of the bandits, and most clearly the terror on the face of the woman sprawled before you. It all feels so distant though, as though you are watching through the eyes of someone else, someone powerful, someone who holds the power of life and death over someone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment seems to last an age, until slowly you drift back to your senses.

You watch as they run, before, satisfied they are gone, turning back to the terrified people of the hamlet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people seem to shrink back from you, you frown uncomprehendingly, and then suddenly your world goes black <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain courses through your body, burning every fiber of your being, with a scream you open your eyes.<br>\r\nYou are in a strange room, surrounded by odd looking blurs, they make sounds you don\u2019t understand.

For a moment the entire world seems to freeze around you, until after what seems like an age you feel the hand slowly glide up your shaft.<br>\r\nThe pleasure causes you to groan deeply, and you instinctively try to thrust your hips forward, however her other hand rests firmly on your stomach, preventing you from moving. Slowly she strokes up and down, pausing at the base and head, before continuing a slow, agonisingly steady rhythm. <br>\r\nYou feel the pressure building and desperately begin bucking your hips but her hand holds you in place, with as little effort as bear holding down a rabbit. Unable to relieve yourself you whine helplessly as her hand seems to move ever slower, pause ever longer, and all the while the pressure builds, higher and higher, till you feel like you're about to burst. <br>\r\nThe sound of your whimpering causes Eostre to laugh all the harder as she cooes \u201cAwww, do you want to cum?\u201d you attempt to respond, but you're muffled by her breasts and as you begin to speak her fingers make an O and start vigorously rubbing the tip of your cock. You gasp as your brain is overloaded with stimulation, unable to make a coherent sound.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay baby, if you think you\u2019re ready then CUM!\u201d her voice cuts through your mind and she resumes tugging your shaft. <br>\r\nHer other hand releases your waist and your hips begin thrusting will all your might. Your mind goes completely blank as the orgasm rips through you, causing your entire body to convulse. Meanwhile her hand continues to pump every last drop of cum you have out of your penis, instead of spurting out like normal it instead flows like a stream, floating into a slowly forming ball that eventually grows to the size of a large apple. <br>\r\nYour entire body completely drained of both energy and cum, slumps unconsciously against Eostre. She smiles down at your limp body, and kisses the top of your head tenderly. Goodnight little hero, and sweet dreams. She lays you down in your bed and touches her fingers gently to your chest. A faint glow washes over your sleeping form, seemingly restoring your energy as you rest. <br>\r\nEostre reaches out her hand and takes the floating ball of cum, and with a flash of light, turns it into a tiny white flower, which she adds to her dress.

You realise that as soon as she won\u2019t be preoccupied for long before her attention turns back to your penis, which is still soaked in your \u2018milk\u2019.

Throwing yourself to the ground the wheat swishes as the imp sails over your head. You roll to the side, away from where you dove into the long wheat, and begin crawling along on your stomach, being careful to not give away your position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCum on out Eric!\u201d the imp teases, from the sound of her voice, hovering above the field.<br>\r\nYou risk a look and see her gliding lazily above you, holding that damned bucket, and scanning the wheat for any sign of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like a mouse, hiding from an owl, you try to continue as stealthily as possible, forcing yourself to continue slowly, carefully, inching your way toward the trees. An age seems to pass, but it's probably more like 10 minutes, during which you hear her call you out several times, with both tempting offers and bloodchilling threats. From the few times you have risked a glance you have steadily closed the gap between you and the safety of the treeline, and estimate you are now no more than 20 meters away from it, perhaps close enough to make a break for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly poke your head out, mostly concealed by the night, and look around for the imp, she silently floats illuminated by the pale moonlight, not 5 meters away from you. Transfixed for a moment by her beauty, you almost forget that she is the one you\u2019re desperately fleeing from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice startles you, and you snatch your head back into the wheat \u201cCan you hear me Eric?\u201d she sounds calm, too calm. slowly you peak out again. She holds the bucket aloft. \u201cI\u2019m gonna drink all your milk\u201d as she says it, she brings the bucket to her lips and throws her head back.<br>\r\nWatching with a mixture of fear, confusion, and of course arousal, you see her drink what must be all of your cum in a little less than 10 seconds, before she throws the bucket to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, thats some potent stuff!\u201d she gasps as she begins glowing with a gentle white aura.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lucky boy Eric, but now you\u2019re going to \u2018cum\u2019 out.\u201d you want to continue crawling along but find yourself rooted in place as the imps glow intensifies.<br>\r\n\u201cFe-fi-fo-fum, I smell the scent of a little boys cum, for my boobs your penis will swell, to be milked by me forever in hell\u201d the words of the incantation reverberate through your soul as you feel between your legs you cock immediately spring to life. You try to cover it with your hands, but it continues to rise to the imps command, you look down to see it glowing with the same pale silvery light that was radiating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFound you\u201d you look up straight into the boobs of the imp, your will gives out and your penis smacks up against your belly in an instant tummy tapping erection. <br>\r\n\u201cPlease, let me -\u201d you begin to plead, silenced by a kiss, you feel weightless and realise you\u2019re in the air, her powerful tail, coiled around your waist.<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Petra\u201d the imp says gently \u201cI\u2019m going to make you cum in a second\u201d she gently strokes your shaft with a soft hand, \u201cwhen I do, you are going to shout \u2018I\u2019m a silly little boy, who was milked into submission by an imp named Petra, and I swear on my penis to serve her for eternity\u2019, do you understand?\u201d you feel her climbing higher into the sky, whilst her hand gently taps your balls, rolling them around. You remain silent save for the involuntary gasps and moans of pleasure elicited by her hands.<br>\r\nYou feel the hand massaging your cum swollen testicles, cease and begin rubbing your bottom as she says \u201cDon\u2019t make me spank it out of you Mr\u201d she giggles and playfully slaps your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a silly little boy, who was milked into submission by an imp named Petra, and I swear on my penis to serve her for eternity\u201d you say, so that only she can hear. <br>\r\n\u201cLouder Eric, shout it to the world\u201d Petra teases, beginning to stroke you more intensely<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a silly little boy, who was milked into submission by an imp named Petra, and I swear on my penis to serve her for eternity!\u201d you shout, blushing a deep crimson from the shame.<br>\r\n\u201cWho milked you?\u201d shouts petra, her hand picking up the pace, as she delivers another spank.<br>\r\n\u201cPetra!\u201d you scream, loud enough for the village, some 100 meters below to hear.<br>\r\n\u201cGood boy\u201d she praises you as her hand round your cock becomes a blur, \u201cNow you and your willy both need to say goodbye to the world\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBye!\u201d you cry out in ecstasy as you cum, pulsing in her hands, as huge ropes of cum shoot out over the village<br>\r\n\u201cGood boy, good boy\u201d you go limp as the Petra flies through a portal with your unconscious body to begin you new life as the cum toy, you\u2019ll love every second of it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad End?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You search your memories for every thing you can remember about bee-girls. They lived in hives. The majority of them aren't very bright, with the exception of the queen. And the honey they produced had amazing healing properties. Supposedly the queen's honey was the best, and could even strengthened someone who ate it for a long time. Of course to get the queen's honey you had to get into a hive that was guarded by warrior drones. Speaking of warrior drones, you're pretty sure the bee in the field was a worker. So where were the guards?<br>\r\nSuddenly a dark figure darts out of the woods on the far side of the field. Startled, the worker leaps into the air just a little to slow. The dark one grabs the worker by the leg and drags her to the ground. With a scream a warrior bee dove out of the sky and slammed into the attacker. Knife like protrusions on the warrior's arm stab repeatedly into her prey. The figure struggles to its feet and manages to throw the bee off. It stands there for a moment, trying to choose to fight or flee. The decision is made by the bees as a second and third warrior dive down, and the first gets back up and rejoins the fray.<br>\r\nGetting up, the warriors go to the injured worker. For a moment, you think they might just kill the injured creature. To your relief, they assist the worker to her feet and carry her back towards the village.<br>\r\nYou wait. Then wait some more. After what feels like hours, (but judging by the sun was only minutes) you run into the field, cursing yourself for being such a fool. You stoop to examine the clearly dead assailant of the bees. Despite the multiple stab wounds, you can see that it was a werewolf. One of the Witch Queen's shock troopers, they amazonian fighter were infamous for breaking infantry with reckless charges backed by immense strength and tough hides. This one was looking fairly unhealthy, even for a corpse. The skeletal arms and matted fur seemed to indicate that she had either been separated with, or more likely thrown out of, her pack and had had trouble fending for herself.<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye, you see a flash of leather. Turning you spy a small satchel laying in the grass. It obviously didn't belong to the dead werewolf. You pick it, holding it close to your face you get a whiff of something sweet. Honey sweet. You freeze. Gears turn in your head making you wonder just how easily the warrior's guarding the bee village could be fooled. If they relied mostly on smell, than this satchel might just be enough to get you into the village and steal some honey. Is it worth the risk?</span></div></div>",

You move through the trees ready for anything. Anything except what you found.<br>\r\nLeaning against a tree was a werewolf child. She appeared to be wearing a simple leather vest and nothing else.

He looked like he went out of his way to smell vile. \"But once they're in the trap all you have to do is...\" He raised a crossbow leveling it at the girl.<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" You stepped froward and pushed the crossbow down. \"She's just a child!\"<br>\r\n\"And soon enough she'll be a grown bitch.\" The man snarled and raised the bow again. \"Better to kill her now when she can't fight back.\" He shouldered you aside to stand in between you and the girl.<br>\r\nYou looked at the little werewolf, her muzzled wet as she sniffed back tears.

What's yours?\"<br>\r\n\"M-Mi-mizzie.\" She sniffled. \"Why, why did you do that?\"<br>\r\n\"You don't get to be a hero by murdering children.\" You take the trap key from the dead hunter and pry open the trap. Mizzie whimpers with pain as you toss the trap aside. You hiss in sympathy, the trap had broken her leg and her supernatural healing had tried to repair the break while still in the trap. The result was a limb twisted in on itself. Mizzie wouldn't be walking anytime soon. You take a deep breath. \"I'm going to have to carry you. If I put you on my back, do you think you can help me find your pack?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh.\" It takes only takes a moment for you to get situated. Mara on your back, sword at your side. A small furry limb jabs into view \"That way.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Mizzie's instructions deeper into the woods. You are slightly nervous about going into werewolf territory alone, but hopefully Mizzie would engineer enough goodwill for you to pass through unscathed. Of course you almost jump out of your skin when a snarling werewolf steps in front of you. She is clad in the same kind of leather vest as Mizzie, but were Mizzie was obviously a child the newcomer was taller than you, with full breasts and an obvious musculature underneath her dark fur. and in one hand she was carrying the biggest war hammer you've ever seen. And she looks pissed. \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?\"<br>\r\n\"Mara!\" Mizzie shouted in your ear. \"Mara, Mara, Mara!\"<br>\r\n\"Mizzie?!\" The werewolf looked shocked. \"What have you been doing? Mom has been worried sick! Are you all right?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" Mizzie assured her...sister? \"Mr. Erik took care of me.\"<br>\r\nMara looked at you. \"Mr. Erik?\"<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you ma'am.\" You nod in greeting. \"And Mizzie here could use some help. Her leg got got in a steel jaw trap and her bones tried to mend while still inside.\"<br>\r\n\"A jaw trap!\" Mara switched from cautiously pleasant to angry in a flash. \"Those are vile, who would even use one? They cripple unwary humans just as often as other creatures. When I get a hold of the bastard who set that thing...\"<br>\r\n\"He's been taken care of.\" You interrupt. \"We should probably get Mara some help though.\"Mizzie looked at you speculatively. You don't meet her eyes. You're not proud of having killed another human like that.<br>\r\n\"Follow me.\" Mara said. She lead you into a clearing with tents, or possibly cloth coverings for dens in the ground, line the edges.<br>\r\n\"Mara you're back already?\" One of the wolves called out. Were Mara was tall and athletic, this werewolf was shorter than you and dangerously curved. Her every step lent a hypnotic sway to her hips and her standard leather vest stretched over an ample chest. So entranced by her appearance you almost missed the worried look in her eye. \"Have you found your sister?\"<br>\r\n\"Here I am Mama.\" Mizzie called out.<br>\r\n\"Mizzie!\" You barely had enough time to drop to one knee as the wolf mother rushed you. You grunted as the surprisingly heavy woman crashed on top of you and Mizzie pulling her daughter, and extension you. into an embrace. \"Mizzie you're all right. I was so worried when I couldn't find you, You should know better than to disappear on me like that. Never do it again.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm okay Mama, I'm okay.\"<br>\r\n\"This is a touching heartfelt reunion and all, but can we please get OFF THE HUMAN!\" Oh crap did you say that out loud? A muffled snort from Mara suggested that you did. Fortunately the wolves didn't seem offended. In fact the mother laughed openly as she got off of you carrying her daughter.<br>\r\n\"I apologize.\" She held a hand in front of her mouth, smothering a giggle. \"My name is Miranda, I'm Mizzie and Mira's mother. Thank you so much for bringing my baby home.\"<br>\r\n\"It was no problem ma'am.\"<br>\r\n\"So polite.\" Miranda murmured as she walked away.<br>\r\nMara sighed as her mother walked away. Glancing up at the sky she turned to Erik. \"The sun is heading down. If you like I can ask the Alpha if you can stay the night in our camp. It's the least I can do after you helped Mizzie get back.\"<br>\r\n\"I would appreciate that thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alpha, a scar covered and particularly scary looking wolf, agreed to let you spend the night with her pack. So as the camp quieted down for the night you found yourself stretching out in a tent provided by the pack. You feel yourself starting to drift of when you hear a rustling at the entrance of your shelter. Propping yourself up on your elbows you watch as a familiar curved figure crawled into the tent. \"Miranda? What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n\"Shhh.\" The wolf mother held a clawed finger in front of her mouth. \"I never got the chance to thank you properly for saving my baby girl.\" Miranda crawled over to you and dragged her breasts across your bare chest. Your eyes widen as you realize what the naked wolf had in mind. You start to stammer excuses but the wolf woman would have nothing of it. With a groan you watch helplessly as she lowers herself onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning you groan and stretch as a satisfied Miranda leads you out of your tent. You almost immediately run into a bouncing Mizzie. \"Mr. Erik, Mr. Erik! Did you sleep with my Mama last night?\" unsure how to respond to the blunt question from a child you cautiously say yes. Mizzie then turned to her mother and asked. \"Am I going to have a new sister Mama?\"<br>\r\nMiranda, smothering a laugh at your crimson cheeks, replies, \"Almost certainly, Mizzie.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Thank you, Mr. Erik.\"<br>\r\nEmbarrassed beyond all belief you make your goodbyes. The werewolf camp is barely out of sight when you are intercepted by Mara. \"I'm coming with you.\" The offer was surprising if not unwelcome. A werewolf with a giant hammer would certainly be a welcome addition to your quest. But why? \"How much do you know about werewolves?\"<br>\r\n\"Not much,\" you admit.<br>\r\n\"Alright there are three kinds. Most are your average wolf. Strong and fierce, fighters that get pregnant now and then. Then there are wolves like my mother.\" You wince at the mention of Miranda. \"Breeders. Not the strongest fighters but with the highest fertility of any wolf. You probably did get her pregnant, by the way. And then there are wolves like me. Alphas, or future Alphas,\" Mara belonging to that second category. \"Stronger than any other wolf and almost never get pregnant. The problem is that there is only one Alpha per pack. So I was starting to overstay my welcome.\"<br>\r\nYou nodded in understanding. \"So any suggestions on which way we should go?\"<br>\r\nMara nodded. \"You came from the direction of the bee village, so we should go that direction. We'll reach a road that heads straight for a port town. Or we could detour through some caves that are rumored to contain a magic spring. Your choice.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's go.\"<br>\r\n\"Say,\" Mara asked curiously, \"How many times did my mother milk you last night anyway?\"<br>\r\n\"Six.\"</span></div></div>",

You can't believe you're actually doing this. Where had all this reckless bravery come from?<br>\r\nAs you walk up to the entrance, you get your first clear look at a warrior bee. Two of them stand at either side of the village gates. They are slender, about a head shorter than you. Twin antennae are perched on the forehead over dark eyes. That is all you can really see of their face, as the rest is covered in shiny black armor. The rest of their bodies are similarly covered, with bright yellow stripes on their sides You suppose their small breasts are well supported by the materiel. They stand at attention, heeled boots together, their arms along  their sides, wings flat against their backs. You look uneasily at the long knifes extending from their wrists. Thinking about it you realize that they would be the stingers of a more mundane bee.<br>\r\nAs you step between the guards their antennae twitch, but the don't even look in your direction. You walk cleanly through the gate. You're in.<br>\r\nYou look around the monster-infested village. It appears the buildings were more or less intact. They had just been covered in what looks like beeswax. Bee workers move quickly around the town, each at least a head shorter than the warriors. In contrast to their warrior's black armor, the workers are covered in soft black and yellow fuzz. On the roofs, warriors land and take off, ending and beginning patrols of the area. Glancing inside one building, you see a wagon being repaired, while another is being carefully loaded with jars full of thick golden honey. Another building had been gutted, the walls lined with hexagonal cells, each with a bee warrior asleep in it. Oddly two of the buildings look completely unaltered, while another appears to be entirely covered in beeswax.<br>\r\nStepping up to the first of the unaltered buildings, what appears to have once been the local inn, and look inside. What you see shocks you. Apparently the workers are not without stings of their own. Right in front of you is a warrior bee, face armor gone, on all fours with a look of ecstasy on her black face. behind her is a worker bee who is ramming her cock-like sting into the bigger bee. Looking around the room you see a number of other bees in doing the same thing, in every conceivable position. You look at a warrior, just in time to see her pull her mouth off of her partners sting, only for the worker to spray a thick golden-yellow fluid all over her face.<br>\r\nYou apparently just found out how bee-girl is made.<br>\r\nYou walk away from the inn, stunned and slightly aroused by what you just saw.

It looks to be a perfectly normal, empty temple. Instantly suspicious, you draw your sword and advance.<br>\r\nThe building had been cleaned. The windows gleamed and the pews looked freshly painted. You didn't see dust or a single cobweb anywhere. Yet as you looked closer, you saw signs that the bees had been in there. Small repairs had been done in beeswax. One pew had almost a quarter of its length replaced with wax. You find a door that you are pretty sure leads to the priest's rooms. Pressing your ear against the wood, you hear buzzing.<br>\r\nCautiously you open the door and peek inside. Like the rest of the building it is clean but with a definite sign that the bees had been in here. In this case a bee was still in the room. She has the same physical characteristics of the worker bee, but much taller, being only slightly shorter than you and a lot curvier. She was buzzing to herself, much like a human might hum or sing.<br>\r\nMost surprising was the fact that she was wearing a skirt. All the bees you had seen so far were mostly covered in armor or soft fuzz, mostly. None of them were wearing clothes. <br>\r\nYou must have made some noise because she turns around and looks right at you. Her eyes widen in surprise. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\nShe knows you're not a bee! What do you do?</span></div></div>",

Your only weapon is on the ground, and you know that those wings could propel her across the room, easily killing you before you could reach the sword. You decide that the best policy is to answer honestly. \"My name is Erik.\"<br>\r\n\"Why are you here?\"<br>\r\nAgain the truth seems the best reply. \"I'm an adventurer and I was passing through when I saw your village. I decided to take a look around.\"<br>\r\nShe just stares at you, until apparently she decides you are trustworthy. Her knife-stings retract with a soft click, and she extends a glossy black hand, \"My name is Miranda.\"<br>\r\nYou cautiously take her hand in yours, despite the polished look it feels soft. You grasp it firmly but carefully, not yet sure how you stand in the eyes of this bee. Shes looking you up and down critically, but you can't tell if she likes what sees or is disappointed. \"How did you even get in her?\" Maybe she is just a little disbelieving. In response you hold out the satchel, you had picked up earlier. She takes it and her antennae twitch. \"This shouldn't have worked. Clearly it did, but... Damn you Mother.\"<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" You didn't quite understand what she was saying. She obviously wasn't another dumb bee. In fact you are pretty sure she's a queen bee. She immediately confirms your thoughts.<br>\r\n\"As a mature queen, I am supposed to be provided with a score of warriors to defend me, and a pair of workers to attend me. And I am supposed to be sent into the world to collect the seed of men to prepare for the creation of my own hive. Instead my mother,\" at that Miranda jabs her finger at the window where you can clearly see the wax covered building. \"Sits on her fat ass in her throne, there are barely enough warriors to defend the hive, and all she cares about is sex and honey that no one wants! All the while I am left her alone and forgotten.\" Sobbing, she throws her arms around you and cries into your shoulder. Awkwardly you put the arm around her and just hold the bee-girl as she just cries and cries.<br>\r\nFinally, her sobbing stops and she just stands there for a moment, content to have you hold her. Then your hear her mumble something into your shirt. You pull your head back to look at her, \"Pardon?\"<br>\r\n\"Can I come with you?\" She straightens up to look you in the eye. \"I just can't stay here, I <b>have</b> to leave soon or I might go crazy. I was planning on leaving by myself soon anyway. But it isn't very safe for a lone bee, even a queen, to be roaming around by herself. So safety in numbers and all that.

She didn't have to sound so surprised. \"Oh thank you, thank you, thank you!\" Then to your surprises she pulls you in for a loud, wet kiss. \"Thank you. My gear is right in here, come on.\" You follow behind the jovial queen with a hand on your lips. Did she just slip you some tongue?<br>\r\nYou follow her down the stairs to a massive storage room under the temple. The walls are lined with human made items. Wardrobes stuffed with clothes. Racks and racks of weapons. Rows of armor.You feel like your heads going to spin off just trying to take it all in. Miranda sees your bewilderment. \"People leave an awful lot of stuff behind when bees march on them. I suppose they thought they were going to come back for it later. Except we never left.\"<br>\r\n\"What about those?\" You point to the center of the room, where a pair of battered training dummies stood. Miranda rubbed her antennae together in a gesture that you think represents embarrassment.<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought I would be traveling by myself. So I wanted to make sure I could defend myself.\" As she spoke she strapped on an odd pack. Instead of going on over her back it held pouches on to her thighs, with straps going down her legs and another set going up her chest, bisecting her large breasts to wrap around her neck. Clearly, it distributed the weight throughout her body, but all you could think of was how sexy leather straps made her look. To distract you from that vision you take another look around.<br>\r\n\"Will anyone mind if I take some armor?\"<br>\r\n\"Not really, I mean I'm the only one who ever comes down here. But why do you...\" She looks at you, utter astonishment on her face. \"You don't have any armor?!?\"<br>\r\nYou forgot that bees went into battle clad head to toe in armor. You not having <i>any</i> armor must seem like sacrilege to her. She drags you over to a rack of armor and proceeds help you find something that fit. She initially tried to sell you a full set of plate, but you managed to convince her that human forged steel was a lot heavier than a bees armor. Eventually you both agree on a simple leather cuirass and steel bracers.<br>\r\nGetting out of the village was less nerve wracking then getting in.You simply followed Miranda through the village gate. There was still plenty of daylight left so the two of you walk down the road in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was setting when you spotted a clearing just off the road. The air was chill, so you lit a fire and watched Miranda in the flickering light. You had found it much nicer traveling with someone, rather than wandering by yourself. Especially someone as good looking as the young queen.<br>\r\n\"So, is it true that a queen's honey has special properties?\" You were genuinely curious and wanted to find out more about her.<br>\r\n\"Well, yes.\" Miranda looked surprised at the question. \"Humans who eat queen honey often become bigger and stronger. But for there to be any real change you would have to eat a lot, and for a long time.\"<br>\r\n\"So how do you actually know that,\" Knowing monster-girls you had an idea but you wanted to be sure.<br>\r\nMiranda rubbed her antennae together, \"Some queens keep pets.\"<br>\r\nAn awkward silence follows. You both sit there for a few moments. \"Do you want to try some?\"<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n\"Do you to try some of my honey?\" You can see Miranda's antennae rubbing together. \"It's all right with me if you want to.\"<br>\r\nYou look her over. She seems sincere. Curious you say all right, and she gets up and walks around the fire to you. She stands over you and you and her honey-sting extends from her groin. She slowly strokes the eight inch rod as she gazes down at you. \"It's best straight from the source.\"<br>\r\nNever taking your eyes off of hers, you get up on your knees and slowly take the tip of her sting in your mouth. She moans as you swirl your tongue around the tip. Sweet fluid leaks from the tip. She reaches down to hold your head as you bob up and down on her shaft.<br>\r\nWith a cry, she pulls your head as far down as it would go and sprays her honey into our mouth. You swallow furiously, drinking as much of the sweet fluid as you can.<br>\r\nMiranda falls to the ground next to you, eyes glazed over. She kisses you fiercely, tongue searching for the remnants of her sticky cum.</span></div></div>",

She stretched, yawned, and finally opened her eyes. \"What the fuck is going on?\" She leapt to her feet and almost immediately fell, clutching her wound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've lost a lot of blood, you should try to keep still.\" \"Why?\" \"Because if you don't you'll just end up fainting again.\" \"No why did you let me live, you even treated my wound.\" You shrug \"I hate killing\" \"... you're weird\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"meh, I've been called worse\" you shrug. Remembering your lack of pants, you grab a pair out of your bag and hastily put them on. \"Here let me see your shoulder.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peel off the bandage and survey your handiwork. \"Pretty good, it should be all healed up in a few days. You should probably go home and rest, it'll do you good.\" You redress the wound and gather your things. \"I'm gonna be on my way now, stay out of trouble!\"</span></div></div>",

In order to protect her, you put your coat on her covering her wing from view. the knight walked over to the rabbit girl who was now on her feet. \"stay away\" she pleaded. the knight approached and *SMACK* slapped the rabbit girl across the face. \"you have no honor, attacking helpless children\" he said. in an instant the rabbit girl too fell to the ground headless. the knight cleaned and sheathed his blade. then he approached you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"are you kids ok?\" he asked as he helped you up. \"yes thank you...\" you reply. \"sir Justin\" he finishes, \"and what should I call you?\". \"I'm Erik\" you reply then thinking of the imp you say \"and this is Jessica\". \"I am an adventurer just starting my journey when I ran into Jessica, then we were attacked by the rabbit girl.\" you explain. \"if you don't mind me asking, what is a child your age doing being an unarmed adventurer and protecting young women?\" you look to your imp and think that she does look young, barely over 18 if she were human, then you realize you don't have your sword. \"well I have a wooden sword, and is it not an adventurers responsibility to protect the helpless? which by the way sir Justin you are amazing at. would you enlighten a novice like myself on how you got so good?\" you answer then change the subject. \"let me ask you a question, what is the scourge of this land?\" he asks you. \"monster girls!\" you reply a little too excitedly. \"exactly, but what these monster girls don't know is that I am a married man, and trust me I would be in a lot more danger if my wife found out I even thought about doing anything other than killing a monster girl than I would be fighting ten monster girls blindfolded.\" he chuckled a bit at his words then continued, \"my advice is find yourself a lady, one who wont let you get away with anything, and get a real sword\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Justin offers to escort you and your imp to the port. while you know you would be safe doing this, if he found about your imp he would no doubt kill her in an instant. unsure of what to do you begin talking to your imp. \"sorry for calling you Jessica\" you say. \"it's ok, I like the name, I think I'll keep it.\" she said. \"while this Sir Justin is great I am afraid that if we go with him he may kill you.\" you explain. \"Erik you are in charge, I am subservient remember.

Wait no better, I will train you.' exclaims sir Justin. Before you can protest he cuts you off saying he won't take no for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next three days you and Jessica live with sir Justin. You learn how to use a sword better as well as specific weaknesses for certain monster girls. For the first two days you train with sir Justin while Jessica watches and cheers you on. Then at the end of the day Jessica would heal any wounds you received. She is skilled in potions as well as poisons as you find out. On the third day Jessica goes to gather herbs for her potions, and Sir Justin pulls you aside. \"Erik I am not sure if you know this but Jessica is an imp.' he says to you. \"I know,' you reply 'she is bound to me by the monster girls code.' you say before you can stop yourself. \"I have heard of this code and it is a lie' explains sir Justin 'you need to kill her' he commands. \"but she saved my life, has done nothing to harm me since our first fight, I trust her now. Also I broke her wings already.' you explain to sir Justin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica walks in as this is happening and says, 'Erik don't kill me please. Yes I lied about the code, but I mean you no harm. You are the only person to actually have cared about me. That's why you tried to turn down sir Justin. You are my friend, neither of us has to die.' Jessica pleads to you. \"now this is interesting' says sir Justin. \"she may actually care about you, I have heard about this before but it is very rare, and never from something as soulless as an imp.' explained sir Justin. \"I resent that, but yes I care for Erik.' exclaimed Jessica. \"we shall see, tomorrow the three of us shall go monster girl hunting, then we shall see where your loyalties lie' said sir Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day the three of you set out in search of monster girls. The first one you come across is a spider girl. Sir Justin tells you and Jessica to stay back while he handles it. He shouts at the spider girl who turns and motions as if she is about to throw something. Before she can her hand is shot with a crossbow by sir Justin. Angered she charges sir Justin with her hooked staff. He parries her attack and slices off one of her arms. Then taking the offensive he slashes with such force that it cuts the spider girl's staff on half.  She drops it and jumps back. The spider girl shoots a web at sir Justin, but he easily cuts it up with his sword. The spider girl again shot a web, this time instead of cutting it sir Justin threw his sword at his foe. Sir Justin got caught in the web the spider girl got a sword through the head. She fell over dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to help sir Justin free himself from the web but he says he has it, and in one slash of a dagger cuts his way out. Sir Justin walks over to the spider girl and as he pulls his sword out says, 'pathetic'. The flutter of wings could be heard as a swarm of imp flew at you. \"they look nice and tough' one of them says. Sir Justin shoots one through the Head, he hands the crossbow to Jessica and orders her to reload it. \"why should this imp have all the fun?' says one imp as she flies at Jessica. You dray your sword and stab the imp's chest before it reaches her, it falls to the ground dead. \"oh I see the men are both probably fantastic with swords, if you know what I mean, isn't that right imp' taunted one imp. \"what's a matter couldn't even make a simple poison so you gathered a dozen friends to attack a kid?' retorted Jessica. \"well you know what you are a...agjk'' coughed the imp as sir Justin shot it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn imp fly at you, it attacks but you are faster, you dodge and slash its face. Sir Justin cuts two more down. As their numbers dwindle the imp's attempt to seduce you and sir Justin. The most attractive one in the group strikes a pose and says, 'wanna show me how you really work your sword, boy?' she says. You look at her great figure and admire it for a second. Jessica shoots the imp in the head. \"its lines like that that give imp's a bad name' she says. \"ohh someone's jealous,' taunts another imp. \"what makes this boy so special?' she asks. \"why don't you come and find out?' you taunt. This imp fly at you nut you duck under. You stand up behind the imp and stab its back. You turn and see an imp about to attack Jessica back and another about to throw a poison at sir Justin. You have seconds to react.</span></div></div>",

With that thought in mind, you charged at the pile of monster girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, just as you reached them, you were tackled from behind by another Imp. Caught off guard, you dropped your weapon as you were shoved into the mass of bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world suddenly became filled with pleasure. The soft bodies of the imps were pressing against you. Any attempt to push them off just turned into blind groping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, they had managed to completely strip you of your clothing. A pair of Imps were playing with your testicles; kissing, licking, sucking, and nibbling on them to their hearts content. Another had her tail wrapped around your head as she forced your face into her ass; caught up in the moment, you began to lick her anus without a second thought. A fourth Imp had merely grabbed your hand and shoved it into her pussy. And finally, one Imp had wrapped her arms and legs around you and squeezed as hard as she could, pressing her soft breasts against your bare back. Without warning, she thrust her tail up your butt and began to give you anal sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't quite sure what happened after that, as you had sort of blacked out from pleasure overload. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you came to, your wrists had been tied to your elbows and you were hanging from the ceiling of a cave via a rope tied to your forearms. And, of course, you were still naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally an Imp stopped by to give you a blowjob, or feed you. Or both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, you spent the rest of your days being a snack machine for the Imps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>BAD END</b></u></span></div></div>",

I faced the witch queen's personal squad of dragon girls, I was unable to defeat them, for they were skilled and organized and I was nearly killed. the king himself saved my life. with his mighty scepter he slew two dragon girls and attacked the witch. he broke her arm before the dragon girls were able to regroup. in an instant the squad attacked in unison, all striking vital points. the king was dead in an instant, and I had failed as a knight. As the witch queen stood to boast I was able to make my escape, and I vowed to defeat the queen and her dragon girl guards. I realized that no one man could accomplish this task, nor could I allow the Queen's forces to find me. for the past 7 years I have resided on this island training to face the queen and staying under the radar, until now when I am ready to gather my forces. Erik what we are about to do is assemble a team of legends. we will find heroes whose fame reaches far and who's skills are legendary. we will assemble a team, we will train together, and we will fight as one. through this unity we will overcome all that stands before us, Dragon Girls, and the Queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter hearing all of this you were shocked that three days into your quest and you had already allied yourself with a warrior of Sir Justin's caliber. \"where to first sir Justin?\" you ask with enthusiasm. \"the port, I am the strongest on this island, so we must take too the seas in order to find new allies. the queen has conquered more than one kingdom, so we will have many warriors to choose from\" says Sir Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou arrive at the port the next day without a problem, sir Justin goes to find you a ship and commands you and Jessica to go and buy what the two of you will need. where do you go first?</span></div></div>",

You run after him alongside the other men in the front lines. The force of hornet girls had been victorious against the men who had initially fought against the invasion. As the hornet girls prepared to leave with their captured prizes, they heard battle cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sight of a group of men charging at them, some of the hornet girls tried to fly upwards but were met with a hail of arrows. Sir Justin engaged first, driving his lance through one of the hornet girls. Two hornet girls attacked him, one on each side. Sir Justin struck one with the side of his lance, but the other lunged at his unarmed side. The spear struck the knight and bounced off his armor. The surprised hornet girl was struck in the side of the head by Sir Justin\u2019s armored fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now you and the rest of the men had arrived and joined the fighting. A hornet girl rushes you with her spear but you block the attack with your shield.

Many begin to retreat, leaving their paralyzed men behind. You block the attack of another hornet girl and knock the spear from her hand with your sword. You see several hornet girls throw their spears at Sir Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he is unharmed in his armor, his horse is not so well protected. As it his mount is struck by two spears, it topples to the ground, bringing it\u2019s rider along with it.

You just stare, frustrated. For a second you think about just leaving her here to be eaten by some wild animal<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A wave of empathy washes over you. She is no different than a unconscious girl now. A off red, very demon-like girl, but still a girl. Just as you think about how to stop her from harming people, a idea pops into your head.</span></div></div>",

The evil Witch was successful in killing the King, and crowned herself the new queen of Asun. Since that day, many adventurers and warriors have taken up arms against the evil Witch Queen and her army of Monster Girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are one such Hero.

Keep it readable.<br>\r\n2.<i> No one liners.</i> Seriously, I don't want this to be one of those stories where there is like ten chapters where nothing happens because they where all devoted to one decision. No \"X or or something else.\" \"Then how about Y, or something else\" stuff.<br>\r\n2b. I will except one liners like \"Take a look around town\" where it was clarifying something and all options are guaranteed to move the story along.<br>\r\n3. All battles with a Monster Girl must have at least one Bad End.<br>\r\n</td>",
