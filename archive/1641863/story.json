Lightning flashes, revealing two men ten steps from each other, each pointing pistols at the other's head, not flinching or moving. One wears the dark blue uniform of a police officer, and has a short beard and mustache, in a respectable manner, neatly trimmed, with a hat that has a badge saying, \"New York City Police Officer Eighth Precinct.\" The other wears a dark black outfit, with a ski mask covering most of his face, except his mouth and eyes. However, the thing that is the same is their eyes, those cold grey eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the end for you Robert,\" the officer says. \"Turn yourself in, and I'll see to it that the Judge gives you a light sentence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you could go to Hell Billy,\" the masked man shouts back. \"You and father both belong there anyways. You never helped me after he left us. You were too busy playing hero to even help me get a place to stay after I put my house up and lost it when he skipped town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what about me?\" the officer shouts. \"Because of you, Internal Affairs has been investigating me every time you pull off one of your heists!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's what you get, when you have a thief for a brother,\" the masked man said, as he took his mask off, revealing is face to be the same as the police officer's. The only difference was that his face was clean shaven. \"And life hasn't been peaches and cream for me. Do you know how hard it is to build a reputation as a thief with you for a brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the sounds of sirens are heard, followed by another familiar sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like my ride is here,\" the thief says, as he runs to the edge of the roof they'd been on and jumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the officer runs, expecting to see his brother's body on the sidewalk more than a hundred feet down. However, much to his surprise, a helicopter comes up over the edge, with his brother hanging onto a rope ladder, just looking at him with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you around Billy,\" he said, giving him a mocking salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" the officer said, lowering his pistol as he watch the helicopter fly away. \"See you around Robert.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By the time the police got to the scene most of the place had been emptied, with the exception of Robert himself. The responding officers engaged him, chasing him to the roof, where it is said that the thief jumped off of the roof and caught a rope ladder on a helicopter that was being piloted by members of his gang, and took off. Coincidentally, the thief\u2019s brother was, like usually, the first responding officer along with his partner. When asked for details, here is what he had to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, a TV screen turns on, revealing Officer William entering the precinct, surrounded by a sea of reporters saying, \"No Comment.\" to all of their questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I thought that me and my siblings didn't get along,\" the woman said. \"Now, let's go to Joe with the weather. Joe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, a TV turns off, a remote in the hands of an older man. He looks at two officers sitting in some chairs across from his desk, his eyes having a look of anger in them, especially towards the officer with grey eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the third place your brother has robbed this week,\" he says. \"And, once again, you've failed to capture him. You seem to catch everyone else but him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my fault that he seems to be one step ahead of me at times,\" Officer William said. \"It was like this when we were kids as well, when we played games of Hide-and-Seek and Cops-and-Robbers; we seemed have problems outwitting each other, as we do think alike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you better catch him soon,\" the superior officer said. \"Otherwise the FBI will be called in, and you know how they work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to remind me,\" William said, standing up and getting his hat. \"Though they ought to be glad that Robert pulled that heist on them, as they were able to catch that terrorist cell when they tried to steal the substance themselves, after he'd stolen it in the first place. Also, and you have to remember, he did return the item.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but stealing weapons-grade Plutonium is a serious crime. It got him in the Federal database because of it,\" the superior officer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just increased his reputation, especially since very few people know that he returned it,\" William said, as he left the officer, with his partner, a young redhead, following him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like this Lorin,\" William said, as he turned on the engine. \"Me and Robert are twin brothers, and as a result we happen to have that Twinepathy, you know, telepathy for twins. We think the same way. That's why I can figure out how he does his crimes. Conversely, he uses it to figure out how I'll try to capture him and his men. As a result, it's been like a complicated game of chess between me and him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever gotten close to him?\" Lorin asked, as William drove their car out of the lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, dozens of times,\" William said. \"But each time he has a trick up his sleeve, like that helicopter from last night, or something more important comes up, in which someone's life is in danger, and I'm forced to let him get away in order to save that person's life. Funny thing is, he tends to help me out in such situations. Remember that fire at that apartment last month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Lorin said. \"I remember that. Electrical fire right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That it was,\" William said. \"But there is something that wasn't in the reports, Robert was there. Just as I was opening the last door, a beam fell and would of crushed me, if he and one of his men hadn't been there and held up that beam, giving me enough time to open up the door, enter the room, and get the child that was in it, and get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like he cares for you on some level,\" Lorin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" William said, as the radio came to life.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But it wasn't just any officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sergeant Harrison,\" he said, in a shocked voice. \"It can't be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man had been like a mentor to him through the tough times, giving him tips on collaring criminals, how to become a good shot, becoming a better fighter, every thing. To see the Ambulance drivers pick him up and put him on the gurney was something he never saw coming. He'd been like a father to him after his skipped town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" he asked, looking at the man's partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked at him, his eyes colder than Hell, and said, \"Your brother did this, Officer William Smith. Robert and his crew were coming out of an apartment when we spotted them. We gave chase, and the group split up, your brother and some redhead going one way, and the rest going another. Sergeant Harrison followed your brother and the redhead, and I went after the others. I heard shots, so I doubled back and saw your brother over the body, his gun drawn. I told him to freeze, but he took off, like the little coward he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, William felt his hand clench. As much as he hated his brother, he'd be damned before he just let someone insult Robert. He wanted to punch the officer, but that could get him suspended, meaning that he'd be unable to work the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, William looked at the scene, and said, \"Robert didn't do it. Killing isn't his style. Someone else did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't here,\" the officer said. \"You didn't see him standing there with a smoking gun. If he didn't do it, who did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be anyone,\" William said. \"Both me and him have made a lot of enemies, me because I'm a highly successful police officer who has arrested numerous criminals, and him because he's a highly successful thief. Hell, because of Robert, we've been able to investigate numerous high profile criminals since their place was an active crime scene, as he'd steal something from them and drop it off at the precinct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you know that your brother didn't pull the trigger?\" the officer asked. \"Oh wait, Twinepathy right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it was because my brother respected him as a person,\" William said, as he looked at the body. \"If anything, he was trying to protect him, and keep him alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why would he run if he didn't do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same reason that anyone who was wanted for a crime would run, no one would have believed him,\" William said, looking back at the officer. \"In fact, he might have seen who really did it. Also, that person might be someone powerful, or answer to someone powerful. Harrison told me a few things, that he was investigating someone high up on the force. Who\u2019s to say that Harrison was shot by that person or one of their men, and Robert was in the wrong place at the wrong time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you implying that I shot Harrison and tried to frame your brother?\" the officer asked with a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I wasn't implying that, though it is a possibility. You and Harrison were always arguing over how to capture criminals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" the officer said, turning to look at the body. \"Though you better catch him before I do. He's going to pay for what he\u2019s done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, William went to his place. It was an apartment room; all that he could get on his salary.

I told Lessa to keep running, and I turned and fired in the direction of the shot. Another shot came, and it would have hit me if Harrison hadn't pushed me out of the way, and took it in the chest. I was able to drag him behind a car, but the guy kept firing. Those bullets tore through that car like a knife through soft butter, and they were close, just missing me and him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get a look at the guy?\" William asked, as he took a look at his brother's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Robert said, as he sat down. \"All that I could tell was that he was white and had a scar on the side of his head. Also, from the way that he was shooting, he was sniper trained at any rate. Don't know if it was police or military, but he has connections to someone with armor piercing rounds. The guy stopped shooting just before that other cop showed up, but by then, it was no good. He'd lost too much blood, and died before I left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he say anything before he died?\" William asked, wanting to know if Harrison left a clue as to the identity to his killer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he told me to tell you to not trust anyone on the force,\" Robert said, with a weak chuckle. \"Ironic, a cop telling a thief to tell a cop to not trust other cops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you going to do Robert?\" William asked. \"By this time tomorrow your picture will be on every News station, and this time it won't be for a robbery or a heist like it usually is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't turn myself in, that's for sure.

Hardly any of them would believe me when I said that you could not have done it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a surprise to me,\" Robert said, as he walked to the window. \"After all, I'm listed as a cop killer in their minds, and given the fact that you and me are twins, it would be logical that you and me are, in a sence, one and the same. After all, we do think alike, as much as we both try to denigh it. I can figure out how you will try to capture me, and you can figure out how I robbed a place without even looking at the footage of the robbery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be careful Robert,\" William said. \"And don't get yourself shot again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just find the guys that had me framed,\" Robert said, as he climbed out the window. \"And when you do, give me five minutes alone with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me both,\" William said, as he watched Robert vanish into the night. \"You and me both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, William, went to his room, and tried to get some sleep. However, he kept seeing himself running from Harrison, then his arm hurting, then turning around to fire at someone in an apartment, followed by Harrison pushing him out of the way, watching as the older officer's chest erupted in a fountain of blood, and then falling down into the pavement. He could hear himself screaming out \"No!\"and then more bullets wizzing past his head, as Harrison's partner came after him. Then, he'd woke up in a cold sweet. He'd been seeing what Robert saw and felt, and not for the first time. It was something that the two of them had shared since they were children, in that they had dreams about what the other had seen that day. In a way, it was how they kept track of each other, and why William always had trouble trying to catch Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robert,\" he thought. \"Whatever happens to you, be careful.\"</span></div></div>",

He knew it all. However, he was looking over it, to see if he missed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he took a look at the evidence that had been gathered from Harrison's murder, fingerprints on the shoulder of the officer's uniform, pictures of scuff marks, and of course, the bullet holes in the uniform.

He could see himself shooting into the window of an apartment building, across from where Harrison had been shot.

However, William only saw the others, especially Harrison's partner. The man had a look that said, \"Your brother's going to pay.\" With a heavy sigh, the cop went to the garage, to go out on patrol, and to clear his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to his car, William stopped and got out his keys.

They'd been working on this particular heist for months now, trying to find the right angle. Thankfully, Angela came through with an inside guy just two weeks earlier. Finally, they had the intel they needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert rolled the blue prints out on the table as he spoke. \"As you all know, the museum has a Hammer1000 alarm.\" A hush filled the room. As thieves, Robert's gang held an almost reverence for the state-of-the-art technology. It had yet to be breached by anyone in their network, or anywhere, for all they knew. \"Angela, here, is gonna walk us through it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young woman with captivating green eyes and long, dark red hair stepped forward, shifting the thick strands over her shoulder before leaning over the table. Her voice was deep and sensual, pouring out into the silent room. \"Every entrance is linked to the alarm.\" She indicated the seven entrances. \"And every window and display as well. Once activated, the alarm notifies the local authorities and museum security. It is absolutely critical that we not do this.\" She looked to each man in turn, as though searching the faces of kindergarten students for comprehension. Seemingly satisfied, she continued, \"There are three ways around the alarms: First, the code, which has been benevolently provided to us by a friend for a nominal fee.\" She picked up a pack of cigarettes and placed one in her mouth. \"Second, the alarms can be disarmed. As it cannot be hacked, this service, too, is provided by a friend, giving it a small disadvantage.\" Robert lit a match and held it toward her, shielding it with his free hand. She leaned in to light her cigarette, smiling at him intimately before turning back to the gang. \"We can do this once and only for 60 seconds. Third, we can do it the old fashioned way: jump the on-duty guard on his smoke break and follow him in. This provides some obvious complications, which is why it remains at the bottom of the list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep drag on her cigarette, closing her eyes as she inhaled deeply. \"This brings me to our next concern: security cameras. Gigi can put them in a loop, so that our presence will be undetected.\" She stated, referring to their resident techi. \"But this will only work for a short amount of time. The guards are trained to recognize this and it will be a matter of minutes before they do.\" She puffed on her cigarette, again scanning her audience for comprehension. \"This has to be an in and out job guys.\" She said authoritatively. \"No fuck ups.\" She added, her green eyes sparking with menace. She held the gaze to see every man nod assent and pulled a pen from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her cigarette precariously between her lips, she uncorked the pen. \"This is the game plan.\"</span></div></div>",

Turns out she worked hard time, big bucks - Moscow mafia reject. Reject again being the key word, she hid out with this rag-tag band of thieves for a cover. He congratulated her, and frowned, too. The only annoying things about her were the lack of height and the cheesy lines cut and pasted from gangster films. It got old, fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you find, Ivana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice of Bones. Grave digging aficionado, which landed him in a sticky place at med school. He stole the autopsy corpse straight out of the grounds at St. Muriel's next door. Luckily, no one found out except Robert, who happened to be on his way to steal something out of the very school. Robert trusted Bones, Bones trusted Robert; a mutual relationship built on fear of revealing the other. Come to think of it, Bones was probably a necrophiliac, too. He liked to imagine the people they'd lay waste to in a heist, not realizing that such was the complete opposite of their goals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also had a penchant for bugging Robert; mostly, this involved his obvious infatuation with the otherwise cold Ivana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one. Granny's house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny's house? Thought we'd agreed, no more old biddies,\" Robert chuckled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only, this granny happens to be an ambassador. And the house, of course, is public relations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside, big old crown. Hunks of ice worth more than most of these guys' necks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA communal gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds big, but I'm not so sure,\" Robert sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd get you that nice house and white picket fence you've always dreamed of, boss,\" Ivana sarcastically imitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, Robert waxed on sometimes about how he missed his nice four-bedroom suite, but teasing him about it? That crossed the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, boss, she was only trying to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bones, you too. OUTTA MY SIGHT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hollered, and the two skittered like cockroaches. Most everyone else left, too. Except that redhead. What was her name again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're real scary, Mr. Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouldn't have been more than twenty, sweet young thing. He wasn't much older (twenty-eight now). Cute red curls, just bobbing in mid-air. He resisted the urge most days to jostle them, toy with them. And those baby blues? He had to be dreaming, just to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Smith, can I come along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer girlish charms almost swayed him, but he refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A robbery isn't a place for a girl like you. Now, on the other hand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he sank to her again, resting on the couch. She giggled as he kissed her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My couch is a mighty fine place this time of day. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sparkling eyes lit that fire in his spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Mr. Smith. I'm just a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat adorable laughter! He had to...</span></div></div>",

He gently turned away from the red-head, both of them only clothed in his rain-jacket.

That's-- great, William.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert choked back something like a tear. Why was he crying? It was just his brother...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica, Robert's old girlfriend from their high school days. Started dating William when he became a cop. Treated him like crap. Now, he was going to move in with her? Something in Robert's brain broke a fuse. His brother had snapped a few wires, unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Billy, do you need a place to stay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"----------\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Billy, I know it seems bad, but we've got a nice place here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if I'm recognized, huh? If I compromise you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert couldn't hear him for the next few seconds, but he knew what happened off the phone. Sobs. William, devastated. His instinct told him to worry about his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to come over here now, William.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robert, you're sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it. I need to talk to you. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"------- Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hung up. Time to get prepared for the visit. Hastily, he woke up the red-head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, yeah, I'm gonna need you to get off my couch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Robbie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clung to his shirt; venom sparked from his eyes.

Bones never did business behind her back, but now he'd gotten some unknown wayward to lead up the biggest catch of her career? He knew she worked on a bounty-by-bounty basis, and assistance only meant splitting costs. She didn't mind if it was Bones; the poor boy followed her like a dog. Nowadays, that dog's leash was getting pretty lax... However, if Bones's little plan acted out accordingly, she'd be plenty willing to divide the shares. After all, it wasn't every day you get to wrangle a crooked crook. Especially not your boss...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done. Let's make sure the bastard's still out cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smoky air permeated Bones' normal scent. Ivana took a few deep breaths of him, and he shared a couple of hers.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">They say that siblings tend to think alike, especially when they are twins. Twin brothers William and Robert Smith would disagree with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam Smith is a police officer, with over five years on the force. He has earned plenty of medals for his bravery and valor in the line of duty, even going as far as taking a bullet that was meant for his partner, just barely surviving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert Smith, on the other hand, is an expert thief, and has robbed so many places, that it is easier to say what he hasn't stolen and so far that's, candy from a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them have squared off on numerous occasions, each trying to outwit the other, which is very hard, considering the fact that they can think the same way. Many of their encounters have ended in stand offs, until backup arrived, forcing Robert to flee, or William lowering his pistol, and walking away, letting his brother escape, as no matter what the other did, they were still brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing that they'd agree on is their shared hatred for their father. The man had been arrested for Tax Evasion, and his sons had put William's chances for promotion and Robert's house up for collateral, so that their father could be free until the trial. However, the man skipped town, leaving William stuck as a patrolman, and forcing Robert to turn to thievery to make ends meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when one is framed for a crime he didn't commit, the other goes undercover, to find out who did it, and clear his brother of the deed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is, Who is framed, and why, and who really did it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The brothers can't kill each other, though they sure can argue and fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The brothers are between the ages of 25 and 30 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. William tries to go by the book, while Robert does whatever it takes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Both of them are expert fighters, capable of using any weapon that comes to hand, and are experts in one style of Martial Arts or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. They do think alike, and have that twin \"telepathy\" of sorts, in which they can tell what the other is thinking, as well as how they did something, such as William figuring out how Robert robbed a place, and Robert knowing how William will try to catch him and his men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Sex is allowed, and both of them could have female partners in their respective professions.</td>",
