            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One day Elizabeth received a phone call from someone very anonymous that said she should go to Planet X on January 3, 2012. She could not decide what to do and why someone would give her this anonymous tip. What was wrong with this picture? Things were very strange in the place she lived. There was talk of extinction of animals. The world was about to end. Elizabeth was a tall blonde who loved to write. She had taken local classes at her college for writing. She had always been a natural writer so she decided she would pick up her pen and write a story. Before doing that, she decided to write her friend Danielle a letter and her friend Danny a letter also. Danny was a superstar. Well, he thought anyway. He lived in a trailer and was in a band. He loved to travel. He was from her hometown. Lately, they had gotten very close. She wondered if they were going to become romantic. <br>\r\nDanny and her loved to explore places together and were even thinking of becoming investigative reporters. That is, if Danny's singing career did not pan out. Danny was a very sweet soul. He loved to play electric guitar and his rock mates were Jackson, a tall red head with a thin body who played the drums, Tiler who was the back up singer, and Connie who was the bass guitarist. They were sometimes conflicted by their friendships. They all did not get along well but that was how things were in this world. No one got along much. People seemed to be very tense lately. <br>\r\nThings were not the same between them. Danny decided that if things did not get better, he would simply leave the band. He was a tall, fair, dark-haired guy with blue eyes that were a baby blue color. <br>\r\nHer investigative skills made her want to call Danny and ask why he was so upset lately with things. He had been very close to drinking a lot, partying to the point of taking pills, and swallowing them all down. He seemed somewhat troubled. <br>\r\nAnyway, looking out the window, she felt that there was a lot of turmoil in the whole environment. The sun was so bright that there were sunspots on it. She noticed strange things happening with radios and the sun was just too bright lately. She took pictures of everything. Everything just was messed up. The planet seemed to be in danger. <br>\r\nShe looked in her closet. Would she leave soon for Planet X and how would she get there. <br>\r\nThings were strange alright. She decided to leave the very next morning to ask around what the heck was going on with this planet and why? Things were just not right at all.<br>\r\nShe decided to look into her little town of Hallworth. It was a small place in Georgia. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
