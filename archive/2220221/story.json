There was just something about her, but you couldn't put your finger on it. Man. I wish I could meet her for real. You said. You binge watch a few more episodes until your eye lids get heavy and you go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning came, you awoke with sunlight shining directly on you. Ugh..... You said getting up. You rub your eyes and get up. You take a few steps when you notice the ground beneath you felt odd. It wasn't soft carpet, but hard wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing that gets you was that you heard the sound of seagulls cawing, and a vastness of water. I'm.....on a boat? But how did I get here? You said. You were racking your brain when you saw a few feet from you a lounging chair with someone in it. A person with jet black hair in a purple bikini. She's sunbathing. But what really caught your attention was how huge she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nT....that's Nico Robin...! What is she.....? Wait. If Robin is here, then that means i'm on the Merry! You said. You gave yourself a quick pinch to make sure you are not dreaming. You weren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm....really on the Merry. And that's really Nico Robin. And she's huge. Or I'm just tiny. How the hell did this happen? You said. You look for the answer to that later. Right now, you need to get Robin's attention, so you......</span></div></div>",

When you get there, you catch your breathe then look at the marvelously long leg. You give them a good feel and they are a soft and smooth as you thought. You then scale up the leg to get to the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reached the top of her leg, look at the sight before you. I still have a long way to go. You said. You begin your trek across Robin's massive body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good while, you came to her stomach area. You could hear the sounds of her stomach rumbling. As if still in the process of digesting a meal. You shake off the terrible feeling you had and continue your journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then came up to her huge breasts. You couldn't believe what you were about to do. You were filled with both joy and terror as if she found you there, she'd think you're a pervert. Or crush you between them. Or both. You pray that if she finds you there, she lets you explain yourself. You then worm your way through her valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were almost out when the two walls of flesh press against you, trapping you between them. Oh, no....! You said. The two orbs of flesh mash you a few times. And you heard giggling following each press. Then you saw two fingers coming in for you. They grab you and pull you out and drop you onto a soft surface that is  her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the massive smiling face of hers. Your knees were shaking but you didn't know if it was out of fear or seeing her beauty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, what do we have here? A tiny, pervert stowaway. She said with a giggle. You couldn't respond back. Here you are in the hands of your favorite anime character and you can't say a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was enjoying herself a midday sun bathe when she had feel something crawling on her leg. At first, she thought it was Sanji being his love struck self again and nuzzling her leg, but it kept moving upwards to her stomach and chest. She then knew it couldn't have been Sanji as he knows better to touch her there. So she figured it was a bug crawling on her. She'd was going to swat it away when it when between her breast. She could have easily crushed it there, but didn't want to clean it off her. So she trapped it and reached for it, but it wasn't a bug. It was a tiny man crawling his way through her cleavage. She already has so many questions she wanted to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo little man....  How'd you get on our ship? She said. I.... I.... You said, still transfixed by her beauty. Aw, Cat got your tongue? I won't bite you. She said, smiling.  I.....don't know. You said, finding your voice. Really? No idea how you got here? She said. None. I just went to sleep and....woke up here. You said. That sounds a bit far fetched to believe. She said. But it's true! I went to bed at night and woke up here. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs good as it would be to know how you got here, she was more interested in how you got so small. Ok.... Let's say I believe that. What kind of devil fruit did you eat to become like this? She said. Devil fruit.....? I didn't eat any of that. You said. You didn't? She said, surprised. How else would this happen to you? She said. I don't know. I just woke up like this. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo let me get this right. You woke up on our ship like this and have no idea how it happened? She said. Pretty much. You said. You have to admit, it sounds really out there. She said. I know it's hard to believe, but it's true. I mean, you really think i'd shrink myself and hide away on a ship filled with pirates? You said. Crazier things have happen. She said. She's right. With all the straw hats have been through, it wouldn't be that hard to believe someone would do this at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know it sounds crazy, but it true. You said. Robin looks at you closely, looking for any hint of lying. .....Ok. I believe you. She said. Thank you. You said in relief. So will you help me? You said.</span></div></div>",

You said, catching yourself. Robin. Nico Robin. What yours? Or will little man work? She said with a giggle as she rubs your back. This was one of the many reasons you liked her. She was nice and knew how to make light of a situation. M....my name is.... Uh.... You said. Don't tell me you forgot your name? She said. I haven't. I just....can't remember it right now for some reason. You said. Robin just giggles as she knows what's going on. The same with Sanji. Just you aren't falling over yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, until you can tell me, i'll call you little one. She said. She can call you mud and you'd be fine with it. Sure.... You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo little one, the next city is still a few miles away. How about keeping a lady company until then? She said. Y-yeah! You said quickly. Someone eager. She said. Robin then lowers you between her breast. Your eyes go wide as you look up at Robin smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you were there when I found you, no better place to keep you. She said. Robin lays down with her hands behind her head and continues her sun bathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile basking in the sun rays, Robin had a flurry of thoughts past through her. She was going to help you, no doubt about it. But she couldn't help but think of the things she could do with you. Play with you, rubbing her feet, \"Unintentionally\" sit or step on you, teasing you with her body.... She was thinking of it all and it made her smile widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was enjoying herself, you were still in shocked over being put between her breast. Sure, you where here before, but now she knows about you. You move your hand and squeeze the fleshy mound. It's....just as soft as it looks. You said. You do it again and press up against the soft flesh, which made Robin giggle from feeling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy stop with just grabbing? You can have more fun here, and you doubt Robin would say anything.</span></div></div>",

When you got close, you were grabbed by a disembodied arm. You were surprised at first, but remembered that was her devil fruit power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand rubs your head with its index finger and put you back down on Robin's stomach. It then pointed to Robin's head. You quickly try to run into the panties, but are grabbed by the hand again. Another arm forms and wags its finger at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't blame a guy for trying, right?\" You said, smiling. This time, it rubs you under your chin before it puts you down. Defeated, you head to Robin's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get back to her breast, you think she might trap you again. So you climb up her left breast and sit in the center. When she looks at you, she can't help but laugh a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun, are we?\" She said, grabbing you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What else is a guy suppose to do? A once in a life opportunity.\" You said, smiling at her. Which got a chuckle out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think I found someone worst than Sanji.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm cuter than him, right? I don't trip over myself when I see you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... I'll give you a 7. Your small body is just too cute.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Why not a ten if i'm too cute?\" You said, a little upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't want you getting an ego with that small body.\" She said while sitting up and rubbing you. Robin just couldn't stop with rubbing you. It was like she had said. You were just too cute for her. In fact, she wanted to do more than just pet you. She wants to hug you tightly, nuzzle you when either of you are tired, give you long, passion filled kisses. But she couldn't just yet thinking coming on too hard too quick would creep you out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So little one. How about you tell me a little about yourself? She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to. After you tell me a little about yourself first. As of ladies first.\" You said, trying to be smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe! Don't know if you're being a gentleman or a player, but I'll play along. I'm Nico Robin. Archaeologist of the Straw Hat. pirates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou already know everything about her, but you'll play stupid for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pirate? You? But you're way too nice and beautiful for that.\" You said, making her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks are deceiving. I'm not called the Devil's child for nothing.\" She said, with a little pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on. A beautiful lady like you wouldn't hurt a fly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't seen me in action yet. Don't let the cute face fool you, little one. It might be the last thing you see.\" She said, smiling. She doesn't have to tell you. You already know how skilled and dangerous she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin goes on to tell you some more abut her life and you do the same without getting lost in her beauty.this time. Although, your story wasn't as hardly as interesting as hers, she was excited to hear what you had to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were done, Robin had stood up with you in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to stay out here longer with you, but let's not risk getting sunburn. Plus, you must be.....</span></div></div>",

She makes her way to the kitchen which was empty so she didn't have to hide you. She puts you on the table and grabs an apple and cuts small pieces for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" You said biting into it. Robin giggle watching you eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, little one. I told you a little about me, yet I hardly know anything about you.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not as interesting as yours. I don't have a fancy nickname. You'd only be bored to death.\" You said. You couldn't tell her the truth about what happened to you. So you try to brush it away, but this seems to make her even more interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so modest. There has to be a story about your size. Maybe a devil fruit?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....You wouldn't go hunting for it if there was a devil fruit like that and then use it on people?\" You said a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" She said, smiling. \"It's only fair I know a little bit about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know she won't let up about this so you're going to have to give her something. You couldn't tell her the truth as it would sound crazy. Even though crazy things happen often here, you telling her you've been shrunken and transported here would be too crazy to believe. So you quickly think up a lie to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. My name is (your name) I'm....from a far away island village.\" You said, hoping she'd buy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? An island village? Is everyone there tiny like you?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. We're all the same height. More or less. They are really nice people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you doing so far away from them?\" She questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've always wanted to see what was out there on the ocean. So I built a boat and sailed off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is that how you came across our ship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I was at sea for days until I came across your ship. I knew it would be dangerous to board a ship not knowing who's on it, but I was out of food and desperate. So I climbed aboard.\" You said. It's not the most well thought out lie, but it' the best you could do on short notice. You hope she buys it when you see her finger comes towards you and rubs your head and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a brave tiny person. Venturing out onto the sea all by himself.\" She said, making you turn lightly red. Robin lets out a giggle seeing you like this. \"Would you like to go back to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take you back if you want. I just have to talk to our navigator and we can have you home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I don't want to go back. I was kind of an outcast among them. I'm way better off with you. Besides, I don't think you would give me up if you could.\" You said. Robin laughs a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true. You are too cute to just give up. And since you want to stay with me, I guess that makes you a member of the Straw hats now. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-me? A straw hat pirate?\" You said stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, secret member. I don't know how the others will take to you. Except Nami. She'll probably enslave you or something like that.\" She said. She's right. You know Nami's personality and she will probably just use you for her own amusement. But still a member of the Straw hats? Even you didn't see this coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't know what to say. I don't know how I'll be able to do any of the things the rest of your crew can do.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep being cute.\" She said, rubbing your head gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can manage that.\" You said. Robin smiles wide as she give you another cut apple piece. She was happy that you wanted to stay, albeit in secret. Still, having you around would be fun. As long as she doesn't overload on how cute you are.</span></div></div>",
