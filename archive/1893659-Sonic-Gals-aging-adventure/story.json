After the aftermath of Naugus almost taking control of the kingdom (Authors note: Does not know final outcome) it seemed that she was in need to relax for a bit. So, Cream decided to take Cheese and go the flower patch near the village to pick flowers for her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And one for you, and one for you...and two for you. Hee-hee\", Cream giggled as she prepared several bouquets for her friends and family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cheese flew over her head, depositing several lilies on to her head. Giggling at her friends intention, Cream looked at Cheese with a bit of disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Cheese. We can't use these. They are for those whom are morning the loss of loved ones\", Cream said while waggling her finger at the chao, \"Try getting some more tulips instead. Mom really likes those\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheese nodded in assent and flew off in pursuit of the flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours, they had gathered several lovely bouquets and were on their way back to the village when she felt her foot connect with a rock, causing her to trip and fall, scattering the flowers every which-way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Cream cried, \"And we worked so hard on those. 'Sigh'. C'mon Cheese. Let's gather them up\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gathering the flowers, Cream happened to look at the object she had tripped on. It turned out there were but two of them. And they suspiciously looked like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chaos emeralds?\" Cream asked picking the rocks up with ease. Sure enough, both crystals had the same shape of the emeralds that the kingdom had known for years; one green, the other ruby red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I can't wait to show this to Mr. Sonic!\" Cream said cheerfully, \"He's going to be so surprised!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she frowned, staring at the flowers, \"Oh, but if I take too long the flowers will wilt\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheese seemed to understand the problem and gave Cream the according answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. We'll take the flowers first to everyone, then we can go see Mr. Sonic. Thank you, Cheese!\" Cream said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, both of them went off into the village, flowers and stones in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who to visit first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was most distraught when she had joined team Fighters, but was glad Cream had little participation and merely helped guide the citizen's to safety. As soon as she had gotten home to the hut Nicole had built them, she promptly went to the closet to pull out several vases and placed each of bouquets in them, filling them with enough water to keep them healthy. Then, she grabbed the vase with daisies and called out, \"Mom? Are you in here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing replied but a faint echo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream searched the entire house till she noticed a small note in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone out to grocers today. Out of milk and carrots. Make sure the house stays tidy till I get back. If you have any problems, contact Amy right away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, she's not going to be back for a while, Cream thought, her ears drooping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least I can deliver the flowers to everyone else\" Cream said, \"And I should still have enough time to tend to the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream joyfully grabbed several vases, while Cheese grabbed one, and both left the house, leaving the two emeralds on the counter where they glowed ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHO IS AFFECTED FIRST?</span></div></div>",

Slightly disappointed, but knowing that grocery shopping was a long process, Cream set the daisies down on the kitchen counter and proceeded to play with Cheese. They skipped in the living room, played tea with some of Cream's dolls and even tried their hands at a war re-enactment (of course, the opposition won, but that's not either here nor there).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished with their game, and her mother still not home, Cream suddenly remembered the gems she had wanted to show Sonic.

Then, her glove fell off her right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream, seeing the item in question fall, stared at her other hand. The glove was seemingly larger than she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...shwinking?\" Cream asked, then was surprised as to her own speech impediment.

Cream looked just as her clothes snapped and broke, revealing a naked teenaged Cream in front of herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n\"Wha...I'm...older?\" Cream asked, looking at herself and turning to inspect.

The realization that laughter had punctuated the air caused her to turn around when she saw Dr. Robotnik floating in his hover craft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Why if it isn't Cream? I haven't seen you since...well, the last olympics games? How are you dear?\" The doctor said, in his most evil yet sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...um...um...\" Cream said, her eyes going wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot paying attention, the doctor stared at his gloves for a minute, then said, \"Well, that's nice...NOW HAND OVER THOSE EMERALDS OR I'LL-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAAAAH!!!\" Cream cried, throwing both the flowers and the emeralds into the air. The doctor, using an arm attachment on his craft, caught the emeralds nimbly and flew off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...to analyze these crystals before the blasted hedgehog gives me any more trouble...\" Robotnik said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*minutes later*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobotnik had continued to analyze the gems, his two lackeys, orb-bot and cub-bot, standing behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHA! These aren't chaos emeralds! They're energy power is far too insufficient to be linked to them\", the doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A brilliant deduction as normally sir, but if they're not the emeralds we were looking for...then what are they?\" Orb-bot asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Costume jewelry? Rock candy...Ooh! I love me some of that there rock candy. Gives me glitches, but boy-oh-boy does it taste-\" Cub-bot said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence! There is only one way to properly test this out\", Robotnik said, 'Snively, report to my office in 30 mins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*30 mins later*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnively entered the door, wondering what his uncle would have needed for him now, \"You called, Dr Robotnik?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I did, nephew!\" Robotnik cried and pushed the green button on his latest device: a gun with two chambers on the sides with one stone in each, and two modes of fire, according to the doctors schematics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnively gave a cry of fear as the green bolt hit him. The next thing anybody knew, where Snively once stood, there was in his place a small ugly baby with clothes strewn about him. Looking up at the doctor, the infant proceeded to cry at the strange man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHA! Do you know what this means?\" Dr. Robotnik asked his lackeys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...that we're going to need a nursery in the Death Egg?\" Cub-bot asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fool! We're going to finally stop that miserable blue pest once and for all! By altering the reality we live in, causing all of him and his pesky friends to turn into elderly people, allowing me the easiest point of conquering the entire planet! NOTHING CAN STOP ME NOW!!!!\" The doctor cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel a sudden case of deja vu. Doctor, if you'll permit me, the hedgehog is too fast! How will we plan to catch him? And for that matter, it's worked fine on your nephew, but how will we know it will work on a mobian?\" Orb-bot implored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobotnik thought on those words, \"Hmm...maybe you're right. This would be a too delicate procedure to botch up too soon. What shall I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yuri and hetero, however, is excepted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only transformations involved in this story should be limited to Age regression and Progression. This can be done by either clothing (morphing into something older or younger [though you can leave them unchanged and have them busting or falling out of them]), physical gain or loss, and mental programming. Also you can start off with the characters having a diaper thing, I don't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory pages should at least have some plot to them, so no simple sentences.
