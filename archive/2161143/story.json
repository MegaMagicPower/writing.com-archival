With a deafening rumble like thunder another cityscape was reduced to dust, the tortured screams of unaccountable thousands echoing across the landscape. From the point of impact, a tidal wave of pressurized dust and debris swept outwards in all directions, smashing down any surviving structures in its wake for miles around in every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoaringly high above the shattered remains of the ruined principality towered an object of such immense size it was unperceivable to the tiny handful of battered survivors who found themselves closest to it. At best they could perceive two vast mountains of obsidian black rock towering above the horizon, though they had no idea that what they saw were merely the twin tips of something much more massive. Those further away who had the benefit of distance and scale could see the massive construct for what it truly was, the dual toes of a gigantic boot, armoured yet distinctly feminine, and unmistakably alien. A second boot, identical to the first was poised across the river that marked the boundary of that particular territorial district, the smouldering ruins of a once prosperous trading town strewn around it. From the base of each foot soared an almost metallic cylinder like tower of silver and black, each of which gave way to the outline of a colossal and shapely thigh wrapped in synthetic black webbing and cloth several thousand meters above. Dizzyingly high above the skyline, elaborately curved and interlocking plates of metallic silver combined with a synthetic bodysuit drawn tightly over corded muscles and flesh, forming the silhouette of a gigantic alien woman clad in a suit of distinctly extra-terrestrial environmental armour. Her face was hidden behind a reflective half oval faceplate, whilst a vast cowl covered the metallic helmet that enclosed the head behind her mask, the hood reaching down to the woman's shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess was truly monolithic in stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic Quarian paused, the gauntlets of her colossal three fingered hands resting atop her hips as she surveyed the land below, the crushed out remains of the towns and cities she had already visited that morning splotched out as tiny imperfections to the rolling hills and plains of this world. Sunlight from a distant star glanced off her breastplate and helm as the alien woman cast her eyes over the sprawling landscape, her featureless mask bereft of any emotion as all around her, the world burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall arms and cannon fire shrieked upwards at the giantess from seemingly every direction, the explosive shells and projectiles disintegrating harmlessly against her cyclonic energy shielding. Blue lighting continued to crackle and spit around her, the tiny humanoids who still found themselves closest to her shrieking as the electrical discharge of her shielding lashed out, vaporizing them to ash. Almost by subconscious afterthought the woman\u2019s hand strayed to the pistol at her hip, her gloved forefinger deftly brushing over the trigger before she thought better of it. Nothing on this world could harm her, and it would not have been worth the effort to visit such disproportionate destruction upon the indigenous inhabitants at this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance wherever she looked, the Quarian woman saw destruction and calamity of a truly catastrophic scale. The smallest of this world\u2019s indigenous inhabitants reminded her, at least \u2018superficially\u2019 of the humans she had known of and met in what now seemed a distant previous life, before she had become stranded upon this world. Baring herself of course, they were clearly the most intelligent inhabitants of this world, and they still fought to defend a civilization that had in reality already fallen. Their walls breached and their population centres exposed to the raving depravations of their lumbering almost zombie like kin who dwarfed them in size and scale many times over, the inhabitants of the island kingdom still fought on. Their soldiers formed barricades and blockades behind guns and artillery when they could, herding their civilian population to the safety of walled enclosures where such structures still existed. The Quarian watched them firing their weapons at both the diminutive \u2018titans\u2019 as she had come to call them, and herself, her shielding still vaporizing every projectile and shell that was fired at her in pathetic puffs of tiny smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Quarian woman knew that she was responsible for the nightmarish hellscape this previously idyllic paradise had become, and she knew there was nothing she could do to stop the coming extermination had she even been inclined to. Whether they died in the bloodstained maws of the encroaching titans that looked so much like them or were pulverized to death beneath her own colossal steps, the Quarian knew that the indigenous \u2018humans\u2019 of this island simply would not survive.  Not now the last of their defences had been overrun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she still could, with what lied at their very heart of their island and kingdom. With that thought in her mind the Quarian continued her path of unfathomable destruction across the kingdom, the sprawling urban city that was this human kingdom\u2019s capital quickly appearing upon the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Quarian woman\u2019s foot came down just outside the outskirts of the capital city. Her armoured boot straddled a vast highway that led to the \u2018mighty\u2019 metropolis\u2019s centre, the city\u2019s walls and multi-storied building situated upon its outskirts shaking with the force of her footfall, their slopped roofs not even reaching the height of her toes. From the vantage point of her visor distantly high above, the woman glimpsed movement in the shadows cast beneath her boots, scores of tiny humans fleeing in terror towards the imagined safety of their capital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her vantage point, the Quarian woman could see the city had already all but fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitans in such vast numbers that she had not encountered before thronged the city, the clumsy giants smashing their way through buildings and thoroughfares as they clawed at and feasted upon the fleeing humans by their hundreds. The sharp crackle of many hundreds of rifles and small arms fire, interspaced with heavier cannon blasts and explosions ripped across the city\u2019s skyline, indicating remnants of the cities garrison still remained. Many thousands of humans still remained within the city despite the titan infestation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would not remain alive much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRifles and cannons continued to pepper the Quarian giantess with sporadic fire, her shielding disintegrating the tiny projectiles with ease. With surreal and almost leisurely grace the Quarian raised her hand towards the city, small arms fire and explosive munitions exploding harmlessly against the heavy leather of her palm. Turning her hand over, the Quarian flex her long fingers and thumb before activating her Omni-tool, her eyes scanning the data that appeared before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no mistake, the transmission was originating from beneath the city\u2019s centre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tired sigh the Quarian deactivated her Omni-tool, her colossal three fingered hands descending to her hips as she lifted her foot from the ground. Raw clumps of earth and asphalt from the despoiled ground below tumbled free from her bootsole as she lifted her foot above the city, her leg bent at the knee. Beneath her in the carnage of the capital\u2019s streets, tiny human and colossal titans alike suddenly looked upwards as the dark shadow of her foot swept over them, hundreds of tiny humans falling to their knees in fear, terror and prostration. Men, women and children screamed in terror, clutched and their loved ones and begged for their lives as dizzyingly high above and with her hands poised atop her shapely hips, the Quarian woman\u2019s expressionless mask looked down at them between the dual tips of her toes, her cold intentions towards them unmistakable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was gigantic, an impossibly huge titan towering above titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer soon to be victims could only pray as the Quarian made her final judgement;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Quarian giantess stood, somewhere between;</b></span></div></div>",

All eyes were raised to the fifty metre high wall and the skinless yet very human like head that soared above it, a dark and unnatural shadow protruding across the centre of the district as the titan; colossal beyond all reckoning looked down upon the little humans with hunger.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex stared up at the giant\u2019s head, his lips parted and mouth dry in the summer heat of the afternoon, the boy\u2019s tongue stubbornly still and unmoving inside his mouth.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh God\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s a titan\u201d Sara whispered from behind him, the hand of his adopted sister clasped around his, her nails digging into his palm.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMovement flickered at the corner of his eye, and instinctively Alex knew that one of their two younger siblings was beside them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWas it Billy, or Jessica?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex could not turn his head to see, so thawed with fear the young boy was.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nScarcely a minute before, the four young siblings had all been happy and laughing, the children enjoying the afternoon sunshine which had seen them relaxing in the central plaza of Shiganshina district.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were homeless street orphans all of them, related neither by blood, marriage or money, but instead by the need of young children to find solace and comfort in a society that had all but abandoned them. Alex was the oldest of them at twelve years of age, with Sara the older \u2018sister\u2019 of the group at ten. Billy was eight, and Jessica six. They looked out for each other, protected each other, and together the four siblings formed a close knit family that survived together in the poorest region of the kingdom behind the walls.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThat momentary happiness between the hunger, the freezing nights spent upon cold city streets and hiding from corrupt soldiers of the city garrison seemed a distant dream in Alex\u2019s past now as the huge face of the titan looked down upon them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026not possible\u2026\u201d Billy stammered, \u201c\u2026that wall is over fifty metres tall. That titan\u2019s got to be\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cOver Two Hundred feet high\u201d Alex finished.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIs that a titan?\u201d Jessica asked, her voice as innocently na\u00efve as it always was.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe have to get out of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBefore Alex could finish a thunderous crash shook the district, Wall Maria seeming to groan with the sound of cracking rock as the ground shook beneath the four children\u2019s feet, and then the centre of the curtain wall was smashed outwards in a churning explosion of dust and debris.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex was suddenly snapped from his stupor. Grasping his siblings by their arms he dragged them towards the nearest building as chucks of the broken wall peppered the city. Slabs of stone and mortar smashed through buildings, flattened houses and peppered streets, cutting down and crushing anyone unfortunate enough to find themselves in their path.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBlood splashed across the cobbled streets and walls as the first screams echoed across the district, fear giving way to panic as the full realization of what had just happened dawned upon the little township\u2019s inhabitants.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cTheir though the walls!\u201d someone screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs he was helping Billy to his feet, Alex turned towards wall, his gut twisting like a knife inside his stomach. Wall Maria still stood, the Colossal Titan suddenly gone as quickly as it had appeared, but from the gaping hole it had smashed through the lower segment of the wall, lanky and pale humanoid forms many times taller than a man were emerging, gapping wide toothed mouths open atop bobbing listing heads, their swollen human like eyes searching hungrily for flesh.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTitans!<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to the gate\u201d Alex shouted, grasping Jessica\u2019s arm as he did so, \u201cSara, take Billy\u2019s hand. Don\u2019t let go.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got no papers\u201d Sara cried, \u201cThey won\u2019t let us through.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to try. Come On!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTogether, the four orphans sprinted across the open plaza, a large crowd already forming across the mouth of the Aquila thoroughfare, the most direct route to the only remaining gate out of Shiganshina District, and deeper into the Kingdom behind the Walls.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs they approached the avenue, just how hopeless their situation was becoming apparent to Alex very quickly. Shiganshina District contained over ten thousand permanently resident men, women and children, and it seemed that every single one of them today was gathered into a single swelling crowd that blocked the main intersection of the thoroughfare, their numbers growing with every passing second.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA thin line of city guardsmen from the Royal Garrison were clustered around the baying mob, their distinctive mustard brown overcoats marking them out amongst the crowd. Futilely they tried to bring some semblance of order to chaotic crowd, the militiamen burnishing their antiquated flint-lock muskets and firelocks into the air.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was just as Alex and his three siblings reached the edge of the crowd that the sound of crumbling brick and masonry echoed across the open plaza. Panting for breath Alex turned, his three siblings pausing to follow his gaze towards the other end of the square, just in time to see a titan clambering over a triple storied house.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe titan was perhaps five or six metres tall, its giant form lurching drunkenly forward as it tried to navigate its way over the house, one long leg coming down upon the buildings balcony. The was a grinding off broken tiles and then suddenly the titan was plunging through the second storey roof, its arms flailing uselessly as it tried to dig its way free, and then the second titan appeared.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was at least twice as tall of the first, and unlike its companion it emerged from the closest street, a third titan stumbling forth in its wake. More titans suddenly appeared, their slow unwieldy forms rising from behind the row of houses and shops that lined the plaza and adjacent  roads, roofs and walls, an overhanging bridge collapsing as one smashed its way into the plaza, the tallest amongst them standing over fourteen metres high.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThere in the square!\u201d someone shouted.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGuardsman\u201d shouted a thick voice, \u201cForm Up. Deploy the cannons!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA line of guardsmen detached themselves from the crowd, running past Alex, Sara, Billy and Jessica as they stormed into the square. The thick tubular barrels of half a dozen serpentine cannons upon wooden carts were pulled out with them, the guardsmen forming a line about a hundred strong as they levelled their muskets and cannons towards the approaching titans. A thickly build man in a sergeants uniform emerged from their ranks. The man sported a curling moustache, and burnished a sword which he now swept through the air.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cFire!\u201d the sergeant screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex clasped his hands over his ears, shouting at his siblings to do the same as the first volley fired, the whistling <i>crack</i> of close to a hundred muskets suddenly followed by explosive <i>boom</i> as the cannons let loose, the wheels of their carriages lurching backwards with the force of the blast.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe shots slammed into the oncoming titans, the pee sixed musket balls peppering their wiry misshapen bodies as the cannon shots ripped through limbs, human like blood splashing across the plaza floor. Alex saw a titan stumble and fall, its nightmarish face reduced to a bloody stump where one of the cannons had caught its head and ripped it clean off, but to his horror Alex could see its body already fighting to regain its footing, a twisting mass of flesh atop its neck already reforming as it head began to grow back.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nNo more than two of the titans had been felled by the solders first volley, and at least a dozen more were already shambling forwards, the closest halfway across the square already.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cReload\u201d the sergeant shouted, \u201cProtect the civilians at all costs.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe soldiers fired again, and the lead titan was cut down, but then another was shambling forwards in its place, its ten-metre-high form towering above the thin line of soldiers who were still reloading.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we do!\u201d Sara screamed from behind Alex, \u201cWe\u2019re trapped.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex turned back to the crowd, his heart sinking. Without the guardsmen there to police the evacuation, the crowd that still blocked the intersection had descended into an even more chaotic mass as people punched, kicked and clawed at each other, the press of so many human bodies preventing all but a handful from moving forward. Already Alex could see more titans worming their way around the plazas edge, and instinctively he knew they intended to flank the soldiers. The dumb brute\u2019s tiny animal like minds had deduced the quickest possible path to the crowd.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThat intersection would soon become a bloodbath.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cAlex!\u201d Sara screamed, Jessica and Billy crying behind her \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cFollow me\u201d Alex shouted. Leading Jessica again by her arm, Alex sprinted across the edge of square, Sara and Billy hard on his heels. Steeling a glance over his shoulder, Alex glimpsed a titan in amongst detachment of soldiers. Their line reeled, a squirming human form suspended at least eight metres off the ground in the meaty fist of a titan. The soldier convulsed inside the titan\u2019s fist as the fingers of the giant crushed his torso, blood frothing from the man\u2019s lips as his companions fired their muskets upwards.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex twisted back his head, swerving to avoid a discarded box of rotting fish. Jessica cried out as her foot struck the box, but Alex continued to pull her after him, ignoring his baby sisters whimpering. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nRather than the intersection, Alex led them to one of the plaza\u2019s corners, where the sewage of the both Shiganshina eastern and northern drainage ditches met in a low slung trench. Jumping into the filthy knee deep water Alex grasped hold of the thin grated wire-mesh plate that blocked the entrance to the underground pipe and pulled with all his might.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe plate groaned, one edge peeling free from the waterproof brickwork to which it was stuck. The thin wire-mesh twisted between his fingers, blood dripping from between his nails, then with one last groan the thinly stripped metal came apart, the grated plate coming out in his hands.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s open\u201d Alex said, \u201cCome on, get in. Get in!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSara was the first in, dragging a now sobbing Jessica behind her as the two girls descended to their knees and disappeared into the pipe. Billy was next, Alex pushing his younger brother into the pipe with both hands before turning back to the square, the water suddenly trembling around him.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTurning back towards the plaza, Alex\u2019s heart sunk. At least a dozen titans were now amongst the guardsmen, and almost each and every one of the giant freaks had the limbs of a screaming and struggling soldier clasped in their huge hands, obvious to the scattered musket fire tearing into their flesh as they feasted upon their screaming, still living victims.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA titan chased a fleeing soldier, the man dropping his spent musket only to be plucked from the ground, kicking at the thick meaty fingers that had grasped hold of his leg. His screams echoed across the square as the titan clamped its huge mouth around his torso, thick arterial blood spurting upwards. A cannon fired, blowing the arm of another titan clean off as its crew tried to reload, then another titan was upon them, overturning the cannon and crushing one of the surviving soldiers, one of his companions hurriedly reloading his musket as another fled.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMovement from the corner of his eyes caught Alex attention, and suddenly the young boy realized a titan was lumbering towards him, the water splashing upwards around his legs. It was a big titan, almost fifteen metres tall, and it was almost upon him.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nDiving to his knees Alex scrambled into the pipeway. From the corner of his eye his glimpsed one final shot of the plaza, the human soldiers dead or dying, the crowd at the intersection all but clawing over each other as the titans converged upon them, a towering fifteen metre tall titan plucking a man from the crowd to consume. And then there was the human sergeant in the middle of plaza, his sword still brandished into the air and hand-musket grasped in one hand, surrounded.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe approaching titan stumbled and fell, its clumsy flailing body landing straight atop the trench. Already in the pipe, a sudden surge of water splashed over Alex, the filthy liquid getting into his eyes, ears and mouth. Still the boy continued forward, the repetitive <i>splash splash splash</i> up ahead telling him that his siblings were still clambering through the tunnel further up.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cKeep going\u201d Alex screamed spitting out the fowl tasting water as he did so, \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was many minutes later that they reached the other end of the pipe, Sara poised at the entrance waiting for Alex while Billy and Jessica sat shivering in the closest alleyway.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHuman screams, alongside the sound of ripping flesh and breaking bones echoed across the rooftops, coming from where the crowd had been at the edge of the plaza.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep moving\u201d Alex said, rousing Billy and Jessica to their feet, \u201cGet up get up. They\u2019ll be closing the gate soon.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe children were now on Shiganshina District\u2019s northern side, only a few streets to the gateway. Hand in hand Alex led them forward, the four orphans emerging from the alleyway and into a small square, the ground suddenly shaking.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA titan emerged from atop the overhanging roofs, its towering form at least ten metres high. Its wide mouthed grinning visage regarded the young orphans with hunger, and suddenly one gangly arm was reaching down towards them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cRun!\u201d Alex shouted, pushing his siblings to one side. Together they dived under an overhanging archway, the titan half destroying the front of a shop was its attempt to grasp at them went wide.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTwisting on his heel Alex shoved Jessica and Billy forward, Sara running behind him and together the siblings sprinted beneath the titan\u2019s legs, the massive creature twisting it body to fast as it stumbled and fell.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe ground shook with the giant\u2019s collapse. Billy cried out as he stumbled forward, but Alex was behind him, pushing his younger brother to his feet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey emerged from the alleyway into the main thoroughfare, two mid-sized titans turning to meet them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cBack\u201d Alex shouted, the titan\u2019s arms coming up as they stumbled forwards, preparing to grasp at the human children, \u201cGet back!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nCannon fire ripped across the thoroughfare, smashing straight into the two titans. One of the titans took a cannon ball straight to the shoulder, the blast ripping apart half its torso whilst the second took a blow to its legs, the shot ripping them both clean off as thick arterial human like blood splashed across the walls and street.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGlancing the way the shots had come, Alex could see the inner gate. Six cannons and a gaggle of guardsman were gathered around the gate\u2019s entrance, waving the children forwards.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s still open\u201d Alex said, pulling Jessica and Billy into the street, \u201cCome on. Run!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey entered the thoroughfare, Alex and Sara each dragging one of their younger siblings after them. From the closest alleyways and streets other humans emerged, and soon they were part of small crowd filtering up the gate. The familiar sound of crumbling bricks and mortar echoed down the road.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGlancing over his shoulder as he ran, Alex saw a titan emerge from the thoroughfare\u2019s winding edge, at least two more behind it.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGet down\u201d a soldier screamed, Alex and Sara throwing their younger siblings to the ground as the cannons fired. The Oncoming titan was cut down as were two of the beast\u2019s companions. Alex twisted onto his back as the gigantic humanoids stumbled forwards and fell, limbs and heads ripped clean off, but already he could see movement behind them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGet up, get up!\u201d he said, rousing Jessica to her feet. The girl continued to sob as they pushed forward, Sara and Billy behind them, and then they were at the gate. A blond haired officer shoved them through the gigantic archway beneath the interior of wall Maria, and then suddenly for the first time in their lives Alex, Sara, Billy and Jessica were outside of Shiganshina district, and inside the interior of Wall Maria.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA vast expanse of open green fields and rolling hills stretched out as far as any of them could see, whilst a cobbled road and water canal from the gateway ran all the way to the horizon. Somewhere far in the distance Alex knew Wall Rose stood, and beyond that Wall Sheena, and then the royal capital and the lavish Palace of the King. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAnother crowd greeted them, even larger than the one they had encountered in the plaza. The mass of huddled refugees from Shiganshina District was nestled between the small trading outpost that adjoined Wall Maria\u2019s Inner Gate, and a makeshift port where a line of Gondola\u2019s were docked. A thin line of guardsman was gathered before the ships, selecting people to take on and turning others away, their flintlock muskets pointed towards the crowd as a warning.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThere\u201d Alex said, \u201cCome on. We have to get on that last ship.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA sharp crack of cannon fire echoed from inside the gate as they approached the port, the crowd and soldiers tensing, yet no one tried to rush the boats. Alex and his siblings made their way through the press of the crowd, Alex maintaining a firm grip on Jessica\u2019s hand, who in turn had her hand gripped to Jesscia\u2019s, who in turn was leading Billy at their rear.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBehind them another volley of cannon and musket fire boomed, people glancing nervously back the way they had come.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d someone shouted up ahead, \u201cLet us on!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWomen and children only at this time Sir\u201d a reply came, \u201cMore Gondola\u2019s will be here soon for the rest of you.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey reached the front of the crowd just as another volley of cannon fire went off, the thin line of soldiers stretched out before the docked ships eying each other nervously as the crowd edged closer, then a man attempted to rush the nearest gangplank.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cStop him!\u201d an officer shouted.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTwo soldiers leapt forward to restrain the man, their compatriots raising their muskets to the crowd in warning.</span></div></div>",

Together the four children made their way forward, a shaven headed officer glancing up and waving them forward, his soldiers parting to let them on.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were just at the gangplank of the nearest ship when a forth volley of cannon and musket fire echoed outwards from behind Wall Rose, this time the gunfire punctuated with a chorus of human screams. Alex turned his head, glimpsing the terrified looks on the faces of the crowd, and then the first scream went up.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThere right outside the gate!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWith that the crowd finally panicked and surged, dozens of people pushing their way forward as a soldier discharged his musket into the crowd, then all hell broke loose. Hundreds of Shiganshina\u2019s townspeople were surging up the gang plank, the half a dozen or so soldiers guarding it being grappled to the ground and beaten as more muskets were fired into the roaring crowd.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex pulled Sara behind him, Jessica trying to do the same to Billy as the crowd surged into them, and then suddenly Alex was falling, thick hands grasping him by his collar and throwing him aside and back onto the dry-docks ledge<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cSara\u201d, Alex shouted, \u201cJessica!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIn the thick press of bodies Alex glimpsed Billy, his younger brother tossed to the ground the other side of the gang plank, struggling to return to his feet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t see his sisters.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cCast off, cast off. Before they swamp us\u201d a voice screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Gondola suddenly lurched precariously to one side, over a hundred people screaming as they were thrown from the tumbling gangplank. A handful of them were able to grasp onto the rails of the ship as it began to cast off, those onboard struggling to pull them to safety however the majority tumbled downwards, splashing into the water below.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThrough the press of people, Alex glimpsed Sara and Jessica, the two girls staring back at them from the Gondola\u2019s wooden deck.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were safe, for now.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe other Gondola\u2019s were preparing to cast off, the crews and passengers upending the gangplanks even as people continued to try and board them, hundreds of screaming refuges splashing into the cold water off the dry dock below.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGlancing back towards the trading centre across the road, Alex caught sight of a dozen wagons and horses, a ring of armed mercenaries holding back a smaller crowd just as the soldiers before the Gondola\u2019s had been a moment earlier.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nScrambling back to his feet, Alex found his way to Billy and pulled the young boy to his feet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we do\u201d his brother cried.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cFollow me.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex led his brother across the road and past the trading centre, another round of cannon fire punctuating the screams of both crowds.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex and Billy wormed their way through the crowd and were soon within sight of the wagons. Whoever owned the caravan must have had a soft spot for the two orphans that day, for the ring of guards parted and they were dragged forward, the crowd yelling and clawing behind them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat about us!\u201d someone screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA tall mercenary with cropped black hair lifted Alex and Billy into one of the caravan\u2019s, the rear compartment so crammed with women, children and a small number of labourers that the two boys were forced to perch themselves upon the end, their legs dangling over the wagons parapet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, time to go!\u201d the caravan master shouted, and with that the drivers lashed their horses into action, the towering animals snorting as they began to trot forward, pulling the lumbering wheeled carts behind them. The mercenaries rushed back towards their caravans as the crowd surged after them, the caravan picking up speed as they boarded each of the wagons in turn, their fellow guards hanging from the carts edges to beat off the questing hands of the crowd with heavy truncheons.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex didn\u2019t think that they would make it out of the mob, but at the last moment the bulk of the crowd dispersed before the now charging horses, the few remaining men and women being trampled down by the heavy draft horses as they passed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was with a mixture of both relief and fatigue that Alex allowed himself to fall backwards onto the caravans wooden floor. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIn the distance, the Gondola carrying Sara and Jessica receded towards the horizon, no doubt on its way to Trost District.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey would be safe there, until Alex and Billy caught up with them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIs it over\u201d Billy asked.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cI think so\u201d Alex replied, \u201cWe\u2019re safe now.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Inner Gateway of Shiganshina District was just barely visible to them now, but Alex could see the gate coming down. They would close it, the titans would not follow and despite the hundreds of people who had died here today, that would be that.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was only a handful of seconds later that both boys saw the Inner gateway smash outwards, a fifteen-metre-tall armoured titan barrelling straight through the archway as if it had been made of sand.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt had finally happened.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe titans had breached wall Maria.</span></div></div>",

Deftly she recognized the symbol for <i>foreign contaminant</i> but could not recall what she was suppose to do until she felt the medical antibodies administered by her suit flooding into her bloodstream.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nDeep down at the back of her throat the Quarian could feel something begin to bubble and froth, and suddenly she knew she was about to be sick.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nPushing herself up onto one elbow the female shuddered, clenching her lips more out of reflex then actual conscious thought. Water trickled down from her back, small waves rippling forth in the water around her as she reached towards the Omni-tool at her wrist with her free hand, her gloved finger and thumb activating her suits environmental controls.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe coughed, her lips still clenched tightly behind gritted teeth, and with one final flick of her thumb she stabbed down at her Omni-tool, overriding the emergency ventilation port of her helmet. The cylindrical port which covered her mouth opened with a pressurised hiss, her lips parted and she vomited.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cOoogggg\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBlood, bile and a toxic mixture of broken down antibiotic paste plummeted down into the water below. The Quarian heaved again, her hand splashing down into the water, and faintly was she aware of the ground crumbling beneath her gloved palm, almost as if she had been a giant slamming her fist into the ground.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nJust as quickly had the sensation to gag had come over her, it passed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nClean filtered air fed by her suit pumped into her helmet and with a smooth gust of wind her mouth port closed, sealing her back inside her helmet. She breathed, a sensation of weightlessness momentarily overcoming her as a second round of antibiotics and endorphins flood through her bloodstream, purging any remnants of the contaminants which appeared to have temporarily breached her suit.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGroggily, the Quarian woman sat up, one hand still planted firmly behind her. Drawing her long legs up towards her chest, she flexed the toes of her boots and once she was satisfied she was reasonably stable, she tried to stand.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe movement of rising to her feet was relatively fluid, through she still felt a little unsteady. Perplexingly, she felt her boots sink slightly into the ground. It was not the sensation of her feet sinking into sand, but the impression of a million tiny fragments of shale crushing like ice beneath her bootsoles, yet whatever the strange substance she was standing on was, it seemed to support her weight.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Quarian found herself looking at her hand, her long fingers and thumb flexing beneath the heavy padding of her suit\u2019s gloves.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWho am I\u2026?\u201d the Quarian asked, her voice coming out as a metallic echo of the one she imagined hearing in her head. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSuddenly she found herself looking towards the horizon, the endless puddle of water seemingly to stretch around her in all directions.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nNeither question answered the other, though she could sense her name of the very tip of her tongue, and slowly memories began to resurface.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe titled her head towards the sky, the sunlight glancing of her visor. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was bright, unusually bright and she was forced to lift a hand to shield her eyes.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nUp there, beyond the blue sky of this world and into the dark blackness beyond was where she had come from.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe was a Quarian. Her people were a nomadic race of scavengers, engineers and scientists, forever doomed to travel the endless void of space within their sealed starships, to be sneered and loathed by those races and civilizations who still enjoyed the protection of their colonies and homeworlds. Somewhere deep down the Quarian knew that she despised them for that, and in her deepest darkest thoughts she sometimes found herself wishing unspeakable calamity upon those ignorant people and races. A dark shadow falling across the civilization of those who had never known hunger or loss, the tiny aliens fleeing as a boot of cruel malice ground them beneath its heel.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHer immune system was weak. That much she remembered clearly, hence the need for her sealed environmental suit, yet stubbornly her name and her personnel history escaped her.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nLowering her head, the Quarian glanced back towards the horizon. Her hands descended to her hips as she surveyed her surroundings, trying to make sense at what she saw.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThere was no beach, no landmass, and yet she knew she could not have been standing in the middle of an ocean with the water lapping around her boots.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm\u2026\u201d the Quarian mused, \u201cCould I be a giant\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe imagined tiny wooden sailing ships banking against the crushing waves beneath her ankles, the minuscule human like crews fighting against their rigging as she stepped backwards, oblivious to their presence even as she condemned them and their tiny wooden sailing ships to be crushed beneath her hard soles of her boots.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe idea was entertaining, if only for a moment, but quite preposterous.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe was woman of science, and therefore she knew that there must a reasonable explanation for the world she found herself on.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlmost as if it had been in response to the thought, she glimpsed something ahead, just below the horizon. Her visor dimmed to compensate for the intense light, and suddenly she could see a landmass ahead.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Quarian could have slapped a palm to her visor.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was right there!<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHow by the God\u2019s could she have missed it?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe landmass was shallow but she was sure that was just an effect of the light blocking her full view of the horizon and the mountains that would be beyond.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nJust as she was about to set off towards it, her Omni-tool bleeped.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTurning to the holographic terminal across her wrist, the Quarian tapped at the interface, her eyebrow rising in an almost quizzical gesture. Somewhere in the direction of the \u2018island\u2019 was a signal, perhaps a way for her to get off this world and back to the flotilla.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nEither way, it was better than staying here.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSmiling beneath her helmet, the Quarian took her first step towards the island. Water rippled outwards in tandems with her footfalls, and as she got closer more and more of the island could be seen.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was surprisingly flat from what she could see, but as more and more of the landmass came into focus she saw what might have been larger landmarks against the horizon. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nOr was it just a trick of her eyes?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Quarian woman was half way to setting foot on \u2018Paradise Island\u2019, and the besieged Kingdom behind the Walls when suddenly she remembered her name, and who she was;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-\tHer Name was;</b></span></div></div>",

As a species this race is\u2026use to great economic and social\u2026hardship and persecution at the\u2026 &lt;claws&gt;\u2026 of other corporeal races in stronger positions of\u2026and economic power. It will therefore be\u2026interesting to\u2026witness how she chooses to interact, when presented with another\u2026&lt;alien&gt;\u2026race who by circumstance, are so incredibly at her mercy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026location for this experiment\u2026I have found a world unique to our requirements\u2026indigenous race known as Eldian\u2019s, almost identical too\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026in almost every way accept\u2026scale makes them almost microscopic in comparison to most humanoid races in the galaxy. Even more uniquely\u2026besieged by a race of mutated\u2026humanoids the Eldian\u2019s have collectively dubbed \u2018titans\u2019\u2026behind three circular walls which comprise the majority of the island\u2019s central landmass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Eldian\u2019s are still pre space faring, and their technology consists largely of primitive muzzle loading firearms and wheeled cannons\u2026all of which will be quite useless against the Quarian giantess once she arrives. The\u2026technology incorporated into the Quarian\u2019s environmental suit is\u2026significantly more technologically advanced, and incorporates cyclonic energy shielding. Nothing the native Eldian\u2019s possess will be capable of even scratching her suit. Her own integrated weaponry however\u2026suit contains a full array of visual and communication equipment. The magnification her helmet offers will allow her to view the Eldian civilisation and miniaturized people in near perfect detail. She will be able to hear them, understand them, translate their language, and even establish verbal communication is she wishes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I shall place the\u2026&lt;Quarian&gt;\u2026female known as\u2026Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya\u2026 just off the coast of the\u2026landmass. From the ingenious inhabitants perspective\u2026she will be a towering giant, over one\u2026&lt;mile&gt;\u2026tall\u2026I have placed a package beneath the centre of the Eldian\u2019s civilization and largest city\u2026which will provide her instantaneous transmission and communication to the Quarian flotilla. The Quarian female\u2019s Omni-tool should lead her straight to the heart of their kingdom\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026how will she react? Will she attempt to communicate with the indigenous Eldian\u2019s\u2026ask them politely to promptly evacuate their capital before she levels their entire city, ripping out the urbanized heart of their civilization in order to dig out her package\u2026simply step or them, as if they were nothing more than a collection of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026my daughter, Vorazun does not share my sentiment. She seems convinced that because this Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya bares a womb in her stomach, this will somehow make her sympathetic to the Eldian\u2019s plight. As a result, she will be loathe to take any action that may result in unnecessary death and suffering to the near microscopic Eldian children, to whom she may be inclined to feel some maternal compassion towards\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I am somewhat more cynical in my ancient age compared to my daughter. True, from what her profile tells me, Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya is not a naturally cruel and malicious woman, but she is still a\u2026&lt;organic&gt;\u2026origin, and thus prone to same pleasures and prejudices of her kind. She may ponder, she may pause, and she may even come to regret her actions in\u2026&lt;years&gt;\u2026to come. Still, I have no doubt that when she encounters this miniaturized race of humanoids, and realizes she can with but a single step annihilate entire cities, a necessary evil in order to return to her beloved flotilla, she will not hesitate to bring unfathomable destruction to the their civilization, if she believes it in her interest to do so. The native Eldian\u2019s are after all little more than near microscopic insects to her, and this is exactly how she will come to view them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026daughter persists that I am wrong, and she is right in this matter\u2026so we have agreed, a little wager. If she is proved correct\u2026I have promised not to carry out another planetary extermination event for at least another millennia. But if Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya actions provide my daughter wrong\u2026Vorazun shall withdrew her protection of the Orion spiral arm, and allow me to purge any world I desire of all life. I have been looking forward to dealing with that pestilent little race of\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026my daughter know, that I will not be keeping my promise. If against all my expectations and assumptions, this Quarian decides starvation and death is preferable to mass murder, then I shall reach out into the corporeal world\u2026take physical form within\u2026the Eldian\u2019s\u2026star system\u2026enclose my\u2026&lt;claws&gt;\u2026around the entire planet, and crush the entire world to dust within my palm\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026homeworld will be next. Such is the right off a goddess after all, and I always get what I want\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Who does the story follow from here;</b></span></div></div>",

This \u2018island\u2019 was just as peculiar as the manner in which Tali had first awoken to find herself upon this world in the first place.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt had not taken her long at all to reach the island, yet when she arrived at its edge there had been no beach, simply a thin \u2018boundary\u2019 of sand which marked where the water ended and the island began. The landmass of the island itself was a soupy green marsh of flatland save for a few gently sloping inclines and mounds, pleasing to look at but so soft and yielding that Tali\u2019s boots had sunk almost to her ankles when she had stepped into it.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIndeed, the Quarian was starting to believe rather half-heartedly that she really was a giant on this world.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTali had continued on, tiny clumps of wet marsh and soil falling free from her bootsoles with each and every step she took. Her Omni-tool had taken her deeper and deeper into the island\u2019s centre as it had continued to pinpoint the mysterious signal\u2019s location.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was now, with her raised hand shielding her eyes from the overbearing sun that Tali glimpsed her first possible sign of civilization.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was a wall!<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA wall that just barely surpassed the height of the Quarian woman\u2019s ankles.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAt first Tali thought it was natural structure, perhaps a tiny outcropping of rock that had become sandwiched into the surrounding marshland, but as she approached the edifice she knew this could not be the case.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTali\u2019s foot came down just in front of the \u2018wall\u2019, and with dexterous caution she knelt down, running her eyes over the miniature structure. It was constructed from stone and stood perhaps five full centimetres high, its length dotted with tiny and almost adorable watchtowers and other fortifications.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt extended outwards in both directions, as far as Tali\u2019s eyes could see even with the magnification her helmet offered.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHer curiosity momentarily getting the better of her, Tali reached down and ran an experimental finger along the walls top. Her gloved fingertip quickly came into contact with one of the wall\u2019s stone watchtowers, the building suddenly toppling in a miniature avalanche of dissolving stonework as her fingertip smashed right through it, all bit obliterating the tower in the process.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTali withdrew her hand as if stung, suddenly conscious that she had damaged the wall.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt had been like touching a little child\u2019s sandcastle.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe had not expected it to be so\u2026fragile!<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIs this a toy\u201d Tali mused, glancing back up and down the length of the wall, and the expanse of the island\u2019s landmass that surrounded it.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWas this entire island, this entire world nothing more than some rich brat\u2019s playground, populated with miniature landscapes and structures?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTali slowly rose back to her full height, dusting of her hands as she did so.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t matter one way or the other.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWhat mattered was finding a way off this planet, and the signal her Omni-tool was leading her to may provide just such an avenue.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTwisting on her heel Tali stepped over the wall, the mile tall quarrian unknowingly taking her first step into the humanlike kingdom of Eldia.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIn an act of pure spite Tali dragged her other foot forward, the twin toes of her boot deliberately smashing straight into the wall in an explosion of crumbling masonry and stone that saw an entire section of the wall crumble, dust and debris raining down into the surrounding marshland.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTali pretended not to notice the damage she had caused as she strode off, but if this planet really was the fantasy made real of a family with more money than sense, then she had just made her feeling on the matter very clear.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nUnfortunately, Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya didn\u2019t realize that the wall she had just smashed open was all that protected the native citizens of Eldia from the ravenous titans, and that she had just allowed those same titans to pour into the kingdom unchallenged in her wake.</span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s get some buildings between us and those freaks to cut off their line of sight. We should be fine anyway but let\u2019s not take chances.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cAye Boss, you got it.\u201d the wagon driver, this \u2018Jenkins\u2019 if Alex had heard correctly shouted back.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe caravan had departed Shiganshina with over a dozen wagons.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAfter the first clash with an advance party of freakishly fast titans, \u2018abnormal\u2019s\u2019 as the caravan guards had referred to them as, the wagons had scattered in panic. Now only three remained, at least twenty people crammed into each.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex hoped the others had gotten away safely, and were now doing their best to make their way to Trost District.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe wooden gangplank beneath Alex and Billy jostled as the caravan banked to the right, the titan\u2019s receding behind them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be OK\u201d Alex said, setting a reassuring hand on Billy\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe gangplank shook again with a less then gentle jostle, its rear wheels seeming to bounce. It could have been a simple rock in the path, but to Alex it felt distinctly like an small earthquake.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt couldn\u2019t have been the titan\u2019s, they were still too far away.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBefore Alex could think better of it, across the dividing fields the line of trees suddenly burst open, a fifteen metres tall titan smashing through the trees with uncharacteristic speed as it began running straight at the caravan.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cFuck, an Abnormal!\u201d the caravan master shouted, \u201cJenkin\u2019s, lash the horse\u2019s spines out. We\u2019ve got an abnormal titan closing.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cOh God!\u201d a woman cried.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe wagon bounced again, the driver\u2019s whip lashing back and forth into the air as the horse chortled out their protests, the animals picking up speed as they galloped onwards<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAcross the field Alex could see the abnormal titan still sprinting towards them, its wiry misshapen limbs flailing left and right as its huge drooling jaws gnashed open and closed with a terrible wet crack, the colossal and naked humanoid continuing to close the distance with the wagons.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re\u2026 we\u2019re going to die\u201d Billy whimpered.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGrasping at the wagons protective cover with one hand Alex twisted himself to one side, his head peeking out from the wagon\u2019s rear edge. The farm the caravan master had just mentioned wasn\u2019t far off, a small cluster of barns and workshops accompanied by a house. If Alex and Billy could just get inside one of the houses, find a cellar and\u2026<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cOh Shit, more Titans!\u201d Jenkins screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were just outside the farmhouse\u2019s gate and the words had scarcely passed the drivers lips before Alex glimpsed the first titan. The ugly brute was small by the size of its kin, perhaps less than six metres tall. It rose up from behind one of the small workshop that dotted the edge of the farm, its meaty paw like hands clasped around the arm and leg of a screaming farmer whose abdomen it was still in the process of gnawing into. Thick human blood dribbled down its chin and chest.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe man\u2019s howling screams echoed across the surrounding fields, Alex\u2019s eyes widening in surreal fear as he saw the other titan emerge from amongst farmyard\u2019s buildings.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe place was infested with them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cTurn, Turn, Turn!\u201d the caravan master was screaming.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was at that moment that a small explosion shook the ground around them. The wagon\u2019s rear wheels left the paved road beneath them, its occupants screaming in terror as the vehicle was pivoted to one side at the front, and then its anterior axel snapped. Alex was almost tossed clear even as the wagon came apart beneath him, the canvas hood ripping free as over twenty men, women and children were flung to the adjacent field.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex smacked straight into the dirt face first, the young boy all but somersaulting head over heels as he came to a pounding stop. Billy hit the ground just ahead of him, and ahead of the two boys the next wagon capsized, its occupants letting out a collective scream as they were hurtled free. The only wagon to survive the thunderous crash did not wait to try and help the passengers of its fallen companions, for whom it had no room for.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nRising shakily to his feet, Alex saw the last wagon speeding off, its driver lashing furiously as his horses as the sole surviving vehicle cart-wheeled itself around the edge of the farm, and then it was gone.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGet up, Get up!\u201d the caravan master screamed, rousing a woman and her daughter from the ground. Around the broken wagon the survivors from Shiganshina stumbled groggily to their feet, the bulk of them being women and small children, alongside a handful of labourers.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlready the titans inside the farm were taking notice of the refugees, and with an earth quaking crash that made the smaller children cry a ten-metre-tall titan was already clambering its way over the wall to get to them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex didn\u2019t wait to be eaten. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nRising unsteadily to his feet the boy leapt forward, grasping at Billy\u2019s collar and pushing his brother forward.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGet to the buildings!\u201d the caravan master screamed, \u201cThere our only chance. Everybody Run!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex and Billy were already running before the first titan had descended on the crowd, the gigantic humanoid grasping one of the caravan labourers up from the ground before crunching its think jaws into the man\u2019s abdomen.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA high pitched human scream echoed outwards as the survivors scattered, Alex and Billy sprinting up towards the barn at the edge of the farm.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe sound of splashing water and mud accompanied by the tell-tale rapid quakes of approaching footfalls forced Alex to glance over his shoulder, his gut suddenly feeling hollow into his stomach. The abnormally fast titan vaunted across the final patch of field to crash straight into the overturned wagon, the fifteen-metre-tall monster grasping a woman from the fleeing crowd as it did so and all but ripping her into two bloody pieces in the process. Alex saw the caravan master charging the titan with a wooden baton over his shoulder, the young boy turning just in time to pull Billy up when his younger brother stumbled. A woman and three children had joined them, the six fleeing refugees now almost at the closest barn now.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTurning back to look over his shoulder, Alex glimpsed the titan swinging one of its malformed arms downwards, the caravan master flying backwards as his neck was broken.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA child screamed as more titan converged on those still cowering between the broken wagons, munching upon the old and young alike.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAt the farms edge Alex and Billy finally made it to the barn, the woman and her children hot behind them. Together the six small humans made their way to the barn\u2019s entrance, just as a second explosive quake rocked the farm.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe sudden shockwave rocked the clearing, almost sending Alex, Billy, the woman and children behind them tumbling to their knees.  None of them had time to question the source of the explosive quake. They were just in front of barn\u2019s two story double doors, a thick knot of iron chains wrapped around the wooden handles.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex pushed at the doors, but they would not open. The chains were secured by a heavy metal padlock and they wouldn\u2019t budge.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cOh God\u201d the woman cried.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cMommy look\u201d one of the children said, gesturing towards the distance.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex forced his shoulder into the gates, but they still stubbornly refused to move.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHe glanced around, looking for a shovel, and axe, anything that they may be able to force the doors open with.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cAlex, look!\u201d Billy cried, his arm pointing towards the distance.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBefore Alex could following his brother line of sight, the pallid and fleshy leg of a giant humanoid foot swung out from the other side of barn, the titan\u2019s foot coming down to demolish a small tiled well with a miniature wake that shook the ground beneath Alex\u2019s feet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex grasped Billy\u2019s shoulder and pulled his younger brother behind him, the woman doing the same with two of her children beside him. The titan was the abnormal one they had seen running across the field, fifteen metres tall and sporting an open wide toothed smile as it looked down upon the tiny humans with unmistakable intent.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHuman screams of pain and death continued to echo across the farm that was quickly becoming a killing field for the feasting titans.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA dark shadow swept over the farm and surrounding countryside, neither Alex nor the mother realizing as they regarded the approaching giant with cold fear.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The titan was within arm\u2019s reach of them now.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThere was nowhere to run.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cAlex look\u201d Billy said, tugging at his brother\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex turned his head to the horizon just in time to see an impossibly huge three toed alien foot descend to the ground, crushing the entire portion of the surrounding woodlands that seemed to encircle the farmland on that side.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAn ear-splitting shockwave blasted over the entire farm.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex, Billy, the woman and her three children were all blasted back into the barns doors, the children screaming in terror as beside them even the titan was thrown from its feet and tossed backwards.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe air knocked from his lungs, Alex could only look upon the horizon in terror.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe woodland that had bordered the farm and its surrounding fields were gone, replaced by a veritable superstructure of a three toed alien boot. A handful of trees had survived the alien foot\u2019s descent; trees that would have dwarfed even the fifty-foot-high titans were now dwarfed by the mere toes of this alien\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs the dust from the shockwave began to settle around the farm Alex looked up, his tongue suddenly dry inside his mouth. The vast alien foot that had all but obliterated the nearby forest was just the lower portion of a being much more massive in stature. A metallic sky-high cylinder rose upwards from the base of the foot, Alex\u2019s eyes suddenly picking up another of the incompressibly huge cylinder like legs poised behind the first. The two legs met dizzyingly high above where the unmistakable silhouette of a woman stood, clad in a bizarre suit of full fitting alien armour and cloth that seemed to cling to her statuesque like form, almost like a glove. Her shape and stature were unmistakably alien, yet distantly human. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe blocked out the sky and sun a full mile above the tiny farm, her form dominating the horizon as far as Alex could lift his head.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Billy whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** **********************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali\u2019Zorah\u2019s first encounter with the so called \u2018titan\u2019s\u2019 had been as one sided as he had been unsettling.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWhen she had first set foot upon this world, Tali had joked somewhat half-heartedly that she may well have been a giant upon this world for all the signs of civilization and geographical landmarks that she could see. That joke had seemed somewhat more plausible when she had encountered the ankle high protective wall, yet still Tali\u2019s mind had persisted with the notion that there was some rational explanation for the situation she found herself in.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHer first encounter with the apparent indigenous inhabitants of this world had shattered that that persistent hope.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHumans!<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nInfinitesimal humans!<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThat was Tali\u2019s first thought when she stumbled upon the first miniaturized humanoids, yet from her first glimpse of the islands indigenous inhabitants alone the Quarian knew something was dangerously wrong with the creatures aside from their tiny size.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were pasty and ugly things, their naked misshapen bodies a grotesque parody of the humans she had gotten to know aboard the crew of the Normandy, and beyond. Some were significantly taller than their fellow humanoids, and others much smaller than their companions. Some had terribly misshapen limbs, whilst others sported bizarrely shaped heads upon torsos too small to adequately support their bobbing heads. None could have been more then fifteen millimetres in height from the Quarian\u2019s woman\u2019s perspective, and many were a great deal tinier.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTali had come upon her first such congregation of the tiny humanoids not long after she had encountered the wall. She had been half expecting them to scatter and run at her first approach, fleeing the armoured giantess in terror.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was certainly what she would have done in their place.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nInstead, the grossly misshapen humanoids had merely turned toward her, their wide-eyed faces and drooping jaws regarding the approach of the soaring Quarian woman in an almost zombiefied trance like state.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nCuriosity had gotten the better of her.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nPausing above the tiny creatures Tali had reached down, her long gloved finger and thumb curling around one such titan as she lifted it from the ground.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you\u2026?\u201d Tali had asked, the tiny humanoid prised not urgently between her finger and thumb. She had hoped for a response, some kind of compression from the minuscule creature even if it was only an acknowledgement of fear.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe titan was not entirely unresponsive.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe creature seemed to stir between the grip of her outstretched digits, its head twisting to an impossible angle as the bones it neck slurped and cracked, its head turning until it was facing the exposed surface of her thumb. Tali saw the creature jaws open, its white stubbly teeth glinting in the magnified view of her visored helmet, and then it began to gnaw at the hard surface of her gloved thumb.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cUuggg\u2026disgusting!\u201d Tali had cried.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA tiny warning light had flickered at the edge of her vision, informing her of the irritation to the surface of her environmental suit. Tali\u2019s suit was armoured, with even the softest \u2018padding\u2019 of her clothing interlaced with weaved fibres of titanium and absorbent gels, but the act alone was repulsive enough.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWithout consciously thinking about it, Tali clenched her finger and thumb together, slowly crushing the fifteen-millimetre-tall humanoid between the space of her digits until only bloodied flesh and broken bones remained.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nStill somewhat disgusted by the experience, Tali had been about about to reach down towards the utility belt at her waist to pull free an antiseptic wipe when she suddenly remembered the other tiny humanoids still beneath her. She had been so engrossed with the one in her hand, Tali and not taken notice of the other tiny humanoids congregating around her feet, and now at least a dozen were busy gnawing at the base of her boots. There were at least a dozen of them, and more approaching<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cYou little bosh\u2019tet\u2019s\u201d Tali almost screamed, \u201cGet away from me\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe lifted her foot, the movement alone knocking over at least half of the little pests. Her hands clenching to fists at her sides, Tali flexed her colossal dual toes above the titans, any suspicion at the back of her mind that these pests were humans that had somehow found themselves micronized being quietly quashed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTali brought her foot down on the offending humanoid bugs with a violent stomp, her boot sinking into the soft ground almost to her ankle. She felt the tiny humanoid forms beneath the hard surface of her foot popping and squishing beneath her sole.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTheir companions didn\u2019t get the hint, continuing to bite and gnaw at the surface of Tali\u2019s other boot. They were subsequently the next ones Tali crushed, this time beneath the hard surface of her toes.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was like stepping on starved scuttleroaches, the type of insects that infested starships and could never be exterminated quickly enough. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs a rule, Quarian\u2019s detested insects of all forms. Insects carried diseases, pilfered food stores, used up valuable oxygen supplies and ate through starship cabling. No Quarian suffered an insect to live in their sleeping quarters, home or ship, and it was with exactly this loathing hatred that Tali came to view the titans after her first encounter.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were little more than bugs to her, and any more that Tali happened to find in her path, she made a special effort to crush beneath her boots.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nDespite her initial revulsion, something about the titan\u2019s presence still unsettled Tali and it was not their disgustingly zombie like state of intelligence. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThat wall had been built for a reason, and whoever had constructed it must have had a more than basic grasp of engineering and mathematics, and thus an above adequate level of intelligence. Even as she thought about it and recalled the dimensions of the miniature wall, Tali realized that the oddly proportioned and misshapen titans were several times to large to make adequate use of the gatehouses, towers and other fortifications along the wall. In fact, everything Tali had observed of them so far made it abundantly clear that the titan\u2019s could not have constructed the wall themselves. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSo, who had?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was perhaps after another full hour of fruitless walking, her feet aching that Tali came upon her second sign of civilisation. She had been walking through a forested region, the great trees little more than blades of neatly cut grass to her when she glimpsed the tiny reflection of sunlight.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAt the centre of the forest where a small clearing had been made a tiny cluster of buildings stood, the tiny hamlet surrounded by what Tali quickly realized were finally cultivated fields divided neatly by their own insignificantly small fences and stone walls.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was a farm.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTali altered her path, and within but a handful of steps she was virtually on top of the tiny farm, her foot descending to flatten a great portion of the woodlands that bordered the cultivated farmland beneath her armoured tread. She flexed her foot, her colossal dual toes sinking into the finally ploughed fields that surrounded the farm, each toe leaving a sunken crater wide enough to accommodate a dozen vehicles at least.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It occurred to Tali that she may have just unintentionally crushed a great deal of natural wildlife in the form of birds, rodents and antelope. Under normal circumstances this may have upset her deeply, but at this point in the day Tali really didn\u2019t care what may have killed when she stepped down. She had yet to see any actual proof that creatures of actual intelligence still inhabited this galaxy forsaken island she now found herself upon.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTali\u2019s gigantic gloved hands found their way to her hips, and with an almost leisurely grace the Quarian cast eyes downwards towards the tiny farm at her boots. Light glinted off the faceplate of her oval visor, momentarily obscuring her sight. Tali gave her helmet a moment to adjust, and soon her visor was darkening, the image of the clustered barns and utility sheds that surrounded the single stone houses at the farms centre suddenly magnifying several times in size before her eyes.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThere were tiny flickers of movement across the farmland, Tali\u2019s lips curling in disgust beneath her visor at what she saw.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMore Titans!<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe place was infested with them, but something was different.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThere were other humanoids down there, all of them significantly smaller than even the smallest titans, but unlike the bigger humanoids they were clothed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe titans were eating them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBlood, entrails and half gnawed and mutilated limbs were splashed across the farm like confetti. There were perhaps two dozen of the smaller humanoids as far as Tali could see, most of them inside the farm. A handful clustered around what Tali quickly realized were the remains of two primitive thatched wagons, the type\u2019s ancient cultures relied on domesticated bovine or other beasts of burden to pull. For all intents and purposes they were almost identical to humans, with the exception of their almost microscopic size.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWhatever alien race these \u2018humans\u2019 really were, the larger naked titans were massacring them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nClearly, they had been fleeing some kind of disaster judging from how unprepared they appeared, and these titans had set upon them, pinning them into the farm to been exterminated.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTali watched as one of the titans plucked a fleeing human female from behind an outhouse, the disgusting creature lifting the screaming women over its mouth. That titan was less then fifteen millimetres tall to Tali, yet by her own quick calculations the Quarian estimated that the titan must have been fifty foot high from the almost microscopic human\u2019s perspective. It was with a great deal of unease that Tali watched the titan drop the bawling and terrified woman into its open mouth, its jaw clamping tight as it bit down into her still struggling form, biting through the tiny humans arms as she shrieked in agony, blood splashing out from the titans maw as it gulped her down alive.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe humans themselves were almost unperceivable to Tali\u2019s eyes, and if it was not the magnification her helmet offered Tali doubted she would have even noticed them at all. Now that she took her time to observe them Tali noticed the vast majority of those who still survived were simple women and children, a handful of men and boys as well. The adults alone could not have been more than a couple of millimetres tall from Tali\u2019s perspective, the children even tinier to her by comparison.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<b>By the God\u2019s{/i} Tali thought. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe must have over a mile tall from their perspective.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTali was suddenly very aware of the very real nightmare she was in, as well as the spectacle her appearance had caused.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nDown below the apparent massacre she had stumbled upon seemed to have paused, and Tali quickly realized that her last step had seem to cause a miniature earthquake to the tiny human\u2019s and titans, toppling some and blasting the others back by the force of her footfall alone. Many of the almost microscopic humans seemed to regard her with fear, yet true to their earlier behaviour many of the titans seemed oblivious to her presence as they stumbled back to their feet to lumber after the tiny humans.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nUnder her visored helm Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya pursed her lips together, unsure for the moment what she should do;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What does Tali decide to do;</b></b></span></div></div>",

If Daro\u2019Xen vas Moreh feels it is in her interest to destroy entire cities and their collective populations, even if her motives in such actions is to simply to reveal in the pleasure that she can, then I have no doubt those cities will be crushed flat beneath the soles of this Quarian woman\u2019s boots.

She seems convinced that because this Forzan vas Idenna bares a womb in her stomach, this will somehow make her sympathetic to the Eldian\u2019s plight. As a result, she will be loath to take any action that may result in unnecessary death and suffering to the near microscopic Eldian children, to whom she may be inclined to feel some maternal compassion towards\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I am somewhat more cynical in my ancient age compared to my daughter. Forzan vas Idenna is unique to this experiment as unlike the majority of our other potential candidates, she is also a mother, having given birth to a live Quarian infant less than a standard\u2026&lt;terran&gt;\u2026year ago. I have left the offspring in the relative safe company of her family within the Quarian flotilla for the duration of this experiment. The fact that this Quarian female bears a live offspring would seem to strengthen my daughter\u2019s argument, at least to one with a less sceptical mind then myself. Forzan vas Idenna will surely be inclined to feel some form of maternal affection and protectiveness towards the indigenous Eldian children, and thus loathe to take any action that may result in her killing untold numbers of those same Eldian children as a result of her gigantic size and scale. Whilst Vorazun\u2019s argument is thus in theory sound, she does not truly appreciate the maternal bond and desire this Quarian woman will feel to be reunited with her own child upon the flotilla, or the cruelties and destruction she will be willing to inflict upon the indigenous Eldian\u2019s to ensure this happens. Forzan vas Idenna may well try to limit the death toll and destruction caused by her actions, going out of her way to avoid crushing any errant Eldian\u2019s or population centres she comes across, but when her Omni-tool leads her to the Eldian\u2019s capital and the package I have placed beneath it, she will be left with only a single choice. Yes, this Quarian mother may ultimately feel regret over any Eldian children she kills when she proceeds to exhume and destroy the great city in search of her prize, but if that is ultimately the price that must be paid, then I have little doubt that Forzan vas Idenna will crush any city she comes across if she feels it necessary to do so, regardless of the cost in Eldian lives\u2026    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026daughter persists that I am wrong, and she is right in this matter\u2026so we have agreed, a little wager. If she is proved correct\u2026I have promised not to carry out another planetary extermination event for at least another millennium. But if Forzan vas Idenna actions provide my daughter wrong\u2026Vorazun shall withdrew her protection of the Orion spiral arm, and allow me to purge any world I desire of all life. I have been looking forward to dealing with that pestilent little race of\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026my daughter know, that I will not be keeping my promise. If against all my expectations and assumptions, this Quarian decides starvation and death is preferable to mass murder, then I shall reach out into the corporeal world\u2026take physical form within\u2026the Eldian\u2019s\u2026star system\u2026enclose my\u2026&lt;claws&gt;\u2026around the entire planet, and crush the entire world to dust within my palm\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026homeworld will be next.

As a species this race is\u2026use to great economic and social\u2026hardship and persecution at the\u2026 &lt;claws&gt;\u2026 of other corporeal races in stronger positions of\u2026and economic power.

The\u2026technology incorporated into the Quarian\u2019s environmental suit is\u2026significantly more technologically advanced, and incorporates cyclonic energy shielding. Nothing the native Eldian\u2019s possess will be capable of even scratching her suit. Her own integrated weaponry however\u2026suit contains a full array of visual and communication equipment.

All eyes were raised to the fifty metre high wall and the skinless yet very human like head that soared above it, a dark and unnatural shadow protruding across the centre of the district as the titan; colossal beyond all reckoning looked down upon the little humans with hunger.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex stared up at the giant\u2019s head, his lips parted and mouth dry in the summer heat of the afternoon, the boy\u2019s tongue stubbornly still and unmoving inside his mouth.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh God\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s a titan\u201d Sara whispered from behind him, the hand of his adopted sister clasped around his, her nails digging into his palm.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMovement flickered at the corner of his eye, and instinctively Alex knew that one of their two younger siblings was beside them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWas it Billy, or Jessica?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex could not turn his head to see, so thawed with fear the young boy was.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nScarcely a minute before, the four young siblings had all been happy and laughing, the children enjoying the afternoon sunshine which had seen them relaxing in the central plaza of Shiganshina district.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were homeless street orphans all of them, related neither by blood, marriage or money, but instead by the need of young children to find solace and comfort in a society that had all but abandoned them. Alex was the oldest of them at twelve years of age, with Sara the older \u2018sister\u2019 of the group at ten. Billy was eight, and Jessica six. They looked out for each other, protected each other, and together the four siblings formed a close knit family that survived together in the poorest region of the kingdom behind the walls.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThat momentary happiness between the hunger, the freezing nights spent upon cold city streets and hiding from corrupt soldiers of the city garrison seemed a distant dream in Alex\u2019s past now as the huge face of the titan looked down upon them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026not possible\u2026\u201d Billy stammered, \u201c\u2026that wall is over fifty metres tall. That titan\u2019s got to be\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cOver Two Hundred feet high\u201d Alex finished.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIs that a titan?\u201d Jessica asked, her voice as innocently na\u00efve as it always was.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe have to get out of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBefore Alex could finish a thunderous crash shook the district, Wall Maria seeming to groan with the sound of cracking rock as the ground shook beneath the four children\u2019s feet, and then the centre of the Curtain wall was smashed outwards in a churning explosion of dust and debris.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex was suddenly snapped from his stupor. Grasping his siblings by their arms he dragged them towards the nearest building as chucks of the broken wall peppered the city. Slabs of stone and mortar smashed through buildings, flattened houses and peppered streets, cutting down and crushing anyone unfortunate enough to find themselves in their path.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBlood splashed across the cobbled streets and walls as the first screams echoed across the district, fear giving way to panic as the full realization of what had just happened dawned upon the little township\u2019s inhabitants.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re though the walls!\u201d someone screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs he was helping Billy to his feet, Alex turned towards wall, his gut twisting like a knife inside his stomach. Wall Maria still stood, the Colossal Titan suddenly gone as quickly as it had appeared, but from the gaping hole it had smashed through the lower segment of the wall, lanky and pale humanoid forms many times taller than a man were emerging, gapping wide toothed mouths open atop bobbing listing heads, their swollen human like eyes searching hungrily for flesh.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTitans!<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to the gate\u201d Alex shouted, grasping Jessica\u2019s arm as he did so, \u201cSara, take Billy\u2019s hand. Don\u2019t let go.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got no papers\u201d Sara cried, \u201cThey won\u2019t let us through.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to try. Come On!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTogether, the four orphans sprinted across the open plaza, a large crowd already forming across the mouth of the Aquila thoroughfare, the most direct route to the only remaining gate out of Shiganshina District, and deeper into the Kingdom behind the Walls.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs they approached the avenue, just how hopeless their situation was becoming apparent to Alex very quickly. Shiganshina District contained over twenty thousand permanently resident men, women and children, and it seemed that every single one of them today was gathered into a single swelling crowd that blocked the main intersection of the thoroughfare, their numbers growing with every passing second.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA thin line of city guardsmen from the Royal Garrison were clustered around the baying mob, their distinctive blue trench coats marking them out amongst the crowd. Futilely they tried to bring some semblance of order to chaotic crowd, the militiamen burnishing their cumbersome bolt-action rifles into the air.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was just as Alex and his three siblings reached the edge of the crowd that the sound of crumbling brick and masonry echoed across the open plaza. Panting for breath Alex turned, his three siblings pausing to follow his gaze towards the other end of the square, just in time to see a titan clambering over a triple storied house.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe titan was perhaps five or six metres tall, its giant form lurching drunkenly forward as it tried to navigate its way over the house, one long leg coming down upon the buildings balcony. The was a grinding off broken tiles and then suddenly the titan was plunging through the second storey roof, its arms flailing uselessly as it tried to dig its way free, and then the second titan appeared.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was at least twice as tall of the first, and unlike its companion it emerged from the closest street, a third titan stumbling forth in its wake. More titans suddenly appeared, their slow unwieldy forms rising from behind the row of houses and shops that lined the plaza and adjacent  roads, roofs and walls, an overhanging bridge collapsing as one smashed its way into the plaza, the tallest amongst them standing over fourteen metres high.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThere in the square!\u201d someone shouted.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGuardsman\u201d shouted a thick voice, \u201cForm Up. Deploy the howitzers!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA line of guardsmen detached themselves from the crowd, running past Alex, Sara, Billy and Jessica as they stormed into the square. The tracked carriages of half a dozen matt-black howitzer cannons were pulled out with them, the soldiers forming a line about a hundred strong as they levelled their rifles and cannons towards the approaching titans. A thickly build man in a sergeants uniform emerged from their ranks. The man sported a curling moustache, and burnished a sword which he now swept through the air.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cFire!\u201d the sergeant screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex clasped his hands over his ears, shouting at his siblings to do the same as the first volley fired, the whistling <i>crack</i> of close to a hundred rifles suddenly followed by explosive <i>boom</i> as the howitzers lets loose, the tracks of the heavy artillery guns lurching backwards with the force of the blast.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe rifle volley slammed into the oncoming titans, peppering their wiry misshapen bodies as the artillery rounds ripped through limbs, human like blood splashing across the plaza floor. Alex saw a titan stumble and fall, its nightmarish face reduced to a bloody stump where one of the howitzers had caught its head and ripped it clean off, but to his horror Alex could see its body already fighting to regain its footing, a twisting mass of flesh atop its neck already reforming as it head began to grow back.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nNo more than two of the titans had been felled by the solders first volley, and at least a dozen more were already shambling forwards, the closest halfway across the square already.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cReload\u201d the sergeant shouted, \u201cProtect the civilians at all costs.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe soldiers fired again, and the lead titan was cut down, but then another was shambling forwards in its place, its ten-metre-high form towering above the thin line of soldiers who were still reloading.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we do!\u201d Sara screamed from behind Alex, \u201cWe\u2019re trapped.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex turned back to the crowd, his heart sinking. Without the guardsmen there to police the evacuation, the crowd that still blocked the intersection had descended into an even more chaotic mass as people punched, kicked and clawed at each other, the press of so many human bodies preventing all but a handful from moving forward. Already Alex could see more titans worming their way around the plazas edge, and instinctively he knew they intended to flank the soldiers. The dumb brute\u2019s tiny animal like minds had deduced the quickest possible path to the crowd.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThat intersection would soon become a bloodbath.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cAlex!\u201d Sara screamed, Jessica and Billy crying behind her \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cFollow me\u201d Alex shouted. Leading Jessica again by her arm, Alex sprinted across the edge of square, Sara and Billy hard on his heels. Steeling a glance over his shoulder, Alex glimpsed a titan in amongst detachment of soldiers. Their line reeled, a squirming human form suspended at least eight metres off the ground in the meaty fist of a titan. The soldier convulsed inside the titan\u2019s fist as the fingers of the giant crushed his torso, blood frothing from the man\u2019s lips as his companions fired their rifles upwards.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex twisted back his head, swerving to avoid a discarded box of rotting fish. Jessica cried out as her foot struck the box, but Alex continued to pull her after him, ignoring his baby sisters whimpering. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nRather than the intersection, Alex led them to one of the plaza\u2019s corners, where the sewage of the both Shiganshina eastern and northern drainage ditches met in a low-slung trench. Jumping into the filthy knee deep water Alex grasped hold of the thin grated wire-mesh plate that blocked the entrance to the underground pipe and pulled with all his might.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe plate groaned, one edge peeling free from the waterproof brickwork to which it was stuck. The thin wire-mesh twisted between his fingers, blood dripping from between his nails, then with one last groan the thinly stripped metal came apart, the grated plate coming out in his hands.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s open\u201d Alex said, \u201cCome on, get in. Get in!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSara was the first in, dragging a now sobbing Jessica behind her as the two girls descended to their knees and disappeared into the pipe. Billy was next, Alex pushing his younger brother into the pipe with both hands before turning back to the square, the water suddenly trembling around him.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTurning back towards the plaza, Alex\u2019s heart sunk. At least a dozen titans were now amongst the guardsmen, and almost each and every one of the giant freaks had the limbs of a screaming and struggling soldier clasped in their huge hands, obvious to the scattered rifle fire tearing into their flesh as they feasted upon their screaming, still living victims.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA titan chased a fleeing soldier, the man dropping his spent rifle only to be plucked from the ground, kicking at the thick meaty fingers that had grasped hold of his leg. His screams echoed across the square as the titan clamped its huge mouth around his torso, thick arterial blood spurting upwards. A howitzer fired, blowing the arm of another titan clean off as its crew tried to reload, then another titan was upon them, overturning the cannon and crushing one of the surviving soldiers, one of his companions hurriedly reloading his rifle as another fled.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMovement from the corner of his eyes caught Alex attention, and suddenly the young boy realized a titan was lumbering towards him, the water splashing upwards around his legs. It was a big titan, almost fifteen metres tall, and it was almost upon him.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nDiving to his knees Alex scrambled into the pipeway. From the corner of his eye his glimpsed one final shot of the plaza, the human soldiers dead or dying, the crowd at the intersection all but clawing over each other as the titans converged upon them, a towering fifteen metre tall titan plucking a man from the crowd to consume. And then there was the human sergeant in the middle of square, his sword still brandished into the air and handgun grasped in one hand, surrounded.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe approaching titan stumbled and fell, its clumsy flailing body landing straight atop the trench. Already in the pipe, a sudden surge of water splashed over Alex, the filthy liquid getting into his eyes, ears and mouth. Still the boy continued forward, the repetitive <i>splash splash splash</i> up ahead telling him that his siblings were still clambering through the tunnel further up.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cKeep going\u201d Alex screamed spitting out the fowl tasting water as he did so, \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was many minutes later that they reached the other end of the pipe, Sara poised at the entrance waiting for Alex while Billy and Jessica sat shivering in the closest alleyway.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHuman screams, alongside the sound of ripping flesh and breaking bones echoed across the rooftops, coming from where the crowd had been at the edge of the plaza.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep moving\u201d Alex said, rousing Billy and Jessica to their feet, \u201cGet up get up. They\u2019ll be closing the gate soon.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe children were now on Shiganshina District\u2019s northern side, only a few streets to the gateway. Hand in hand Alex led them forward, the four orphans emerging from the alleyway and into a small square, the ground suddenly shaking.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA titan emerged from atop the overhanging roofs, its towering form at least ten metres high. Its wide mouthed grinning visage regarded the young orphans with hunger, and suddenly one gangly arm was reaching down towards them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cRun!\u201d Alex shouted, pushing his siblings to one side. Together they dived under an overhanging archway, the titan half destroying the front of a shop was its attempt to grasp at them went wide.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTwisting on his heel Alex shoved Jessica and Billy forward, Sara running behind him and together the siblings sprinted beneath the titan\u2019s legs, the massive creature twisting it body to fast as it stumbled and fell.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe ground shook with the giant\u2019s collapse. Billy cried out as he stumbled forward, but Alex was behind him, pushing his younger brother to his feet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey emerged from the alleyway into the main thoroughfare, two mid-sized titans turning to meet them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cBack\u201d Alex shouted, the titan\u2019s arms coming up as they stumbled forwards, preparing to grasp at the human children, \u201cGet back!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nCannon fire ripped across the thoroughfare, smashing straight into the two titans. One of the titans took a cannon ball straight to the shoulder, the blast ripping apart half its torso whilst the second took a blow to its legs, the shot ripping them both clean off as thick arterial human like blood splashed across the walls and street.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGlancing the way the shots had come, Alex could see the inner gate. Six cannons and a gaggle of guardsman were gathered around the gate\u2019s entrance, waving the children forwards.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s still open\u201d Alex said, pulling Jessica and Billy into the street, \u201cCome on. Run!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey entered the thoroughfare, Alex and Sara each dragging one of their younger siblings after them. From the closest alleyways and streets other humans emerged, and soon they were part of small crowd filtering up the gate. The familiar sound of crumbling bricks and mortar echoed down the road.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGlancing over his shoulder as he ran, Alex saw a titan emerge from the thoroughfare\u2019s winding edge, at least two more behind it.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGet down\u201d a soldier screamed, Alex and Sara throwing their younger siblings to the ground as the cannons fired. The Oncoming titan was cut down as were two of the beast\u2019s companions. Alex twisted onto his back as the gigantic humanoids stumbled forwards and fell, limbs and heads ripped clean off, but already he could see movement behind them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGet up, get up!\u201d he said, rousing Jessica to her feet. The girl continued to sob as they pushed forward, Sara and Billy behind them, and then they were at the gate. A blond haired officer shoved them through the gigantic archway beneath the interior of wall Maria, and then suddenly for the first time in their lives Alex, Sara, Billy and Jessica were outside of Shiganshina district, and inside the interior of Wall Maria.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA vast expanse of open green fields and rolling hills stretched out as far as any of them could see, whilst a cobbled road and railway from the gateway ran all the way to the horizon. Somewhere far in the distance Alex knew Wall Rose stood, and beyond that Wall Sheena, and then the royal capital and the lavish Palace of the King. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAnother crowd greeted them, even larger than the one they had encountered in the plaza. The mass of huddled refugees from Shiganshina District was nestled between the small trading market that adjoined Wall Maria\u2019s Inner Gate, and the train station where a row of carriages were docked behind the puffing steam-train at the head of the tracks. A thin line of guardsman was gathered before the carriages, selecting people to take on and turning others away, their rifles pointed towards the crowd as a warning.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThere\u201d Alex said, \u201cCome on. We have to get on that last ship.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA sharp crack of artillery fire echoed from inside the gate as they approached the port, the crowd and soldiers tensing, yet no one tried to rush the train. Alex and his siblings made their way through  the press of the crowd, Alex maintaining a firm grip on Jessica\u2019s hand, who in turn had her hand gripped to Jessica\u2019s, who in turn was leading Billy at their rear.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBehind them another volley of artillery and rifle fire boomed, people glancing nervously back the way they had come.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d someone shouted up ahead, \u201cLet us on!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWomen and children only at this time Sir\u201d a reply came, \u201cAnother train will be here soon for the rest of you.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey reached the front of the crowd just as another volley of howitzer fire went off, the thin line of soldiers stretched out before the docked ships eying each other nervously as the crowd edged closer, then a man attempted to rush the nearest gangplank.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cStop him!\u201d an officer shouted.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTwo soldiers leapt forward to restrain the man, their compatriots raising their rifles to the crowd in warning.</span></div></div>",

Together the four children made their way forward, a shaven headed officer glancing up and waving them forward, his soldiers parting to let them on.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were just at the gangplank of the nearest ship when a forth volley of artillery fire echoed outwards from behind Wall Rose, this time the gunfire punctuated with a chorus of human screams. Alex turned his head, glimpsing the terrified looks on the faces of the crowd, and then the first scream went up.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThere right outside the gate!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWith that the crowd finally panicked and surged, dozens of people pushing their way forward as a soldier discharged his rifle into the crowd, then all hell broke loose. Hundreds of Shiganshina\u2019s townspeople were surging up the gang plank, the half a dozen or so soldiers guarding it being grappled to the ground and beaten as more rifles were fired into the roaring crowd.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex pulled Sara behind him, Jessica trying to do the same to Billy as the crowd surged into them, and then suddenly Alex was falling, thick hands grasping him by his collar and throwing him aside and back onto the dry-docks ledge<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cSara\u201d, Alex shouted, \u201cJessica!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIn the thick press of bodies Alex glimpsed Billy, his younger brother tossed to the ground the other side of the gang plank, struggling to return to his feet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t see his sisters.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThe engine! Fire up the engine. Before they swamp us.\u201d a voice screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe train suddenly lurched precariously to one side, over a dozen people screaming as they were thrown backwards from the carriages entrance.  Through the press of people, Alex glimpsed Sara and Jessica, the two girls staring back at them from behind the carriages window.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were safe, for now.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe other carriages were starting to move, the crews and passengers upending slamming closed the doors even as people continued to try and board them, hundreds of screaming refuges smashing their bloodied fists against the windows.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGlancing back towards the trading market across the road, Alex caught sight of a dozen wagons and horses, a ring of armed mercenaries holding back a smaller crowd just as the soldiers before the train had been a moment earlier.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nScrambling back to his feet, Alex found his way to Billy and pulled the young boy to his feet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we do\u201d his brother cried.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cFollow me.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex led his brother across the road and past the market, another round of artillery fire punctuating the screams of both crowds.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex and Billy wormed their way through the crowd and were soon within sight of the wagons. Whoever owned the caravan must have had a soft spot for the two orphans that day, for the ring of guards parted and they were dragged forward, the crowd yelling and clawing behind them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat about us!\u201d someone screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA tall mercenary with cropped black hair lifted Alex and Billy into one of the caravan\u2019s, the rear compartment so crammed with women, children and a small number of labourers that the two boys were forced to perch themselves upon the end, their legs dangling over the wagons parapet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, time to go!\u201d the caravan master shouted, and with that the drivers lashed their horses into action, the towering animals snorting as they began to trot forward, pulling the lumbering wheeled carts behind them. The mercenaries rushed back towards their caravans as the crowd surged after them, the caravan picking up speed as the boarded each of the wagons in turn, their fellow guards hanging from the carts edged to beat off the questing hands of the crowd with heavy truncheons.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex didn\u2019t think that they would make it out of the mob, but at the last moment the bulk of the crowd dispersed before the now charging horses, the few remaining men and women being trampled down by the heavy draft horses as they passed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was with a mixture of both relief and fatigue that Alex allowed himself to fall backwards onto the caravan\u2019s wooden floor. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIn the distance, the chugging steam train carrying Sara and Jessica receded towards the horizon, no doubt its way to Trost District.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey would be safe there, until Alex and Billy caught up with them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIs it over\u201d Billy asked.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cI think so\u201d Alex replied, \u201cWe\u2019re safe now.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Inner Gateway of Shiganshina District was just barely visible to them now, but Alex could see the gate coming down. They would close it, the titans would not follow and despite the hundreds of people who had died here today, that would be that.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was only a handful of seconds later that both boys saw the Inner gateway smash outwards, a fifteen-metre-tall armoured titan barrelling straight through the archway as if it had been made of sand.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt had finally happened.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe titans had breached wall Maria.</span></div></div>",

Deftly she recognized the symbol for <i>foreign contaminant</i> but could not recall what she was suppose to do until she felt the medical antibodies administered by her suit flooding into her bloodstream.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nDeep down at the back of her throat the Quarian could feel something begin to bubble and froth, and suddenly she knew she was about to be sick.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nPushing herself up onto one elbow the female shuddered, clenching her lips more out of reflex then actual conscious thought. Water trickled down from her back, small waves rippling forth in the water around her as she reached towards the Omni-tool at her wrist with her free hand, her gloved finger and thumb activating her suits environmental controls.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe coughed, her lips still clenched tightly behind gritted teeth, and with one final flick of her thumb she stabbed down at her Omni-tool, overriding the emergency ventilation port of her helmet. The cylindrical port which covered her mouth opened with a pressurised hiss, her lips parted and she vomited.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cOoogggg\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBlood, bile and a toxic mixture of broken down antibiotic paste plummeted down into the water below. The Quarian heaved again, her hand splashing down into the water, and faintly was she aware of the ground crumbling beneath her gloved palm, almost as if she had been a giant slamming her fist into the ground.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nJust as quickly had the sensation to gag had come over her, it passed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nClean filtered air fed by her suit pumped into her helmet and with a smooth gust of wind her mouth port closed, sealing her back inside her helmet. She breathed, a sensation of weightlessness momentarily overcoming her as a second round of antibiotics and endorphins flood through her bloodstream, purging any remnants of the contaminants which appeared to have temporarily breached her suit.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGroggily, the Quarian woman sat up, one hand still planted firmly behind her. Drawing her long legs up towards her chest, she flexed the toes of her boots and once she was satisfied she was reasonably stable, she tried to stand.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe movement of rising to her feet was relatively fluid, through she still felt a little unsteady. Perplexingly, she felt her boots sink slightly into the ground. It was not the sensation of her feet sinking into sand, but the impression of a million tiny fragments of shale crushing like ice beneath her bootsoles, yet whatever the strange substance she was standing on was, it seemed to support her weight.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Quarian found herself looking at her hand, her long fingers and thumb flexing beneath the heavy padding of her suit\u2019s gloves.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWho am I\u2026?\u201d the Quarian asked, her voice coming out as a metallic echo of the one she imagined hearing in her head. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSuddenly she found herself looking towards the horizon, the endless puddle of water seemingly to stretch around her in all directions.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nNeither question answered the other, though she could sense her name of the very tip of her tongue, and slowly memories began to resurface.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe titled her head towards the sky, the sunlight glancing of her visor. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was bright, unusually bright and she was forced to lift a hand to shield her eyes.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nUp there, beyond the blue sky of this world and into the dark blackness beyond was where she had come from.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe was a Quarian. Her people were a nomadic race of scavengers, engineers and scientists, forever doomed to travel the endless void of space within their sealed starships, to be sneered and loathed by those races and civilizations who still enjoyed the protection of their colonies and homeworlds. Somewhere deep down the Quarian knew that she despised them for that, and in her deepest darkest thoughts she sometimes found herself wishing unspeakable calamity upon those ignorant people and races. A dark shadow falling across the civilization of those who had never known hunger or loss, the tiny aliens fleeing as a boot of cruel malice ground them beneath its heel.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHer immune system was weak. That much she remembered clearly, hence the need for her sealed environmental suit, yet stubbornly her name and her personnel history escaped her.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nLowering her head, the Quarian glanced back towards the horizon. Her hands descended to her hips as she surveyed her surroundings, trying to make sense at what she saw.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThere was no beach, no landmass, and yet she knew she could not have been standing in the middle of an ocean with the water lapping around her boots.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm\u2026\u201d the Quarian mused, \u201cCould I be a giant\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe imagined tiny wooden sailing ships banking against the crushing waves beneath her ankles, the minuscule human like crews fighting against their rigging as she stepped backwards, oblivious to their presence even as she condemned them and their tiny wooden sailing ships to be crushed beneath her hard soles of her boots.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe idea was entertaining, if only for a moment, but quite preposterous.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe was woman of science, and therefore she knew that there must a reasonable explanation for the world she found herself on.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlmost as if it had been in response to the thought, she glimpsed something ahead, just below the horizon. Her visor dimmed to compensate for the intense light, and suddenly she could see a landmass ahead.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Quarian could have slapped a palm to her visor.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was right there!<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHow by the God\u2019s could she have missed it?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe landmass was shallow but she was sure that was just an effect of the light blocking her full view of the horizon and the mountains that would be beyond.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nJust as she was about to set off towards it, her Omni-tool bleeped.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTurning to the holographic terminal across her wrist, the Quarian tapped at the interface, her eyebrow rising in an almost quizzical gesture. Somewhere in the direction of the \u2018island\u2019 was a signal, perhaps a way for her to get off this world and back to the flotilla.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nEither way, it was better than staying here.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSmiling beneath her helmet, the Quarian took her first step towards the island. Water rippled outwards in tandems with her footfalls, and as she got closer more and more of the island could be seen.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was surprisingly flat from what she could see, but as more and more of the landmass came into focus she saw what might have been larger landmarks against the horizon. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nOr was it just a trick of her eyes?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Quarian woman was half way to setting foot on \u2018Paradise Island\u2019, and the besieged Kingdom behind the Walls when suddenly she remembered her name, and who she was;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-\tHer Name was</b></span></div></div>",

As a species this race is\u2026use to great economic and social\u2026hardship and persecution at the\u2026 &lt;claws&gt;\u2026 of other corporeal races in stronger positions of\u2026and economic power. It will therefore be\u2026interesting to\u2026witness how she chooses to interact, when presented with another\u2026&lt;alien&gt;\u2026race who by circumstance, are so incredibly at her mercy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026location for this experiment\u2026I have found a world unique to our requirements\u2026indigenous race known as Eldian\u2019s, almost identical too\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026in almost every way accept\u2026scale makes them almost microscopic in comparison to most humanoid races in the galaxy. Even more uniquely\u2026besieged by a race of mutated\u2026humanoids the Eldian\u2019s have collectively dubbed \u2018titans\u2019\u2026behind three circular walls which comprise the majority of the island\u2019s central landmass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Eldian\u2019s are still pre-space faring, and their technology consists largely of crude breech loading rifles and artillery\u2026all of which will be quite useless against the Quarian giantess once she arrives. The\u2026technology incorporated into the Quarian\u2019s environmental suit is\u2026significantly more technologically advanced, and incorporates cyclonic energy shielding. Nothing the native Eldian\u2019s possess will be capable of even scratching her suit. Her own integrated weaponry however\u2026suit contains a full array of visual and communication equipment. The magnification her helmet offers will allow her to view the Eldian civilisation and miniaturized people in near perfect detail. She will be able to hear them, understand them, translate their language, and even establish verbal communication is she wishes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I shall place the\u2026&lt;Quarian&gt;\u2026female known as\u2026Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya\u2026 just off the coast of the\u2026landmass. From the ingenious inhabitant\u2019s perspective\u2026she will be a ridiculously towering giant, over five\u2026&lt;miles&gt;\u2026tall\u2026I have placed a package beneath the centre of the Eldian\u2019s civilization and largest city\u2026which will provide her instantaneous transmission and communication to the Quarian flotilla. The Quarian female\u2019s Omni-tool should lead her straight to the heart of their kingdom\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026how will she react? Will she attempt to communicate with the indigenous Eldian\u2019s\u2026ask them politely to promptly evacuate their capital before she levels their entire city, ripping out the urbanized heart of their civilization in order to dig out her package\u2026simply step or them, as if they were nothing more than a collection of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026my daughter, Vorazun does not share my sentiment. She seems convinced that because this Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya bares a womb in her stomach, this will somehow make her sympathetic to the Eldian\u2019s plight. As a result, she will be loath to take any action that may result in unnecessary death and suffering to the near microscopic Eldian children, to whom she may be inclined to feel some maternal compassion towards\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I am somewhat more cynical in my ancient age compared to my daughter. True, from what her profile tells me, Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya is not a naturally cruel and malicious woman, but she is still a\u2026&lt;organic&gt;\u2026origin, and thus prone to same pleasures and prejudices of her kind. She may ponder, she may pause, and she may even come to regret her actions in\u2026&lt;years&gt;\u2026to come. Still, I have no doubt that when she encounters this miniaturized race of humanoids, and realizes she can with but a single step annihilate entire cities, a necessary evil in order to return to her beloved flotilla, she will not hesitate to bring unfathomable destruction to the their civilization, if she believes it in her interest to do so. The native Eldian\u2019s are after all little more than near microscopic insects to her, and this is exactly how she will come to view them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026daughter persists that I am wrong, and she is right in this matter\u2026so we have agreed, a little wager. If she is proved correct\u2026I have promised not to carry out another planetary extermination event for at least another millennium.

Whilst it is true that from what her profile tells me, this Shala\u2019Raan vas Tonbay is not a woman naturally inclined to inflicting cruelty and destruction upon others, she is also a soldier, her morality and sensibilities skewed and twisted by decades of hardship and persecution. When she encounters this miniaturized race of humanoids and comes to the rapid conclusion that her only option if she wishes to return to her beloved flotilla is to bring untold devastation and genocide to their civilization, then I suspect she shall waste little time quibbling over the question of whether she has any right to do so. It is my firm belief Shala\u2019Raan vas Tonbay shall resign herself to this grim task with little pause for hesitation, crushing any errant Eldian\u2019s who find themselves unfortunate enough to fall beneath the footfalls of her boots as she sets out upon her task. She shall make her way straight to the heart of the indigenous Eldian\u2019s kingdom, destroying any armies they throw against her, and proceed to lay waste to their capital as she attempts to locate the package I have placed beneath the city for her to find. As I have already said, Shala\u2019Raan vas Tonbay is not a woman naturally inclined to cruelty or violence, but when confronted with the simple choice of life, the indigenous Eldian\u2019s collective lives, or hers, why would she be inclined to show such kindness, when all her people have ever known from alien civilizations is unrelenting hatred and persecution\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026daughter persists that I am wrong, and she is right in this matter\u2026so we have agreed, a little wager.

Forzan vas Idenna is unique to this experiment as unlike the majority of our other potential candidates, she is also a mother, having given birth to a live Quarian infant less than a standard\u2026&lt;terran&gt;\u2026year ago. I have left the offspring in the relative safe company of her family within the Quarian flotilla for the duration of this experiment. The fact that this Quarian female bears a live offspring would seem to strengthen my daughter\u2019s argument, at least to one with a less sceptical mind then myself. Forzan vas Idenna will surely be inclined to feel some form of maternal affection and protectiveness towards the indigenous Eldian children, and thus loathe to take any action that may result in her killing untold numbers of those same Eldian children as a result of her gigantic size and scale. Whilst Vorazun\u2019s argument is thus in theory sound, she does not truly appreciate the maternal bond and desire this Quarian woman will feel to be reunited with her own child upon the flotilla, or the cruelties and destruction she will be willing to inflict upon the indigenous Eldian\u2019s to ensure this happens. Forzan vas Idenna may well try to limit the death toll and destruction caused by her actions, going out of her way to avoid crushing any errant Eldian\u2019s or population centres she comes across, but when her Omni-tool leads her to the Eldian\u2019s capital and the package I have placed beneath it, she will be left with only a single choice. Yes, this Quarian mother may ultimately feel regret over any Eldian children she kills when she proceeds to exhume and destroy the great city in search of her prize, but if that is ultimately the price that must be paid, then I have little doubt that Forzan vas Idenna will crush any city she comes across if she feels it necessary to do so, regardless of the cost in Eldian lives\u2026    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026daughter persists that I am wrong, and she is right in this matter\u2026so we have agreed, a little wager.

As a species this race is\u2026use to great economic and social\u2026hardship and persecution at the\u2026 &lt;claws&gt;\u2026 of other corporeal races in stronger positions of\u2026and economic power. It will therefore be\u2026interesting to\u2026witness how she chooses to interact, when presented with another\u2026&lt;alien&gt;\u2026race who by circumstance, are so incredibly at her mercy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026location for this experiment\u2026I have found a world unique to our requirements\u2026indigenous race known as Eldian\u2019s, almost identical too\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026in almost every way accept\u2026scale makes them almost microscopic in comparison to most humanoid races in the galaxy. Even more uniquely\u2026besieged by a race of mutated\u2026humanoids the Eldian\u2019s have collectively dubbed \u2018titans\u2019\u2026behind three circular walls which comprise the majority of the island\u2019s central landmass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Eldian\u2019s are still pre-space faring, and their technology consists largely of crude breech loading rifles and artillery\u2026all of which will be quite useless against the Quarian giantess once she arrives. The\u2026technology incorporated into the Quarian\u2019s environmental suit is\u2026significantly more technologically advanced, and incorporates cyclonic energy shielding. Nothing the native Eldian\u2019s possess will be capable of even scratching her suit. Her own integrated weaponry however\u2026suit contains a full array of visual and communication equipment. The magnification her helmet offers will allow her to view the Eldian civilisation and miniaturized people in near perfect detail. She will be able to hear them, understand them, translate their language, and even establish verbal communication is she wishes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I shall place the\u2026&lt;Quarian&gt;\u2026female known as...&lt;translation error&gt;... just off the coast of the\u2026landmass. From the ingenious inhabitant\u2019s perspective\u2026she will be a ridiculously towering giant, over five\u2026&lt;miles&gt;\u2026tall\u2026I have placed a package beneath the centre of the Eldian\u2019s civilization and largest city\u2026which will provide her instantaneous transmission and communication to the Quarian flotilla. The Quarian female\u2019s Omni-tool should lead her straight to the heart of their kingdom\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026how will she react? Will she attempt to communicate with the indigenous Eldian\u2019s\u2026ask them politely to promptly evacuate their capital before she levels their entire city, ripping out the urbanized heart of their civilization in order to dig out her package\u2026simply step or them, as if they were nothing more than a collection of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026my daughter, Vorazun does not share my sentiment. She seems convinced that because this ...&lt;translation error&gt;... bares a womb in her stomach, this will somehow make her sympathetic to the Eldian\u2019s plight. As a result, she will be loath to take any action that may result in unnecessary death and suffering to the near microscopic Eldian children, to whom she may be inclined to feel some maternal compassion towards\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I am somewhat more cynical in my ancient age compared to my daughter. True, the Quarian female we have selected is an anomaly, thus neither I nor my daughter can accurately predict how she will conduct herself once the reality of her situation becomes apparent. Whilst she may not be a naturally cruel or bloodthirsty woman, this Quarian is still a\u2026&lt;organic&gt;\u2026and thus prone to all her kind\u2019s irrational paranoia and brutality once she is removed from an environment she is familiar with. Once she realizes the situation she is in, this\u2026&lt;translation error&gt;\u2026may hesitate, she may even pause to deliberate, but when she realizes that the only way to return to her beloved flotilla is to destroy the centre of the Eldian\u2019s native kingdom, I am confident her true nature shall be revealed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026daughter persists that I am wrong, and she is right in this matter\u2026so we have agreed, a little wager. If she is proved correct\u2026I have promised not to carry out another planetary extermination event for at least another millennium. But if ...&lt;translation error&gt;... actions provide my daughter wrong\u2026Vorazun shall withdrew her protection of the Orion spiral arm, and allow me to purge any world I desire of all life.

All eyes were raised to the fifty metre high wall and the skinless yet very human like head that soared above it, a dark and unnatural shadow protruding across the centre of the district as the titan; colossal beyond all reckoning looked down upon the little humans with hunger.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex stared up at the giant\u2019s head, his lips parted and mouth dry in the summer heat of the afternoon, the boy\u2019s tongue stubbornly still and unmoving inside his mouth.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh God\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s a titan\u201d Sara whispered from behind him, the hand of his adopted sister clasped around his, her nails digging into his palm.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMovement flickered at the corner of his eye, and instinctively Alex knew that one of their two younger siblings was beside them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWas it Billy, or Jessica?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex could not turn his head to see, so thawed with fear the young boy was.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nScarcely a minute before, the four young siblings had all been happy and laughing, the children enjoying the afternoon sunshine which had seen them relaxing in the central plaza of Shiganshina district.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were homeless street orphans all of them, related neither by blood, marriage or money, but instead by the need of young children to find solace and comfort in a society that had all but abandoned them. Alex was the oldest of them at twelve years of age, with Sara the older \u2018sister\u2019 of the group at ten. Billy was eight, and Jessica six. They looked out for each other, protected each other, and together the four siblings formed a close knit family that survived together in the poorest region of the kingdom behind the walls.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThat momentary happiness between the hunger, the freezing nights spent upon cold city streets and hiding from corrupt soldiers of the city garrison seemed a distant dream in Alex\u2019s past now as the huge face of the titan looked down upon them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026not possible\u2026\u201d Billy stammered, \u201c\u2026that wall is over fifty metres tall. That titan\u2019s got to be\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cOver Two Hundred feet high\u201d Alex finished.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIs that a titan?\u201d Jessica asked, her voice as innocently na\u00efve as it always was.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe have to get out of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBefore Alex could finish a thunderous crash shook the district, Wall Maria seeming to groan with the sound of cracking rock as the ground shook beneath the four children\u2019s feet, and then the centre of the Curtain wall was smashed outwards in a churning explosion of dust and debris.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex was suddenly snapped from his stupor. Grasping his siblings by their arms he dragged them towards the nearest building as chucks of the broken wall peppered the city. Slabs of stone and mortar smashed through buildings, flattened houses and peppered streets, cutting down and crushing anyone unfortunate enough to find themselves in their path.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBlood splashed across the cobbled streets and walls as the first screams echoed across the district, fear giving way to panic as the full realization of what had just happened dawned upon the little township\u2019s inhabitants.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re though the walls!\u201d someone screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs he was helping Billy to his feet, Alex turned towards wall, his gut twisting like a knife inside his stomach. Wall Maria still stood, the Colossal Titan suddenly gone as quickly as it had appeared, but from the gaping hole it had smashed through the lower segment of the wall, lanky and pale humanoid forms many times taller than a man were emerging, gapping wide toothed mouths open atop bobbing listing heads, their swollen human like eyes searching hungrily for flesh.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTitans!<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to the gate\u201d Alex shouted, grasping Jessica\u2019s arm as he did so, \u201cSara, take Billy\u2019s hand. Don\u2019t let go.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got no papers\u201d Sara cried, \u201cThey won\u2019t let us through.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to try. Come On!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTogether, the four orphans sprinted across the open plaza, a large crowd already forming across the mouth of the Aquila thoroughfare, the most direct route to the only remaining gate out of Shiganshina District, and deeper into the Kingdom behind the Walls.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs they approached the avenue, just how hopeless their situation was becoming apparent to Alex very quickly. Shiganshina District contained over forty thousand permanently resident men, women and children, and it seemed that every single one of them today was gathered into a single swelling crowd that blocked the main intersection of the thoroughfare, their numbers growing with every passing second.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA thin line of city guardsmen from the Royal Garrison were clustered around the baying mob, their distinctive khaki uniforms and caps marking them out amongst the crowd. Futilely they tried to bring some semblance of order to chaotic crowd, the soldiers burnishing their semi-automatic rifles and submachine guns into the air.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was just as Alex and his three siblings reached the edge of the crowd that the sound of crumbling brick and masonry echoed across the open plaza. Panting for breath Alex turned, his three siblings pausing to follow his gaze towards the other end of the square, just in time to see a titan clambering over a triple storied house.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe titan was perhaps five or six metres tall, its giant form lurching drunkenly forward as it tried to navigate its way over the house, one long leg coming down upon the buildings balcony. The was a grinding off broken tiles and then suddenly the titan was plunging through the second storey roof, its arms flailing uselessly as it tried to dig its way free, and then the second titan appeared.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was at least twice as tall of the first, and unlike its companion it emerged from the closest street, a third titan stumbling forth in its wake. More titans suddenly appeared, their slow unwieldy forms rising from behind the row of houses and shops that lined the plaza and adjacent  roads, roofs and walls, an overhanging bridge collapsing as one smashed its way into the plaza, the tallest amongst them standing over fourteen metres high.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThere in the square!\u201d someone shouted.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGuardsman\u201d shouted a thick voice, \u201cForm Up. Deploy the half-tracks!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA line of soldiers detached themselves from the crowd, running past Alex, Sara, Billy and Jessica as they stormed into the square. A dozen armoured halftracks grinded their way outwards onto plaza, each vehicle sporting a heavy artillery cannon on its back, the soldiers formed a line about a few hundred strong, levelling their rifles and cannons towards the approaching titans. A thickly build man in a sergeants uniform emerged from their ranks. The man sported a curling moustache, and burnished a sword which he now swept through the air.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cFire!\u201d the sergeant screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex clasped his hands over his ears, shouting at his siblings to do the same as the first volley fired, the whistling <i>crack</i> of close to three hundred rifles suddenly followed by explosive <i>boom</i> as the halftracks cannons lets loose, each vehicle lurching backwards with the force of the blast.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe shots slammed into the oncoming titans, hundreds of bullets peppering their wiry misshapen bodies as the cannon shells ripped through limbs, human like blood splashing across the plaza floor. Alex saw a titan stumble and fall, its nightmarish face reduced to a bloody stump where one of the cannons had caught its head and ripped it clean off, but to his horror Alex could see its body already fighting to regain its footing, a twisting mass of flesh atop its neck already reforming as it head began to grow back.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nNo more than two of the titans had been felled by the solders first volley, and at least a dozen more were already shambling forwards, the closest halfway across the square already.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cReload\u201d the sergeant shouted, \u201cProtect the civilians at all costs.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe soldiers fired again, and the lead titan was cut down, but then another was shambling forwards in its place, its ten-metre-high form towering above the thin line of soldiers who were still reloading.<br>\r\n  \u201cWhat do we do!\u201d Sara screamed from behind Alex, \u201cWe\u2019re trapped.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex turned back to the crowd, his heart sinking. Without the guardsmen there to police the evacuation, the crowd that still blocked the intersection had descended into an even more chaotic mass as people punched, kicked and clawed at each other, the press of so many human bodies preventing all but a handful from moving forward. Already Alex could see more titans worming their way around the plazas edge, and instinctively he knew they intended to flank the soldiers. The dumb brute\u2019s tiny animal like minds had deduced the quickest possible path to the crowd.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThat intersection would soon become a bloodbath.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cAlex!\u201d Sara screamed, Jessica and Billy crying behind her \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cFollow me\u201d Alex shouted. Leading Jessica again by her arm, Alex sprinted across the edge of square, Sara and Billy hard on his heels. Steeling a glance over his shoulder, Alex glimpsed a titan in amongst detachment of soldiers. Their line reeled, a squirming human form suspended at least eight metres off the ground in the meaty fist of a titan. The soldier convulsed inside the titan\u2019s fist as the fingers of the giant crushed his torso, blood frothing from the man\u2019s lips as his companions fired their rifles upwards.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex twisted back his head, swerving to avoid a discarded box of rotting fish. Jessica cried out as her foot struck the box, but Alex continued to pull her after him, ignoring his baby sisters whimpering. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nRather than the intersection, Alex led them to one of the plaza\u2019s corners, where the sewage of the both Shiganshina eastern and northern drainage ditches met in a low-slung trench. Jumping into the filthy knee deep water Alex grasped hold of the thin grated wire-mesh plate that blocked the entrance to the underground pipe and pulled with all his might.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe plate groaned, one edge peeling free from the waterproof brickwork to which it was stuck. The thin wire-mesh twisted between his fingers, blood dripping from between his nails, then with one last groan the thinly stripped metal came apart, the grated plate coming out in his hands.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s open\u201d Alex said, \u201cCome on, get in. Get in!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSara was the first in, dragging a now sobbing Jessica behind her as the two girls descended to their knees and disappeared into the pipe. Billy was next, Alex pushing his younger brother into the pipe with both hands before turning back to the square, the water suddenly trembling around him.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTurning back towards the plaza, Alex\u2019s heart sunk. At least a dozen titans were now amongst the guardsmen, and almost each and every one of the giant freaks had the limbs of a screaming and struggling soldier clasped in their huge hands, obvious to the scattered gunfire tearing into their flesh as they feasted upon their screaming, still living victims.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA titan chased a fleeing soldier, the man dropping his spent submachine only to be plucked from the ground, kicking at the thick meaty fingers that had grasped hold of his leg. His screams echoed across the square as the titan clamped its huge mouth around his torso, thick arterial blood spurting upwards. A halftrack\u2019s cannon fired, blowing the arm of another titan clean off as its crew tried to reload, then another titan was upon them, overturning the cannon and crushing one of the surviving soldiers, one of his companions hurriedly reloading his rifle as another fled.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMovement from the corner of his eyes caught Alex attention, and suddenly the young boy realized a titan was lumbering towards him, the water splashing upwards around his legs. It was a big titan, almost fifteen metres tall, and it was almost upon him.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nDiving to his knees Alex scrambled into the pipeway. From the corner of his eye his glimpsed one final shot of the plaza, the human soldiers dead or dying, the crowd at the intersection all but clawing over each other as the titans converged upon them, a towering fifteen metre tall titan plucking a man from the crowd to consume. And then there was the human sergeant in the middle of square, his sword still brandished into the air and pistol grasped in one hand, surrounded.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe approaching titan stumbled and fell, its clumsy flailing body landing straight atop the trench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready in the pipe, a sudden surge of water splashed over Alex, the filthy liquid getting into his eyes, ears and mouth. Still the boy continued forward, the repetitive <i>splash splash splash</i> up ahead telling him that his siblings were still clambering through the tunnel further up.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cKeep going\u201d Alex screamed spitting out the fowl tasting water as he did so, \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was many minutes later that they reached the other end of the pipe, Sara poised at the entrance waiting for Alex while Billy and Jessica sat shivering in the closest alleyway.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHuman screams, alongside the sound of ripping flesh and breaking bones echoed across the rooftops, coming from where the crowd had been at the edge of the plaza.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep moving\u201d Alex said, rousing Billy and Jessica to their feet, \u201cGet up get up. They\u2019ll be closing the gate soon.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe children were now on Shiganshina District\u2019s northern side, only a few streets to the gateway. Hand in hand Alex led them forward, the four orphans emerging from the alleyway and into a small square, the ground suddenly shaking.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA titan emerged from atop the overhanging roofs, its towering form at least ten metres high. Its wide mouthed grinning visage regarded the young orphans with hunger, and suddenly one gangly arm was reaching down towards them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cRun!\u201d Alex shouted, pushing his siblings to one side. Together they dived under an overhanging archway, the titan half destroying the front of a shop was its attempt to grasp at them went wide.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTwisting on his heel Alex shoved Jessica and Billy forward, Sara running behind him and together the siblings sprinted beneath the titan\u2019s legs, the massive creature twisting it body to fast as it stumbled and fell.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe ground shook with the giant\u2019s collapse. Billy cried out as he stumbled forward, but Alex was behind him, pushing his younger brother to his feet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey emerged from the alleyway into the main thoroughfare, two mid-sized titans turning to meet them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cBack\u201d Alex shouted, the titan\u2019s arms coming up as they stumbled forwards, preparing to grasp at the human children, \u201cGet back!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nCannon fire ripped across the thoroughfare, smashing straight into the two titans. One of the titans took a cannon ball straight to the shoulder, the blast ripping apart half its torso whilst the second took a blow to its legs, the shot ripping them both clean off as thick arterial human like blood splashed across the walls and street.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGlancing the way, the shots had come, Alex could see the inner gate. Six cannons and a gaggle of guardsman were gathered around the gate\u2019s entrance, waving the children forwards.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s still open\u201d Alex said, pulling Jessica and Billy into the street, \u201cCome on. Run!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey entered the thoroughfare, Alex and Sara each dragging one of their younger siblings after them. From the closest alleyways and streets other humans emerged, and soon they were part of small crowd filtering up the gate. The familiar sound of crumbling bricks and mortar echoed down the road.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGlancing over his shoulder as he ran, Alex saw a titan emerge from the thoroughfare\u2019s winding edge, at least two more behind it.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGet down\u201d a soldier screamed, Alex and Sara throwing their younger siblings to the ground as the cannons fired. The Oncoming titan was cut down as were two of the beast\u2019s companions. Alex twisted onto his back as the gigantic humanoids stumbled forwards and fell, limbs and heads ripped clean off, but already he could see movement behind them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGet up, get up!\u201d he said, rousing Jessica to her feet. The girl continued to sob as they pushed forward, Sara and Billy behind them, and then they were at the gate. A blond haired officer shoved them through the gigantic archway beneath the interior of wall Maria, and then suddenly for the first time in their lives Alex, Sara, Billy and Jessica were outside of Shiganshina district, and inside the interior of Wall Maria.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA vast expanse of open green fields and rolling hills stretched out as far as any of them could see, whilst a cobbled highway from the gateway ran all the way to the horizon. Somewhere far in the distance Alex knew Wall Rose stood, and beyond that Wall Sheena, and then the royal capital and the lavish Palace of the King. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAnother crowd greeted them, even larger than the one they had encountered in the plaza. The mass of huddled refugees from Shiganshina District was nestled between the small trading market that adjoined Wall Maria\u2019s Inner Gate, and a makeshift airport where the bulbous form of a great airship was docked. A thin line of soldiers were gathered before airship\u2019s under-slung gondola, selecting people to take on and turning others away, their rifles and submachine guns pointed towards the crowd as a warning.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThere\u201d Alex said, \u201cCome on. We have to get on that last ship.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA sharp crack of artillery fire echoed from inside the gate as they approached the port, the crowd and soldiers tensing, yet no one tried to rush the airship. Alex and his siblings made their way through the press of the crowd, Alex maintaining a firm grip on Jessica\u2019s hand, who in turn had her hand gripped Jesscia\u2019s, who in turn was leading Billy at their rear.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBehind them another volley of cannon and machinegun fire boomed, people glancing nervously back the way they had come.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d someone shouted up ahead, \u201cLet us on!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWomen and children only at this time Sir\u201d a reply came, \u201cAnother airship will be here soon for the rest of you.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey reached the front of the crowd just as another volley of artillery fire went off, the thin line of soldiers stretched out before the docked gondola eying each other nervously as the crowd edged closer, then a man attempted to rush the nearest gangplank.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cStop him!\u201d an officer shouted.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTwo soldiers leapt forward to restrain the man, their compatriots raising their rifles to the crowd in warning.</span></div></div>",

Together the four children made their way forward, a shaven headed officer glancing up and waving them forward, his soldiers parting to let them on.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were just at the gangplank of the nearest ship when a forth volley of artillery and gunfire echoed outwards from behind Wall Rose, this time the gunfire punctuated with a chorus of human screams. Alex turned his head, glimpsing the terrified looks on the faces of the crowd, and then the first scream went up.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThere right outside the gate!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWith that the crowd finally panicked and surged, dozens of people pushing their way forward as a soldier discharged his rifle into the crowd, then all hell broke loose. Hundreds of Shiganshina\u2019s townspeople were surging up the gang plank, the half a dozen or so soldiers guarding it being grappled to the ground and beaten as more guns were fired into the roaring crowd.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex pulled Sara behind him, Jessica trying to do the same to Billy as the crowd surged into them, and then suddenly Alex was falling, thick hands grasping him by his collar and throwing him aside and back onto the dry-docks ledge<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cSara\u201d, Alex shouted, \u201cJessica!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIn the thick press of bodies Alex glimpsed Billy, his younger brother tossed to the ground the other side of the gang plank, struggling to return to his feet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t see his sisters.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cCast off, cast off. Before they swamp us\u201d a voice screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Gondola suddenly lurched precariously to one side, over a hundred people screaming as they were thrown from the tumbling gangplank. A handful of them were able to grasp onto the rails of the ship as it began to cast off, those onboard struggling to pull them to safety however the majority tumbled downwards, tumbling into the open dry-dock below.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThrough the press of people, Alex glimpsed Sara and Jessica, the two girls staring back at them from the Gondola\u2019s wooden deck.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were safe, for now.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe airship was preparing to cast off, the crews and passengers upending the gangplanks even as people continued to try and board them, hundreds of screaming refuges falling to the hard floor of dry-dock below as the airship rose into the air.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGlancing back towards the trading market across the road, Alex caught sight of a dozen cargo trucks, a ring of armed mercenaries holding back a smaller crowd just as the soldiers before the airship had been a moment earlier.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nScrambling back to his feet, Alex found his way to Billy and pulled the young boy to his feet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we do\u201d his brother cried.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cFollow me.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex led his brother across the road and past the trading centre, another round of artillery fire punctuating the screams of both crowds.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex and Billy wormed their way through the crowd and were soon within sight of the trucks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever owned the motor-caravan must have had a soft spot for the two orphans that day, for the ring of guards parted and they were dragged forward, the crowd yelling and clawing behind them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat about us!\u201d someone screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA tall mercenary with cropped black hair lifted Alex and Billy into one of the trucks canvassed cargo decks, the rear compartment so crammed with women, children and a small number of labourers that the two boys were forced to perch themselves upon the end, their legs dangling over the trucks rear parapet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, time to go!\u201d the caravan master shouted, and with that the drivers fired up their engines, the heavy automobiles belching out thick toxic fumes as they began to lumber forward. The mercenaries rushed back towards their trucks as the crowd surged after them, the caravan picking up speed as the mercenaries boarded each of the wagons in turn, their fellow guards hanging from the carts edged to beat off the questing hands of the crowd with heavy truncheons and pistol butts.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex didn\u2019t think that they would make it out of the mob, but at the last moment the bulk of the crowd dispersed before the now charging vehicles, the few remaining men and women being cut down by the thick wheels of the cargo vehicles as they passed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was with a mixture of both relief and fatigue that Alex allowed himself to fall backwards onto the trucks metal floor. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAbove them, the airship carrying Sara and Jessica ascended towards the sky, its sponsor mounted turbo fans propelling it slowly forward, no doubt on its way to Trost District.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey would be safe there, until Alex and Billy caught up with them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIs it over\u201d Billy asked.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cI think so\u201d Alex replied, \u201cWe\u2019re safe now.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Inner Gateway of Shiganshina District was just barely visible to them now, but Alex could see the gate coming down. They would close it, the titans would not follow and despite the hundreds of people who had died here today, that would be that.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was only a handful of seconds later that both boys saw the Inner gateway smash outwards, a fifteen-metre-tall armoured titan barrelling straight through the archway as if it had been made of sand.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt had finally happened.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe titans had breached wall Maria.</span></div></div>",

Deftly she recognized the symbol for <i>foreign contaminant</i> but could not recall what she was suppose to do until she felt the medical antibodies administered by her suit flooding into her bloodstream.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nDeep down at the back of her throat the Quarian could feel something begin to bubble and froth, and suddenly she knew she was about to be sick.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nPushing herself up onto one elbow the female shuddered, clenching her lips more out of reflex then actual conscious thought. Water trickled down from her back, small waves rippling forth in the water around her as she reached towards the Omni-tool at her wrist with her free hand, her gloved finger and thumb activating her suits environmental controls.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe coughed, her lips still clenched tightly behind gritted teeth, and with one final flick of her thumb she stabbed down at her Omni-tool, overriding the emergency ventilation port of her helmet. The cylindrical port which covered her mouth opened with a pressurised hiss, her lips parted and she vomited.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cOoogggg\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBlood, bile and a toxic mixture of broken down antibiotic paste plummeted down into the water below. The Quarian heaved again, her hand splashing down into the water, and faintly was she aware of the ground crumbling beneath her gloved palm, almost as if she had been a giant slamming her fist into the ground.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nJust as quickly had the sensation to gag had come over her, it passed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nClean filtered air fed by her suit pumped into her helmet and with a smooth gust of wind her mouth port closed, sealing her back inside her helmet. She breathed, a sensation of weightlessness momentarily overcoming her as a second round of antibiotics and endorphins flood through her bloodstream, purging any remnants of the contaminants which appeared to have temporarily breached her suit.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGroggily, the Quarian woman sat up, one hand still planted firmly behind her. Drawing her long legs up towards her chest, she flexed the toes of her boots and once she was satisfied she was reasonably stable, she tried to stand.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe movement of rising to her feet was relatively fluid, through she still felt a little unsteady. Perplexingly, she felt her boots sink slightly into the ground. It was not the sensation of her feet sinking into sand, but the impression of a million tiny fragments of shale crushing like ice beneath her bootsoles, yet whatever the strange substance she was standing on was, it seemed to support her weight.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Quarian found herself looking at her hand, her long fingers and thumb flexing beneath the heavy padding of her suit\u2019s gloves.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWho am I\u2026?\u201d the Quarian asked, her voice coming out as a metallic echo of the one she imagined hearing in her head. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSuddenly she found herself looking towards the horizon, the endless puddle of water seemingly to stretch around her in all directions.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nNeither question answered the other, though she could sense her name of the very tip of her tongue, and slowly memories began to resurface.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe titled her head towards the sky, the sunlight glancing of her visor. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was bright, unusually bright and she was forced to lift a hand to shield her eyes.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nUp there, beyond the blue sky of this world and into the dark blackness beyond was where she had come from.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe was a Quarian. Her people were a nomadic race of scavengers, engineers and scientists, forever doomed to travel the endless void of space within their sealed starships, to be sneered and loathed by those races and civilizations who still enjoyed the protection of their colonies and homeworlds. Somewhere deep down the Quarian knew that she despised them for that, and in her deepest darkest thoughts she sometimes found herself wishing unspeakable calamity upon those ignorant people and races. A dark shadow falling across the civilization of those who had never known hunger or loss, the tiny aliens fleeing as a boot of cruel malice ground them beneath its heel.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHer immune system was weak. That much she remembered clearly, hence the need for her sealed environmental suit, yet stubbornly her name and her personnel history escaped her.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nLowering her head, the Quarian glanced back towards the horizon. Her hands descended to her hips as she surveyed her surroundings, trying to make sense at what she saw.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThere was no beach, no landmass, and yet she knew she could not have been standing in the middle of an ocean with the water lapping around her boots.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm\u2026\u201d the Quarian mused, \u201cCould I be a giant\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe imagined tiny wooden sailing ships banking against the crushing waves beneath her ankles, the minuscule human like crews fighting against their rigging as she stepped backwards, oblivious to their presence even as she condemned them and their tiny wooden sailing ships to be crushed beneath her hard soles of her boots.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe idea was entertaining, if only for a moment, but quite preposterous.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe was woman of science, and therefore she knew that there must a reasonable explanation for the world she found herself on.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlmost as if it had been in response to the thought, she glimpsed something ahead, just below the horizon. Her visor dimmed to compensate for the intense light, and suddenly she could see a landmass ahead.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Quarian could have slapped a palm to her visor.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was right there!<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHow by the God\u2019s could she have missed it?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe landmass was shallow but she was sure that was just an effect of the light blocking her full view of the horizon and the mountains that would be beyond.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nJust as she was about to set off towards it, her Omni-tool bleeped.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTurning to the holographic terminal across her wrist, the Quarian tapped at the interface, her eyebrow rising in an almost quizzical gesture. Somewhere in the direction of the \u2018island\u2019 was a signal, perhaps a way for her to get off this world and back to the flotilla.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nEither way, it was better than staying here.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSmiling beneath her helmet, the Quarian took her first step towards the island. Water rippled outwards in tandems with her footfalls, and as she got closer more and more of the island could be seen.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was surprisingly flat from what she could see, but as more and more of the landmass came into focus she saw what might have been larger landmarks against the horizon. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nOr was it just a trick of her eyes?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Quarian woman was half way to setting foot on \u2018Paradise Island\u2019, and the besieged Kingdom behind the Walls when suddenly she remembered her name, and who she was;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-\tHer Name was;</b></span></div></div>",

As a species this race is\u2026use to great economic and social\u2026hardship and persecution at the\u2026 &lt;claws&gt;\u2026 of other corporeal races in stronger positions of\u2026and economic power. It will therefore be\u2026interesting to\u2026witness how she chooses to interact, when presented with another\u2026&lt;alien&gt;\u2026race who by circumstance, are so incredibly at her mercy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026location for this experiment\u2026I have found a world unique to our requirements\u2026indigenous race known as Eldian\u2019s, almost identical too\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026in almost every way accept\u2026scale makes them almost microscopic in comparison to most humanoid races in the galaxy. Even more uniquely\u2026besieged by a race of mutated\u2026humanoids the Eldian\u2019s have collectively dubbed \u2018titans\u2019\u2026behind three circular walls which comprise the majority of the island\u2019s central landmass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Eldian\u2019s are still pre-space faring, and their technology consists largely of semi-automatic rifles, machineguns and armoured fighting vehicles propelled by primitive internal combustion\u2026all of which will be quite useless against the Quarian giantess once she arrives. The\u2026technology incorporated into the Quarian\u2019s environmental suit is\u2026significantly more technologically advanced, and incorporates cyclonic energy shielding. Nothing the native Eldian\u2019s possess will be capable of even scratching her suit. Her own integrated weaponry however\u2026suit contains a full array of visual and communication equipment. The magnification her helmet offers will allow her to view the Eldian civilisation and miniaturized people in near perfect detail. She will be able to hear them, understand them, translate their language, and even establish verbal communication is she wishes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I shall place the\u2026&lt;Quarian&gt;\u2026female known as\u2026Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya\u2026 just off the coast of the\u2026landmass. From the ingenious inhabitant\u2019s perspective\u2026she will be a soaring giantess, over ten\u2026&lt;miles&gt;\u2026tall\u2026I have placed a package beneath the centre of the Eldian\u2019s civilization and largest city\u2026which will provide her instantaneous transmission and communication to the Quarian flotilla. The Quarian female\u2019s Omni-tool should lead her straight to the heart of their kingdom\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026how will she react? Will she attempt to communicate with the indigenous Eldian\u2019s\u2026ask them politely to promptly evacuate their capital before she levels their entire city, ripping out the urbanized heart of their civilization in order to dig out her package\u2026simply step or them, as if they were nothing more than a collection of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026my daughter, Vorazun does not share my sentiment. She seems convinced that because this Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya bares a womb in her stomach, this will somehow make her sympathetic to the Eldian\u2019s plight. As a result, she will be loath to take any action that may result in unnecessary death and suffering to the near microscopic Eldian children, to whom she may be inclined to feel some maternal compassion towards\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I am somewhat more cynical in my ancient age compared to my daughter. True, from what her profile tells me, Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya is not a naturally cruel and malicious woman, but she is still a\u2026&lt;organic&gt;\u2026origin, and thus prone to same pleasures and prejudices of her kind. She may ponder, she may pause, and she may even come to regret her actions in\u2026&lt;years&gt;\u2026to come. Still, I have no doubt that when she encounters this miniaturized race of humanoids, and realizes she can with but a single step annihilate entire cities, a necessary evil in order to return to her beloved flotilla, she will not hesitate to bring unfathomable destruction to the their civilization, if she believes it in her interest to do so. The native Eldian\u2019s are after all little more than near microscopic insects to her, and this is exactly how she will come to view them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026daughter persists that I am wrong, and she is right in this matter\u2026so we have agreed, a little wager. If she is proved correct\u2026I have promised not to carry out another planetary extermination event for at least another millennium. But if Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya actions provide my daughter wrong\u2026Vorazun shall withdrew her protection of the Orion spiral arm, and allow me to purge any world I desire of all life. I have been looking forward to dealing with that pestilent little race of\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026my daughter know, that I will not be keeping my promise. If against all my expectations and assumptions, this Quarian decides starvation and death is preferable to mass murder, then I shall reach out into the corporeal world\u2026take physical form within\u2026the Eldian\u2019s\u2026star system\u2026enclose my\u2026&lt;claws&gt;\u2026around the entire planet, and crush the entire world to dust within my palm\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026homeworld will be next. Such is the right off a goddess after all, and I always get what I want\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>With whose perspective does the story now switch to;</b></span></div></div>",

If Daro\u2019Xen vas Moreh feels it is in her interest to destroy entire cities and their collective populations, even if her motives in such actions is to simply to reveal in the pleasure that she can, then I have no doubt those cities will be crushed flat beneath the soles of this Quarian woman\u2019s boots.

Whilst it is true that from what her profile tells me, this Shala\u2019Raan vas Tonbay is not a woman naturally inclined to inflicting cruelty and destruction upon others, she is also a soldier, her morality and sensibilities skewed and twisted by decades of hardship and persecution. When she encounters this miniaturized race of humanoids and comes to the rapid conclusion that her only option if she wishes to return to her beloved flotilla is to bring untold devastation and genocide to their civilization, then I suspect she shall waste little time quibbling over the question of whether she has any right to do so. It is my firm belief Shala\u2019Raan vas Tonbay shall resign herself to this grim task with little pause for hesitation, crushing any errant Eldian\u2019s who find themselves unfortunate enough to fall beneath the footfalls of her boots as she sets out upon her task. She shall make her way straight to the heart of the indigenous Eldian\u2019s kingdom, destroying any armies they throw against her, and proceed to lay waste to their capital as she attempts to locate the package I have placed beneath the city for her to find. As I have already said, Shala\u2019Raan vas Tonbay is not a woman naturally inclined to cruelty or violence, but when confronted with the simple choice of life, the indigenous Eldian\u2019s collective lives, or hers, why would she be inclined to show such kindness, when all her people have ever known from alien civilizations is unrelenting hatred and persecution\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026daughter persists that I am wrong, and she is right in this matter\u2026so we have agreed, a little wager.

Forzan vas Idenna is unique to this experiment as unlike the majority of our other potential candidates, she is also a mother, having given birth to a live Quarian infant less than a standard\u2026&lt;terran&gt;\u2026year ago. I have left the offspring in the relative safe company of her family within the Quarian flotilla for the duration of this experiment. The fact that this Quarian female bears a live offspring would seem to strengthen my daughter\u2019s argument, at least to one with a less sceptical mind then myself. Forzan vas Idenna will surely be inclined to feel some form of maternal affection and protectiveness towards the indigenous Eldian children, and thus loathe to take any action that may result in her killing untold numbers of those same Eldian children as a result of her gigantic size and scale. Whilst Vorazun\u2019s argument is thus in theory sound, she does not truly appreciate the maternal bond and desire this Quarian woman will feel to be reunited with her own child upon the flotilla, or the cruelties and destruction she will be willing to inflict upon the indigenous Eldian\u2019s to ensure this happens. Forzan vas Idenna may well try to limit the death toll and destruction caused by her actions, going out of her way to avoid crushing any errant Eldian\u2019s or population centres she comes across, but when her Omni-tool leads her to the Eldian\u2019s capital and the package I have placed beneath it, she will be left with only a single choice. Yes, this Quarian mother may ultimately feel regret over any Eldian children she kills when she proceeds to exhume and destroy the great city in search of her prize, but if that is ultimately the price that must be paid, then I have little doubt that Forzan vas Idenna will crush any city she comes across if she feels it necessary to do so, regardless of the cost in Eldian lives\u2026    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026daughter persists that I am wrong, and she is right in this matter\u2026so we have agreed, a little wager.

As a species this race is\u2026use to great economic and social\u2026hardship and persecution at the\u2026 &lt;claws&gt;\u2026 of other corporeal races in stronger positions of\u2026and economic power. It will therefore be\u2026interesting to\u2026witness how she chooses to interact, when presented with another\u2026&lt;alien&gt;\u2026race who by circumstance, are so incredibly at her mercy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026location for this experiment\u2026I have found a world unique to our requirements\u2026indigenous race known as Eldian\u2019s, almost identical too\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026in almost every way accept\u2026scale makes them almost microscopic in comparison to most humanoid races in the galaxy. Even more uniquely\u2026besieged by a race of mutated\u2026humanoids the Eldian\u2019s have collectively dubbed \u2018titans\u2019\u2026behind three circular walls which comprise the majority of the island\u2019s central landmass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Eldian\u2019s are still pre-space faring, and their technology consists largely of semi-automatic rifles, machineguns and armoured fighting vehicles propelled by primitive internal combustion\u2026all of which will be quite useless against the Quarian giantess once she arrives. The\u2026technology incorporated into the Quarian\u2019s environmental suit is\u2026significantly more technologically advanced, and incorporates cyclonic energy shielding. Nothing the native Eldian\u2019s possess will be capable of even scratching her suit. Her own integrated weaponry however\u2026suit contains a full array of visual and communication equipment. The magnification her helmet offers will allow her to view the Eldian civilisation and miniaturized people in near perfect detail. She will be able to hear them, understand them, translate their language, and even establish verbal communication is she wishes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I shall place the\u2026&lt;Quarian&gt;\u2026female known as...&lt;translation error&gt;... just off the coast of the\u2026landmass. From the ingenious inhabitant\u2019s perspective\u2026she will be a soaring giantess, over ten\u2026&lt;miles&gt;\u2026tall\u2026I have placed a package beneath the centre of the Eldian\u2019s civilization and largest city\u2026which will provide her instantaneous transmission and communication to the Quarian flotilla. The Quarian female\u2019s Omni-tool should lead her straight to the heart of their kingdom\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026how will she react? Will she attempt to communicate with the indigenous Eldian\u2019s\u2026ask them politely to promptly evacuate their capital before she levels their entire city, ripping out the urbanized heart of their civilization in order to dig out her package\u2026simply step or them, as if they were nothing more than a collection of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026my daughter, Vorazun does not share my sentiment. She seems convinced that because this ...&lt;translation error&gt;... bares a womb in her stomach, this will somehow make her sympathetic to the Eldian\u2019s plight. As a result, she will be loath to take any action that may result in unnecessary death and suffering to the near microscopic Eldian children, to whom she may be inclined to feel some maternal compassion towards\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I am somewhat more cynical in my ancient age compared to my daughter. True, the Quarian female we have selected is an anomaly, thus neither I nor my daughter can accurately predict how she will conduct herself once the reality of her situation becomes apparent. Whilst she may not be a naturally cruel or bloodthirsty woman, this Quarian is still a\u2026&lt;organic&gt;\u2026and thus prone to all her kind\u2019s irrational paranoia and brutality once she is removed from an environment she is familiar with. Once she realizes the situation she is in, this\u2026&lt;translation error&gt;\u2026may hesitate, she may even pause to deliberate, but when she realizes that the only way to return to her beloved flotilla is to destroy the centre of the Eldian\u2019s native kingdom, I am confident her true nature shall be revealed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026daughter persists that I am wrong, and she is right in this matter\u2026so we have agreed, a little wager. If she is proved correct\u2026I have promised not to carry out another planetary extermination event for at least another millennium. But if ...&lt;translation error&gt;... actions provide my daughter wrong\u2026Vorazun shall withdrew her protection of the Orion spiral arm, and allow me to purge any world I desire of all life. I have been looking forward to dealing with that pestilent little race of\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026my daughter know, that I will not be keeping my promise. If against all my expectations and assumptions, this Quarian decides starvation and death is preferable to mass murder, then I shall reach out into the corporeal world\u2026take physical form within\u2026the Eldian\u2019s\u2026star system\u2026enclose my\u2026&lt;claws&gt;\u2026around the entire planet, and crush the entire world to dust within my palm\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026homeworld will be next.

All eyes were raised to the fifty metre high wall and the skinless yet very human like head that soared above it, a dark and unnatural shadow protruding across the centre of the district as the titan; colossal beyond all reckoning looked down upon the little humans with hunger.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex stared up at the giant\u2019s head, his lips parted and mouth dry in the summer heat of the afternoon, the boy\u2019s tongue stubbornly still and unmoving inside his mouth.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh God\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s a titan\u201d Sara whispered from behind him, the hand of his adopted sister clasped around his, her nails digging into his palm.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMovement flickered at the corner of his eye, and instinctively Alex knew that one of their two younger siblings was beside them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWas it Billy, or Jessica?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex could not turn his head to see, so thawed with fear the young boy was.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nScarcely a minute before, the four young siblings had all been happy and laughing, the children enjoying the afternoon sunshine which had seen them relaxing in the central plaza of Shiganshina district.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were homeless street orphans all of them, related neither by blood, marriage or money, but instead by the need of young children to find solace and comfort in a society that had all but abandoned them. Alex was the oldest of them at twelve years of age, with Sara the older \u2018sister\u2019 of the group at ten. Billy was eight, and Jessica six. They looked out for each other, protected each other, and together the four siblings formed a close knit family that survived together in the poorest region of the kingdom behind the walls.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThat momentary happiness between the hunger, the freezing nights spent upon cold city streets and hiding from corrupt soldiers of the city garrison seemed a distant dream in Alex\u2019s past now as the huge face of the titan looked down upon them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026not possible\u2026\u201d Billy stammered, \u201c\u2026that wall is over fifty metres tall. That titan\u2019s got to be\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cOver Two Hundred feet high\u201d Alex finished.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIs that a titan?\u201d Jessica asked, her voice as innocently na\u00efve as it always was.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe have to get out of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBefore Alex could finish a thunderous crash shook the district, Wall Maria seeming to groan with the sound of cracking rock as the ground shook beneath the four children\u2019s feet, and then the centre of the Curtain wall was smashed outwards in a churning explosion of dust and debris.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex was suddenly snapped from his stupor. Grasping his siblings by their arms he dragged them towards the nearest building as chucks of the broken wall peppered the city. Slabs of stone and mortar smashed through buildings, flattened houses and peppered streets, cutting down and crushing anyone unfortunate enough to find themselves in their path.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBlood splashed across the asphalt of the streets and walls as the first screams echoed across the district, fear giving way to panic as the full realization of what had just happened dawned upon the little city\u2019s inhabitants.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re though the walls!\u201d someone screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs he was helping Billy to his feet, Alex turned towards wall, his gut twisting like a knife inside his stomach. Wall Maria still stood, the Colossal Titan suddenly gone as quickly as it had appeared, but from the gaping hole it had smashed through the lower segment of the wall, lanky and pale humanoid forms many times taller than a man were emerging, gapping wide toothed mouths open atop bobbing listing heads, their swollen human like eyes searching hungrily for flesh.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTitans!<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to the gate\u201d Alex shouted, grasping Jessica\u2019s arm as he did so, \u201cSara, take Billy\u2019s hand. Don\u2019t let go.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got no papers\u201d Sara cried, \u201cThey won\u2019t let us through.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to try. Come On!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTogether, the four orphans sprinted across the open plaza, a large crowd already forming across the mouth of the Aquila thoroughfare, the most direct route to the only remaining gate out of Shiganshina District, and deeper into the Kingdom behind the Walls.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs they approached the avenue, just how hopeless their situation was becoming apparent to Alex very quickly. Shiganshina District contained over eighty thousand permanently resident men, women and children, and it seemed that every single one of them today was gathered into a single swelling crowd that blocked the main intersection of the thoroughfare, their numbers growing with every passing second.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA thin line of city guardsmen from the Royal Garrison were clustered around the baying mob, their distinctive khaki uniforms and body-armour marking them out amongst the crowd. Futilely they tried to bring some semblance of order to chaotic crowd, the soldiers burnishing their assault rifles into the air.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was just as Alex and his three siblings reached the edge of the crowd that the sound of crumbling brick and masonry echoed across the open plaza. Panting for breath Alex turned, his three siblings pausing to follow his gaze towards the other end of the square, just in time to see a titan clambering over a triple storied house.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe titan was perhaps five or six metres tall, its giant form lurching drunkenly forward as it tried to navigate its way over the house, one long leg coming down upon the buildings balcony. The was a grinding off broken tiles and then suddenly the titan was plunging through the second storey roof, its arms flailing uselessly as it tried to dig its way free, and then the second titan appeared.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was at least twice as tall of the first, and unlike its companion it emerged from the closest street, a third titan stumbling forth in its wake. More titans suddenly appeared, their slow unwieldy forms rising from behind the row of houses and shops that lined the plaza and adjacent  roads, roofs and walls, an overhanging bridge collapsing as one smashed its way into the plaza, the tallest amongst them standing over fourteen metres high.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThere in the square!\u201d someone shouted.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGuardsman\u201d shouted a thick voice, \u201cForm Up. Deploy the tanks!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA line of infantrymen detached themselves from the crowd, running past Alex, Sara, Billy and Jessica as they stormed into the square. A dozen slope armoured battle tanks grinded their way into the square, the guardsmen forming a line several hundred strong as they levelled their assault rifles towards the approaching titans, the tanks heavy turrets following in their wake. A thickly build man in a officers uniform emerged from their ranks. The man sported a curling moustache, and burnished a sword which he now swept through the air.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cFire!\u201d the officer screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex clasped his hands over his ears, shouting at his siblings to do the same as the first volley fired, the whistling <i>crack crack crack</i> of hundreds of assault rifles suddenly followed by explosive <i>boom</i> as the tanks lets loose with their cannons, their heavy tracks lurching backwards with the force of the blast.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe shots slammed into the oncoming titans, peppering their wiry misshapen bodies with automatic gunfire as the cannon shells shots ripped through limbs, human like blood splashing across the plaza floor. Alex saw a titan stumble and fall, its nightmarish face reduced to a bloody stump where one of the tank\u2019s shell\u2019s had caught its head and ripped it clean off, but to his horror Alex could see its body already fighting to regain its footing, a twisting mass of flesh atop its neck already reforming as it head began to grow back.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nNo more than two of the titans had been felled by the solders first volley, and at least a dozen more were already shambling forwards, the closest halfway across the square already.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cReload\u201d the sergeant shouted, \u201cProtect the civilians at all costs.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe soldiers fired again, and the lead titan was cut down, but then another was shambling forwards in its place, its ten metre high form towering above the thin line of soldiers who were still reloading.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we do!\u201d Sara screamed from behind Alex, \u201cWe\u2019re trapped.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex turned back to the crowd, his heart sinking. Without the guardsmen there to police the evacuation, the crowd that still blocked the intersection had descended into an even more chaotic mass as people punched, kicked and clawed at each other, the press of so many human bodies preventing all but a handful from moving forward. Already Alex could see more titans worming their way around the plazas edge, and instinctively he knew they intended to flank the soldiers. The dumb brute\u2019s tiny animal like minds had deduced the quickest possible path to the crowd.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThat intersection would soon become a bloodbath.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cAlex!\u201d Sara screamed, Jessica and Billy crying behind her \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cFollow me\u201d Alex shouted. Leading Jessica again by her arm, Alex sprinted across the edge of square, Sara and Billy hard on his heels. Steeling a glance over his shoulder, Alex glimpsed a titan in amongst detachment of soldiers. Their line reeled, a squirming human form suspended at least eight metres off the ground in the meaty fist of a titan. The soldier convulsed inside the titan\u2019s fist as the fingers of the giant crushed his torso, blood frothing from the man\u2019s lips as his companions fired their assault rifles upwards.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex twisted back his head, swerving to avoid a discarded box of rotting fish. Jessica cried out as her foot struck the box, but Alex continued to pull her after him, ignoring his baby sisters whimpering. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nRather than the intersection, Alex led them to one of the plaza\u2019s corners, where the sewage of the both Shiganshina eastern and northern drainage ditches met in a low-slung trench. Jumping into the filthy knee deep water Alex grasped hold of the thin grated wire-mesh plate that blocked the entrance to the underground pipe and pulled with all his might.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe plate groaned, one edge peeling free from the waterproof brickwork to which it was stuck. The thin wire-mesh twisted between his fingers, blood dripping from between his nails, then with one last groan the thinly stripped metal came apart, the grated plate coming out in his hands.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s open\u201d Alex said, \u201cCome on, get in. Get in!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSara was the first in, dragging a now sobbing Jessica behind her as the two girls descended to their knees and disappeared into the pipe. Billy was next, Alex pushing his younger brother into the pipe with both hands before turning back to the square, the water suddenly trembling around him.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTurning back towards the plaza, Alex\u2019s heart sunk. At least a dozen titans were now amongst the guardsmen, and almost each and every one of the giant freaks had the limbs of a screaming and struggling soldier clasped in their huge hands, obvious to the scattered gunfire tearing into their flesh as they feasted upon their screaming, still living victims.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA titan chased a fleeing soldier, the man dropping his spent carbine only to be plucked from the ground, kicking at the thick meaty fingers that had grasped hold of his leg. His screams echoed across the square as the titan clamped its huge mouth around his torso, thick arterial blood spurting upwards. A tank cannon fired, blowing the arm of another titan clean off as its crew tried to reload, then another titan was upon them, overturning the cannon and crushing one of the surviving soldiers, one of his companions hurriedly reloading his rifle as another fled.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMovement from the corner of his eyes caught Alex attention, and suddenly the young boy realized a titan was lumbering towards him, the water splashing upwards around his legs. It was a big titan, almost fifteen metres tall, and it was almost upon him.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nDiving to his knees Alex scrambled into the pipeway. From the corner of his eye his glimpsed one final shot of the plaza, the human soldiers dead or dying, the crowd at the intersection all but clawing over each other as the titans converged upon them, a towering fifteen metre tall titan plucking a man from the crowd to consume. And then there was the human sergeant in the middle of plaza, his sword still brandished into the air and machinegun pistol grasped in one hand, surrounded.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe approaching titan stumbled and fell, its clumsy flailing body landing straight atop the trench. Already in the pipe, a sudden surge of water splashed over Alex, the filthy liquid getting into his eyes, ears and mouth. Still the boy continued forward, the repetitive <i>splash splash splash</i> up ahead telling him that his siblings were still clambering through the tunnel further up.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cKeep going\u201d Alex screamed spitting out the fowl tasting water as he did so, \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was many minutes later that they reached the other end of the pipe, Sara poised at the entrance waiting for Alex while Billy and Jessica sat shivering in the closest alleyway.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHuman screams, alongside the sound of ripping flesh and breaking bones echoed across the rooftops, coming from where the crowd had been at the edge of the plaza.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep moving\u201d Alex said, rousing Billy and Jessica to their feet, \u201cGet up get up. They\u2019ll be closing the gate soon.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe children were now on Shiganshina District\u2019s northern side, only a few streets to the gateway. Hand in hand Alex led them forward, the four orphans emerging from the alleyway and into a small square, the ground suddenly shaking.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA titan emerged from atop the overhanging roofs, its towering form at least ten metres high. Its wide mouthed grinning visage regarded the young orphans with hunger, and suddenly one gangly arm was reaching down towards them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cRun!\u201d Alex shouted, pushing his siblings to one side. Together they dived under an overhanging archway, the titan half destroying the front of a shop was its attempt to grasp at them went wide.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTwisting on his heel Alex shoved Jessica and Billy forward, Sara running behind him and together the siblings sprinted beneath the titan\u2019s legs, the massive creature twisting it body to fast as it stumbled and fell.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe ground shook with the giant\u2019s collapse. Billy cried out as he stumbled forward, but Alex was behind him, pushing his younger brother to his feet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey emerged from the alleyway into the main thoroughfare, two mid-sized titans turning to meet them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cBack\u201d Alex shouted, the titan\u2019s arms coming up as they stumbled forwards, preparing to grasp at the human children, \u201cGet back!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nCannon fire ripped across the thoroughfare, smashing straight into the two titans. One of the titans took a cannon ball straight to the shoulder, the blast ripping apart half its torso whilst the second took a blow to its legs, the shot ripping them both clean off as thick arterial human like blood splashed across the walls and street.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGlancing the way the shots had come, Alex could see the inner gate. Six cannons and a gaggle of guardsman were gathered around the gate\u2019s entrance, waving the children forwards.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s still open\u201d Alex said, pulling Jessica and Billy into the street, \u201cCome on. Run!\u201d<br>\r\n  They entered the thoroughfare, Alex and Sara each dragging one of their younger siblings after them. From the closest alleyways and streets other humans emerged, and soon they were part of small crowd filtering up the gate. The familiar sound of crumbling bricks and mortar echoed down the road.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGlancing over his shoulder as he ran, Alex saw a titan emerge from the thoroughfare\u2019s winding edge, at least two more behind it.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGet down\u201d a soldier screamed, Alex and Sara throwing their younger siblings to the ground as the cannons fired. The Oncoming titan was cut down as were two of the beast\u2019s companions. Alex twisted onto his back as the gigantic humanoids stumbled forwards and fell, limbs and heads ripped clean off, but already he could see movement behind them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGet up, get up!\u201d he said, rousing Jessica to her feet. The girl continued to sob as they pushed forward, Sara and Billy behind them, and then they were at the gate. A blond haired officer shoved them through the gigantic archway beneath the interior of wall Maria, and then suddenly for the first time in their lives Alex, Sara, Billy and Jessica were outside of Shiganshina district, and inside the interior of Wall Maria.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA vast expanse of open green fields and rolling hills stretched out as far as any of them could see, whilst a paved highway and elevated maglev track ran from the gateway ran all the way to the horizon. Somewhere far in the distance Alex knew Wall Rose stood, and beyond that Wall Sheena, and then the royal capital and the lavish Palace of the King. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAnother crowd greeted them, even larger than the one they had encountered in the plaza. The mass of huddled refugees from Shiganshina District was nestled between the small trading port that adjoined Wall Maria\u2019s Inner Gate, and a train station where a maglev bullet train was docked. A thin line of guardsman was gathered before the train, selecting people to take on and turning others away, their assault rifles pointed towards the crowd as a warning.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThere\u201d Alex said, \u201cCome on. We have to get on that last ship.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA sharp crack of tank fire echoed from inside the gate as they approached the port, the crowd and soldiers tensing, yet no one tried to rush the trains. Alex and his siblings made their way through  the press of the crowd, Alex maintaining a firm grip on Jessica\u2019s hand, who in turn had her hand gripped to Jesscia\u2019s, who in turn was leading Billy at their rear.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBehind them another volley of tank shells and automatic gunfire fire boomed, people glancing nervously back the way they had come.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u201cCome on!\u201d someone shouted up ahead, \u201cLet us on!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWomen and children only at this time Sir\u201d a reply came, \u201cMore trains will be here soon for the rest of you.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey reached the front of the crowd just as another volley of gunfire went off, the thin line of soldiers stretched out before the docked ships eying each other nervously as the crowd edged closer, then a man attempted to rush the nearest gangplank.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cStop him!\u201d an officer shouted.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTwo soldiers leapt forward to restrain the man, their compatriots raising their assault rifles to the crowd in warning.</span></div></div>",

Together the four children made their way forward, a shaven headed officer glancing up and waving them forward, his soldiers parting to let them on.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were just at the gangplank of the nearest ship when a forth volley of tank shells being launched echoed outwards from behind Wall Rose, this time the gunfire punctuated with a chorus of human screams. Alex turned his head, glimpsing the terrified looks on the faces of the crowd, and then the first scream went up.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThere right outside the gate!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWith that the crowd finally panicked and surged, dozens of people pushing their way forward as a soldier discharged his rifle into the crowd, then all hell broke loose. Hundreds of Shiganshina\u2019s townspeople were surging up the gang plank, the half a dozen or so soldiers guarding it being grappled to the ground and beaten as more automatic weapons were fired into the roaring crowd.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex pulled Sara behind him, Jessica trying to do the same to Billy as the crowd surged into them, and then suddenly Alex was falling, thick hands grasping him by his collar and throwing him aside and back onto the dry-docks ledge.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cSara\u201d, Alex shouted, \u201cJessica!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIn the thick press of bodies Alex glimpsed Billy, his younger brother tossed to the ground the other side of the gang plank, struggling to return to his feet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t see his sisters.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cCast off, cast off. Before they swamp us\u201d a voice screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe train carriage was suddenly lurched to one side as its magnetic coils spun up, over a hundred people screaming as they were thrown from the tumbling gangplank. A handful of them were able to grasp onto the rails of the train as it began to cast off, those onboard struggling to pull them to safety however the majority tumbled backwards.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThrough the press of people, Alex glimpsed Sara and Jessica, the two girls staring back at them from the carriages closing doors.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were safe, for now.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe train was powering up and preparing to cast off, the crews and passengers upending the gangplanks even as people continued to try and board them, hundreds of screaming refuges fighting to slip through the closing doors and pounding their fists against the carriage windows when they could not get in.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nPulling back fluently from the platforms ledge the bullet train seemed to pause like a coiled serpent, and then it began to move, the carriages gliding smoothly away.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGlancing back towards the trading town across the road, Alex caught sight of over a dozen cargo trucks, a ring of armed mercenaries holding back a smaller crowd just as the soldiers before the train had been a moment earlier.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nScrambling back to his feet, Alex found his way to Billy and pulled the young boy to his feet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we do\u201d his brother cried.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cFollow me.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex led his brother across the road and past the entrance to the trading centre, another round of cannon fire punctuating the screams of both crowds.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex and Billy wormed their way through the crowd and were soon within sight of the trucks. Whoever owned the caravan must have had a soft spot for the two orphans that day, for the ring of guards parted and they were dragged forward, the crowd yelling and clawing behind them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat about us!\u201d someone screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA tall mercenary with cropped black hair lifted Alex and Billy into one of the trucks gangplanks, the rear compartment so crammed with women, children and a small number of labourers that the two boys were forced to perch themselves upon the end, their legs dangling over the wagons parapet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, time to go!\u201d the caravan master shouted, and with that the drivers fired up their engines, the heavy automobiles belching out thick toxic fumes as they began to lumber forward. The mercenaries rushed back towards their trucks as the crowd surged after them, the caravan picking up speed as the mercenaries boarded each of the trucks in turn, their fellow guards hanging from the carts edged to beat off the questing hands of the crowd with heavy truncheons and pistol butts.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex didn\u2019t think that they would make it out of the mob, but at the last moment the bulk of the crowd dispersed before the now charging vehicles, the few remaining men and women being pulled beneath the types of the heavy transport vehicles as they passed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was with a mixture of both relief and fatigue that Alex allowed himself to fall backwards onto the trucks metal gangplank. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIn the distance, the bullet train carrying Sara and Jessica was hurtling towards the horizon, no doubt its way to Trost District.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey would be safe there, until Alex and Billy caught up with them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIs it over\u201d Billy asked.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cI think so\u201d Alex replied, \u201cWe\u2019re safe now.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Inner Gateway of Shiganshina District was just barely visible to them now, but Alex could see the gate coming down. They would close it, the titans would not follow and despite the hundreds of people who had died here today, that would be that.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was only a handful of seconds later that both boys saw the Inner gateway smash outwards, a fifteen-metre-tall armoured titan barrelling straight through the archway as if it had been made of sand.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt had finally happened.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe titans had breached wall Maria.</span></div></div>",

Deftly she recognized the symbol for <i>foreign contaminant</i> but could not recall what she was suppose to do until she felt the medical antibodies administered by her suit flooding into her bloodstream.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nDeep down at the back of her throat the Quarian could feel something begin to bubble and froth, and suddenly she knew she was about to be sick.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nPushing herself up onto one elbow the female shuddered, clenching her lips more out of reflex then actual conscious thought. Water trickled down from her back, small waves rippling forth in the water around her as she reached towards the Omni-tool at her wrist with her free hand, her gloved finger and thumb activating her suits environmental controls.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe coughed, her lips still clenched tightly behind gritted teeth, and with one final flick of her thumb she stabbed down at her Omni-tool, overriding the emergency ventilation port of her helmet. The cylindrical port which covered her mouth opened with a pressurised hiss, her lips parted and she vomited.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cOoogggg\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBlood, bile and a toxic mixture of broken down antibiotic paste plummeted down into the water below. The Quarian heaved again, her hand splashing down into the water, and faintly was she aware of the ground crumbling beneath her gloved palm, almost as if she had been a giant slamming her fist into the ground.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nJust as quickly had the sensation to gag had come over her, it passed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nClean filtered air fed by her suit pumped into her helmet and with a smooth gust of wind her mouth port closed, sealing her back inside her helmet. She breathed, a sensation of weightlessness momentarily overcoming her as a second round of antibiotics and endorphins flood through her bloodstream, purging any remnants of the contaminants which appeared to have temporarily breached her suit.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGroggily, the Quarian woman sat up, one hand still planted firmly behind her. Drawing her long legs up towards her chest, she flexed the toes of her boots and once she was satisfied she was reasonably stable, she tried to stand.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe movement of rising to her feet was relatively fluid, through she still felt a little unsteady. Perplexingly, she felt her boots sink slightly into the ground. It was not the sensation of her feet sinking into sand, but the impression of a million tiny fragments of shale crushing like ice beneath her bootsoles, yet whatever the strange substance she was standing on was, it seemed to support her weight.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Quarian found herself looking at her hand, her long fingers and thumb flexing beneath the heavy padding of her suit\u2019s gloves.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWho am I\u2026?\u201d the Quarian asked, her voice coming out as a metallic echo of the one she imagined hearing in her head. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSuddenly she found herself looking towards the horizon, the endless puddle of water seemingly to stretch around her in all directions.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nNeither question answered the other, though she could sense her name of the very tip of her tongue, and slowly memories began to resurface.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe titled her head towards the sky, the sunlight glancing of her visor. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was bright, unusually bright and she was forced to lift a hand to shield her eyes.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nUp there, beyond the blue sky of this world and into the dark blackness beyond was where she had come from.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe was a Quarian. Her people were a nomadic race of scavengers, engineers and scientists, forever doomed to travel the endless void of space within their sealed starships, to be sneered and loathed by those races and civilizations who still enjoyed the protection of their colonies and homeworlds. Somewhere deep down the Quarian knew that she despised them for that, and in her deepest darkest thoughts she sometimes found herself wishing unspeakable calamity upon those ignorant people and races. A dark shadow falling across the civilization of those who had never known hunger or loss, the tiny aliens fleeing as a boot of cruel malice ground them beneath its heel.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHer immune system was weak. That much she remembered clearly, hence the need for her sealed environmental suit, yet stubbornly her name and her personnel history escaped her.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nLowering her head, the Quarian glanced back towards the horizon. Her hands descended to her hips as she surveyed her surroundings, trying to make sense at what she saw.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThere was no beach, no landmass, and yet she knew she could not have been standing in the middle of an ocean with the water lapping around her boots.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm\u2026\u201d the Quarian mused, \u201cCould I be a giant\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe imagined tiny wooden sailing ships banking against the crushing waves beneath her ankles, the minuscule human like crews fighting against their rigging as she stepped backwards, oblivious to their presence even as she condemned them and their tiny wooden sailing ships to be crushed beneath her hard soles of her boots.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe idea was entertaining, if only for a moment, but quite preposterous.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe was woman of science, and therefore she knew that there must a reasonable explanation for the world she found herself on.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlmost as if it had been in response to the thought, she glimpsed something ahead, just below the horizon. Her visor dimmed to compensate for the intense light, and suddenly she could see a landmass ahead.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Quarian could have slapped a palm to her visor.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was right there!<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHow by the God\u2019s could she have missed it?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe landmass was shallow but she was sure that was just an effect of the light blocking her full view of the horizon and the mountains that would be beyond.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nJust as she was about to set off towards it, her Omni-tool bleeped.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTurning to the holographic terminal across her wrist, the Quarian tapped at the interface, her eyebrow rising in an almost quizzical gesture. Somewhere in the direction of the \u2018island\u2019 was a signal, perhaps a way for her to get off this world and back to the flotilla.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nEither way, it was better than staying here.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSmiling beneath her helmet, the Quarian took her first step towards the island. Water rippled outwards in tandems with her footfalls, and as she got closer more and more of the island could be seen.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was surprisingly flat from what she could see, but as more and more of the landmass came into focus she saw what might have been larger landmarks against the horizon. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nOr was it just a trick of her eyes?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Quarian woman was half way to setting foot on \u2018Paradise Island\u2019, and the besieged Kingdom behind the Walls when suddenly she remembered her name, and who she was;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-\tHer Name was;</b></span></div></div>",

As a species this race is\u2026use to great economic and social\u2026hardship and persecution at the\u2026 &lt;claws&gt;\u2026 of other corporeal races in stronger positions of\u2026and economic power. It will therefore be\u2026interesting to\u2026witness how she chooses to interact, when presented with another\u2026&lt;alien&gt;\u2026race who by circumstance, are so incredibly at her mercy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026location for this experiment\u2026I have found a world unique to our requirements\u2026indigenous race known as Eldian\u2019s, almost identical too\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026in almost every way accept\u2026scale makes them almost microscopic in comparison to most humanoid races in the galaxy. Even more uniquely\u2026besieged by a race of mutated\u2026humanoids the Eldian\u2019s have collectively dubbed \u2018titans\u2019\u2026behind three circular walls which comprise the majority of the island\u2019s central landmass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Eldian\u2019s are still pre-space faring, and their technology consists largely of automatic assault rifles, armoured battle tanks and attack aircraft\u2026all of which will be quite useless against the Quarian giantess once she arrives. The\u2026technology incorporated into the Quarian\u2019s environmental suit is\u2026significantly more technologically advanced, and incorporates cyclonic energy shielding. Nothing the native Eldian\u2019s possess will be capable of even scratching her suit. Her own integrated weaponry however\u2026suit contains a full array of visual and communication equipment. The magnification her helmet offers will allow her to view the Eldian civilisation and miniaturized people in near perfect detail. She will be able to hear them, understand them, translate their language, and even establish verbal communication is she wishes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I shall place the\u2026&lt;Quarian&gt;\u2026female known as\u2026Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya\u2026 just off the coast of the\u2026landmass. From the ingenious inhabitant\u2019s perspective\u2026she will be a soaring goddess, over twenty five\u2026&lt;miles&gt;\u2026tall\u2026a single of her footfalls capable of levelling small cities. I have placed a package beneath the centre of the Eldian\u2019s civilization and largest city\u2026which will provide her instantaneous transmission and communication to the Quarian flotilla. The Quarian female\u2019s Omni-tool should lead her straight to the heart of their kingdom\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026how will she react? Will she attempt to communicate with the indigenous Eldian\u2019s\u2026ask them politely to promptly evacuate their capital before she levels their entire city, ripping out the urbanized heart of their civilization in order to dig out her package\u2026simply step or them, as if they were nothing more than a collection of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026my daughter, Vorazun does not share my sentiment. She seems convinced that because this Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya bares a womb in her stomach, this will somehow make her sympathetic to the Eldian\u2019s plight. As a result, she will be loath to take any action that may result in unnecessary death and suffering to the near microscopic Eldian children, to whom she may be inclined to feel some maternal compassion towards\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I am somewhat more cynical in my ancient age compared to my daughter. True, from what her profile tells me, Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya is not a naturally cruel and malicious woman, but she is still a\u2026&lt;organic&gt;\u2026origin, and thus prone to same pleasures and prejudices of her kind. She may ponder, she may pause, and she may even come to regret her actions in\u2026&lt;years&gt;\u2026to come. Still, I have no doubt that when she encounters this miniaturized race of humanoids, and realizes she can with but a single step annihilate entire cities, a necessary evil in order to return to her beloved flotilla, she will not hesitate to bring unfathomable destruction to their civilization, if she believes it in her interest to do so. The native Eldian\u2019s are after all little more than near microscopic insects to her, and this is exactly how she will come to view them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026daughter persists that I am wrong, and she is right in this matter\u2026so we have agreed, a little wager. If she is proved correct\u2026I have promised not to carry out another planetary extermination event for at least another millennium. But if Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya actions provide my daughter wrong\u2026Vorazun shall withdrew her protection of the Orion spiral arm, and allow me to purge any world I desire of all life. I have been looking forward to dealing with that pestilent little race of\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026my daughter know, that I will not be keeping my promise. If against all my expectations and assumptions, this Quarian decides starvation and death is preferable to mass murder, then I shall reach out into the corporeal world\u2026take physical form within\u2026the Eldian\u2019s\u2026star system\u2026enclose my\u2026&lt;claws&gt;\u2026around the entire planet, and crush the entire world to dust within my palm\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026homeworld will be next. Such is the right off a goddess after all, and I always get what I want\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>With whose perspective does the story now switch to;</b></span></div></div>",

If Daro\u2019Xen vas Moreh feels it is in her interest to destroy entire cities and their collective populations, even if her motives in such actions is to simply to reveal in the pleasure that she can, then I have no doubt those cities will be crushed flat beneath the soles of this Quarian woman\u2019s boots.

Whilst it is true that from what her profile tells me, this Shala\u2019Raan vas Tonbay is not a woman naturally inclined to inflicting cruelty and destruction upon others, she is also a soldier, her morality and sensibilities skewed and twisted by decades of hardship and persecution. When she encounters this miniaturized race of humanoids and comes to the rapid conclusion that her only option if she wishes to return to her beloved flotilla is to bring untold devastation and genocide to their civilization, then I suspect she shall waste little time quibbling over the question of whether she has any right to do so. It is my firm belief Shala\u2019Raan vas Tonbay shall resign herself to this grim task with little pause for hesitation, crushing any errant Eldian\u2019s who find themselves unfortunate enough to fall beneath the footfalls of her boots as she sets out upon her task. She shall make her way straight to the heart of the indigenous Eldian\u2019s kingdom, destroying any armies they throw against her, and proceed to lay waste to their capital as she attempts to locate the package I have placed beneath the city for her to find. As I have already said, Shala\u2019Raan vas Tonbay is not a woman naturally inclined to cruelty or violence, but when confronted with the simple choice of life, the indigenous Eldian\u2019s collective lives, or hers, why would she be inclined to show such kindness, when all her people have ever known from alien civilizations is unrelenting hatred and persecution\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026daughter persists that I am wrong, and she is right in this matter\u2026so we have agreed, a little wager.

Forzan vas Idenna is unique to this experiment as unlike the majority of our other potential candidates, she is also a mother, having given birth to a live Quarian infant less than a standard\u2026&lt;terran&gt;\u2026year ago. I have left the offspring in the relative safe company of her family within the Quarian flotilla for the duration of this experiment. The fact that this Quarian female bears a live offspring would seem to strengthen my daughter\u2019s argument, at least to one with a less sceptical mind then myself. Forzan vas Idenna will surely be inclined to feel some form of maternal affection and protectiveness towards the indigenous Eldian children, and thus loathe to take any action that may result in her killing untold numbers of those same Eldian children as a result of her gigantic size and scale. Whilst Vorazun\u2019s argument is thus in theory sound, she does not truly appreciate the maternal bond and desire this Quarian woman will feel to be reunited with her own child upon the flotilla, or the cruelties and destruction she will be willing to inflict upon the indigenous Eldian\u2019s to ensure this happens. Forzan vas Idenna may well try to limit the death toll and destruction caused by her actions, going out of her way to avoid crushing any errant Eldian\u2019s or population centres she comes across, but when her Omni-tool leads her to the Eldian\u2019s capital and the package I have placed beneath it, she will be left with only a single choice. Yes, this Quarian mother may ultimately feel regret over any Eldian children she kills when she proceeds to exhume and destroy the great city in search of her prize, but if that is ultimately the price that must be paid, then I have little doubt that Forzan vas Idenna will crush any city she comes across if she feels it necessary to do so, regardless of the cost in Eldian lives\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026daughter persists that I am wrong, and she is right in this matter\u2026so we have agreed, a little wager.

As a species this race is\u2026use to great economic and social\u2026hardship and persecution at the\u2026 &lt;claws&gt;\u2026 of other corporeal races in stronger positions of\u2026and economic power. It will therefore be\u2026interesting to\u2026witness how she chooses to interact, when presented with another\u2026&lt;alien&gt;\u2026race who by circumstance, are so incredibly at her mercy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026location for this experiment\u2026I have found a world unique to our requirements\u2026indigenous race known as Eldian\u2019s, almost identical too\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026in almost every way accept\u2026scale makes them almost microscopic in comparison to most humanoid races in the galaxy. Even more uniquely\u2026besieged by a race of mutated\u2026humanoids the Eldian\u2019s have collectively dubbed \u2018titans\u2019\u2026behind three circular walls which comprise the majority of the island\u2019s central landmass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Eldian\u2019s are still pre-space faring, and their technology consists largely of automatic assault rifles, armoured battle tanks and attack aircraft\u2026all of which will be quite useless against the Quarian giantess once she arrives. The\u2026technology incorporated into the Quarian\u2019s environmental suit is\u2026significantly more technologically advanced, and incorporates cyclonic energy shielding. Nothing the native Eldian\u2019s possess will be capable of even scratching her suit. Her own integrated weaponry however\u2026suit contains a full array of visual and communication equipment. The magnification her helmet offers will allow her to view the Eldian civilisation and miniaturized people in near perfect detail. She will be able to hear them, understand them, translate their language, and even establish verbal communication is she wishes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I shall place the\u2026&lt;Quarian&gt;\u2026female known as...&lt;translation error&gt;... just off the coast of the\u2026landmass. From the ingenious inhabitant\u2019s perspective\u2026she will be a soaring goddess, over twenty five\u2026&lt;miles&gt;\u2026tall\u2026a single of her footfalls capable of levelling small cities. I have placed a package beneath the centre of the Eldian\u2019s civilization and largest city\u2026which will provide her instantaneous transmission and communication to the Quarian flotilla. The Quarian female\u2019s Omni-tool should lead her straight to the heart of their kingdom\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026how will she react? Will she attempt to communicate with the indigenous Eldian\u2019s\u2026ask them politely to promptly evacuate their capital before she levels their entire city, ripping out the urbanized heart of their civilization in order to dig out her package\u2026simply step or them, as if they were nothing more than a collection of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026my daughter, Vorazun does not share my sentiment. She seems convinced that because this ...&lt;translation error&gt;... bares a womb in her stomach, this will somehow make her sympathetic to the Eldian\u2019s plight. As a result, she will be loath to take any action that may result in unnecessary death and suffering to the near microscopic Eldian children, to whom she may be inclined to feel some maternal compassion towards\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I am somewhat more cynical in my ancient age compared to my daughter. True, the Quarian female we have selected is an anomaly, thus neither I nor my daughter can accurately predict how she will conduct herself once the reality of her situation becomes apparent. Whilst she may not be a naturally cruel or bloodthirsty woman, this Quarian is still a\u2026&lt;organic&gt;\u2026and thus prone to all her kind\u2019s irrational paranoia and brutality once she is removed from an environment she is familiar with. Once she realizes the situation she is in, this\u2026&lt;translation error&gt;\u2026may hesitate, she may even pause to deliberate, but when she realizes that the only way to return to her beloved flotilla is to destroy the centre of the Eldian\u2019s native kingdom, I am confident her true nature shall be revealed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026daughter persists that I am wrong, and she is right in this matter\u2026so we have agreed, a little wager. If she is proved correct\u2026I have promised not to carry out another planetary extermination event for at least another millennium. But if ...&lt;translation error&gt;... actions provide my daughter wrong\u2026Vorazun shall withdrew her protection of the Orion spiral arm, and allow me to purge any world I desire of all life. I have been looking forward to dealing with that pestilent little race of\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026my daughter know, that I will not be keeping my promise. If against all my expectations and assumptions, this Quarian decides starvation and death is preferable to mass murder, then I shall reach out into the corporeal world\u2026take physical form within\u2026the Eldian\u2019s\u2026star system\u2026enclose my\u2026&lt;claws&gt;\u2026around the entire planet, and crush the entire world to dust within my palm\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026homeworld will be next. Such is the right off a goddess after all, and I always get what I want\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>With whose perspective does the story now switch to;</b></span></div></div>",

All eyes were raised to the fifty metre high wall and the skinless yet very human like head that soared above it, a dark and unnatural shadow protruding across the centre of the district as the titan; colossal beyond all reckoning looked down upon the little humans with hunger.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex stared up at the giant\u2019s head, his lips parted and mouth dry in the summer heat of the afternoon, the boy\u2019s tongue stubbornly still and unmoving inside his mouth.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh God\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s a titan\u201d Sara whispered from behind him, the hand of his adopted sister clasped around his, her nails digging into his palm.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMovement flickered at the corner of his eye, and instinctively Alex knew that one of their two younger siblings was beside them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWas it Billy, or Jessica?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex could not turn his head to see, so thawed with fear the young boy was.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nScarcely a minute before, the four young siblings had all been happy and laughing, the children enjoying the afternoon sunshine which had seen them relaxing in the central plaza of Shiganshina district.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were homeless street orphans all of them, related neither by blood, marriage or money, but instead by the need of young children to find solace and comfort in a society that had all but abandoned them. Alex was the oldest of them at twelve years of age, with Sara the older \u2018sister\u2019 of the group at ten. Billy was eight, and Jessica six. They looked out for each other, protected each other, and together the four siblings formed a close knit family that survived together in the poorest region of the kingdom behind the walls.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThat momentary happiness between the hunger, the freezing nights spent upon cold city streets and hiding from corrupt soldiers of the city garrison seemed a distant dream in Alex\u2019s past now as the huge face of the titan looked down upon them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026not possible\u2026\u201d Billy stammered, \u201c\u2026that wall is over fifty metres tall. That titan\u2019s got to be\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cOver Two Hundred feet high\u201d Alex finished.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIs that a titan?\u201d Jessica asked, her voice as innocently na\u00efve as it always was.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe have to get out of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBefore Alex could finish a thunderous crash shook the district, Wall Maria seeming to groan with the sound of cracking rock as the ground shook beneath the four children\u2019s feet, and then the centre of the Curtain wall was smashed outwards in a churning explosion of dust and debris.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex was suddenly snapped from his stupor. Grasping his siblings by their arms he dragged them towards the nearest building as chucks of the broken wall peppered the city. Slabs of stone and mortar smashed through buildings, flattened houses and peppered streets, cutting down and crushing anyone unfortunate enough to find themselves in their path.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBlood splashed across the paved streets and walls as the first screams echoed across the district, fear giving way to panic as the full realization of what had just happened dawned upon the little outlier city\u2019s inhabitants.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re though the walls!\u201d someone screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs he was helping Billy to his feet, Alex turned towards wall, his gut twisting like a knife inside his stomach. Wall Maria still stood, the Colossal Titan suddenly gone as quickly as it had appeared, but from the gaping hole it had smashed through the lower segment of the wall, lanky and pale humanoid forms many times taller than a man were emerging, gapping wide toothed mouths open atop bobbing listing heads, their swollen human like eyes searching hungrily for flesh.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTitans!<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to the gate\u201d Alex shouted, grasping Jessica\u2019s arm as he did so, \u201cSara, take Billy\u2019s hand. Don\u2019t let go.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got no papers\u201d Sara cried, \u201cThey won\u2019t let us through.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to try. Come On!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTogether, the four orphans sprinted across the open plaza, a large crowd already forming across the mouth of the Aquila thoroughfare, the most direct route to the only remaining gate out of Shiganshina District, and deeper into the Kingdom behind the Walls.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs they approached the avenue, just how hopeless their situation was becoming apparent to Alex very quickly. Shiganshina District contained over hundred and sixty thousand permanently resident men, women and children, and it seemed that every single one of them today was gathered into a single swelling crowd that blocked the main intersection of the thoroughfare, their numbers growing with every passing second.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA thin line of city guardsmen from the Royal Garrison were clustered around the baying mob, their distinctive cobalt blue uniforms and battle armour marking them out amongst the crowd. Futilely they tried to bring some semblance of order to chaotic crowd, the soldiers burnishing their matt-black gauss rifles into the air.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was just as Alex and his three siblings reached the edge of the crowd that the sound of crumbling brick and masonry echoed across the open plaza. Panting for breath Alex turned, his three siblings pausing to follow his gaze towards the other end of the square, just in time to see a titan clambering over a triple storied house.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe titan was perhaps five or six metres tall, its giant form lurching drunkenly forward as it tried to navigate its way over the house, one long leg coming down upon the buildings balcony. The was a grinding off broken tiles and then suddenly the titan was plunging through the second storey roof, its arms flailing uselessly as it tried to dig its way free, and then the second titan appeared.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was at least twice as tall of the first, and unlike its companion it emerged from the closest street, a third titan stumbling forth in its wake. More titans suddenly appeared, their slow unwieldy forms rising from behind the row of houses and shops that lined the plaza and adjacent  roads, roofs and walls, an overhanging bridge collapsing as one smashed its way into the plaza, the tallest amongst them standing over fourteen metres high.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThere in the square!\u201d someone shouted.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGuardsman\u201d shouted a thick voice, \u201cForm Up. Deploy the behemoths!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA line of infantrymen detached themselves from the crowd, running past Alex, Sara, Billy and Jessica as they stormed into the square. At least two dozen thick beetle like Behemoth class battle tanks grinded their way into the square, their heavy tracks crushing they ancient cobbles of the plaza. The guardsmen formed a line over a thousand strong as they levelled their gauss rifles and assault cannons towards the approaching titans, their heavy Behemoth battle tanks following suit as their bulbous turrets swept round, the dual prongs of their railgun\u2019s coming to bare on the approaching titans. A thickly build man in a officers uniform emerged from their ranks. The man sported a curling moustache, and burnished a sword which he now swept through the air.<br>\r\n  \u201cFire!\u201d the officer screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex clasped his hands over his ears, shouting at his siblings to do the same as the first volley fired, the whistling <i>zoom and crack</i> of close to a thousand gauss rifles suddenly followed by explosive <i>boom</i> as the railguns lets loose, the tracks of the heavy tanks lurching backwards with the force of the blast.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe shots slammed into the oncoming titans, the fist sized magnetic rounds from the gauss rifles peppering their wiry misshapen bodies as the railgun shots ripped through limbs, human like blood splashing across the plaza floor. Alex saw a titan stumble and fall, its nightmarish face reduced to a bloody stump where one of the tanks railguns had caught its head and ripped it clean off, but to his horror Alex could see its body already fighting to regain its footing, a twisting mass of flesh atop its neck already reforming as it head began to grow back.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nNo more than two of the titans had been felled by the solders first volley, and at least a dozen more were already shambling forwards, the closest halfway across the square already.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cReload\u201d the sergeant shouted, \u201cProtect the civilians at all costs.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe soldiers fired again, and the lead titan was cut down, but then another was shambling forwards in its place, its ten-metre-high form towering above the thin line of soldiers who were still reloading.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we do!\u201d Sara screamed from behind Alex, \u201cWe\u2019re trapped.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex turned back to the crowd, his heart sinking. Without the guardsmen there to police the evacuation, the crowd that still blocked the intersection had descended into an even more chaotic mass as people punched, kicked and clawed at each other, the press of so many human bodies preventing all but a handful from moving forward. Already Alex could see more titans worming their way around the plazas edge, and instinctively he knew they intended to flank the soldiers. The dumb brute\u2019s tiny animal like minds had deduced the quickest possible path to the crowd.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThat intersection would soon become a bloodbath.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cAlex!\u201d Sara screamed, Jessica and Billy crying behind her \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cFollow me\u201d Alex shouted. Leading Jessica again by her arm, Alex sprinted across the edge of square, Sara and Billy hard on his heels. Steeling a glance over his shoulder, Alex glimpsed a titan in amongst detachment of soldiers. Their line reeled, a squirming human form suspended at least eight metres off the ground in the meaty fist of a titan. The soldier convulsed inside the titan\u2019s fist as the fingers of the giant crushed his torso, blood frothing from the man\u2019s lips as his companions fired their rifles upwards.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex twisted back his head, swerving to avoid a discarded box of rotting fish. Jessica cried out as her foot struck the box, but Alex continued to pull her after him, ignoring his baby sisters whimpering. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nRather than the intersection, Alex led them to one of the plaza\u2019s corners, where the sewage of the both Shiganshina eastern and northern drainage ditches met in a low-slung trench. Jumping into the filthy knee deep water Alex grasped hold of the thin grated wire-mesh plate that blocked the entrance to the underground pipe and pulled with all his might.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe plate groaned, one edge peeling free from the waterproof brickwork to which it was stuck. The thin wire-mesh twisted between his fingers, blood dripping from between his nails, then with one last groan the thinly stripped metal came apart, the grated plate coming out in his hands.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s open\u201d Alex said, \u201cCome on, get in. Get in!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSara was the first in, dragging a now sobbing Jessica behind her as the two girls descended to their knees and disappeared into the pipe. Billy was next, Alex pushing his younger brother into the pipe with both hands before turning back to the square, the water suddenly trembling around him.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTurning back towards the plaza, Alex\u2019s heart sunk. At least a dozen titans were now amongst the guardsmen, and almost each and every one of the giant freaks had the limbs of a screaming and struggling soldier clasped in their huge hands, obvious to the scattered gunfire tearing into their flesh as they feasted upon their screaming, still living victims.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA titan chased a fleeing soldier, the man dropping his spent gauss rifle only to be plucked from the ground, kicking at the thick meaty fingers that had grasped hold of his leg. His screams echoed across the square as the titan clamped its huge mouth around his torso, thick arterial blood spurting upwards. A tanks railgun fired, blowing the arm of another titan clean off as its crew tried to reload, then another titan was upon them, overturning the cannon and crushing one of the surviving soldiers, one of his companions hurriedly reloading his rifle as another fled.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMovement from the corner of his eyes caught Alex attention, and suddenly the young boy realized a titan was lumbering towards him, the water splashing upwards around his legs. It was a big titan, almost fifteen metres tall, and it was almost upon him.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nDiving to his knees Alex scrambled into the pipeway. From the corner of his eye his glimpsed one final shot of the plaza, the human soldiers dead or dying, the crowd at the intersection all but clawing over each other as the titans converged upon them, a towering fifteen metre tall titan plucking a man from the crowd to consume. And then there was the human officer in the middle of plaza, his sword still brandished into the air and hand-cannon grasped in one hand, surrounded.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe approaching titan stumbled and fell, its clumsy flailing body landing straight atop the trench. Already in the pipe, a sudden surge of water splashed over Alex, the filthy liquid getting into his eyes, ears and mouth. Still the boy continued forward, the repetitive <i>splash splash splash</i> up ahead telling him that his siblings were still clambering through the tunnel further up.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cKeep going\u201d Alex screamed spitting out the fowl tasting water as he did so, \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was many minutes later that they reached the other end of the pipe, Sara poised at the entrance waiting for Alex while Billy and Jessica sat shivering in the closest alleyway.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHuman screams, alongside the sound of ripping flesh and breaking bones echoed across the rooftops, coming from where the crowd had been at the edge of the plaza.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep moving\u201d Alex said, rousing Billy and Jessica to their feet, \u201cGet up get up. They\u2019ll be closing the gate soon.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe children were now on Shiganshina District\u2019s northern side, only a few streets to the gateway. Hand in hand Alex led them forward, the four orphans emerging from the alleyway and into a small square, the ground suddenly shaking.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA titan emerged from atop the overhanging roofs, its towering form at least ten metres high. Its wide mouthed grinning visage regarded the young orphans with hunger, and suddenly one gangly arm was reaching down towards them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cRun!\u201d Alex shouted, pushing his siblings to one side. Together they dived under an overhanging archway, the titan half destroying the front of a shop was its attempt to grasp at them went wide.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTwisting on his heel Alex shoved Jessica and Billy forward, Sara running behind him and together the siblings sprinted beneath the titan\u2019s legs, the massive creature twisting it body to fast as it stumbled and fell.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe ground shook with the giant\u2019s collapse. Billy cried out as he stumbled forward, but Alex was behind him, pushing his younger brother to his feet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey emerged from the alleyway into the main thoroughfare, two mid-sized titans turning to meet them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cBack\u201d Alex shouted, the titan\u2019s arms coming up as they stumbled forwards, preparing to grasp at the human children, \u201cGet back!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nCannon fire ripped across the thoroughfare, smashing straight into the two titans. One of the titans took a cannon ball straight to the shoulder, the blast ripping apart half its torso whilst the second took a blow to its legs, the shot ripping them both clean off as thick arterial human like blood splashed across the walls and street.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGlancing the way the shots had come, Alex could see the inner gate. Six cannons and a gaggle of guardsman were gathered around the gate\u2019s entrance, waving the children forwards.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s still open\u201d Alex said, pulling Jessica and Billy into the street, \u201cCome on. Run!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey entered the thoroughfare, Alex and Sara each dragging one of their younger siblings after them. From the closest alleyways and streets other humans emerged, and soon they were part of small crowd filtering up the gate. The familiar sound of crumbling bricks and mortar echoed down the road.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGlancing over his shoulder as he ran, Alex saw a titan emerge from the thoroughfare\u2019s winding edge, at least two more behind it.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGet down\u201d a soldier screamed, Alex and Sara throwing their younger siblings to the ground as the cannons fired. The Oncoming titan was cut down as were two of the beast\u2019s companions. Alex twisted onto his back as the gigantic humanoids stumbled forwards and fell, limbs and heads ripped clean off, but already he could see movement behind them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGet up, get up!\u201d he said, rousing Jessica to her feet. The girl continued to sob as they pushed forward, Sara and Billy behind them, and then they were at the gate. A blond haired officer shoved them through the gigantic archway beneath the interior of wall Maria, and then suddenly for the first time in their lives Alex, Sara, Billy and Jessica were outside of Shiganshina district, and inside the interior of Wall Maria.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA vast expanse of open green fields and rolling hills stretched out as far as any of them could see, whilst a paved dual carriageway from the gateway ran all the way to the horizon. Somewhere far in the distance Alex knew Wall Rose stood, and beyond that Wall Sheena, and then the royal capital and the lavish Palace of the King. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAnother crowd greeted them, even larger than the one they had encountered in the plaza. The mass of huddled refugees from Shiganshina District was nestled between the small trading town that adjoined Wall Maria\u2019s Inner Gate, and the airport where a line of dropship\u2019s were docked. A thin line of guardsman was gathered before the ships, selecting people to take on and turning others away, their gauss-rifles pointed towards the crowd as a warning.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThere\u201d Alex said, \u201cCome on. We have to get on that last ship.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA sharp crack of railgun fire echoed from inside the gate as they approached the port, the crowd and soldiers tensing, yet no one tried to rush the dropships. Alex and his siblings made their way through the press of the crowd, Alex maintaining a firm grip on Jessica\u2019s hand, who in turn had her hand gripped to Jesscia\u2019s, who in turn was leading Billy at their rear.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBehind them another volley of railgun and gauss rifles fire boomed, people glancing nervously back the way they had come.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d someone shouted up ahead, \u201cLet us on!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWomen and children only at this time Sir\u201d a reply came, \u201cMore dropship\u2019s and transport will be here soon for the rest of you.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey reached the front of the crowd just as another volley of gauss rifle fire went off, the thin line of soldiers stretched out before the docked ships eying each other nervously as the crowd edged closer, then a man attempted to rush the nearest gangplank.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cStop him!\u201d an officer shouted.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTwo soldiers leapt forward to restrain the man, their compatriots raising their rifles to the crowd in warning.</span></div></div>",

Together the four children made their way forward, a shaven headed officer glancing up and waving them forward, his soldiers parting to let them on.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were just at the gangplank of the nearest ship when a forth volley of explosive tank and rifle fire echoed outwards from behind Wall Rose, this time the gunfire punctuated with a chorus of human screams. Alex turned his head, glimpsing the terrified looks on the faces of the crowd, and then the first scream went up.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThere right outside the gate!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWith that the crowd finally panicked and surged, dozens of people pushing their way forward as a soldier discharged his gauss rifle into the crowd, then all hell broke loose. Hundreds of Shiganshina\u2019s townspeople were surging up the gang plank, the half a dozen or so soldiers guarding it being grappled to the ground and beaten as more rifles were fired into the roaring crowd.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex pulled Sara behind him, Jessica trying to do the same to Billy as the crowd surged into them, and then suddenly Alex was falling, thick hands grasping him by his collar and throwing him aside and back onto the dry-docks ledge<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cSara\u201d, Alex shouted, \u201cJessica!\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIn the thick press of bodies Alex glimpsed Billy, his younger brother tossed to the ground the other side of the gang plank, struggling to return to his feet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t see his sisters.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cGet us in air, get us into the air. Before they swamp us!\u201d a voice screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe dropship suddenly lurched precariously to one side, over a hundred people screaming as its repulsor engines mounted onto either side of its stubby wings fired off, people leaping back with burnt limbs and soldered clothing.  Through the press of people, Alex glimpsed Sara and Jessica, the two girls staring back at them from the dropship\u2019s passenger deck.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe dropship\u2019s lurched backwards and rose, it repulsor engines spitting cones of blue fire downwards at its ascended upwards into the air. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey were safe, for now.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe other dropships were preparing to lift off, the crews and passengers beating back the surging crowd as they struggled to close the doors.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGlancing back towards the trading town across the road, Alex caught sight of over a dozen tacked cargo trawlers, a ring of armed mercenaries holding back a smaller crowd just as the soldiers before the train had been a moment earlier.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nScrambling back to his feet, Alex found his way to Billy and pulled the young boy to his feet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we do\u201d his brother cried.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cFollow me.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex led his brother across the road and past the entrance to the trading town, another round of railgun fire punctuating the screams of both crowds.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex and Billy wormed their way through the crowd and were soon within sight of the trawlers. Whoever owned the caravan must have had a soft spot for the two orphans that day, for the ring of guards parted and they were dragged forward, the crowd yelling and clawing behind them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat about us!\u201d someone screamed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nA tall mercenary with cropped black hair lifted Alex and Billy into one of the trawlers gangplanks, the rear compartment so crammed with women, children and a small number of labourers that the two boys were forced to perch themselves upon the end, their legs dangling over the wagons parapet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, time to go!\u201d the caravan master shouted, and with that the drivers fired up their engines, the heavy cargo vehicles lurching forwards. The mercenaries rushed back towards their trawlers as the crowd surged after them, the caravan picking up speed as the mercenaries boarded each of the vehicles in turn, their fellow guards hanging from the edge of their transports decks to beat off the questing hands of the crowd with heavy truncheons and rifle butts.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlex didn\u2019t think that they would make it out of the mob, but at the last moment the bulk of the crowd dispersed before the now charging vehicles, the few remaining men and women being crushed beneath the grinding tracks of the cargo trawlers as they made their escape.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was with a mixture of both relief and fatigue that Alex allowed himself to fall backwards onto the cargo trawlers metal gangplank. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIn the distance, the dropship carrying Sara and Jessica was hurtling towards the sky and the horizon, no doubt its way to Trost District.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThey would be safe there, until Alex and Billy caught up with them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cIs it over\u201d Billy asked.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cI think so\u201d Alex replied, \u201cWe\u2019re safe now.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Inner Gateway of Shiganshina District was just barely visible to them now, but Alex could see the gate coming down. They would close it, the titans would not follow and despite the hundreds of people who had died here today, that would be that.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was only a handful of seconds later that both boys saw the Inner gateway smash outwards, a fifteen-metre-tall armoured titan barrelling straight through the archway as if it had been made of sand.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt had finally happened.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe titans had breached wall Maria.</span></div></div>",

Deftly she recognized the symbol for <i>foreign contaminant</i> but could not recall what she was suppose to do until she felt the medical antibodies administered by her suit flooding into her bloodstream.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nDeep down at the back of her throat the Quarian could feel something begin to bubble and froth, and suddenly she knew she was about to be sick.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nPushing herself up onto one elbow the female shuddered, clenching her lips more out of reflex then actual conscious thought. Water trickled down from her back, small waves rippling forth in the water around her as she reached towards the Omni-tool at her wrist with her free hand, her gloved finger and thumb activating her suits environmental controls.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe coughed, her lips still clenched tightly behind gritted teeth, and with one final flick of her thumb she stabbed down at her Omni-tool, overriding the emergency ventilation port of her helmet. The cylindrical port which covered her mouth opened with a pressurised hiss, her lips parted and she vomited.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cOoogggg\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBlood, bile and a toxic mixture of broken down antibiotic paste plummeted down into the water below. The Quarian heaved again, her hand splashing down into the water, and faintly was she aware of the ground crumbling beneath her gloved palm, almost as if she had been a giant slamming her fist into the ground.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nJust as quickly had the sensation to gag had come over her, it passed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nClean filtered air fed by her suit pumped into her helmet and with a smooth gust of wind her mouth port closed, sealing her back inside her helmet. She breathed, a sensation of weightlessness momentarily overcoming her as a second round of antibiotics and endorphins flood through her bloodstream, purging any remnants of the contaminants which appeared to have temporarily breached her suit.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nGroggily, the Quarian woman sat up, one hand still planted firmly behind her. Drawing her long legs up towards her chest, she flexed the toes of her boots and once she was satisfied she was reasonably stable, she tried to stand.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe movement of rising to her feet was relatively fluid, through she still felt a little unsteady. Perplexingly, she felt her boots sink slightly into the ground. It was not the sensation of her feet sinking into sand, but the impression of a million tiny fragments of shale crushing like ice beneath her bootsoles, yet whatever the strange substance she was standing on was, it seemed to support her weight.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Quarian found herself looking at her hand, her long fingers and thumb flexing beneath the heavy padding of her suit\u2019s gloves.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWho am I\u2026?\u201d the Quarian asked, her voice coming out as a metallic echo of the one she imagined hearing in her head. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSuddenly she found herself looking towards the horizon, the endless puddle of water seemingly to stretch around her in all directions.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nNeither question answered the other, though she could sense her name of the very tip of her tongue, and slowly memories began to resurface.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe titled her head towards the sky, the sunlight glancing of her visor. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was bright, unusually bright and she was forced to lift a hand to shield her eyes.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nUp there, beyond the blue sky of this world and into the dark blackness beyond was where she had come from.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe was a Quarian. Her people were a nomadic race of scavengers, engineers and scientists, forever doomed to travel the endless void of space within their sealed starships, to be sneered and loathed by those races and civilizations who still enjoyed the protection of their colonies and homeworlds. Somewhere deep down the Quarian knew that she despised them for that, and in her deepest darkest thoughts she sometimes found herself wishing unspeakable calamity upon those ignorant people and races. A dark shadow falling across the civilization of those who had never known hunger or loss, the tiny aliens fleeing as a boot of cruel malice ground them beneath its heel.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHer immune system was weak. That much she remembered clearly, hence the need for her sealed environmental suit, yet stubbornly her name and her personnel history escaped her.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nLowering her head, the Quarian glanced back towards the horizon. Her hands descended to her hips as she surveyed her surroundings, trying to make sense at what she saw.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThere was no beach, no landmass, and yet she knew she could not have been standing in the middle of an ocean with the water lapping around her boots.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm\u2026\u201d the Quarian mused, \u201cCould I be a giant\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe imagined tiny wooden sailing ships banking against the crushing waves beneath her ankles, the minuscule human like crews fighting against their rigging as she stepped backwards, oblivious to their presence even as she condemned them and their tiny wooden sailing ships to be crushed beneath her hard soles of her boots.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe idea was entertaining, if only for a moment, but quite preposterous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was woman of science, and therefore she knew that there must a reasonable explanation for the world she found herself on.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAlmost as if it had been in response to the thought, she glimpsed something ahead, just below the horizon. Her visor dimmed to compensate for the intense light, and suddenly she could see a landmass ahead.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Quarian could have slapped a palm to her visor.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was right there!<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHow by the God\u2019s could she have missed it?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe landmass was shallow but she was sure that was just an effect of the light blocking her full view of the horizon and the mountains that would be beyond.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nJust as she was about to set off towards it, her Omni-tool bleeped.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTurning to the holographic terminal across her wrist, the Quarian tapped at the interface, her eyebrow rising in an almost quizzical gesture. Somewhere in the direction of the \u2018island\u2019 was a signal, perhaps a way for her to get off this world and back to the flotilla.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nEither way, it was better than staying here.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSmiling beneath her helmet, the Quarian took her first step towards the island. Water rippled outwards in tandems with her footfalls, and as she got closer more and more of the island could be seen.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIt was surprisingly flat from what she could see, but as more and more of the landmass came into focus she saw what might have been larger landmarks against the horizon. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nOr was it just a trick of her eyes?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe Quarian woman was half way to setting foot on \u2018Paradise Island\u2019, and the besieged Kingdom behind the Walls when suddenly she remembered her name, and who she was;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-\tHer Name was;</b></span></div></div>",

As a species this race is\u2026use to great economic and social\u2026hardship and persecution at the\u2026 &lt;claws&gt;\u2026 of other corporeal races in stronger positions of\u2026and economic power. It will therefore be\u2026interesting to\u2026witness how she chooses to interact, when presented with another\u2026&lt;alien&gt;\u2026race who by circumstance, are so incredibly at her mercy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026location for this experiment\u2026I have found a world unique to our requirements\u2026indigenous race known as Eldian\u2019s, almost identical too\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026in almost every way accept\u2026scale makes them almost microscopic in comparison to most humanoid races in the galaxy. Even more uniquely\u2026besieged by a race of mutated\u2026humanoids the Eldian\u2019s have collectively dubbed \u2018titans\u2019\u2026behind three circular walls which comprise the majority of the island\u2019s central landmass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Eldian\u2019s are still pre-space faring, though they are on the cusp of it. Their armies consist largely of semi-powered armoured infantry equipped with gauss rifles, long range subsonic railguns and cold fusion nuclear missiles\u2026all of which will be quite useless against the Quarian giantess once she arrives. The\u2026technology incorporated into the Quarian\u2019s environmental suit is\u2026significantly more technologically advanced, and incorporates cyclonic energy shielding. Nothing the native Eldian\u2019s possess will be capable of even scratching her suit. Her own integrated weaponry however\u2026suit contains a full array of visual and communication equipment. The magnification her helmet offers will allow her to view the Eldian civilisation and miniaturized people in near perfect detail. She will be able to hear them, understand them, translate their language, and even establish verbal communication is she wishes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I shall place the\u2026&lt;Quarian&gt;\u2026female known as\u2026Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya\u2026 just off the coast of the\u2026landmass. From the ingenious inhabitant\u2019s perspective\u2026she will be a monolithic\u2026over one hundred\u2026&lt;miles&gt;\u2026tall\u2026a single of her footfalls capable of levelling entire mountain ranges. I have placed a package beneath the centre of the Eldian\u2019s civilization and largest city\u2026which will provide her instantaneous transmission and communication to the Quarian flotilla. The Quarian female\u2019s Omni-tool should lead her straight to the heart of their kingdom\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026how will she react? Will she attempt to communicate with the indigenous Eldian\u2019s\u2026ask them politely to promptly evacuate their capital before she levels their entire city, ripping out the urbanized heart of their civilization in order to dig out her package\u2026simply step or them, as if they were nothing more than a collection of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026my daughter, Vorazun does not share my sentiment. She seems convinced that because this Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya bares a womb in her stomach, this will somehow make her sympathetic to the Eldian\u2019s plight. As a result, she will be loath to take any action that may result in unnecessary death and suffering to the near microscopic Eldian children, to whom she may be inclined to feel some maternal compassion towards\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026I am somewhat more cynical in my ancient age compared to my daughter. True, from what her profile tells me, Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya is not a naturally cruel and malicious woman, but she is still a\u2026&lt;organic&gt;\u2026origin, and thus prone to same pleasures and prejudices of her kind. She may ponder, she may pause, and she may even come to regret her actions in\u2026&lt;years&gt;\u2026to come. Still, I have no doubt that when she encounters this miniaturized race of humanoids, and realizes she can with but a single step annihilate entire cities, a necessary evil in order to return to her beloved flotilla, she will not hesitate to bring unfathomable destruction to the their civilization, if she believes it in her interest to do so. The native Eldian\u2019s are after all little more than near microscopic insects to her, and this is exactly how she will come to view them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026daughter persists that I am wrong, and she is right in this matter\u2026so we have agreed, a little wager. If she is proved correct\u2026I have promised not to carry out another planetary extermination event for at least another millennium. But if Tali\u2019Zorah nar Rayya actions provide my daughter wrong\u2026Vorazun shall withdrew her protection of the Orion spiral arm, and allow me to purge any world I desire of all life. I have been looking forward to dealing with that pestilent little race of\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026my daughter know, that I will not be keeping my promise. If against all my expectations and assumptions, this Quarian decides starvation and death is preferable to mass murder, then I shall reach out into the corporeal world\u2026take physical form within\u2026the Eldian\u2019s\u2026star system\u2026enclose my\u2026&lt;claws&gt;\u2026around the entire planet, and crush the entire world to dust within my palm\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026&lt;humans&gt;\u2026homeworld will be next.

If Daro\u2019Xen vas Moreh feels it is in her interest to destroy entire cities and their collective populations, even if her motives in such actions is to simply to reveal in the pleasure that she can, then I have no doubt those cities will be crushed flat beneath the soles of this Quarian woman\u2019s boots.

She shall make her way straight to the heart of the indigenous Eldian\u2019s kingdom, destroying any armies they throw against her, and proceed to lay waste to their capital as she attempts to locate the package I have placed beneath the city for her to find. As I have already said, Shala\u2019Raan vas Tonbay is not a woman naturally inclined to cruelty or violence, but when confronted with the simple choice of life, the indigenous Eldian\u2019s collective lives, or hers, why would she be inclined to show such kindness, when all her people have ever known from alien civilizations is unrelenting hatred and persecution\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026daughter persists that I am wrong, and she is right in this matter\u2026so we have agreed, a little wager.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Ok, this story has been along time coming, and I hope whoever is reading this finds the outcome satisfactory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd just like to thank 'aquarianfetishist' (<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://aquarianfetishist.deviantart.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://aquarianfetishist.deviantart.com/</a>) over the Deviantart for granting me position to use his beautiful image as cover for this story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we go into the story, I just want to use this 'introduction\u2019 to provide some further information on the setting, characters and rules of this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, what is this story?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn simple terms and as the title suggests, this story supposes that a Quarian female from the Mass Effect Universe (many choices to pick from in terms of who this character is) suddenly finds herself transported to the world of AOT (Attack On Titan) by an all-powerful omnipotent being from a trans-dimensional universe. Not only does this (for now) unnamed Quarian find herself in the world of AOT, but she is also a giantess, somewhere between 1 \u2013 100 miles tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs part of a twisted psychological experiment, the all powerful being responsible for transporting this Quarian woman to this \u2018alternative\u2019 universe and turning her into a giantess, has also placed a long range interstellar communicator beneath the largest human city within the Quarian\u2019s local vicinity. The Quarian quickly detects a signal from the communicator via her Omni-tool, and proceeds to make her way towards it, believing this communicator is her only way to reestablish contact with the Quarian migrant fleet. Unfortunately the communicator can only be 'dug out' from beneath the Eldian's capital, meaning the majority of the city would need to be destroyed to exhume the device, which will leave the Quarian with a single decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither she destroys an entire city, and possibly kills millions of tiny humans in the process in an attempt to retrieve the communicator, or remain stranded upon the planet, forever a giantess.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purpose of this experiment, and the reason that this specific scenario has been setup by this all powerful extra dimensional  being, is to allow them to observe how the Quarian reacts to this extraordinary situation that she finds herself in, and to witness whether she will consent to the cold blooded destruction an entire civilization of tiny humans simply to return home to her people and family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Setting</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor anyone who is familiar with the Quarian\u2019s from Mass Effect, but not familiar with the anime and manga AOT (Attack On Titan), it is quite a simple setting to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Attack On Titan\u2019 takes place on a small continent named Paradise Island, on an unnamed earth like planet. A race of humans called Eldian\u2019s (Eldian is their nationality) with mid to late 19th era century technology live behind three huge circular walls fifty meter\u2019s high. The total area of land inside the walls covers an area comparable to modern day Germany in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside these walls, naked humanoid giants called \u2018titans\u2019 roam freely, their size ranging from approximately 10 feet in height to 50 feet in height. Titans psychically resemble giant but malformed humans, and can best described as giant zombies who will attempt to eat humans whenever they encounter them. For this very reason, the Eldian\u2019s have walled off their kingdom, and have enjoyed approximately 100 years of peace and prosperity by the time this story starts. Each wall is studded with 4 \u2018outlier\u2019 districts, towns behind semi-circular fortifications that jut out like thorns on each wall, which is wear the poorest citizens live as they are at most risk of attack by titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is roughly what the Kingdom of Eldia looks like from an ariel view;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/shingekinokyojin/images/0/0b/CPAI4.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161101011140\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/shingekinokyojin/images/0/0b/CPAI4.jpg/revis...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis his roughly what an outlier district looks like;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/shingekinokyojin/images/e/e9/Karanes_District.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170710122213\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/shingekinokyojin/images/e/e9/Karanes_Distric...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth in the Manga and at the time this story begins, the 100 years peace humans have enjoyed is shattered when a colossal 200 foot titans appears at the outer most wall and smashes a hole through it, the smaller titans proceeding the swarm into the human kingdom and devour the Eldian\u2019s inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor anyone reading this story who is familiar with the universe of AOT, but unfamiliar with the Quarian race of Mass Effect, Quarian's are a nomadic space-faring alien culture who were driven out of their home systems generations ago by their own cybernetic creations. Not psychically dissimilar from humans, Quarians have lived their entire lives within the sterile environments of their overcrowded starships, which has practically destroyed their immune systems. As a result, Quarians are equipped with environmental suits and armour which cover them from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is the background of this setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story begins just as the titan\u2019s breach \u2018Wall Maria\u2019, the outer most wall of the Eldian Kingdom, as an army of 10 \u2013 50 foot tall titans are storming the outlying Eldian district, eating any humans they can find. At the same time, a Quarian giantess somewhere between 1 \u2013 100 miles tall will find herself waking up in an ocean just of the coast of Paradise Island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn due course, she will encounter both the tiny \u2018titan\u2019s\u2019 and even tinier humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story will initially take place from 2 perspectives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne will be written from the perspective of the Quarian woman, and the other will be written from a small band of human children who have escaped the initial massacre of the titans breaching the wall section of their home town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere the story goes will be up to the writers, however there are a few early choices that will determine some important parameters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Size &amp; HumanTechnology</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first chapter will end with the reader choosing 1 of 5 options for the Quarian\u2019s giantess\u2019s height, and this will determine the level of technology and population the native Eldian\u2019s have access to. The more massive the Quarian giantess, the larger the Eldian cities will be for her to stomp, and the more advanced technology they will have to throw at her. (Nothing they have will be able to harm her regardless, but I feel it add a lot of variety to the content of the chapters)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease see below table to see how your initial choice of the Quarian\u2019s woman's size will effect the total Eldian population and available technology. (As an example, if you choose for the Quarian to be one mile tall, the Eldian\u2019s will have outlier districts with populations in the lower thousands, with the total population of the kingdom being 1.2 million people. If you choose for the Quarian to be 100 miles tall, the outlier districts will be the size of small cities, with over a hundred and fifty thousand people in each district, with the Kingdom's total population numbering over 100 million people)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Quarian Height (Miles)....................District Pop.......Wall Maria Pop.....Wall Rose Pop.....Wall Sheena Pop..................Total Pop</b><br>\r\n1 Mile Tall (5,280 Feet)...........................10,000..................200,000................400,000...................600,000..................1,200,000<br>\r\n5 Mile\u2019s Tall (26,400 Feet).......................20,000.............. 1,000,000.............2,000,000................3,000,000..................6,000,000<br>\r\n10 Mile\u2019s Tall (52,800 Feet).....................40,000...............2,000,000.............4,000,000................6,000,000................12,000,000<br>\r\n25 Mile\u2019s Tall (132,000 Feet)...................80,000...............5,000,000...........10,000,000..............15,000,000................30,000,000<br>\r\n100 Mile\u2019s Tall\t(528,000 Feet)...............160,000.............20,000,000.......... 40,000,000..............60,000,000..............120,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease also see below table to determine what level of technology the Eldians have access to, as determined by the Quarian giantess\u2019s height. (For example, a 1 mile tall Quarian giantess will be encountering tiny humans armed with muskets and antiquated muzzle loading wheeled cannons. A 100-mile-tall Quarian giantess will thus be facing tiny humans armed with futuristic gauss rifles and railgun equipped battle tanks. Nothing in the tiny human\u2019s arsenal will be capable of harming the giantess regardless, but I feel it will still add an interesting degree of variety to the story)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Quarian Scale (Miles)...............Power..................................Transport..................................Weapons</b><br>\r\n1 Mile Tall.....................................Wind Power..........................Sailing Ships/Horse..................Muskets &amp; Cannons<br>\r\n5 Miles Tall....................................Steam..................................Horse/Steam Train...................Bolt-action Rifles &amp; Howitzers\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                                                                    <br>\r\n10 Miles Tall..................................Internal Combustion............Automobiles/Airships................Semi-Auto Rifles, Machineguns &amp; Tanks \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                                                    <br>\r\n25 Miles Tall..................................Fossil Fuels.........................Maglev Trains...........................

A number of different Quarian females from the games are available after Chapter 2;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Quarians</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-\tTali'Zorah nar Rayya</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\no\tThe famous Tali\u2019 Zorah from the games. I\u2019d imagine from her appearance in the games, if put in this theoretical situation, she would do her best to get back to the migrant fleet whilst not causing any intentional harm to the native Eldian\u2019s, no matter how difficult it may be if she is between 1 \u2013 100 miles from their perspective. But I could be mistaken in this belief, its not like Tali hasn\u2019t killed people before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-\tDaro'Xen vas Moreh</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\no\tVoiced by Farscape favorite Claudia Black, Daro'Xen vas Moreh as depicted in the games is a Quarian Admiral with virtually no ethical scruples when it comes to her dealing with alien races. With this in mind, if Daro\u2019Xen did find herself in this theoretical situation, I cannot imagine her losing sleep if she had to crush a few Eldian cities to get her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-\tShala'Raan vas Tonbay</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\no\tTali\u2019s aunt and a fellow member of the Quarian Admiral Board. Depicted as a caring yet calculating woman, like Tali I\u2019d imagine her doing her best not to bring unnecessary harm of suffering to the Eldian\u2019s if she can avoid it, but if she has to take such measures to get off the planet, who knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-\tForzan vas Idenna</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\no\tA minor character in the games, Forzan vas Idenna is unique in this story in being the only Quarian female to also be a mother, suddenly and unexpectably separated from her newborn daughter. This provides her with a unique temperament amongst the other Quarians, as while her maternal instincts may make her loathe to any destructive actions, her desire to return to her child could lead her to rationalize that any destruction she visits upon the native Eldians in her efforts to find a way home to be the lesser of two evils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Humans</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-\tAlex</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\no\tA human orphan, 12 years of age and native to the Eldian Shiganshina district. Self-appointed big-brother of his fellow orphans. Used a human \u2018bait\u2019 by the Eldian royal family to keep the titans contained to one area outside the wall, Alex like all his fellow orphans of the Shiganshina district is forbidden from leaving the fortified township.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-\tSara</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\no\tA human orphan, 10 years of age and native to the Eldian Shiganshina district. Self-appointed big-sister of her fellow orphans. Used a human \u2018bait\u2019 by the Eldian royal family to keep the titans contained to one area outside the wall, Sara like all her fellow orphans of the Shiganshina district is forbidden from leaving the fortified township.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-\tBilly</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\no\tA human orphan, 8 years of age and native to the Eldian Shiganshina district. Self-appointed younger-brother of his fellow orphans. Used a human \u2018bait\u2019 by the Eldian royal family to keep the titans contained to one area outside the wall, Billy like all his fellow orphans of the Shiganshina district is forbidden from leaving the fortified township.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-\tJessica</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\no\tA human orphan, 6 years of age and native to the Eldian Shiganshina district. Self-appointed little-sister of her fellow orphans. Used a human \u2018bait\u2019 by the Eldian royal family to keep the titans contained to one area outside the wall, Sara like all her fellow orphans of the Shiganshina district is forbidden from leaving the fortified township.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Other</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tMatriarch Raszagal &amp; Vorazun<br>\r\no\tInspired by the Protoss characters of the same names from Starcraft, these two all-powerful and incorporeal beings are responsible for integrating this experiment that sees a Quarian giantess dumped into the Eldian\u2019s world. Capable of planetary level destruction and beyond, they are initially heard, but not seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Rules</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules for this story are fairly simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease keep the Quarian\u2019s inside their armoured suits for the majority of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone can die, though if a Quarian giantess dies it has to be via a spectacular accident capable of killing a giantess 1 mile tall or over. (i.e. she got drunk and fell down an active volcano)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease initially keep the POV\u2019s between the Quarian giantess in question, and those of the orphans, however new characters can be introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost importantly please keep the scaling realistic where possible. All the giantesses here are mega level height, so simple acts such as walking will result in miniature earth quakes to the tiny humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, please keep character personalities consistent with what\u2019s come before in previous chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Guide</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, this story has 3 pre-written chapters which establish the setting and back-ground. If you wish to skip chapters that establish the back-ground to AOT but don\u2019t necessarily have a Quarian giantess in, that\u2019s fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe below summary gives you a brief idea of what happens in every chapter, and the choices you have at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Prologue</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick scene featuring an unnamed Quarian giantess impassively laying waste to several Eldian towns and cities as the Eldian Kingdom, beset by gigantic titans (not gigantic to the Quarian of course) falls around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chapter ends with the reader being given the choice of just how gigantic this Quarian woman is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Prologue is they\u2019re to wet peoples appetites. More giantess action will come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Chapter 1 </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis chapter takes place 24 hours before the events in the prologue, and is initially written from the perspective of a group of human orphans within Shiganshina, the day that after 100 years of peace, the titans breach Wall Maria and proceed to eat the human inhabitants of the city. In the ensuing chaos the four orphans escape the town/city but are separated into 2 groups of 2 orphans each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time several miles away, a Quarian woman who cannot initially remember her name wakes up lying in a large body of water, not know she is a giantess somewhere between 1 \u2013 100 miles tall. Coming to her senses she slowly stands up. After spying an \u2018island\u2019 in the distance, her Omni-tool tells her that it is detecting a signal on that island. She then begins to make her way towards it, not realizing the \u2018signal\u2019 is coming from beneath the Eldian capital city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chapter ends with the reader being given the choice of who this Quarian woman is. (She can be either an existing Quarian such as Tali\u2019Zorah or Daro\u2019Xen, or a new Quarian character of your own creation)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Chapter 2</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis chapter features the fragmentary recording of a conversation between the all powerful Matriarch Raszagal and her daughter Vorazun. It will detail that these two were responsible for placing a Quarian woman on the outskirts of the Eldian Kingdom and turning her into a giantess. They\u2019ve done this as they wish to see first hand what happens when a member of a particular species known for being persecuted at the hands of other races, is then placed in a position of greatly disproportionate power over a race she has never encounter before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chapter ends with the reader being given the choice of who the story proceeds with. The Quarian giantess in question, or one of the human orphans.</td>",
