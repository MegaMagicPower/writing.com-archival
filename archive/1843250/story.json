Currently, the group was stopping for lunch in the campsite they had set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was currently traveling with his friends Misty and Brock. Misty had taken some time off from the Cerulean Gym to join him for a bit of traveling, while Brock was currently preparing lunch. He had to admit, he liked traveling with them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is fun traveling with Misty and Brock again, right Pikachu?\" he asked his partner, who currently sat on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika!\" the electric-type replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the trainer walked through the campsite, he suddenly tripped, and fell to the ground. \"Woah!\" he let out in surprised. He then looked at what he had tripped over, and saw that it was a strange looking rock sticking out of the ground. He the dug it out and examined it. \"Wonder what this is...?\" he wondered out loud. He then walked over to the others. \"Hey guys!\" he called out and they all gathered around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Ash?\" Misty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just found a weird stone burried in the ground.\" he said as he held it out for them to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what kind of stone is that?\" Misty wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks almost like an evolution stone, but not one that I'm familiar with.\" Brock said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they looked over the stone, it suddenly began to glow, and a bright, blinding light engulfed the group.</span></div></div>",

Where the snap had happened, a gold buckle had appeared and her new belt began cinching her top tighter onto her as if to show off her new womanly curves.

She goes to look at her other hand to see if it is the same as her right and her eyes go wide to see that it's now covered by a white wrist length glove. Going back to her right hand, she sees that it too is now gloved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This all seems too familiar.\" she says to herself as she finally leaves the briefing room and heads to the bathroom. Once inside, she goes to stand in front of the mirror to get a look herself and her jaw drops at what she sees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look like I'm wearing Officer Jenny's uniform.\" she sputters to herself, seeing full on for the first time how her outfit is completely identical to the one Jenny wears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I can get to Brock and Ash and tell them what's going on when I get to the gym to provide security.\" she says to herself, getting a bit confused as to why she would care about a job she knows is not hers. As she leaves the station, her age finally finishes off at 27 years old and her breasts reach their final C-cup size.</span></div></div>",

Something she quickly noticed. 'I guess that's one of the ways they get Brock's attention.' she thinks to herself, knowing how every Officer Jenny they've come across, Brock has been smitten with. 'But maybe I'm just becoming an officer on my own.' she thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought though comes crashing to a halt when she hears someone yelling for her. \"Officer Menny, you gotta take your bike to get there quick enough.\" one of the other officers yells at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bike?\" Menny asks herself as she's realized that she must be turning into an Officer Jenny just by how people are now referring to her. She then looks over to see a motorcycle that wasn't there when she arrived at the station. \"I've never rode on one of these before.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes to sit on it and finds that she somehow knows how to operate one of these and quickly peels out and starts heading for the gym. \"And I can do it in these heels too.\" she sputters to herself. \"Why is that surprising? I got high marks at the academy for motorcycling.\" she continues on and shakes her head. \"What academy?\" she asks herself as she's getting really worried for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally arrives at the gym, a large blue hat with a black plastic bill and red trim on top appears on her head. And right in the middle of the hat is the police emblem for Vermillion City. Who are the first people she encounters when she arrives.</span></div></div>",

He then looked at what he had tripped over, and saw that it was a strange looking rock sticking out of the ground. He the dug it out and examined it. \"Wonder what this is...?\" he wondered out loud. He then walked over to the others. \"Hey guys!\" he called out and they all gathered around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Ash?\" Dawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just found a weird stone burried in the ground.\" he said as he held it out for them to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what kind of stone is that?\" Dawn wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks almost like an evolution stone, but not one that I'm familiar with.\" Brock said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they looked over the stone, it suddenly began to glow, and a bright, blinding light engulfed the group.</span></div></div>",

Why do I have a Pikachu tail!?\" he let out in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should we know?\" Dawn replied worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, is it just me, or does it look like its getting bigger?\" May asked. And sure enough, she was right. It was happening slowly, but it was growing. And it was going to grow until it became the appropriate size for his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, look!\" Iris said, pointing at Ash's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hes got red circles on his cheeks, just like Pikachu's!\" Brock said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Ash let out. He looked around to his friends, wishing that one of them could do something to help him. As he did, he took note of somethings about them. For Misty, he saw a circular object in the back of her pants. For both May and Dawn, their lips looked to be slightly harder and getting a yellowish tint. Iris's fangs looked to be getting bigger. Brock's skin was slightly rougher. And finally, Cilan's hair looked kinda leafy. \"Uh, guys, I don't think I'm the only person that this is happening to...\" he warned them, alerting them to their own changes, and they began to freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes, Ash's Pikachu tail had reached full size, and he had the red circles on his cheeks. Misty now also had a tail, only her's was a Marill's. Dawn and MAy now had beak-like lips. Iris's new fangs had gotten longer and were pointing sideways. Brock's skin now seemed more rock-like, though not yet that hard. And Cilan's hair was sticking up and now had a bush on his head.</span></div></div>",
