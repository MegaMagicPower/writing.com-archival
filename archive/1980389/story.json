I eventually came to a brick building surrounded by a metal fence as i sighed<br>\r\n\"So this is hell\" I thought to myself thinking of the fate that awaited me inside this pristine building as i closed my eyes<br>\r\n\"I would rather be anywhere then here\" I thought standing silent as i decided to push the buzzer. I'm already in the Dragon's den i might as well get on their good side\" I thought as a voice interrupted the silence coming thru a intercom<br>\r\n\"Yes\" a voice responded, sound like it belonged to a man<br>\r\n\"Are you Col. Calloway?\" I asked felling as thou he was and i just asked a stupid question<br>\r\n\"Yes, what i can i do for you?\" The voice said impatient<br>\r\n\"I should be enrolled here\" I said as i heard a distance sound of papers rustling<br>\r\n\"I'm not expecting anymore students, what's your name\" the Col. said feeling i was wasting his time as i gave him my name<br>\r\n\"Ah ha, you not enrolled here\" The col. said as i smiled <br>\r\n\"really, I could've sworn my parents filled out a form\" I replied confused but not questioning a get out of jail free card<br>\r\n\"They did, but not here, according to the mainframe you're enrolled at Grimwoods\" The Col. said confused<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong about that?\" I asked after hearing him<br>\r\n\"Well it's an 'all girl' school for monsters\" The Col. responded as i stood still hoping he was joking<br>\r\n\"Well I'm a human and a boy so what do i do?\" I asked confused as the Col. responded<br>\r\n\"Maybe Talk to Miss Grimwood, maybe she can help straighten things out, her school is just uphill\" The Col. responded shutting off the intercom as i froze in fear seeing the decaying building up the hill, it looked like something out of an old horror movie<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'll do that\" I thought to myself as i walked to a street corner sitting down for a good 30 minutes thinking about what to do. I eventually decided to check the Grimwood school out, The Col. was probably just trying to scare me, like a joke on the new kid i mean monsters are fake, i don't know what was holding me back but i eventually made my way to the school. i eventually saw a woman working in he garden as i checked my watch, i was 9:30 who would be up at this time. I walked to the woman nervous<br>\r\n\"Excuse me\" I stuttered as the woman turned around she was old hunchbacked and wrinkled looking like a witch<br>\r\n\"Yes\" the old woman replied happily tending her garden pulling out plants<br>\r\n\"Are you Miss Grimwood\" I asked as the woman took her gloves off<br>\r\n\"Why yes I am, what could i do for you?\" She asked politely<br>\r\n\"I was supposed to be going to Calloway's military school, but when i got there he said my application went here,probably by mistake\" I stated confused<br>\r\n\"Yes, The human boy I heard about that, I knew your application sounded off, but i already accepted it\" The woman said as a giant spider rolled the wheelbarrow to a shed<br>\r\n\"So that mean that...i really am...enrolled here?\" I asked confused<br>\r\n\"Yes Mr, oh what you're name\" she asked as i remembered i never told her    </span>        </span></div></div>",

I woke up later in a room adjusting as i was laying on an uncomfortable bed as i got up seeing a person in the doorway, he was the only other 'normal person' i've seen since i got here. He was wearing a red shirt and had two dogs with him, one a Great Dane with a few black spot and a collar, the other much younger walking on two legs<br>\r\n\"Like good, you're finally up \" The man said as i rubbed my head<br>\r\n\"What happened to those girls\" I asked confused about what i saw<br>\r\n\"Oh the students, they're downstairs, and they're probably eager to meet you\" The puppy said as i coiled back<br>\r\n\"Did that puppy just talk?\" I asked hoping i wasn't going crazy<br>\r\n\"Yeah i did, Scrappy Doo is the name, and this is my Uncle Scooby and our friend Shaggy\" Scrappy said in a qwerky tone<br>\r\n\"Hello\" Scooby said with an 'R' sound making it sound like 'Rello' as i rubbed my head <br>\r\n\"Monster Kids and Talking Dogs, what's next?\" I asked myself getting off the bed<br>\r\n\"I might as well meet my new...classmates\" I said walking downstairs hanging onto the railing still uneasy from he events, imagine just finding out monsters were real, and i'd be staying with 10 of them as I walked down the stairway i saw two of the monster girls     </span></span></div></div>",

I made it to the room I was in before as it noticed it had a small 9 on a plague  as I turned the rusted knob entering the room walking to the bed as i plopped on the mattress tired. Part of me thought I was dreaming, i mean monsters and talking dogs. I laid on the bed not even bothering to get undressed or get under the covers. A good hour an a half and i couldn't get to sleep, they were noises keeping me up, everything from trees blowing against the building to creaking boards to howling which i concluding was coming from Winnie. eventually the door to my room opened as the light turned on burning my eyes as my view just saw a pink and blue blob in front of me. My eyesight fixed as everything was clear I was looking at the alien girl as we were both surprised to see eachother<br>\r\n\"What are you doing in my room\" I asked her sleepy<br>\r\n\"These are my quarters\" The girl said confused<br>\r\n\"These are my bags which the teachers brought up here\" I replied as she pulled out a piece of paper <br>\r\n\"The symbol on the lock matches this inscription Miss Grimwood gave me\" She replied in defense<br>\r\n\"Let me see\" I asked as she handed me a metal key, the key had a 6 carved on it<br>\r\n\"This is a 6, this lock says 9\" I told her<br>\r\n\"Meaning?\" she replied confused<br>\r\n\"This is not your room\" I showed her turning the number upside-down explaining the earth number to her <br>\r\n\"It was a simple miscalculation\" the girl responded<br>\r\n\"There a line under the 6, just remember line at the bottom\" I said as she smiled<br>\r\n\"Thanks.. uh what's your name?\" the girl asked wanting to know<br>\r\n\"Carl\" I reponded still sleepy<br>\r\n\"my identification is Mary\" The girl responded<br>\r\n\"Mary, that doesn't sound like an alien name\" I said confused<br>\r\n\"My true identification is unpronounceable in Earth languages\"Mary said leaving the room as I got up<br>\r\n\"I should probably lock my door, i said noticing a key on the night stand with a nine carved in it<br>\r\n\"We must have keys to lock our rooms\"i concluded as i walked to the door turning the lock as i eventually went to sleep    </span></span></div></div>",

I figured i might as well unlock the door as i walked down the hall,I obviously had to pee, i don't what it is about some people having to to use the bathroom first thing in the morning but i figured i wasn't the only one, i spotted Chika coming out of what i assumed was the bathroom adjusting her dress<br>\r\n\"Is this the bathroom?\" I asked as she smiled nodding<br>\r\n\"Help yourself\" she responded leaving as i entered the room locking the door as I made my way to the toilet noting the seat already up but just shrugging it off as i unzipped my jeans as the sound of my stream bouncing against the bowl could be heard. i eventually finished as i flushed the toilet from a chain crank and put the seat down as i zipped up my pants leaving the bathroom as i headed back to my sleeping quarters deciding to make my bed. upon finishing i decided to unpack my stuff, first was my cherry red fender jazzmaster which i put in the corner, next my clothes which i put into the dresser there which was coated in dust as i pulled out my CD player, i decided if i was gonna clean up this room I might as well listen to some tunes as I popped a disk in and placed the thing on the dresser as i continued unpacking my stuff, container of hair gel, and knives, switchblade and butterfly, eventually i came to my prized possession, a pair of nunchakus, there were black mahogany held by a stainless steel chain, these weren't some cheap knockoffs you could find at the mall, these were high end, they were a gift from my Martial Arts teacher I've been taking martial arts for a few years and I recently got my black belt, I figured i could play with these for a while, I enjoyed freestyling with these bad boys as i twirled them around smoothly between my hands while listening to some progressive rock spinning and catching the chucks to the beats of the song as it climaxed i used the sticks drumming out the final part as the song concluded i swung the chuck catching the other end in my hand. I noticed a rusted nail sticking out of the wall over my bed as i swung the chucks there catching the nail with the chain pulling it out as i placed the chucks in my jacket pocket and sat the bed noticed Chika standing in the doorway with another girls, one coated in seaweed.<br>\r\n\"How long were you three standing there?\" I asked taking the disk out of the CD player <br>\r\n\" Good while the swamp girl said <br>\r\n\"And you are?\" I asked implying her to introduce herself<br>\r\n\"Oh, My name is Goonie\" The girl said introducing herself<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you\" I said shaking her hand<br>\r\n\"I came to tell you breakfast was ready\" Chika said as i smiled<br>\r\n\"Great I could eat a horse\" I replied jokingly      </span>           </span></div></div>",

Eventually all of the girls introduced themselves, not only was i going to the wrong school, not only was it an 'all girl school, not only was it a school for monster but these girls were the kids of some of the deadliest monster I've heard about, i suddenly prayed i don't do anything the piss the girls off. Gym class started and we decided to jog , Winnie easily took the lead making sense being part animal, she was easily the fastest of the girls. The young werewolf was followed by Jessica, I guess growing up outside made her really fast and fit. Sibella, then Phanty caught up to them, I was assuming their powers wouldn't help with running. Chika was just in front of me, I thought she would be faster, but i guess all my accusation were not right Goonie was Barely behind me, maybe she was just trying to not get tangled in the seaweed which coated her body, the same probably for Tanis being coated in bandages. Mary was close to last, but i guess it wasn't her fault, due to adjusting to earth's gravity. Zina and Elsa, were closely tied for last I guess Zina's size weighed her down and Elsa couldn't run due to her inability to bend her knees. eventually the jog was over and everyone was stretching in the schoolyard. I felt this might be a good time to talk to Winnie, she appeared to be boasting to the other new students. Later i walked up to her and Chika, I realized no other girls were around and the two were extremely close friends<br>\r\n\"Nice job out there i said to both girls as Chika smiled saying thanks as Winnie just stood still nodding <br>\r\n\"Winnie I had no idea you were so fast\" I said wiping the sweat off my forehead <br>\r\n\"Thanks\" she replied with no emotion implying she didn't want me around<br>\r\n\"Oh Carl, Me and Winnie were going out to go swimming in the lake, I would really like for you to come\" Chika said pouring a bottle of water on her head to cool off <br>\r\n\"I Think I have some trunks in my bag\" I responded<br>\r\n\"Wait, What!\" Winnie said annoyed<br>\r\n\"What?\" Chika replied confused<br>\r\n\"Are you seriously asking this boy to go swimming with us!\" Winnie sated in an outburst<br>\r\n\"Winnie, It won't hurt to invite him\" Chika replied <br>\r\n\"I don't want to hang out with him!\" Winnie replied<br>\r\n\"Winnie you can't keep avoiding him all year\" Chika stated<br>\r\n\"It's Ok, I could pass\" I said hoping to end the argument<br>\r\n\"Look Winnie, I just want the three of us to spend some time together\" Chika told Winnie<br>\r\n\"Chika, I really don't mind passing out\" I stated <br>\r\n\"See Chika even he doesn't mind not swimming\" Winnie said using my words against her<br>\r\n\"Because You're being a bitch!\" Chika responded<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!\" Winnie shouted pissed off<br>\r\n\"Sorry, bad choice of words, my fault\" Chika replied taking back what she said as she hummed a faint melody which calmed Winnie down<br>\r\n\"Look Winnie, I just want you to learn to tolerate Carl, You don't have to go and be his best friend\" Chika said softly<br>\r\n\"Ok Chika, I'll Try\" Winnie said as Chika hugged her<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Chika replied as Winnie went to school to get her swimsuit leaving me and the Chupacabra alone<br>\r\n\"What was with that humming?\" I asked confused as to how easily she sedated Winnie's temper<br>\r\n\"It's a nursery our mothers sang to us when we were little\" Chika responded <br>\r\n\"How long have you two known eachother?\" I asked confused about their friendship<br>\r\n\"Since we were toddlers, our fathers are close friends and every year Winnie's family comes down the Mexico for the summer, This is my first year at Grimwoods,\" Chika stated<br>\r\n\"We I'll get my trunks\" Carl said walking with Chika to the school as we went our separate ways</span></span></div></div>",

I left the school and walked down a dirt path eventually finding the body of water. I arrived at the lake wearing my shirt, pants and coat as i walked to to the area which unlike most areas was actually clean, the water was a sparkly blue as i sat down on the grass i guess the others were here yet but i shrugged it off laying down as a took a deep breath sitting down. I ran my finger thru a bushel of clovers grabbing a bundle as I looked at them all before tossing them on the ground. I found some stones near the edge of the pond picking them up, they were all smooth and thin as i swung my hand skipping a stone as it bounced off the water. After I ran out of stones i just laid down waiting for the two girls, i was beginning to think they weren't coming. I eventually dozed out only to be woken by an arm on my shoulder. a turned looking at my watch, i was out for 30 minutes. I looked at the girls in their swimwear. Chika was blushing at the fact I was staring at her, Winnie was pretty much the opposite giving me a sour look. Both girls entered the lake<br>\r\n\"Hey Carl, Why aren't you wearing your swimwear\" Chika asked swimming up to me<br>\r\n\"I couldn't find them\" I responded as she accepted the answer as the moment went by smoothly as i got up to take a piss.When I got back four boys had arrived at the lake, I stayed out of sight but I could tell Winnie was annoyed from my view <br>\r\n\"Hey get out of our spot\" One of the boys said , he was Hispanic and wore trunks <br>\r\n\"Make me\" Winnie said <br>\r\n\"Miguel, I think they have just as much right as we do\" One of the boys said<br>\r\n\"No we own rights to this spot, were not gonna ask again\" the other boy said who was the biggest <br>\r\n\"If Winnie said she's not moving, she's not moving\" Chika replied<br>\r\n\"Oh, you must be new, what's you're name?\" The tall kid asked<br>\r\n\"Chika\" the lizard replied<br>\r\n\"And Chika, I assuming your a Grimwood Ghoul, what are you a... let me guess a dragon hybrid type\" the tall kid said<br>\r\n\"Dragon my ass, that bitch is El Chupacabra\" Miguel said<br>\r\n\"actually yes, I'm surprised\" Chika said<br>\r\n\"How did you know\" The big kid asked<br>\r\n\"Her kind are from Mexican folklore\" Miguel said <br>\r\n\"Either way These girls have to leave Grunt said as Winnie walked up to him<br>\r\n\"And if we don't\" Winnie said as Grunt punched her as she fell down as everyone, including the other Cadets just stood shocked,<br>\r\n\"Grunt, No need need to be Violent\" Miguel said the big kid ignored him and continued the beating Part of we wanted to go out there and fight that bully but on the other hand this girl pretty much hated me, and i part of me enjoyed watching her get beat up, but i didn't have to get physically involved, i could let Winnie get trashed then report it to the teachers  i was at an emotional crossroad but eventually i decided to   <br>\r\n       </span></span></div></div>",

I eventually walked over to the perfect spot as a sat down, the seat off my wet swimsuit stuck to the dirt as i watched the event<br>\r\n\"Look Kid, we're the human boys, you should be on our side\" Grunt said as Carl just looked at him<br>\r\n\"So is that why you hate them for being monster girls, that's no different then being racist\" Carl responded<br>\r\n\"I am Not racist, I have friends of various skin color\" Grunt said<br>\r\n\"So You're sexist then\" Carl said which i couldn't agree more with to describe the Cadets, If It had to be one word it would be Bigot  <br>\r\n\"I am not sexist either, if they were human they would be fine to be around\" Grunt said as i nearly threw up at what he said, like I could change my species just like that <br>\r\n\"Grunt I think we should just leave\" Miguel said<br>\r\n\"I'm not leaving\" Grunt said <br>\r\n\"For the record, not all of us, share Grunt's view\" Frederick said<br>\r\n\"Look are you gonna leave or do i have to make you\" Carl said as i rubbed my hands together hoping to finally see some action as Grunt cracked his knuckles<br>\r\n\"If you challenge me will not end will\" Carl said as i was eager to see these boys tear each other up as Grunt swung his fist land a blow up Carl's chest as he recoiled hitting an hard object in the coat.<br>\r\n\"Ow what the hell\" Grunt said as Carl pulled something from his coat, i could identify the object until he started swinging it<br>\r\n\"Holy Christ\" Miguel stated<br>\r\n\"Where did you get nunchucks\" Jamal asked <br>\r\n\"I'm a Martial Arts student, Black Belt to be precise\" Carl said as my eyes widened, this just got interesting. Carl swung his ninja sticks around as I watched the stick twirling in awe as he laid blows on Grunt as the fight broke out, this went from being amusing to being arousing and exciting, as with each move i was watching in amazment, and I found myself cheering for Carl, silently. Carl swung the chucks catching the other end as the lard-ass fell to the ground<br>\r\n\"No more\" Grunt pleaded as Carl sheathed the chucks in his coat <br>\r\n\" You promise to not be any trouble\" Carl said<br>\r\n\"I Promise\" Grunt said<br>\r\n\"And Not beating on the girls\" Carl said<br>\r\n\"I Promise\" Grunt repeated getting up backing away as the other cadets quickly followed as I realized the fight was over I should probably get back to the school but then again I could talk to Carl     </span></span></div></div>",

I looked at the mirror in my room to notice my nose looked untouched, even the bloodstains were gone. I pulled my arms thru the armstraps of my swimsuit sliding in off as i threw it down the hamper and sat on my bed, the sun was still up, as i just laid on my bed staring at the ceiling, the light was shining the a window lighting a corner of the room. the quiet was interfered by the door opening<br>\r\n\"Winnie, you in here? I heard as I looked up seeing Carl in my doorway immediately covering myself with the bedsheets as he covered his eyes<br>\r\n\"Whoa\" He said in shock<br>\r\n\"Carl, could you knock first\" I stated feeling both embarrassed and pissed, if he hadn't beaten up Grunt earlier i would've put my claws in him there and then<br>\r\n\"Sorry, my fault but i didn't know you were undressed\" Carl said as i stared at him<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" I asked him still with attitude<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to check on you\" He said as i calmed down<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, now leave\" i said as he shrugged his shoulders<br>\r\n\"If it makes you feel any better, i didn't see anything\" He said<br>\r\n\"Out\" I quietly whispered not wanting to cause a scene as he closed the door. I will give that kid credit for beating up a cadet but that still doesn't change anything between me and him. i scooted the sheets to the side realizing i should get dressed as i reached for my clothes pulling my blue dress over my head as it fell covering my body as i reached for the drawer pulling out a clean pair of underwear sliding it up and wrapped a light bow around the dress to put on the finishing touches.          </span></span></div></div>",

I was wondering how after doing something as selfless as standing up to Grunt for Winnie, she didn't even acknowledge my kind act, maybe i should've just let that boy tear her a new hole. I later decided I did make the right choice as I continued walking I eventually saw the boys from earlier on the path as they walked to me <br>\r\n\"You Grimwood boy, Tug Roped has requested you to see him\" Miguel said<br>\r\n\"Who is Tug Roper?\" I asked feeling like they think I should be scared<br>\r\n\"He's head cadet, trust me, you want to be on his good side, we're not going to resort to violence but please see him\" Jamal said <br>\r\n\"This could be an attempt to ambush me\" I replied in defense<br>\r\n\"We just want you to her him out, we're sorry for Grunt's behavior, we've never hit any of the girls before\" Jamal <br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm sorry, I was just angry and confused, I've never seen Winnie befriend a boy\" Grunt said<br>\r\n\"What Winnie, she's not my friend\" I said which was true<br>\r\n\"just Talk to Tug\" Miguel said putting his hand on my back<br>\r\n\"OK\" I said interested in what they had to say<br>\r\n\"Give Jamal Williams your nunchucks, to make sure you don't try anything\" Miguel said as I reluctantly handed him the chucks, but I wanted to show a good example as they escorted me on a side path to an old decrepit house. there was a blond haired kid sitting on the porch eating from a bag of beef jerky in font of a capfire,I figured him to be Tug <br>\r\n\"You're the Grimwood Boy\" the boy said as i nodded<br>\r\n\"Tug Roper he said extending his hand for a handshake as i reluctantly shook it<br>\r\n\"Carl\" I said introducing myself<br>\r\n\"Look Carl the boys told me about the lake and I apologize for Grunt's violence, the Calloway code even states not to strike females, although your not a student we would like you on our side\" Tug said offering me a piece of jerky as slowly took the piece <br>\r\n\"This sounds nice but I'm enrolled at Grimwood and the girls might feel betrayed by me doing this\" I said <br>\r\n\"They don't have to know, but face it, they're monster girls, I don't want to sound rude but they will never really understand you\" Tug said as i figured that sounded logical<br>\r\n\"Plus by being our friend you won't betray the girls\" Grunt said as i thought it over I decided to </span></span></div></div>",

I gently opened the door seeing the room decorated in a Gothic-like fashion, here was a bed with red satin sheets, a drawer, a small table, an iron chest and a coffin against the wall, the whole room was filled with aroma of scented candles<br>\r\n\"This must be Sibella's room\" I thought to myself seeing a perfect opportunity, I walked over to the drawer slowly opening it wooden container finding my prize as i quickly smuggled a pair of underwear into my coat pocket quietly closing the drawer, I knew that Sibella was downstairs so I wouldn't get caught as I exited the room walking back to my chamber as I sat on my bed. I decided to get a closer look at the piece of clothing in my pocket. It was green and smooth with white lace stiched in a cobweb patterns on the side. I knew getting 10 pairs wouldn't be that easy but I had all school year technically. I knew needed a place to hide them until i could bring them to the mailbox. I unzipped my pillow and gently spread them in there re-zipping the pillow. I decided I might as well Talk to Sibella, considering I just stole from her, plus she was already downstairs. I walked down where the two girls were still talking<br>\r\n\"Hey what are you two talking about\" I asked as they turned to me<br>\r\n\"Oh Carl, we haven't seen you since exercise where have you been\" Jessica asked <br>\r\n\"Around, what are you two talking about?\" I asked again as they replied<br>\r\n\"Ghoul stuff\" You wouldn't be interested\" Sibella responded<br>\r\n\"Hey Sibella, I'm gonna get ready for bed, i'll see you tomorrow\" Jessica said going upstairs<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to talk about\" Sibella asked in a somewhat seductive tone<br>\r\n\"What's with the tone?\" I asked the vampire girl as she rolled her eyes<br>\r\n\"Tone, I have no idea vhat you mean\" Sibella said implying a V on her what and coming off as more flirty<br>\r\n\"I'm being serious, It sounds like you're flirting with me\" I replying uneasy of bringing it up<br>\r\n\"Well you are kind of cute\" Sibella replied<br>\r\n\"What, I'm cute?\" I said in disbelief of Sibella's approach she must be playing<br>\r\n\"Yes, why would i lie about that\" She said pulling me closer to her putting her hands on mine as she directed them to her hips <br>\r\n\"I've heard of fast girls, but this is ridiculous\" I said retracting my hands<br>\r\n\"Are you calling me a slut?\" Sibella asked<br>\r\n\"Well you you were making me touch your hips in a suggestive way\" I replied<br>\r\n\"I just want to welcome you to the school in a special way, you seem equipped enough\" Sibella replied eyeing at the bulge in my jeans<br>\r\n\"Are you seriously thinking...about having sex, we just met\" I told her<br>\r\n\"Sexual contact is not a big deal to monsters, i bet before the school year is over you'll have poked all of us<br>\r\n\"Really I doubt Winnie would be on me\" I said as Sibella softly bit her thumb with her teeth <br>\r\n\"True she is fiesty, but what to her monthly heat, she'll be all over you\" Sibella said <br>\r\n\"I'm not having sex with you\" i told her firmly<br>\r\n\"Ok, But to make thing straight the others will eventually be over you. and some might not give you a choice\" Sibella said as I walked upstairs. when I made it upstairs I saw Chika in the hallway filing her claws<br>\r\n\"How's it going Carl\" Chika asked as I nodded<br>\r\n\"Fine\" I replied <br>\r\n\"I heard Sibella telling you about the test\" Chika said as i refocused my hearing<br>\r\n\"So it's true, all the ghouls are planning to you-know\" I asked<br>\r\n\"Yes it a test ghouls play on humans all the time to test their will power, the long you refuse the longer the game runs\" Chika said <br>\r\n\"Game, like rules and everything?\" I asked<br>\r\n\"Yes the rules are we can only try once a day, we can't use powers to make you do anything, it has to be actual sex, not foreplay, and you have to willingly do it by choice, we can't just tie you to your bed, and we have to hit on you, you can't hit on us\" Chika<br>\r\n\"Should I know about this game\" I asked<br>\r\n\"The rules don't say not to tell you, I'm just telling you to be friendly, and congratulations on beating the first test\" Chika said<br>\r\n\"So when does this game end?\" I asked her as she giggled<br>\r\n\"You can end it when ever you want, just tap the next girl who flirts with you\" Chika said<br>\r\n\"So I Can't win\" I told her<br>\r\n\"It's not about Winning it's about lasting but technically if you make it to the end of the school, I guess you cold win\" Chika said as I walked in my room             </span></span></div></div>",

The door was unlocked and I didn't hear any water so I entered the dark room turning the lights on as my eyes were still focusing. I eventually got undressed and turned the water on. i stood under the water still groggy from sleep as the hot water poured off my skin bouncing on the floor. I checked my watch,it read 4:00 so I doubt no girls would be disturbing me as i just sat on the stone section sticking out like a seat letting the water hit me. I started feeling to relaxed as a head popped out of the floor<br>\r\n\"Don't use up all the hot water\" The voice said as i looked down seeing Phantasma rise in the shower wearing a nightgown <br>\r\n\"Oh, Sorry\" I said still half asleep as she chuckled<br>\r\n\"I'm just teasing, the hot water doesn't run out, the pipes are enchanted\" Phantasma said<br>\r\n\" What are you doing up Phantasma\" I asked still sitting down rubbing my arms with soap<br>\r\n\"The water woke me up, but please, call me Phanty\" The ghost girl said <br>\r\n\"Uh Phanty, aren't you worried about you gown getting wet?\" I asked her as she chuckled<br>\r\n\"No, it just going right thru me, i'm intangible\" She said fully rising<br>\r\n\"So you're intangible, meaning you can't touch anything\" I stated as she put her hand thru my chest, I actually felt her hand inside my stomach It felt so cold contrasting with the water<br>\r\n\"By choice, I can turn solid\" she explained<br>\r\n\"That's cool\" I said becoming still not fully awake<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is, Having no physically boundaries\" She responded chuckling<br>\r\n\"You're not trying to seduce me for the game you girls are playing right?\" I asked her vaguely remembering about what Chika told me<br>\r\n\"You know about that?\" She said sitting beside me still intangible just sort of hovering in a sitting position<br>\r\n\"Chika told me, is that a problem?\" I asked her<br>\r\n\"Well that sort of takes the fun out of the game, but It's not aginst the rules so i guess we can't punish Chika\" Phanty said <br>\r\n\"Why dont you sit down\" I suggested turning off the water and placing a towel on the stone bench area as the ghost sat beside me turning sold as the transparency in her body vanished, and her skin turned solid color<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" She stated<br>\r\n\"So is there a purpose to this game, like do one of you get a prize\" I asked the girl as she explained the winner gets a few bucks from each girl <br>\r\n\"Be Honest Phanty did you come here trying to seduce me?\" I asked her as she blushed<br>\r\n\"Actually yes, but not just for challenge, I've never have done anything sexual with a boy, I just wanted to feel what it was like\" Phanty explained<br>\r\n\"Seriously, you're a virgin, an pretty girl like you\" I said as she blushed <br>\r\n\"Technically I've had encounters with other ghouls, wait you really think i'm pretty\" She smiled at me<br>\r\n\"Well you're the only ghost I've met so i have no preference\" I told her<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't want to be pushy but if you have sex with me, the game will be over and I'll finally have gotten to be with boy, we both win as she did make a point but i partially like the attention the girls were giving me<br>\r\n\"Well Phanty, I do feel bad for you but to be honest I kind of like the thought of the girls flirting with me,I've never been a center of attention\" I told her<br>\r\n\"I'l make you a deal, It has to be vaginal sex tend the contest, what if you just do some foreplay on me, so I can finally be with a boy?\" Phanty asked as i thought over and eventully          </span></span></div></div>",

I walked slowly to the drawer pulling out the knife as it slipped from my hand landing on the floor.

I was relived to see my skin wound-free but i questioned at where this came from. I noticed another drop separate from the others as i walked to the drips following them to my bed as noticed a red spot on my bed<br>\r\n\"What the hell\" I replied shocked at the sight. I remembered this was were Winnie was sitting, she must have cut herself. I wasn't that worried because it as probably just a small cut but i feel like she didn't know she was bleeding, or if she did she was hiding something. I felt I should confront her before anyone as i went back downstairs noticing Winnie sitting on the floor watching TV with Chika as I approached her <br>\r\n\"Uh Winnie I acknowledged as she turned to me<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" She replied a little uneasy but trying to sound happy<br>\r\n\"Are you OK?\" I asked her as she blushed uncontrollably <br>\r\n\"I'm fine why would you ask that?\" Winnie contradicted like she was hiding something<br>\r\n\"I found a bloodstain were you were sitting on my bed\" I told her as she backed up<br>\r\n\"Winnie dear, are you bleeding?\" Miss Grimwood asked dusting the lamp in the room <br>\r\n\"Uh Yeah, I uh tripped and scrapped my knee\" Winnie said which could feel she as making up, why was Winnie lying about her bleeding, I concluded that she was just being to prideful to want the other knowing she's injured<br>\r\n\"Winnie let me see\" Miss Grim walked towards the werewolf in a caring nature<br>\r\n\"No!\" Winnie quickly replied \"I mean it's not that bad, just a scrape\" the shewolf added<br>\r\n\"It could get infected, i think you should let miss Grimwood examine it\" I stated <br>\r\n\"I um, OK fine, but you and Chika have to leave the room\" Winnie demanded as i shrugged my shoulders walking out with Chika<br>\r\n\"Ok Winnie let me see your knee\" Miss Grimwood said    </span>   </span></div></div>",
