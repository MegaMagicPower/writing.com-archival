On the surface, it resembled most other large metropolitan areas; tall buildings, a mostly grid-based layout, businesses everywhere, apartment buildings in the city and large communities in the suburban areas around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe difference, of course, was that everything in this city was built with Morphs in mind. A human in Morph City would find that everything was just a bit bigger than normal, shifted to suit the larger average size of most Morphs. It was enough to make the average human feel a bit like a child from the size difference. Naturally, most of the people living and working in this city were Morphs, various well endowed animal people walking around, going about their business like usual. Billboards and giant screens showed advertisements featuring scantily clad Morphs posing to promote whatever they were paid to. Public sex was fairly common and not as frowned upon as it was in other places, as the local laws were also designed around the highly sexual nature of Morphs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the Morphs that lived here, life was good. And the atmosphere was generally very welcoming to visitors and new citizens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the question is... who will we follow?</span></div></div>",

Spending his entire life in the countryside, he'd only seen buildings this large in pictures. To see them in real life was awe inspiring, having these concrete and steel colossi towering over him, making him feel so very small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the same could be said about the people Fred saw everywhere around him. For this was Morph City, and for a young man who had never met a morph before, the feeling was quite similar. They were everywhere, in all sorts of shapes and sizes, the only real consistent thing being that they were all considerably taller than Fredrick, who stood only about five feet tall. He took a step forward, not watching where he was going as he looked around, and promptly walked face first into a monstrous ass that was level with his face, blushing furiously as he bounced back from the plush, round behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall, hourglass figured husky glanced down at him and gave a giggle, not seeming offended at all, which somehow made him even more embarrassed. Back home, he would have gotten a slap in the face for even looking at a woman's back side the wrong way. Instead, this practical giantess just gave her hips an inviting wiggle and said, in a teasing tone, \"If you want your face between my cheeks, cutie, all you've gotta do is ask~...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFredrick promptly sputtered an apology and scurried off, overwhelmed, just managing to overhear her say something about \"... humans... so cute...\" to her friend as he fled. He sighed as he stopped to recover; he thought he'd be able to handle this better, but now he was realizing that maybe he'd moved too fast from one extreme to the other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking himself off, he steeled his nerves and began making his way to the address he was moving into, trying to focus on that and that alone. Of course, as he went, he would take notice of a few things on the way that he just couldn't ignore. A buff, tall tigress picking up a more petite (though still visibly taller than himself) mouse girl to make out with her. A stag man rubbing his huge package through the obscene bulge in his shorts while taking a break from a jog, some women and even men openly ogling him with desire. A video on a big screen television of a particularly buxom zebra woman doing a news report, her breasts constantly threatening to pop out of her top. A snake woman with a particularly fat ass, lounging naked on silken sheets as she advertised some perfume brand on a billboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all too much for his reserved personality. He had to get away from it all, slipping into a nearby business to hide in their restroom and try to calm himself down. He leaned against the wall, idly noting the oversized sink and toilet that made him feel like a child, trying to process all of that. His father had always harped that morphs were degenerates, and, while Fredrick didn't agree, he could totally see why his father would think that. To be so openly sexual... it was just so much, all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep breath, made his way out, then resumed his trek to the apartment. He was already running late, and he refused to let anything else distract him. Finally, he arrived, heading up to the address. He was nervous. He hadn't seen his sister in a few years, not since she left for college. And to find out that she was living here of all places. A part of him knew to expect her to be... changed, though after all he'd seen, he wasn't sure what he would find his sister as now. With a deep breath, he knocked on the door. And after a moment, he heard the click of it opening. It swung wide, revealing to Fredrick...</span></div></div>",

Looking up with a breath caught in his throat, he gazed upon the largest breasts he'd ever seen in person, each boulder looking even larger than medicine balls. These massive tits were contained by a tight top that, shockingly, showed no cleavage whatsoever. Then, she leaned over to see him past her breasts, revealing a familiar face; it was the same zebra woman he'd seen on the news on his way here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freddy?\" she asked in a tone that, while a bit more deep and sultry than he remembered, he recognized right away, confirming his suspicions. \"It's me, Abby! Oh, look at you! God, you're so small and cute like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yelped as he found himself scooped up in surprisingly strong arms, pressed into her pillowy breasts as she hugged him tightly. \"It's so good to see you again! I've missed you so much! Oh, this is going to be so exciting!\" With that, Fredrick was carried inside by his now very big sister Abigail, still trying to process that she was now a practically ten foot tall zebra woman with huge breasts and... a very male package, judging from the bulge in her skirt. He was feeling pale, not having prepared for all of this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby sat him down on the couch, blushing slightly as she noticed the look on his face. \"Sorry if that was a bit much. I tried to dress in the most covering clothes I had, but... well... I guess this all must be a bit crazy for you. After living with dad in that backwards little town of ours... I hope you don't... think I'm a freak...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her suddenly becoming bashful, Fredrick blurted out \"You're not a freak! You're very beautiful!\" Blushing at his outburst, he began to sputter. \"I-I mean, there's nothing wrong with how you look, and if you feel happy like this, then I shouldn't judge, and-and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby brightened at that, lifting him into another hug, this time burying his face in her tits as she cooed. \"Oh, you are so sweet! I missed that about you, li'l bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she began to sweep him along, giving him a grand tour of her rather impressively furnished apartment as he kept trying to process how he had agreed for this to be his new life from now on. Sure, it was going to be more exciting than a small town where everyone knew your name and would constantly judge you if you stepped out of line, but still... it was such a big change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Abby wound down on showing him everything and talking his ear off, Fredrick wondered what would happen next...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>About two hours later, Fredrick was sat firmly on the couch, blushing furiously while trying to avoid looking directly at Abigail; the zebra in question was currently hollering joyously along to some pop song, bottle in hand, half naked and shaking her body right in front of him, unaware of how uncomfortable this was making him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had all started innocently enough, with Abby suggesting they have some beers to celebrate. This surprised Fredrick, as both of them had been fairly adamantly against alcohol in their youth, one of the few things from their father that they had ended up agreeing with. He politely declined, only for her to say \"Well, more for me, party pooper!\" With that, she started drinking... a lot. It must have taken her large body a lot to get intoxicated, because she went through an entire six pack on her own... and then kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of her telling stories, showing less and less restraint as she drank, Fredrick was horrified to find her tugging off her clothes, grunting about how uncomfortable they made her. He tried to look away, but couldn't help but get a view of her massive tits, bulging out of her bra, as well as her thick ass and... that cock. Dear god, that cock. Straining against her pantie were balls that had to be twice the size of his head, fat and round, as well as what he now realized was not actually her cock, but rather a sheath that her soft dick was contained within. He shuddered to imagine what it would look like erect, before shaking the mental image out of his head and vowing to not look at her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so we return to the present, just as Fredrick hears an odd sound mixed in with his sister's heavy stomping dance and drunken singing, hazarding a glance just in time to see her panties flying at his face. He froze, stunned, as the musky scented fabric slapped him. He let out a chocking cry of mortified dread, struggling to get it off of him; only, as soon as his vision was unobstructed by panties, he would find himself staring at Abigail's fat ass lowering towards him. He tried to call out, but was too late, voice muffled as her ass cheeks engulfed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew! That was intense, huh bro?\" she sighed, not seeming to notice how lumpy the cushion under her was. \"Bro? Freddy? Where'd you go? Ah, must have slipped away... poor li'l guy... prob'ly too much for him...\" She hiccuped, letting out a sad sigh before chugging another beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred was frozen from shock. He was surrounded by ass fat on all sides, slipped right into her crack, and she didn't even seem to notice. He could feel her plump, equine anus over his head, her hot, wet vagina pressing into him, her heavy balls squishing against his legs. He had no idea what to do, overstimulated by the fact his giant, hermaphrodite sister was currently squishing him beneath her lewd body, her heat and scents flooding him. With shame, he realized that this situation had actually gotten a boner out of him, something he'd been adamantly trying to avoid all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he heard the sound of slapping skin, mixed with the feeling of hips thrusting on top of him and the moans of Abby as she jerked herself off, clearly thinking that it was okay to relief her pent up urges now that she was 'alone'. Snapping out of it, he tried to get her attention, not wanting any part of this, only for a very unfortunate coincidence to happen; him trying to escape and her moving as she pleasured herself caused him to accidentally get his head lodged inside her pussy. She moaned out in surprise, only to go even harder, thinking that she'd accidentally left a dildo sitting here, too drunk and horny to think clearly and realize what was actually happening as she began thrusting her brother's body inside of her snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFredrick wanted to vomit, sickened by the fact he was now, somehow, slipping inside his sister's tight vagina to be used for pleasure. He had to wonder if maybe she knew he was here and was just messing with him. Worse still, his erection was throbbing heavily from this, the scents of her pussy and the feeling of being ridden like this driving him crazy. He was incredibly ashamed as, out of nowhere, he came in his pants just from the sheer depravity of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't let out for another ten minutes, not until Abigail orgasmed out of both her pussy and her cock at the same time. Fredrick found himself coated in hot, sticky liquid while the sound of moaning and of stretching rubber filled his ears from outside. Finally, she rose up with a yawn, releasing him from her tight tunnels before stumbling off to bed, not even realizing he had been there as she left him dazed and wet on the couch. Fredrick sat, stunned, trying to recover from the frankly traumatic experience he'd just been forced into. He slowly sat up, noticing a filled condom on the floor in front of him... a filled condom that looked like it weighed about as much as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuddering, he stumbled off to try and clean himself off, not sure if he'd ever feel clean again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fred woke up groggy, briefly wondering why his room looked so big before remembering his new living situation. And with that came memories of last night, ones that he had hoped had just been a bad dream. To have been sat on by his sister, then used as a sex toy as she jerked off... he couldn't think of anything more scandalous and wrong than that. A part of him hoped foolishly that he'd step out of his room and see everything clean, no signs of last night, that it really was all some awful dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door, expecting a mess, only to find everything as it was when he arrived. He stared for a moment, wondering if perhaps it really had just all been in his head, until he heard humming and saw an unfamiliar Morph step into view carrying a trash bag. The Morph was a house cat, pure white, wearing a very revealing parody of a french maid's uniform, with only a tube top, a headband, a miniskirt so small it covered basically nothing, and a pair of silken panties holding a fairly large bulge. This cat maid was fairly flat up top, and the crotch bulge wasn't nearly as big as the others Fredrick had seen so far (not that he was keeping track or anything), but they (Fredrick was really unsure what gender this cat was...) certainly had an impressive ass. Despite only being about a foot taller than Fred, the maid had an ass that rivaled his sister's, with wide hips and thick thighs to boot. On their smaller frame, the ass looked even bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat maid turned and noticed Fred, smiling. \"Ah, you must be the mistress's brother! Pleasure to meet you! I'm Charlie, Miss Abigail's maid!\" Hearing the voice, Fred decided the Morph had to be male and just very, very feminine looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, my sister has a personal maid? How much does she make?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie just giggled. \"Oh, you've no idea how big your sister is, do you? Ah, but I'm not her <i>personal</i> maid. I work for other people. Though, if your sister wanted to hire me full time and have her be my one and only, I'd accept in a heartbeat~... That woman knows just how to fuck me se-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlie? Is that you?\" came the groggy voice of a hungover zebra Morph. \"Be nice to Freddy, he's sensitive... I'll be out in a minute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat just smiled, tail swishing behind him. \"My apologies for being too forward, sir. The mistress really went hard last night, didn't she? I keep telling her, she needs to drink in moderation, but something about alcohol just brings out the worst - or best, if you ask some - in her. If I know her, she'll have no memory of last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFredrick sighed, thankful he wouldn't have to have that talk with her at least. \"Great. So, for both my and her sake, could you not mention any... ah... particular messes you cleaned up? I'd really not like to have to deal with... what happened last night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie pantomimed zipping his lips sealed with a smug grin before turning away. \"Well, since the mistress won't be in the mood for our usual fun, I suppose I should take my leave. I'll see you around, Mr. Freddy~...\" With that, the cat gave him a wink and a little hip wiggle, ass cheeks jiggling like gelatin, before making his way out. A moment later, Abby came out, looking exhausted... and wearing only an ill-fitting t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Charlie leave already? Hope I didn't leave too big a mess for him to clean up....\" She yawned, rubbing her head before walking over and dropping her ass on the couch, Fred instinctively wincing as he had a flashback to last night, when he'd been sitting there. \"Hey, I didn't do anything crazy last night, right? I want you to feel comfortable here, and I'm really sorry that I let myself get too out of hand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... fine.\" That's all Fredrick could say, very badly lying as his tone and body language made it clear that it was not, in fact, fine. Thankfully for him, Abby was too hungover to pick up on those signs and just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. So... breakfast? I'm starving.\"</span></div></div>",

You two have known each other since Freshman year of high school, by that time she had already been a Morph for a few years. Despite what some might consider a taboo, you two started to fall for each other. By the end of sophomore year after hanging out nearly every day, sleeping over each others houses and knowing each others family members by name\u2026 you asked her out and she was delighted to say \u2018yes\u2019. You two have been high school sweethearts ever since. For the final half of high school you two have helped one another study and power-through SAT\u2019s, gone to prom together twice, and have decided to stay together no matter where life leads you after high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that leads you to your current situation\u2026 you didn\u2019t think this was possible. Your girlfriend\u2019s (still human) mother works in marketing, and she has a friend who is a Morph who is a higher-up in an advertising firm based out of Morph City. The two were just idly chatting on the phone one day when her mother\u2019s Morph friend brought up that they have a decent-paying, low-level job opening at the firm, and if her daughter ever wanted to easily move to Morph City, this was her shot. Both you and your girlfriend were initially planning to go to college yourselves. For Morph\u2019s just breaking into an industry, the city can be competitive\u2026 on the flip-side, Morph City practically rains jobs down on human residents. This is mostly due to the density of the Morph versus Human population in the city. Also, when it comes to humans, although many more open-minded humans might visit the city, many travel-guides say actually living there can be a bit of an \u2018acquired taste\u2019 that takes a lot of adjustments for humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though your girlfriend\u2019s mind was initially made up on what she wanted to attend college for, you on the other-hand were very much undecided. You\u2019d be lying if you said this opportunity wasn\u2019t some kind of a god-send. The plan now, was for you to move into a cozy apartment with your girlfriend, she\u2019ll start her job while you go job hunting (shouldn\u2019t be too hard, you\u2019ll probably get a tidal wave of callbacks), and once you\u2019re both working and settled in your girlfriend might take a few online college courses from the nearby university. And whenever you decided on a more long-term career path, you could join her at the local colleges too; plus, giving yourself some time to explore different jobs might do you a world of good in deciding what you really want out of your career. It seemed like a perfect plan, and the best part, is that instead of coordinating a way for you both to go to the same college, or finding a way to travel from one college to another every few days, you two get to live together\u2026 as roommates.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, today was the day. It\u2019s late-August, your parents are helping you pack up your things into boxes and suitcases. The plan is to get yourself packed up, while your girlfriend and her parents pack up her things. They\u2019ll load all of her things into a rented moving truck, she\u2019ll drive over here to pick you up, and you two will be on your way to Morph City. You were sweating a bit as you were speedily trying to stuff clothes into a suitcase, your dad was packing away your laptop and some band posters, while your mom was a bit emotional and organizing the packed boxes. As you three were diligently at work, you three heard the front door unlock and open, as someone knocked on the door. You heard a feminine voice downstairs, \u201cHelloooooo! Oh huuuuuumanz! Babe? Linda\u2026 I mean\u2026Mrs. Green? Where are you guys?\u201d That must be your lovely girlfriend right now. By the way, who and what exactly is your girlfriend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Name: Angela<br>\r\nSpecies: Crocodile<br>\r\nHeight: 10 feet<br>\r\nDescription: Standing at an imposing height, with an even more imposing body\u2026 Angela is a large Crocodile Morph with a bit of a wide, chubby frame. Despite her big, scaly appearance, she\u2019s quite bubbly and kind. Her favorite past-time is spooning you in bed, wrapping her large, scaly but soft frame around you. Always being a bit of a tomboy, she loves to wrestle, as well as sports and exercise. She\u2019s probably the main reason in convincing you to exercise more and get into better shape. She\u2019s a bit of a tease and enjoys flirting with you. Before this whole Firm Deal, she was considering becoming a personal trainer or perhaps a Martial Arts instructor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Becca<br>\r\nSpecies: Cobra<br>\r\nHeight: 9 feet<br>\r\nDescription: An impressively curvy snake gal, with a huge and heavy tail, Becca is a party animal who loves having a good time, and breaking the rules\u2026 even if her grades or bank account suffer for it. Acting as Tyler\u2019s opposite, the extremely-extroverted snake already has a rap sheet that includes multiple arrests, and weeks upon weeks in detention. She\u2019s very mischievous and pulls tons of stunts and antics, she\u2019s also quite the class clown and comedian. She\u2019s floated the idea of becoming an actress or some form of comedian, she loves to recount crazy party stories to friends and belly-laugh at them, and that\u2019s like\u2026 half of what being a comedian\u2019s about, right!? Despite being a bit of a boisterous personality, she does have a soft-side, she loves going on romantic dates to restaurants or movies with Tyler and snuggling him close to her big, smooth body when they\u2019re alone\u2026 although that usually happens after a night of her knocking back a couple dozen beers and drunkenly rolling over on top of him in her sleep, or somehow getting Tyler or one of their human friends accidentally trapped in her cavernous butt crack. Her mother is not a big fan of this rebellious streak and is hopeful the responsibility of up-keeping an apartment, career and boyfriend will set Becca straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Vivian<br>\r\nSpecies: Wolf<br>\r\nHeight: 8 feet<br>\r\nDescription: Vivian is a bit slim, by Morph standards, but still sports a very bouncy and curvy hour-glass figure. Vivian, could best be described as the \u201chot nerd\u201d, she\u2019s a muscular, glasses-wearing grey wolf. She\u2019s always been interested in fantasy adventures, even before she turned into a Morph. Unlike many humans who were amazed at their new appearance, Vivian took surprisingly well to it, thinking that her life, and the lives of the rest of the planet, now more-closely resembled something she\u2019d probably see on one of her table-top matches. She\u2019s very much into roleplaying games and fantasy novels, and is quite bright, scoring very high-marks on her SAT\u2019s, and having a knack for science. She was even the head of the science-club as well as a member of the school\u2019s Fantasy/Roleplay Club. But, despite her interest in stereotypical \u2018nerdy\u2019 things, she\u2019s also quite the party animal\u2026 literally. A high school party is actually where these two first bumped into each other, specifically Tyler\u2026 into her big, round glutes. And she took interest in the cute little human very quickly; she actually got him to join up with the school\u2019s Fantasy Club, and play D&amp;D games with her and her friends. She loves begging her human boyfriend to scratch her ears, and enjoys when Fall and Winter come around so she can snuggle her boyfriend into her heavy coat of fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Francesca<br>\r\nSpecies: Shark<br>\r\nHeight: 9 feet<br>\r\nDescription: When she was still human, as a little girl, Francesca was quite frightened of the ocean. Now that she\u2019s a shark she\u2019s turned into a bit of a surfer girl and out-doors type. She loves going on hikes and swimming in the ocean, and sleeping under the stars\u2026 and she\u2019s been dragging her boyfriend along with her ever since they started dating. After all, their first date was literally in the ocean, with Francesca teaching Tyler how to surf, and ending the night with him laying on top of her big, curvy, rubbery body as they gently floated in the calm ocean waters. Francesca is a big fan of \u201cgreen\u201d solutions and cleaning up the environment, and has been a big part of her hometown\u2019s initiative to clean up their ocean and shores. She hopes, once they move to Morph City, she can join up with some local green orgs and take trips on the weekend to explore the local woods. At least as of right now, she hopes she can take some part-time college classes on environmental science, hoping to one day work for a non-profit. Francesca also loves music, movies and dabbling in other forms of art and culture, she even keeps a song-journal of random stuff she writes on her guitar every now and then.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Times were tough for the Moore\u2019s. The father and breadwinner of the family, Mark, was unexpectedly laid off of his job, leaving his families future up in the air. This made things even worse considering his two kids, Dylan and Lindsey, are just becoming young adults and were about to be sent out into the world, whether that be a trade school, college or job. But, in their darkest hour, someone thankfully reached out. An old friend of Mark\u2019s, all the way back to his high school days had offered him a job; Hal Porter, was now a successful business-owner in Morph City\u2026 he was also turned into a large and rotund elephant man since the two last spoke in high school. Apparently he had heard through a friend of a friend about Mark\u2019s job search, and as luck would have it, his Real Estate business needed a Commercial Leasing Manager, and Hal thought Mark would be perfect for the position. Mark was a bit hesitant at first, considering from their current homestead, Morph City was a 5-hour car-ride (without highway and city traffic factored in), or a very costly 3:30-hour train ride, but his job search had been anything but frugal, and this job would more than easily pay the bills. So, despite the whining his son and daughter gave him, Mark and his wife Erica, decided to sell their current suburban house and look for a new homestead closer to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHal, being the stand-up elephant that he is, wanting to help his old buddy out, decided to get his equally large, curvy and leathery elephant wife, Amanda, to help the Moore\u2019s out with the move\u2026 they did own a Real Estate firm after all. After his dear friend helped him out with getting his life back on track, it was settled, the Moore\u2019s would move into their new house in Mid-July, with Mark starting his new position at Tusk &amp; Excellence Real Estate the Monday after, Dylan starting his senior year of high school at Claw High that up-coming fall, and Lindsey starting her first gap-year after high school\u2026 she still wasn\u2019t quite sure what she wanted to do for the rest of her life\u2026 though her mom firmly wants her to get a local job in the mean-time. Their old house was put up for sale and thankfully found a buyer, they were able to take that money and sink it into paying off this new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was finally the day, Wednesday, July 17th. After a fairly worrisome and financially scary Spring and early-Summer, the Moore\u2019s were in much higher spirits now that things were back on track\u2026 well, two of the Moore\u2019s were, their kids were not so enthused with the idea. The 18-year-old, somewhat short, blonde-haired boy, Dylan grumbled to himself, looking out the car window as the early morning sun shined in. Lindsey was also just as uppity, both from having to get up early to move and because of the move itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 19-year-old brunette groaned as she clacked out a text on her phone, \u201cMom, I can\u2019t believe this. All our friends are gone!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle-aged blonde woman, who worked as a part time fitness trainer, Erica Moore replied, \u201cHoney, I told you two a million times, your friends aren\u2019t gone. You\u2019re just a little farther away is all. You can still see them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey replied with some sass, \u201cOn where mom? Video-chat? Plainsview is what, 4-5 hours away from our new house.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Moore simply nodded, \u201cListen, you\u2019ll just have to adjust to it. You can take the train on weekends. And with dads new job I\u2019m sure we can chip in a little money for you if it\u2019s expensive.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey just huffed and reclined back in her seat, \u201c\u2026 I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Dylan piped up, \u201cI mean, what am I supposed to do too mom? Like, not only are all my friends gone, but now I have to do my final year of high school,  and do all my college prep in an entirely new school. And I\u2019m going to be the odd one out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Moore continued to nod, \u201cListen kids, I understand, I absolutely do. This year has been hard on all of us, but at the very least we can rest easy knowing your father has a job, and we all have a place to rest our heads. Not everyone has that you know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two young adults simply grumbled some more in the backseat as their car zoomed along the freeway and towards the quaint suburbs outside of Morph City. Soon enough, the car pulled off the highway and made its way through the streets of the suburb. There were tons of titanic houses about, most quaint, two story homes with different colored sidings, some red, navy blue, lime green, tan orange and so on, with trimmed lawns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the streets the human family could see some Morph\u2019s walking around, most in revealing clothing. There was even a pool party in one house that; for a flash as the car past by, Dylan could see that all of the guests were nude. Eventually the car pulled up to the driveway of their new home; 217 Tail Drive, Canis Township. The house was much larger than expectex, at least to the humans\u2026 their car comedically mismatching the size of their new home and driveway. The house, like the many uniformed houses in the neighborhood was two-stories, with navy-blue siding, and off-white paint on parts of the exterior. There was a porch with some furniture on it, a garage, and in the backyard there was a deck and an in-ground pool. Inside there was a kitchen with granite counter-tops, various cupboards, a stove, oven, microwave and fridge. There was a living room with couches and a TV set. Upstairs there were three bedrooms and two bathrooms\u2026 and the house had a small basement and attic for storage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the family stepped into their new home they marveled at the sheer size of it all, it was very elegant, but everything was also\u2026 much bigger. Mrs. Moore soon asked her husband awkwardly, \u201cHoney\u2026 why\u2019s everything so big?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt finally occurred to Mark that this was a Morph neighborhood for a reason, \u201cUm\u2026 guess this place was built with Morph\u2019s in mind. Makes sense.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey huffed as she stepped inside, \u201cGreat, now I\u2019m going to need a step-ladder to use the toilet.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Moore replied, \u201cSweetie, calm down.\u201d But Lindsey was already awkwardly ascending the staircase with a box of her things. The next few hours were mostly settling in, brining some extra furniture into the house, and unpacking boxes. Once Lindsey had finished up unpacking her boxes, and getting her room in order, she strutted back down the stairs as best she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yelled out, \u201cMom! Dad! I\u2019m gonna go out and explore the town.\u201d As she walked towards the front door, her parents were busy putting plates in kitchen cabinets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Moore replied, \u201cAlright sweetie, just keep in touch, text me what you\u2019re doing and where you are.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey unflinchingly continued out the front door, \u201cRodger Mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Dylan was still up in his new bedroom getting situated. Unlike Lindsey, he didn\u2019t just have some make-up, a laptop, and clothes to put away\u2026 he was putting posters up, getting his consoles set-up, getting the WiFi set-up and so on. While he was busy unpacking boxes he noticed something outside his bedroom window\u2026 his bedroom window lined-up perfectly with another bedroom in the next door neighbor\u2019s house. He noticed a large, curvy figure enter the room, as he squinted he got a better view of the female figure in the bedroom, she was a thick Komodo Dragon gal. She had smooth, forest-green scales, thighs that were probably thicker than Dylan\u2019s body, hips that would probably destroy the doorframes in any regular human house, was well-endowed with huge breasts and a bouncy bubble butt, and wore a revealing lime-green bra and thigh-hugging panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a human, it was kind of hard to tell a Morph\u2019s age, but she seemed to be around his age. The Komodo gal; oblivious to Dylan\u2019s prying eyes, strutted into her bedroom, grabbing a remote and turning on her stereo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time, a loud rap song blasted through the speakers, a female voice rapped, \u201cBig Orca, big butt, I got no choice but to twerk, pull up on your boyfriend and I get to work. Ride him so hard, I make it hurt, put this butt in his face, Imma big flirt.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Komodo gal jiggled and wobbled her gargantuan butt, dancing to the song. Dylan could still hear the song but it was a bit muffled, it didn\u2019t matter much as he was transfixed on the large reptile. Eventually, the Komodo twirled around and faced her window, where she saw the human spying on her. At first, her big yellow eyes widened, but a lusty grin soon grew on her snout. Shocked and embarrassed he\u2019d been found, Dylan immediately hid under the window sill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Komodo licked her chops and sashayed up to her window, opening it up, \u201cOooooh human!? Where\u2019d ya\u2019 go? Ya\u2019 scared? We don\u2019t see too many humans around here. You wanna come up and talk to me\u2026 I don\u2019t bite\u2026 unless I\u2019m hungry, heh-heh, but I just ate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan fearfully peaked back up at her as she peered at him from across her window, \u201cThere you are. All cute and bite-sized. You new around here? Planning on staying a while?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan used all of his might to push his window open, he was never all that athletic but it made matters worse when the window is twice the regular size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan gasped as he looked across at her, \u201cUm\u2026 huh, ugh, yeah. My family just moved here. Dad lost his job, got a new one in Morph City, so we had to move. It sucks.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Komodo frowned but then perked up, \u201cWell, it ain\u2019t all bad. Trust me, I think you\u2019ll love it here\u2026 plus, you\u2019ve got me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan replied, \u201cGot you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Komodo smirked, putting her head in her paws and leaning her big breasts into the window sill, \u201cYeah! You got me! I\u2019ll be your friend if you\u2019d like. Matter fact, my friend Jessica\u2026 she\u2019s a horse, is having a little party at her place tonight. Parents are out on a business trip, there\u2019ll be a campfire, she\u2019s got a pool, DJ set-up, raiding her folks liquor cabinet. Everyone is going to be there, bet you\u2019ll meet a lot of people there.\u201d </span></div></div>",

It\u2019s only a couple blocks from here. The place is 63, Muzzle Road, can\u2019t miss it\u2026 it\u2019s a BIG house. Parents are loaded. Party starts at 8pm\u2026 but\u2026 swing by around 7 if you wanna just see Jessica and I and a few of our close friends before the fun starts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan swiftly typed the address out on his phone, \u201cUm, thanks\u2026 ugh, what\u2019s your name?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Komodo\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cOh, Cindy. What\u2019s yours?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human teen replied, \u201cDylan.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy smirked and stood back up, off the window sill, \u201cDylan? That\u2019s a cute name. That sounds like the kinda name of someone who\u2019s going to get a face-full of my giant ass tonight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan blurted out, \u201cWait, wha-\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed her window shut, grinning back at the human like he was her prey, before giving him a wink and strutting away. Was she flirting with him? The human blushed as he thought about her. He\u2019d barely ever talked to Morph\u2019s in real life before\u2026 his old town was predominantly human. He had mixed feeling about their interaction, but\u2026 this Cindy girl seemed kind of nice, and kind of cute\u2026 for a big lizard that is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Dylan finished setting his room up, he rushed down the stairs, his parents now getting the living room in order, \u201cMom, Dad\u2026 I\u2019m gonna go out and explore the town some. I\u2019ll be back later.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Moore replied, \u201cAlright, just keep in touch honey. How late?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan stopped and yelped, \u201cUm, ugh\u2026 not too late I imagine, probably not too much going on in a town like this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Moore spoke up, \u201cYou should go meet the neighbors. They\u2019re a family of lizards\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Moore interjected, \u201cKomodo Dragon\u2019s honey.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer husband nodded, \u201cAnyways, they seem like nice folks, they\u2019ve got a daughter your age, maybe you two could hang out? She could probably introduce you to other young folks around here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan nodded as he continued heading out, \u201cY-yeah, I\u2019ll think about it Dad. See you guys later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the two human parents were alone they finished setting up their home and unpacking everything. Mrs. Moore looked around the house, \u201cWell\u2026 this is nice. It\u2019s almost like home\u2026 if everything weren\u2019t so big.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Moore put a reassuring hand on his wife\u2019s shoulder, \u201cDon\u2019t worry honey. I\u2019m sure after some getting-used-to the place will feel like home.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Mr. Moore felt a his phone vibrate\u2026 it was Hal. He picked up the phone, \u201cYes boss.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant laughed in his deep, gruff voice, \u201cMark, please. I may be your boss but I\u2019m your friend first. Please call me Hal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human laughed, \u201cHeh, sorry. Why\u2019d you call?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant replied, \u201cWhy do you think? To check in on you and your family. See how you\u2019re settling in. Thought the wife and I might swing by later for a proper celebration.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Moore shrugged, \u201cWell, the kids are out exploring the new town, so it\u2019s probably just the wife and I for most of the night.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHal chuckled, \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad to hear the kids are eager about the transition. They\u2019re handling it better than I thought.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 heh, you could say that. So, when can we expect you two?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was some shuffling sounds over the phone, \u201cWell I\u2019m leaving the office as we speak. How about an hour?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Moore grinned, \u201cSounds great. We\u2019ll see you then, we\u2019ve got a lot of catching up to do, buddy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can say that again!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHal hung up the phone, as Mr. Moore turned to his wife, \u201cWell, looks like we\u2019ve got company tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human couple went back to business, getting a small dish\u2026 well, large for them, comparatively small for two elephants, prepared for their dinner together. As Mrs. Moore slid a pan into the warming stove she heard the door bell ring. Walking over to get it, she was presented with a pair of huge, pink udders. Looking up, the human could see the grinning, pink snout of a massive cow woman. Much like the rest of the Morph\u2019s she was tall, with a huge, curvy form and not much in the way of clothes besides a plaid shirt tied around her bosom, and a crimson sash over her wide hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow woman gleefully greeted the human in a thick, southern accent, \u201cHowdy. Ya\u2019ll must be the new neighbors. I\u2019m Mrs. Connolly, we\u2019re ya\u2019ll neighbors, from across the street. Just wanted to stop by and welcome ya\u2019ll to the neighborhood, drop off some home-made cookin\u2019 for ya\u2019.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Moore happily waved up at her new neighbor, a bit shocked she could slightly see up her sash, and her tied-up shirt barely containing her breasts, \u201cUm, yes. Sure. Come on in. Thank you so much Mrs. Connolly is that cherry pie?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow nodded as she followed into the kitchen, \u201cSure is.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three adults convened in the kitchen to start chatting, the two humans started to ask about the neighborhood to Mrs. Connolly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe southern cow cheerfully laughed, \u201cOh yeah, yer damn straight! People are a lot more\u2026 \u2018open\u2019 around here, if ya\u2019 know what I mean. I know it takes some gettin\u2019 used to, for humans.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three chatted, the clacking of claws could be heard against the wooden floor, another female voice could be heard, \u201cExcuse me? Hello? Is this the Moore residence?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems Mrs. Moore had forgotten to shut the front door, and Cindy\u2019s mother, Mrs. Ramirez had stepped in. She was even larger and more imposing than her daughter, wearing hip-hugging shorts and a tube top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe curiously stepped into the kitchen doorway with a bottle of wine in her paw, \u201cHello there. You two must be the new human family.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big lizard smiled and nodded at Mrs. Connolly, \u201cHello Patty.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Moore smiled and approached her, \u201cHello, you must be the family next door.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Ramirez smiled, showing her sharp teeth and nodded, \u201cYes, yes. The Ramirez\u2019s. Good to meet you, welcome to Canis.\u201d It looks like Mr. and Mrs. Moore would be having a few more guests over than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lindsey walked through town, still a bit angered by her current situation. Outside of the large size of everything\u2026 and everyone\u2026 Canis looked like any other town. There were blocks with tons of one-or-two-story houses, convenience stores, restaurants, supermarkets, various stores, a school, and so on. She did catch quite a few looks though, from basically everyone\u2026 after all, the only humans anyone ever really sees here are either passing by and curious about the Morph townsfolk, on vacation, or coming here to deliver a product or package. As she expected the young woman saw Morph men and women dressed very scantily clad, from women with tight-fitting bras and panties, to men in nothing but a snug-speedo. It was definitely a lot for the human to take in, but she was\u2026 at least somewhat intrigued by it all. Morph\u2019s lived so much differently than humans, and she was curious what they were like. Her hometown was mostly human, so the only Morphs she really knew were friends-of-friends. She could at least try to interact and make friends with them\u2026 now that her human ones from \u2018home\u2019 were now miles away. Her mom also was very adamant about her getting a job here, perhaps she could peruse some of the local businesses to see if they had an opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lindsey walked, she started hearing loud, bass-heavy music, and the clattering of beer cans. She looked across the street and noticed a large house, decorated in various Frat and Sorority symbols, with a raging party going on. Through the windows she could see Morphs of various shapes, sizes and species, dancing, drinking, partying and doing a variety of lewd acts. The party even spread to the lawn, with college-aged Morph\u2019s playing beer-pong, sun-tanning and dancing to loud EDM music. Just like the rest of the town\u2019s residents, they weren\u2019t dressed in much. A tiger who looked very ripped, complete with a six-pack, bulging pecks and arms that looked like tree-trunks, started sniffing the air, eventually laying eyes on her a grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feline frat boy yelled across the street to her, in between sipping from his red solo cup, \u201cHey\u2026 human! You wanna join the party?\u201d Lindsey stopped and looked at the huge, hunky tiger, and the rest of the party guests\u2026 the hunky guys, chubby guys, curvy gals, and beyond. She was a bit interested, and considered it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Dylan was walking around town, mostly killing time until 7pm rolled around. He also got stared at by Morphs which he expected, some even flirted with him as they passed him by. Dylan continued to explore the town a little while longer, until he headed over to the place. In a matter of minutes he was in front of the impressively large house. Guess it was time to meet Cindy and her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, who do you follow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">A few years ago, a mysterious event, sometimes attributed to an act of biological terrorism by some unknown group, caused a small percentage of the population to suddenly transform into random anthropomorphic animals. These people still acted like themselves, but were generally taller, more sexual, and surprisingly happier, even when the transformation happened to change their gender as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year later, a company had a breakthrough and managed to figure out how the people had changed. But, to their surprise, none of the affected wanted to be cure. In fact, more people actually wanted to experience this. So, MorphCo was born, offering to transform people into new anthropomorphic forms as a free medical service. Gradually, life began to shift as more and more people became Morphs. Unsurprisingly, many people took issue with this, namely those who were more conservatively minded. Morphs tended to stick to large cities, and the biggest example of this was Morph City, a city designed specifically with Morphs in mind and with a 90% Morph population.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Morphs make up about 50% of the population. They are at minimum seven feet tall, tend to have exaggerated body shapes, and are incredibly sexual in nature. It's commonly believed that every person has a Morph form that they're meant to have, though this is untrue and MorphCo actually allows their clients to change back to human to try a different Morph form if they're unsatisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe shall follow someone living in Morph City. What adventures await them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a sort of slice of life style story, focusing mostly on the misadventures of our protagonist living in Morph City. Sex, anthros, and transformation are a big theme of this. I will allow other fetishes, but those are the main focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nABSOLUTELY NO:<br>\r\nGore, snuff, toilet or slob fetishes, foot fetish, underage sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRace/Speciesism is allowed as a theme in this story, but don't make it too serious.</td>",
