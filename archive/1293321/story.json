It's mostly black on the top of it, with red spots here and there along its back.  It's belly is mostly red, with black spots here and there.  As a young child, you've been fascinated by dragons and was sure that they actually existed.  You used to draw pictures of dragons and hang 'em around your house in the States.  When you grew up, you wanted to see if you could meet an actual dragon.  Your search for dragons has led you to Peru, where there were many sightings of dragons (or \"feathered serpents\" )   You went up a remote mountain trail, sure that you'd meet a dragon up in the mountains...and here you are, face-to-face with the mythical beast.  It looks at you for a moment, as if its considering what to do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"You know, humans hardly come to this place\" said the dragon in a female voice.  \"they're afraid they might get eaten by the dragon that lives here...bah, bah, bah\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         You hardly believe that the dragon talks.  Of course, in some stories dragons do talk...and in some stories, dragons don't talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Well, are you going to run away or stay here?\" asked the dragoness.   \"or..are you just overcome with shock and awe\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n           \"Maybe a little of both\" you blurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          The dragoness chuckles.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"I was hoping to find a dragon\" you say.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n        \"Oh?\" asked the dragoness.  \"well, you found one...and you might regret finding me...or that I found you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Why is that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"I tend to eat humans\" said the dragoness.  \"nothing personal, you understand\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Uhh...\" you say.  \"please don't eat me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Like that ever works\" said the dragoness, coming closer to you and showing you its long teeth.  Her teeth is about 4 feet long!   Her mouth opens wide and comes at you, meaning to swallow you whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"I'll do anything you want if you don't eat me\" you plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         </span></div></div>",

You see bits of bone and clothing in its mouth behind some teeth and you realized that you're going to be eaten by a dragon.  Not the ending that you were hoping for....you plea to the dragoness that you'll do anything if she doesn't eat you.   This makes the dragoness snap its mouth shut just before you enter it.  You're face-to-snout with the dragoness, and you fight off the urge to run.  During your excitement of having met a dragon at last, you failed to notice that this dragoness has two huge wings.  The wings are folded up beside the dragon, and are red.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"Anything, you say?\" asked the dragoness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Yes, yes!\" you plead.  \"I'll do anything you want!

Also, the dragons sizes are changed from about a hundred feet, to about 10 feet standing compfortably (on fours). their torsos have a length of about 8 feet, the arch of their back rests at 5 feet, and the length of their tail is about another 8 feet, with a wingspan of about 20 feet last thing, their \"caw\"is replaced by <u>somthing else</u>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You are baffled once again by this strange request; Your fascination with dragons, that originaly brought you here, did not go this far, you could not imagine anyone legitimately being sexually attracted to dragons. their robhust appearances were intimidating to say the least. Their bodies strangely stood, but were arched forward in a T-rex fasion, but higher; their large feet and their long tails seemed to be able to balance them upright to allow standing 14 feet up in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mjolnir advanced you with deviant intent, her vaginal cavity standing out more than anything. The scales around their groin were duller than the rest, unlike streamlined, bumpy scales over the rest of their bodies, these ones were fleshy, and prone to wrinkle; their vagina seemed large for their already huge bodies. Mjolnir took her forepaw, and pressed you to the ground, seductively walking over your body, and back onto fours until her nethers were in front of my face.<br>\r\nLooking between her legs; Nithog approached as well, mounting herself aganst Mjolnir, her crotch at mine<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Does this satisfy you human?\" Nithog teased<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's not like I have much of a choice or anything\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Resist all you want\" Mjolnir challenged \"I won't bite if you make it entertaining\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before you could protest further, Mjolnir stroked her clit to your face, the sicky juices spilling onto my face; followed by Nithog thrusting hers at your member. Mjolnir stroked down, openning my mouth and forcing my tongue to embrace her cavity, soaking up all of her juices; while Nithog pounded on my extent, each time accumulating a guilty indulgence. Nithog's plated belly fondled aganst mine, and was suprisingly lithe, gently stirring you into lascivious intent. Posessed by rapture, you grab Mjolnir's haunches, taking as much of her nethers as you can, tasting every edge of her exhibit as you can. You feel yourself  getting more and more aroused, you feel like you are about to climax when Nithog suddenly exits, followed by Mjolnir who says:<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You are a feisty one aren't you\"; you feel rather disappointed that they couldn't give you the satisfaction of climax.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh don't worry, we're not done yet\" Nithog comprimised. \"we have one more thing we want to try\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With no reason to argue, you sit and wait quietly for a resolution. Nithog turned herself around, so her backside faced me and haunched so her crevice sloped upwards. Mjolnir stood on two's and picked me up from my seat, leading me to Nithog's openning.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I expect you to crawl in there\" Mjolnir blatantly stated. This idea put you into a panic, even if it was big enough to support your girth:<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How am I supposed to breathe?!?\" you lament.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, I'm sure you will be suprised\" Nithog ogled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mojolnir grabbed you, and pressed you aganst Nithog's gaping orfice with suprising dexderity; Nithog 's juices were abundant from the prior sex, lubricating the passage, it still did not seem enough to fit you. still, you was being forced down the dragon's nether reigons; your whole face was envelloped by saitin flesh, and you gradually feel her enterance slackenning. The last thing you hear is Nithog's groan before your whole head popped into her channel; Nithog's juices fill the passage:, holding your breath, you are still continuously being heaved further by powerfull limbs. Devoid of oxygen, you gasp for whatever will fill your lungs; Nithog's serum was the benefactor, you gag and you think you are going to drown. a moment of reprieve overcame as you realised your lungs were full, Nithog's juices suplied oxygen; Not only that, but the stomach pains that had developed earlier are now also relieved!.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This was probably nurients supplied to eggs before laying\" You guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You feel your shoulders sinking into the fleshy sanctuary, then suddenly the rest of your torso followed, granting you controll of your arms. At this level of intimacy, you could feel Nilhog's every breath, every heartbeat, every movement; If you ever had to imagine what being a dragon was like, this was the closest a humble human could get. Nilhog faced extreme satisfaction as you was being thrust inside her, made her weak in the legs, and tense in the gut. You could almost feel her fissure scream with pleasure. Mjolnir grabbed my leg, and probed my knee into her already tight hole, with preasure, it slid in; questionably, my rump was being restrained. The other leg about as easily slid in to Nilhog's orfice, you were in her cross-legged; Mjolnir grabbed my very erect penis, and pushed my backside in the rest of the way. My whole body was envelloped besides your member, and from outside, it probably made Nilhog look male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now the real fun begins\" you \"felt\" Nilhog say. A moment later, Nilhog hoisted up onto somthing; baring closer, it came to our sensually combined waist.<br>\r\nYou feel your Member sink into somthing wet and warm. You now realise you are having sex with Mjolnir through Nilhog's body!; Nilhog and Mjolnir pressed flanks together in a curl, Nilhog mounted Mjolnir missionary style while she straddled Nilhog's left leg. Nilhog humped into Mjolnir who was gratifying this with a thousand licks; you took a moment to realise Nilhog's sexuality, Nilhog loved her!. This went spinning in your head as Nilhog gently pushed her beakoning partner into a true missionary position. Several, powerfull pumps turned into many smaller ones, as Nilhog could feel you reaching your orgasam. You are now flooded with ecstacy as you reach your peak; Nilhog pressed aganst her mate, as she was climaxing as well, Now everyone was climaxing at once!. as both dragoness' climaxed, they clasped around my body and my penis, filling every sense of my being. Juices flew off and in each other's crotch, depriving me of what I had, and pervading Nilhog and Mjolnir's passages, leaving mixed fluids everywhere.</span></div></div>",

Soon enough, you started coughing uncontrollably. As you instinctively raised your hand to your mouth to cover the cough, you began to notice a soft fire giving way from your jaw after each abrupt exhale! You gag and the cough subsides, but you stare at your hand expecting your skin to be burnt only to see the flames gently subside over a hardy array of glistening red scales and sharpened ebony-black claws at the ends of your fingers. Only four digits, on each hand. You barely even noticed the difference! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin to look up to your female captors, you quickly notice that yours and theirs gaze met nearly at eye level. There was naught but the silence of awe between the three of you. You dart your eyes to the ground and see that your old shredded clothes were but tiny insect-sized scraps in comparison to the size of your clawed feet. As you stretch your legs, you notice more power and dexterity in your lower limbs, as if the use of an extra joint made all the more difference in your stride. Your underbelly looks like a pigment of calm orange in comparison to the glowing crimson blaze of the scales covering your body. With a flick of your tail, you notice something else; wings. Feeling an additional pair of limbs from your backside, you look to each of your sides. Like a flaming ember, the powerful bat-like wings were a sight to behold when fully splayed. With such eager temptation, you begin your first attempt at flight without regards to the others around you. Wave upon wave, you propel yourself barely upwards. Yet, a short distance into the air, you begin to lose your balance and fall belly-down to the ground. As you steady yourself back up, you notice that Nithog was starting to give an expression as if she had something to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's unbelievable! You... You're really a unique one, aren't you?\" she says, open-eyed. She gradually retrieves her demeanor, and quickly states, \"As for the flying, you needn't fall back down again. We'll work on that later.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't care if he can't fly yet! I need him! Look, he's perfect!\" Mjolnir butts in, dedicating so much of her attention on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unwavering calm flushes over you. <br>\r\n\"This feels... so right.\" you confidently state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you feel even more prideful in your newly perfected body, you feel a slight twitch between your thighs. Looking down, you notice your massive, barbed member protruding from a slit in your pelvic region. All of this excitement as seriously turned you on. You...</span></div></div>",

What a terrible decision that could have been. Yet, I bet you probably would've survived that anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought of eating him!? You should have realized that there was something different about him at first glance!\" Mjolnir exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching herself, Nithog quickly responds, \"Of course I knew there was something different about him! Why do you think-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the two begin to sweetly fuss between each other. Realizing that they might continue on forever in their current state, you hastily add, \"I don't think you actually answered my question yet.\" The bellow of your voice felt so distinct and vitalizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if realizing her fault, Nithog corrects herself by saying, \"Well, in irony, we have a pretty redeeming option as of now. Have you tried that awakened body of yours yet? I'm mostly short on food supply here, but we can step out for a bite. There's a fairly large human commune nearby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment, but understand the circumstances. You are a dragon, after all. You agree by nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's settled, then! Let us venture forth. You're in for a treat, handsome.\" Mjolnir adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all of you exit the cave, you notice how different the world looks. From such a high vantage point, everything becomes visible in plain sight and the impact of each step on the ground begins to feel so satisfying. With your claws raking through the dirt, you begin to feel more in control of yourself and the environment around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough forests and hills, you come to your destination; a sprawling suburb on the outskirts of a major cityscape. It feels so different from up here...<br>\r\nAs soon as you look around, you already see that Nithog and Mjolnir are swooping in for their share of the prey. You quickly close in on a large section of a busy street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your weight comes down on the pavement, you hear the sudden shouts and astonished face of dozens of residents from your arrival. As you look upon them, you begin to feel the urge and the need for meat and for energy. Bellowing from the inside, you begin to release an immense roar across the alleys. The hunt is on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the masses began running, you swooped and grabbed a crowd within your grasp. Looking at them for a moment, you slowly lift your hand above your maw and release them to your jaws. The squirming felt so wonderful down your throat. Wiping your lips, you turn your attention back to the street. Chasing after the ensuing masses, you hardly notice those that you flattened under your massive clawed soles. Out of everything, you really began to feel like the main attraction, as if from a giant monster film.</span></div></div>",

As they went you examined the collar. It was like thin silk and it seemed smaller now and you gassed that it adapted to your size and when you try to take it off it chocked you.

Hopefully not while they're sleeping, though, I'd like a little privacy.<br>\r\nOkay, so, checking over the facts: I'm a slave now. I'm able to serve two beautiful dragonesses. Is that even a term, Dragonesses? Dragonessi? Whatever. I'm becoming a dragon myself. I've got a tail, a dragon's dick, and if the pain in my shoulder blades is an indicator, wings are probably next. I feel strong. My lungs seem to take in more air. I'm still the same, though. They don't seem to get that I'm not like most humans. God above, if I even think of my past they might start to pitty me. I'd hate that. I've had enough of people pitying me in my life. Man, I hate her. What did I ever do to her, anyways? Was I evil to her? Did I do something wrong? Is that why she didn't... NO! Stop it right now. You will not think of that evil bitch. Not when you have better women in your life now.<br>\r\nBut what if they think I'm not worthy of them? What then? Are they going to abandon me as well? Do what she did? Maybe they'd even succeed. I can't go through it again. I mean, I was a kid when it happened, but still, I remember hating her with every fiber of my being. Maybe I shouldn't risk it. Before this all, I could hold my breath underwater for four minutes. If I leave this cave I will choke to death. If I breath in and hold my breath I could make it a ways before passing out and dying after my four minutes was up. After I'm dead I won't have to worry about them starving me like she did. But... What if they're nicer than that? They seem to be, and maybe they're actually genuine about it. Maybe they'll just keep me as a slave if they think I'm unworthy to be their mate. Maybe I'd even enjoy it. They seem so nice, but I can't be sure. Okay, decision time. Go back to bed trust them with my life, or leave the cave and never have to worry about trusting anyone again...</i></span></div></div>",

You also don't hear the sigh of relief come out of Nilthog and Mjolnir's mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in the morning noticing one thing in particular, and that thing is that the pain in your shoulderblades is gone. You look behind you and see two black bat-like wings. \"They look nice, John,\" you hear suddenly, and you look towards the voice, seeing the face of what looks to be a very pissed-off Nilthog. She is standing beside Mjolnir, who doesn't look as angry as she does concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi. You scared me for a moment,\" you say, looking in Nilthog's eyes. \"Good. Now you know how it feels,\" Nilthog says, sounding slightly hurt. You look at her, slightly confused. \"What are you talking about? When did I ever hurt-\" Then you realize what she must be referring to. \"Oh, you two could hear me.\" Nilthog rolls her eyes. \"Give the genius a fucking prize! Of-fucking-course we could hear you! We told you we could hear your thoughts, idiot! I can't believe you would even think about doing something so selfish! Why the fuck would you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH, NILTHOG! He gets it already,\" Mjolnir yells, cutting Nilthog off. This shocks you, because you were pretty sure Mjolnir didn't like you. At least not as anything other than a slave. \"Look, John, it's obvious you have some issues. And it looks like they run pretty deep. But you have to admit, it's pretty bad that you're considering suicide. But, It says alot about you that you decided not to go through with it.\" You look at her and feel ashamed of yourself. \"Maybe I'm just afraid of death.\" Now Mjolnir rolled her eyes. \"We both heard your last thoughts, John. You would give yourself to us if we asked. You aren't afraid of death, you are afraid that we'd do something that someone else did to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilthog walks up to you, her face softening. \"Talk to us, John. What happened?\" You sigh to yourself, hating this. So you explain to them that your father had died when you were 2 and that your mother had been a really harsh woman. You tell them how you had been beaten frequently for small things, like talking with your mouth full or not coming in from playing outside at the exact moment she yelled for you. You explain that she was always drinking alcohol, and that when you turned 9 you had finally stood up for yourself when she had insulted you with some stupid name, and that she had beaten you senseless and locked you in the basement without food or water for a few days. You explain to them that the only reason you survived was because on the fourth day you stacked some old chairs up so you could climb out the window and you ran away to your grandparents house, who lived a few blocks away. You are tearing up by this point, but you refuse to cry. You tell them how your grandparents took you in and fought for custody over you, which they were granted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finish, Nilthog and Mjolnir are on the verge of tears. Mjolnir speaks first. \"Wow. John, I'm, uh, I'm sorry for doubting you. You've had some terrible stuff happen to you, but you still seem like you are such a good person. I think I've made my decision, and I want to be your mate, and have you be our mate.\" Nilthog nods in agreement. \"When you finish changing, you can be our mate, and we will be yours.\" You smile at the two of them. \"I'd like that alot.\" Nilthog smirks at you. \"But for now, you're still our slave, so start eating me out!\" You smile wider and walk up to her pussy, kissing it and rubbing her clit.</span></div></div>",

You panted as Nilhog got rougher with her movements till you moaned into Mjolnir's pussy as you came into Nilhog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilhog purred as she waited a moment letting you enjoy her pussy around your dick... one thing you noticed was that her pussy was tight regardless if you had been inside her or not. And what was next... You were drifting now that you had hit your pleasure thought Mjolnir wiggling her pussy in your face made you lick her pussy so that she wouldn't smoother you in her pussy though her juices were probably like Nilhog's. But that was for later as you licked her in time as you panted and licked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long before she purred and lifted off your face as Nilhog pulled of your dick. They purred and nodded to one another as Mjolnir picked you up and Nilhog lifted her tail. Deju vu. You were pressed into Nilhog's tight vulva and her vagina inside. As you were pushed inside it was easier as you fit more easily her pussy used to you. As your head and shoulders were pushed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen like last time your legs were bent and pushed into her pussy. One then the other. Mjolnir or Nilhog pushed you in till only your dick showed making Nilhog look like a male again as she pressed down onto Mjolnir your dick getting slicked into her pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilhog used your dick as if it was her own as she pushed it into Mjolnir over and over her jabs soft then hard, soft then hard as you moaned inside her. It wasn't long till your orgasm rocked you and shivered on inside Nilhog's vagina. And filled Mjolnir's pussy with all the cum you could as you panted... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we are...\" Nilhog panted to Mjolnir. \"So now to hunt and enjoy that food.\" She said as you realize that you were going to be in this position the entire time as your dick softened and was not flapping in the wind...</span></div></div>",

It was a simple leap that you felt as her rear legs were on either side of you and you felt them push. You groaned in pain as your dick was buffeted by the wind and the cold. You felt pain as you wiggled trying to pull in your dick and regardless of you struggles you didn't move as her muscles kept you in that position. You whined and called out. \"MY DICK IS IN PAIN, NILHOG!\" You pleaded with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't hear you as she moaned in pleasure and she seemed to keep on looking for the food she talked of. Regardless if her actions were going to make you lose the funnest part of you because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered and groaned calling out as her soft walls kept you there not opening or moving at all as it would seem she was in flight and the muscles here were tight keeping you steady and thus keeping your cock out and flopping in the wind. You wiggled again trying to slip in deeper so that your dick was safe... but it wasn't working but you were able to push a hand out and put over it finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed in relief as the soft memeber was protected by your hand. And you pulled it in so that it was along your belly, now swollen a bit because of the frostbite and cold it had endured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunt lasted on as you were in Nilhog's vagina not deeper inside, as her rear legs squeezed you and her vagina kept you still as the muscles could inside a flying dragoness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only indicator of the prey being caught was her diving... and soon you felt her land as the muscles relaxed and kept you in comfort now. Nilhog didn't bother letting you out as you were fed and given a drink directly from her as her juices flowed into your mouth for your breaths and other needs. Other than that you just were a passanger for now as Nilhog ate her meal. You wondered what it was as it seemed t require ripping and tearing as you heard the meat and bones tear and break... crunching with each chew she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a good while before it stopped and you heard purring outside as Nilhog got up and seemed to get read to fly...<br>\r\n\"Mjolnir, I am going back, come back when you are done, okay hun?\" Nilhog told Mjolnir making sure she heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will love!\" You heard Mjolnir say before Nilhog took off and into the sky... it wasn't long before she landed again then her vagina contracted letting your dick out first as your legs followed before slipping out of her and onto the floor... She looked at you and your dick as she saw that it was swollen. \"What happened? Got a block or?\" She asked in a friendly tone surprisingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Respectfully... Why would you care... it isn't like you left my dick out when you started flying. I get frost bite, and this is a sign of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilhog nodded not minding you critizing her, and telling her why it was like it was... she...</span></div></div>",

She slicked it over it and let you rest there as you started licking breathing in her juices as you had to trusting her to keep you alive... It made you wonder if you had to even worry about breath or meal as both dragonesses didn't mind letting you enjoy their juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was you could enjoy them as you licked inside her pussy and felt Nilhog pump more on your cock going up till the tip nearly came out of her, and back down tot he hilt. And if you were to see it. Her siting with her pussy on it made it return to the healthy color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moan into Mjolnir's pussy, You loved it and her. Even if you couldn't put your cock into her directly, you loved her. And Nilhog loved you, and you loved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all it was about, regardless if you were an equeal or not. Slave or not. Your love for them was there and you didn't see yourself returning to your life. Your life where you had to work hard for nearly nothing, be looked down upon for being you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut here they loved you and would perhaps support you should you need it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNilhog stopped as she felt you were close she purred before nodding and continuing on. She pumped more and more till you arched your back pushing into her as your cock let loose its seed your balls emptying into her. She purred feeling that and took all that you had loving your seed and accepting you as her mate. Even as Mjolnir accepted Nilhog as hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was not all as you laid there panting into the warm confines of Mjolnir's pussy. Nilhog and Mjolnir were kissing and nodding to one another knowing that they would enjoy it next just letting you rest and get hard again as your cock was soft for now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time for that depended on when you recovered which if this was going to be a common occupancy you found yourself nodding knowing that you would recover quickly in later times as you panted. Loving the soft pussy around your face as you felt Nilhog's still around your cock. The dragonesses made this so enjoyable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you started getting hard again as your smelled Mjolnir and felt Nilhog. The dragoness took notice and nuzzled her lover to let her know what was next as she got off you as your cock was revealed to the cold air. You shivered as Mjolnir lifted off you looked to Nilhog only to take notice of your cock. Seeing that it was healed unlinked before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as you crawl over to Nilhog as she lifted her tail and was up letting you see her ass and pussy. She was also so that she was slopped up and showing inside her vagina. You smiled and gently teased her before pushing yourself up inside that soft passage. Nilhog purred as she felt your hands tease her then your head and shoulders enter... it took a short time before your torso was inside that softness. That clenched to keep you in as you felt Mjolnir grasp your legs. And one at a time insert them inside Nilhog. You smiled and shivered in pleasure feeling her push your rear into Nilhog leaving your cock the only part of you showing as Nilhog's pussy covered every thing else. Your cock showing so that it looked like Nilhog was Male. As for the dragonesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMjolnir laid on her back as Nilhog got over her nuzzling her chest.<br>\r\n\"OH yes, I was waiting for this love.\" She said as she enjoyed it more than you knew it. Feeling your cock trail over the wet warmth that was Mjolnir's pussy. Mjolnir purred enjoying the tease that Nilhog was doing. Nilhog ended it by pushing your cock into Mjolnir's pussy making Mjolnir purr. Nilhog did as well happy to make her mate happy. Nilhog pumped into her slapping pussy and pussy even as one held a cock in its grasp making wet slaps as the two connected you moaned and moaned enjoying the work they were doing. You smiled and just massaged the flesh of Nilhog's vagina making her even happier... the soft and strong walls letting you feel what Nilhog was feeling making her purr and pant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good while before finally you orgasmed and released your seed into Mjolnir. Nilhog just pushed her pussy to Mjolnir's when you did to allow for the maximum amount of seed to Exeter her love. It made you wonder if you could make them pregnant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut regardless they settled down... this time you felt them part and a claw pushed you inside... as there was rubbing after that pushing you deeper... you knew what was going on as you got deeper and deeper... till you felt her Cervix. That dialated and let you into her womb... there you rubbed her fleshy walls and snuggled into her flesh. \"Rest Well John, it will be a busy day tomorrow one that we may just return home and sleep.\" Nilhog said to you as she too got comfortable, cuddling up with Mjolnir, Mjolnir nuzzling into her chest with love and affection. </span></div></div>",

After a few draughts of water she stopped and yawned shaking her whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she seemed to look somewhere before roaring. \"We are LATE!\" She roared as you felt her run back to the bed where she shook Mjolnir awake \"Love we are late!\" She said with a hurried voice.

Yet however pleasurable it felt you still felt ashamed, that you would be violated in such a way, and the fact that you could even consider it pleasurable demonstrated full well you were her bitch. You almost whined when she pulled her tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that slave?\" said Nidhogg, tauntingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lowered your head and let out a whine, that was more draconic sounding than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANSWER ME!!\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... ummmm,\" you stammered, curling in on yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidhog raised her head and grunted. \"So, you're not sure hmmm? You fear to answer, not because of fear of me but because fear of your self pride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped toward you and placed her weight over yours, pinning you between her body and the hard rock wall. If she decided to kill you right then and there, there really wasn't anything you could do about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're, you're going to eat me are you?\" you murmured, finding the prospect not all that bad compared to what she might have in store for you. Though by now you had a fully draconic body, she was still quite literally three times your size, not quite large enough to eat you whole but more than enough to do so in several gulps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, today I will make clear to you that from now on that you are my slave in body, but also a slave in mind. You will forget all of this pride of yours, and of whatever you wish your life to be like, for you exist only for me,\" she said, bluntly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she smiled, \"Oh, we'll have a long day ahead of us won't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trembled under her gaze, \"W-will it hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will hurt more the less you cooperate understand?\" she said. You nodded, of course it was going to hurt, but you preferred less rather than more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe maneuvered her tail and placed it in front of your jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick my tail slave,\" she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you hesitated, but when she saw you she slapped you across the face with her tail. You let out a yelp and fell to your belly, neck extended as your jaw took in her entire length and shoved it down your throat. You could hardly breathe, and dared not do so for fear of biting do so you placed it right in your jaw. Just when you thought you would suffocate for sure, she pulled it out at the last minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could let in a full breath, she snatched you by the claws and pulled your body wings first against her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now open your legs...\" she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body trembled, your tail feebly quavering to cover up your exposed slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OPEN YOUR LEGS!!\" she repeated, screaming this time. This time you did so without hesitation, throwing them wide apart while at the same time snapping your eyes shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your eyes open!! I want to look at you when you scream in terror!!\" she shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obeyed, as her slit pupils bored into you like drills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you scared?\" she taunted, whispering menacingly into your ear. Tears began forming in your eyes as she maneuvered her tail and pressed its wet tip against the opening to your anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your expression, she grinned fiercely, and before you could react you felt a sharp, piercing sensation in your anus. You flinched and let out a high-pitched squeal, legs and arms kicking and thrashing at the sudden intrusion. Because you had licked her tail beforehand, she was able to plunge it deeper within you quite easily. You whimpered in shame all the while, that she would violate you like that. You began to cry, as blood seeped down from her tail and dropped onto the ground, it hurt so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop squirming why don't you slave? There's nothing you can do about it anyhow. You are helpless!!\" she hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had resigned yourself to the fact that nothing could be done, it somehow became not as bad, as you moved to her rhythm. Soon, pleasure began mixing with the pain as you moaned unashamed. Inexplicably, you found your sheathe growing hard and found your claw motion as to reach for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that don't you slave?\" said Nidhog, grinning her pretatory grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure how to respond, yet she had clearly noticed your bulging silt. Teasingly, she reached down with a surprisingly deft claw and carressed it. You shuddered as she maneuvered your cock out of its sheathe and quickly grow erect in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooooohhhhh,\" said Nithog, licking her lips, \"Looks like you've grown quite nicely overnight slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her approval was deceptive, as she responded by plunging her long, sinuous tail further into you, sending forth another scream of shock from your mouth. At the same time, she began stroking your penis in earnest, quivering at her masterful touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\" she bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name!!?\" she repeated, louder this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a while to remember, \"J-john....\" you murmured, fearing that this would not be the response she wanted but not knowing how else to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, she replied by giving you a brutal thrust into your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!! That is not your name!! You will forget that name!! I WILL GIVE YOU A NEW NAME!! YOUR NAME IS SQUEAK!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yess... master...\" you said, trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name... is Squeak...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SAY IT AGAIN LOUDER SLAVE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY NAME IS SQUEAK!!\" you screamed. You felt as if you were going to burst, as precum began dripping from the tip of your penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO IS YOUR MASTER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ooh god.... Y-you are...\" you murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO DO YOU SERVE WITHOUT QUESTION?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yy-YOU!! MY MASTER!!\" you screamed. By now you were nearly delirious, the intense sensation too much to bear, tears running out of the side of your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Nidhog gave your penis a powerful jerk. You threw your head back, vision blurring, as the orgasm consumed your whole body, your penis spurting out a full load of dragon seed all onto your own chest and face in several powerful spurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was all over, Nidhog finally removed her tail from your anus and left you lying there, completely exhausted, covered in your own fluids. Immediately, you felt the raw pain in your anus, sore after the beating and stretching it took. Even so, you felt strangely, fulfilled...and a lingering aura of pleasure still remained; you had never felt anything so incredible in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your master stood over your exhausted body, all you could do was look up at her at fear and awe. In a strange sense, you admired her power, that she could bring such sensations within you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh master...\" you said with a quavering voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffed contemptously, \"Rest for now slave, but soon I will have new tasks for you to complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes master,\" you obeyed without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not occur to you then that at that moment that she had completely broken your will, that she had you as a slave both in body and in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, once you had sufficiently recovered, she told you to</span></div></div>",

As you begin to pick yourself up you feel a strict pain shoot through your lower abdomen. Your anus still sore from the previous 'lesson'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up,\" the dragoness demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan as you slowly push yourself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW SLAVE!!\" she shouted impatiently!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimper and wince as she snaps her jaws at you. You quickly stand, despite the pain. You remain standing for a short time before you begin to loose balance. You yelp as you fall flat on your back. She chuckles at the sight of you looking so pathetic. <br>\r\nYou attempt standing again only to fall onto your hands. You then realize how much more natural this feels. You conclude that you've lost all your physical human qualities. Now you are truly a dragon...a miniature one at least; the dragoness still being many times your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today we shall test to see how dedicated to me you truly are,\" she implied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only listen in silence for fear of another anal penetration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to pleasure yourself here in front of me,\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only stare back dumb-founded. How are you suppose to masturbate for her? You feel terrible and your just not adjusted to all this...you look at your claws...you might puncture something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, will you, slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you spit out between thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you will. You will or else we'll have to teach you a bit more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince at the thought of what else she could do to you. So you gingerly lower yourself into a squat and vaguely stare at your slit. You try to think of something arousing...all that comes to mind is the recent events...But then you feel your sheath begin to bulge. As you recapped you actually got 'aroused'.<br>\r\nNo...you refuse to let that be the case. She may have owned you in a thousand ways, but you still had something in you saying \"no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry it up, slave!!\" she impatiently growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to get yourself off. You begin to panic as she begins to growl in annoyance. You look around quickly then snap your eyes shut and plunge a fist into your sore, worn out anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness laughs to herself as she watches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whine as you feel your anus stretch around your fist, blood flowing from the reopened tears.<br>\r\nThis approach manages to actually work. You feel your slit swell until your cock pops out limply. It quickly begins to harden and you grasp it firmly and start to rub off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licks her lips as she notices your member has had another slight growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub quickly and try to just blankly enjoy, but you can't help but think of the last day's events. You try to block it out, but find it harder and harder to forget. You begin to pant as you get lost in bliss...becoming delirious to what your doing. You begin to push your fist deeper into your anus.<br>\r\nYou feel a sensation shooting throughout your entire body. You give one final squeeze as you feel yourself releasing. It shoots up against your chin and splatters on your chest and belly. Your toes clenching tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull your fist from your anus regretting ever having put it there to begin with...pain brought back, but not as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was...\" the dragoness starts<br>\r\n\"That was awful. You call that pleasuring? I want pleasure!! Not you spilling all over yourself!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only pant as your still worn out from the procedure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest for now...because tomorrow I'll show you what I Wanted to see.\" She threatens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimper and nearly argue but catch yourself. You are her slave. She owns you and can take you out with one blow. Best not back sass.<br>\r\nYou curl up in the corner thankful for such an easy day, but terrified of what is to come tomorrow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She says nothing; perhaps Nithog has her under some other spell, or maybe she is simply struck speechless by the sight of her only son undressing her to feed to a dragon. Your hands brush against her breasts as you undo the buttons, and you pull open her blouse. It won\u2019t fit past her tied hands, but you roll it back around her arms. You can see the expanse of her cleavage constrained by a black lace bra; but for now you move down to her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNithog watches you with interest. It\u2019s clear that she\u2019s aware you\u2019re violating your taboos, though just how much consciousness she has of the sexual nature of the act you\u2019re unsure. Her tongue keeps flickering out, tasting the emotions that both of you are shooting into the air on a pheromonal level. Nithog seems to be enjoying the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hitch your fingers around your mother\u2019s lime-green skirt and begin to pull it down. It involves adjusting her place on the stone which, while she is not actively struggling against, she is certainly not cooperating with. You have to drag your fingers across quite an expanse of her plump arse-cheeks before depositing her back in her place on the stone. You toss her skirt aside and spend a few moments removing her shoes and socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head is now between her smooth calves and you can feel the warmth radiating from them in the chill morning air. You steady yourself almost instinctively as you get up, and your hand touches her leg. You slide it upwards, hardly even thinking, certainly not in control of your own actions, until it rests on her thigh. You jerk it back as though it had been burned, but you know what you are about to do \u2013 what Nithog is about to force you to do \u2013 is going to be far more intimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach behind her to unhook her bra. You have to lean close, and her bosom is pressed against you. She\u2019s still silent; you don\u2019t know why. Is she just shocked? Resigned to her fate? Or does she, in some perverted way, want this?You struggle with the clasp and finally tear it violently apart. You have to rip it at the front, too, to get it off her without untying her; this involves reaching into her cleavage, and her two breasts press against your hands, warm and inviting to the touch. It is a good many years since you\u2019ve touched these...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts are now hanging naked before you, nipples standing in the cold, and you know you must now move to the final piece of cloth that seems so tasteless to your dragon mistress. You had a glimpse of it as you removed her skirt: black lace panties to match the now-useless bra, semi-transparent and with the forest of hairs beneath showing through the silken fabric. You reach down and throw all caution and inhibitions to the wind \u2013 what inhibitions can you have left when your mother is seated before you, almost naked, on a stone altar about to be sacrificed to your dragon overlord? You slip your finger down the front of her knickers, wiry hair brushing past your touch, and feel the slit which, incredibly, brought you into the world all those years ago. It\u2019s not exactly dripping wet, but it\u2019s noticeably damp, and as your finger runs along it you hear an involuntary gasp escape your mother\u2019s lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting on with the task at hand you rip her underwear at the hem, rather than trying to ease it off her as you did her skirt. She\u2019s naked now except for a few pieces of jewellery and the chaotic roll of cloth around her wrists where her blouse clumps around the restraining scarf. You bring your head up and look into her eyes for the last time. Her lips are parted, and her breath escapes into the chill air in misty clouds. Do you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her lips are warm beneath her cool skin, and soon warm up further as yours press against them. She returns the kiss; slightly passively, it\u2019s true, but since she is bound and you are bending over her about to feed her to a dragon this is unsurprising. But there\u2019s warmth, eroticism, even love, behind the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou certainly can\u2019t let her be devoured without doing something for her first. there\u2019s no question of letting her go; even if Nithog wasn\u2019t crouched mere yards away there would be no way to shake off the unyielding compulsions she has placed in your mind. But you let yourself slide down your mother\u2019s body, continuing to shower her with kisses like a journey back in time: the breasts that suckled you, the belly that grew you, and finally the hair-lined portal that brought you into this world. You plant your last kiss there, and it\u2019s much wetter than the simple dampness that you felt earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNithog is padding over, perhaps wondering what you are doing, and perhaps just after a better view. You don\u2019t care. You are pressed tongue-deep into your mother\u2019s cunny, savouring your first and last taste of her, but overall just concerned to pleasure her once last time before she takes the inevitable journey down the dragon\u2019s gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear her beginning to pant, and renew your efforts. Her thighs wrap around your head, crushing you into a warm wet sea of comfort, almost as if she\u2019s trying to draw you back inside her. Then she gasps, moans, almost crushes you with her thighs. You feel a glow of satisfaction spread through you; and then you hear the rustle of wings, the clatter of scales, and Nithog approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She is sucked upward with a slurp of saliva, and Nithog\u2019s lips appear, hot and scaly, mere inches from your head.

Another gulp, and warm draconian flesh engulfs you; you must be sliding down Nithog\u2019s throat. Oddly, there seems plenty of air, though perhaps the fires of her belly need oxygen to burn.

Please, I really need it!  That is why I brought you here.  That is why I transformed you into a dragon. I want you to be my mate!

I would love to be your mate Nithog.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you!  You don\u2019t know how much this means to me!  Now, in order for me to fix your body size, there are actually a few options that I can do.  The first option is to use my magic to age you to my age, but that would make me younger by a few hundred years.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait, how old are you Nithog?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI am currently 2987 years old.  By aging you with my magic, for every minute that passes, I regress 10 years for every 100 years you gain.  Right now, you are still a hatchling, even though you are 20 years old.  If I do this correctly, both you and I should end up at around 2500 years old.  The second method requires you to drink some of sexual juices.  That process does not age me, but it would slowly age you to match my age.  The third option is for you drink some ornaments my blood, but I must warn you that there is a chance that this third option will turn you into a dragoness.  So, which option will you choose choose, my love?\u201d Nithog states.<br>\r\nYou choose...</span></div></div>",

Fortunately for you, your clothes were already off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how is this going to transform me?\" you ask the dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she swallowed you and you fell into her caw.  Suddenly, you can hear her speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To become a dragon, you must lick my caw out completely from tip to bottom, and you must savor the flavor.  Failure to do so will result in a partial transformation,\" the dragoness says.<br>\r\n\"A partial transformation?\" you ask her with curiosity.  \"What is that anyways?\"<br>\r\n\"It is caused when you have not enjoyed the taste of what you have licked up.  Don't worry though.  The stuff in my caw is not that nasty.  All it is is just protein with magical properties that allow you to change when enacted with saliva,\" the dragoness answers.<br>\r\n\"Now I understand,\" you reply contently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then began to lick her caw clean, savoring the taste of what you locked up each time.  After an hours worth of licking, you noticed that you have not changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Miss Dragoness whoever you are,\" you call out.<br>\r\n\"I have a name, you know.  And it is Melissa,\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n\"Okay, \"Melissa,\" explain to me why I have not turned into a dragon yet,\" you said with anger and disappointment.<br>\r\n\"It does not happen instantly.  It happens in stages.  The first stage is your appearance, and that happens after the person has digested enough material from my caw to become a dragon.  The second stage is when you grow to the size of a dragon of your age.  Technically, I am 19 dragon years old, or 1900 human years.  The third stage happens with the second stage, and that is the increased knowledge.  The final stage is where the rest of your body parts finish taking their shape.  This includes your eyes changing your wings growing in,, and other stuff.  Now, I am going to spit you out right now so that you may witness your transformation with your own eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt yourself being pushed up and out of the caw, up the esophagus and out of Melissa's maw.  You then landed on the floor with an audiable thud, but you did not feel any pain.  You look at yourself and see that you are covered in blue and yellow scales.  Your hands and feet have full grown claws, and you are starting to like what you see.  Suddenly, you scream in pain as your body began to shift and grow to the point where you were slightly bigger that Melissa.  Melissa watched as your face changed and molded to a dragon's face with golden horns just like her's, you mouth gaining razor sharp teeth, and then she looked at how your now dragonhood came out of its sheath showing its now pointed tip.  She looked at it in lust ignoring the rest of your transformation.  She could imagine the great intense sex that she would have with you.  She licked her lips lustfully until she came to her senses.  When she looked you, she saw that you were the most hansome dragon she could have possibly ever met!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Did I do something wrong?\" you ask nervously.<br>\r\n\"No, you have done nothing wrong.  Its just that you look so darn hansome!\" Melissa replied with a tone of deep love and interest.<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to take me somewhere?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"Oh!  Yes, we are going to my parent's house!  Thank you for reminding me!\" Melissa exclaimed joyfully.</span></div></div>",

Now get in my mouth!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay,\" you say, unable to think of anything else to say.  \"By the way, my name is John.  I don't like being called 'human'.\"<br>\r\nThe dragonness lowered her head to the ground so that you could climb into her mouth, \"Bah, you're all the same to us.  Humans are just another animal, more like a pest of this world, spreading like a disease.\"  She opened her mouth, and you climb in.<br>\r\n\"What's your name, by the way?\" you ask as you place your foot on the inside of her lower lip, and hoisted yourself over her razor sharp teeth.  Your feet land between her big tongue and her gums, making a sticky squelch.  You realise that you can fit comfortably in her mouth.  If you layed down on her tongue, you would have taken up much of the length of her mouth.  'She's about the size of one whole city-bus, maybe one and a-half city-buses,' you think to yourself.  No wonder you easily fit inside her depths, and stretched her out nicely.<br>\r\n\"My name is Kath'vita,\" the dragonness answered as you settled into her mouth.  \"But since you are my slave, you may call me Mistress Kathy.\"<br>\r\n\"You're a dragon, you think humans are an inferior race, yet you choose to be called by a human name?\"  You reach down under her tongue, and pick up a big glob of her runny saliva, and start scrubbing her gums and teeth with it.<br>\r\n\"Shut up, human.  A dragon may choose to be called by whatever name they prefer if they think their true name is too complex for a normal conversation.\"  You could feel the pull of gravity as Kathy lifted up her head, \"Now less talking, and more scrubbing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: DO NOT END THIS CHAPTER OR ANY CHAPTER AFTERWARDS!!!</span></div></div>",

You momentarily stop to pick up more of her saliva before continuing your tooth and gum scrubbing.<br>\r\n\"So, how long have dragons been on Earth?\"  you ask.<br>\r\nKathy suprising could speak clearly, even with you taking up some space in her mouth, \"We've been on this planet far longer than your species.  We've first evolved alongside the earliest form of dinosaurs.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, if you guys have been around that long, then why is there no fossil record of you dragons, and why haven't humans discovered your species yet?\"<br>\r\nKathy smirked around you, \"That is because my species has had a long standing tradition, from the very first day we came to being.  We incinerate our dead, leave nothing behind, not even charred remains.  And humans haven't been able to discover us yet because they have not been looking for our kind.  Dragons, after all are a fairy tale species to you humans.\"<br>\r\n\"Yet here you are, in the flesh and blood.  If that's true, then where and how did the first fairy tale about dragons come to be?\"  You bounced up and down on Kathy's tongue as she chuckled.<br>\r\n\"The very first story about us dragons is no fairy tale.  Actually, it's more of a report based on fact than it is a story, but nonetheless it is considered a story.  It first was told by a hunter and his fiance in some mountain range village in the land known today as Poland.  They encountered a young dragon chick that had come upon a deer that the hunter had shot.  Actually, I am in a sense related to that chick.  He was my 17th great grandnephew.  When he saw the hunter and his fiance, the chick was startled, and flew off with the hunters kill.\"  Kathy paused to allow you to scrub the back of her mouth before continuing.  \"But when they had told their story, no one believed them.  The hunter was known locally to be one of the village drunks, and many times he was drunk whenever he would go hunting.  No on believed the fiance either, for she was known to have an over-creative imagination.  So, that report went unnoticed by the rest of the early European world, until another report about a dragon sighting came.  This time, from an unlikely source.  The daughter of a nobleman from a small town near the border of Russia.  She said that she had been kidnapped by a great big scaled lizard with wings while sleeping one night.  But somehow, she escaped.  Little did the humans know that I had allowed for her escape.\"<br>\r\nYou paused, \"Wait, it was you that abducted her?\"<br>\r\nKathy snorted, \"No, my mate at the time had.  It was a gift .  But I did not like it, so I ordered him to return her the next night.  That's when the first report became of interest to storytellers.  The descriptions matched perfectly, and thus, the first fairy tale about dragons emerged, 20 years after the abduction.  Only the story had a king's daughter be the one kidnapped by an evil, blood-thirsty dragon.  It's amazing how the human imagination works.  We dragons are not blood-thirsty, or evil in any way.  Humans just make us seem blood-thirsty and evil through their depictions of us when they don't know what we really are.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that why you don't particularly like us?\"<br>\r\n\"No.  Not at all,\" Kathy replied.  \"I just don't particularly like humans for what they've become.\"<br>\r\n\"Which is?\"<br>\r\n\"Dumb, selfish, greedy creatures that have spread throughout the world like a virus or plague.  I only choose to make some humans my slaves becuase they can be easily forced to do my bidding with the proper threats of death.  Plus, humans make for great playthings.\"<br>\r\nYou stop what you are doing.  \"Sooo...is that why you made me your slave?  To be your sex toy?\"<br>\r\n\"Not necessarily.  You will provide me with the care and treatment that I require.  You didn't think that slaves served no other purpose except for being sex toys?\"<br>\r\nYou go back to scrubbing her mouth with her own saliva, \"Well, being the slave of a dragon, that kinda made a bigger impression on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: DO NOT END THIS STORY OR ANY CHAPTER AFTERWARDS!!!</span></div></div>",

But instead of opening her mouth, Kathy closed her jaws shut.<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you doing?\" you say as you begin to panic.  Kathy's tongue slides out from under you, and you fall down into the soft, fleshy depression underneath her tongue.  Oddly enough, the depression you fell into was perfectly shaped for you to fully stretch out your arms and legs.  Even some of her tongue where the base of her tongue connects to her lower jaw was hollowed out somewhat, allowing you to slide undernead the base of her tongue all the way up to your abdomen.  It was almost like a pouch.  Her tongue came back down over you, closing you in in this pouch-like depression.  Your body made a slight, but noticeable buldge on the underside of her lower jaw.<br>\r\nYou could feel the strength behind the muscles in her tongue as she spoke, the muscles flexing and wiggling and contracting around your lower body as she formed each word.  \"What did you think I was going to do?  Eat you?\"<br>\r\n\"You're not too far off on that guess,\" you reply.<br>\r\nKathy snorted, \"Oh please.  Dragons rarely eat humans.  The only times I will eat you are when you annoy me enough, that the only way to shut up will be to eat you.\"<br>\r\n\"But if you do that, then you won't have a slave anymore.\"<br>\r\nKathy laughed at that, \"You silly human.  I guess you are not aware that we dragons have two sets of stomachs.  One for holding food, the other for digesting food.  It's only obvious that I will place you in my holding stomach when I eat you.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" was the only thing you could say.  \"No one ever said that dragons had two stomachs.\"<br>\r\n\"And that's why the human race is so ignorant.  They hardly know anything about the creatures that thrive on this planet.\"  Kathy stretches her legs and walks to the entrance of the cave.<br>\r\n\"Well, how are we supposed to know about the anatomy of a dragon when we've never even fucking discovered your species yet?\"<br>\r\nKathy jostled you around in her pouch, \"Don't talk to me that way.  I know that.  But humans should have at leaast used their overactive imaginations.  How else did they think entire herds of livestock could disappear in just under a night?  Because we stuff our holding stomachs full of livestock for easy transport to our caves.  Now that I mention it, I think it's time for a nice little hunt.\"  Your body suddenly slides further underneath the hollowed space in the base of her tongue as she launches herself out of her cave.<br>\r\nYou could feel the muscles of her pouch flexing around you as they gently cradled you.  You are rocked back and forth with each beat of her wings, and soon, you fall into a deep trance by that rythmic upward and downward motion her body made with the beat of her wings.  You time your breathing with each wing beat, and soon your eyes become heavy, and you quickly fall into a light sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: DO NOT END THIS STORY OR ANY CHAPTER AFTERWARDS!!!</span></div></div>",

You were sleeping soundly\u2026until the shrill screaming of a deer in agony ripped you from your sleep.  You look up, just in time to get a splash of hot liquid in your face.  You wipe your face and look at your hands.  It was too dark underneath Kathy\u2019s tongue to see what it was, but the smell of iron filled your nose, and you realized that you were covered in deer\u2019s blood.  You realize that there was blood running down and pooling in the pouch you were lying in.<br>\r\nIn disgust, you spit the blood from your mouth.  \u201cSo, am I always going to be in your mouth every time you go out hunting?\u201d you asked the roof of Kathy\u2019s mouth.  The shrill screaming of the deer was beginning to die down now, and then you heard a powerful swallow coming from where your feet were.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Kathy replied.  \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this isn\u2019t exactly the best place to be while you\u2019re killing something.\u201d  You spit more of the deer\u2019s blood from your mouth again, and wipe more from your face.<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d  Suddenly, light poured into Kathy\u2019s mouth as her tongue arched upwards.  It curled over, and came down on top of you with a big wet thud.  You only barely managed to catch your breath as Kathy proceeded to give you a tongue bath, much like a cat would, only this was a more proper tongue bath as you were covered head to toe in saliva.  When she was finished, her tongue uncurled and came back over the pouch, closing you in again.<br>\r\n\u201cHow long have you been hunting now?  Better question, how long was I out for?\u201d<br>\r\nKathy smiled as she walked among the trees of the forest, \u201cWell, this is my private hunting grounds, which is about an hours flight from my cave.  And I\u2019ve only been hunting for\u2026maybe four hours now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!  I\u2019ve been out for five hours?  Even though I had a full nights sleep?\u201d<br>\r\nKathy chuckled, \u201cHeh, it\u2019s a little something special from my saliva.  Dragon saliva has some chemicals in it that only seem to effect the human brain, as far as I know.  It\u2019s almost like a sedative, if you will.\u201d<br>\r\nYou groaned, \u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t have told me yesterday?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d was Kathy\u2019s blunt answer.<br>\r\nYou fall silent, unable to think of anything to say.  You\u2019re body slides into the hollow space under her tongue base as she lunged her head forward, snapping up another deer.  Another powerful swallow, and you could hear the deer\u2019s cries of fear fade away as it slide down Kathy\u2019s gullet.<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, that should satisfy me for a couple days.  Now, enough resting, time for you to come out.\u201d<br>\r\nYou look up as light flooded the pouch again, and you slide out of the pouch.  You drop to the ground, head-first.  You land right on top of a rock.  Rolling over, you clutch the top of your head as a big bump rapidly formed there.  \u201cGah!  Did you have to drop me where there were rocks?\u201d<br>\r\nKathy laughed, \u201cOf course.  It\u2019s entertaining.  I love picking on my slaves.  It\u2019s funny listening to their reactions.\u201d<br>\r\nYou rubbed your head, \u201cYou know, you sound just like my older sister when she used to pick on me when I was little.  You\u2019re just like her.  For a dragon, you sure do act like a human.\u201d<br>\r\nKathy snorted, \u201cWhat do you expect?  We live in the same world.  Dragons have been walking among humans for about a thousand years now, and some human emotions and styles have rubbed off onto us.  Like the act of picking on someone younger.  It\u2019s an amusement that I enjoy very much.\u201d<br>\r\nYou groan, \u201cYeah, well it\u2019s not very amusing to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: DO NOT END THIS STORY OR ANY CHAPTER AFTERWARDS!!!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The warmth of her bowels is incredible, and you struggle as you finally realize that you aren't being engulfed by the lovely pussy you saw just moments before ending up in here.  But struggling does not help you at all, for you are already up to your waist in her ass, and struggling only makes the journey into her ass even more difficult as the walls tighten everytime you move.<br>\r\n\"Struggling will get you no where now, little one.\"  Her voice vibrated in your ears.<br>\r\nFinally, just when you think that she is going to push you in to the point of no return, she stops, your ankles the only part of your body sticking out of her ass.  You can hear her breathing hard, obviously exhuasted from straining to get almost all of your body in her ass.<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel her tail wrap around your your ankles again, and she begins to pull your body out of her ass.  Her anal muscles flex outwards and you slide out easily.  She sets you sprawled across her belly and you can hear her panting.  You catch a breath of fresh air, but it's short-lived.  Her tail again lifts you up, but she suddenly plunges you head first into her pussy.  You cry out in joy as you ejaculate, and just when a rush of hot cum flows across your body.  The fun in her pussy is short-lived, for she pulls you out and again sets you on her belly.  She wraps her tail around your arms and torso, and she drags your legs across her belly, until your feet are resting on her anal hole.  The hole of flesh reaches out and engulfs your feet, and this time, you slide into her ass more easily.  You slide in all the way until only your head is sticking out, and the hole tightens around your neck.<br>\r\nYou look up at her and she looks back down at you.<br>\r\nShe smiles, \"You better get used to this little one.  Because we will be doing this everyday before we go to sleep.  We will do this for the rest of our lives.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I can't live as long as you.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I will alway insert you into my sex before putting you to bed, little one.  My sexual juices have nutrients in them, and one nutrient gives you a longer life.\"<br>\r\nAt that, she tightens her ass and you cough as you are literally choked by an asshole.  She then flexes her anal muscles outward, and pushes your head in with a clawed finger, and the opening to the outside world is sealed above you.<br>\r\nYou hear her voice vibrate around you, \"Do not worry little one, we will have more fun together tommorow.\"</span></div></div>",

With another heave, she managed to eject your from her throat, and out of her mouth with a bit of discomfort.  \u201cOw... do you humans ever stop grow... ing...\u201d the dragoness was about to ask before stopping to see she spat out a male dragon from her caw.  \u201cHm.  I must have sent you to my caw on accident, but no matter.  With you as a dragon now, I can do a whole lot more with you...\u201d she said slightly seductively with a toothy smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?

Your eyes felt as if they can see better in the extremely poorly lit environment, and as you dug your nails in the caw to try to get more of the sweet juices that surround you, you realized it is starting to get unbearably tight in her caw.

You wanted all of it for yourself, and nobody else to have.  After a few hours of eating the juices in the caw you were occupying, you let out a light belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled softly in a manner of a female.  \u201cWell excuse me,\u201d you said to yourself.

If I was going to devour you I would of done by now my little pet. Now get to work!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set off to work on the giant maw. The whole mouth must be about twenty feet from end to end. Easy enough to swallow a five foot human. You think, \" I guess this is better than cleaning the outsides of her body. I might freeze to death from the cold outside. Luckily, in here, you are warm, yet coated in about three inches of saliva. 'The dragoness must be drooling over me.' \"Matthias\" thought. 'I mean I am on her tongue, naked, and inside her mouth. She must be be tasting my feet' John thought again.<br>\r\n After three hours of back-breaking work, Solstice says, \"Don't forget to wash in deep, Matthias my pet.\" <br>\r\nUh-oh that means washing right near the esophagus. Where you would easily \"fall\" in. Having no tools, you had to use Solstice's own spittle. Since you were coated in it. You had to get a huge glob of it and smear it on the walls of the throat and back of the tongue. Apparently, this only made the dragon create more saliva to splatter you with. Dripping off the roof of her mouth, the spit was coming down on your head soaking you in every which way. The drops were as big as beach balls! John thought ' She's keeping you here for a reason' she only wants to taste you more. <br>\r\n The way the whole \"coming-down-in-beach-balls-drool-thing\" started is when you wanted to get the saliva off  you. So you started to roll around on the dragon's tongue. Making you only more slimier. Now you figure the only way to get out of this is tell her to stop dribbling over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master...

He will be your new master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You will become his slave, or, if you don't obey him, his supper. Either way, you are taking my place as his servant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could ask any more questions, a loud whoosh filled the air like an enormous kite flailing in the wind. You looked around to see another dragon twice the size of the one who had brought you here. This one had brilliant blue scales the shimmered in the sun's rays that entered the cave mouth and a long, silky silver mane that flowed from his head. He was about 25 feet tall, his head the size of a large exercise ball, his wings like parachutes slowing his descent. He landed and the red dragon bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Kobold, my debt is repaid. I implore Your Excellency to allow me my freedom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Kobold rumbled in a deep bass, \"your payment is accepted. Kiss my feet and be more careful with your debts in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red dragon kneeled and kissed Kobold's feet before quickly flying off. The blue dragon then turned to you. He looked you over and nodded his head in approval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human, do you have a name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-John,\" you stammer, truly frightened by this Titan of a creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, John. You need not be so afraid of me, I am not that bad. I must be firm with my subordinates to keep them in line. For you, however, I will be kind and gentle. You have been traded for Br\u00fck's freedom, so you are now my slave. But first, tell me how this came about.\" You told Kobold how you had been looking for dragons when Br\u00fck swooped down and carried you off in his stomach. \"Ah, good, he did not take you from a village. I did not want to start a war. Unfortunately for you, that means you must remain my slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. You didn't know what it was about these male dragons, but they really turned you on. You almost wanted to be Kobold's slave in the hopes he would let you explore his body. He seems to have caught you staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do you like my form, human?\" he asks, surprised. \"I suppose we could have some fun before we get to work. How would you like to...\"</span></div></div>",

But I wanted this, I wanted to touch it, feel it. He was a true deity who in his eyes, there was an out of the sky, and chose him to be his nearest being. Although a slave but his own. Kobold sat comfortably on his golden mattress you exposing your his every muscle and every part of sapphire body. Kobold probably had a great time because he was smiling constantly looking at your consternation. Your eyes ceased to wander through his powerful body and focused on the crotch. It was something which made the biggest impression. Big, heavy balls and soft but still big phallus, showed the power of the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John have you feared my penis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! Lord! No!\" The dragon laughed out loud slapping his own thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's stopping you my new slave. You disgust me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No lord! You are the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.\" you cried out aloud, dragon lord laughed even louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that I can not handle it in fulfilling your request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKobold licked his mouth. \"Slave, Johny listen. You will not know whether you will succeed if you will not try. Is not it? Now listen to me carefully. Call me Kobold, there will be less formally, I'll call you John, okay?\" You nod. \"Then, I will say this only once do what your heart tells you. Do not hide it, your whole body yells of need for sex. I feel your smell the same smell as many other females or males as they were in the room. Everyone admired my body and everyone sooner or later fuck with me on this particular gold. If jewels could talk, they would tell you how I became the king of this tribe. How many females inseminated and how many males it has become my subordinate. You think you're different because you're not. Now you're in my world, and here a man can be a good slave or a good snack. You have the opportunity to not only be here but to become my personal mascot. Unless you prefer to snack, neither you nor I will feel because of this neither pleasure nor relief. So come here immediately and show what you got, man! You have nothing to lose and a lot to win.\" The last phrase said with a mischievous smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Kobold laid carefully on his right side so that his manhood lay extended in front of you. I still flaccid but already slowly awakening to life and vibrating slightly. Without haste and fear you approach the divine body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready at the first touch of his soft scales felt the shock that went through your whole body. And the smell! It was not the smell of urine or other foul odors of the body. It was the smell of roasted pistachios and sweet liqueur. Something between the two. Your body is tensed and cock became hard as steel and precum starts a leak. Picked up part of the foreskin to see the giant glans and urethra. The hole was so big that it certainly could be put there hand! You touched the warm body and then immediately been awarded a dragon precum. You sunk face in the white drops discovering her taste. It was godlike taste. You knew that you want more! You started to lick the whole interior of the foreskin, which was pleasing Lord Kobold very much because he purred enthusiastically. Another drop of white semen from the urethra went, this time you decide to lubricate over the entire body. Your skin, hair, legs, all covered dragon sperm. What a wonderful feeling! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a wonderful slave I got or rather a slut?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only glanced at the dragon. If he wants that you show him a slut. Well-moisturized hands locked in a fist, and immediately you put in the urethra of a dragon. Lord roared. And then everything happened very quickly. Suddenly member who slowly and calmly raised, thanks to mastering the dragon now suddenly swollen with blood. Being so close you felt a powerful heat emanating from the tension quickly phallus, and with his hand in his urethra felt as the blood flows. You felt like pushing a new wave of semen dragon mode when he lost control for a moment. Every muscle when he tried to stretch that struggled to avoid go the climax too quickly. Quickly rolled onto his back with you still stuck to the  hard and fully exposed penis. When Kobold finally calmed down, his eyes have focused on you still with fist still in his urethra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody ever since I lost my virginity did not try such tricks. Almost made it to shoot one's load. You are either very brave or very stupid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that's what you want sir... I mean Kobold?\" I said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but what's an orgasm without some fun. You nearly ruined all!\" Your feet will slip between the penis and the foreskin. Suddenly the spell was broken, and you want to sink yoursefl into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I realy sorry Kobold. I really did not want to.\" However Kobolt licked your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll forgive you slave but under one condition...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What condition Kobold, what I must do now?\" Kobold smile evild showing all his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When wiped your face and looked up you could see the still leaking Kobold dick dripping right on you. His urethra opened itself to add more sticky drake semen. The inside was hot, humid, the smell was amazing. It was like a very strange sauna. Something was going on outside, you heard voices unknown to you.

He could not wait when the transformation will finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Kobold. Why so long we are waiting, and what are you actually looking for inside. You lost something? Kartos, muscular green drake smile at him flirtatiously. Kobold liked him, because in contrast to his father, he was not a mountain of muscle but was also equipped with a functioning brain. And  a nice ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Yes, I had to make sure that he is all right. Other tribal dragons turn their ear to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You have a new slave there? Franor, red, slim very androgynous, and very dangerous when he is getting angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- No, a human pet. They were all staring now in pink condom. - It such a surprise you know? One of the scouts brought him to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- How long do you keep this poor thing it in your sack? Zelar yellow drake with a fantastic mind and unsaturated lust. Kobold saw the gleam in his eyes, it is going to be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Month, still I am working on him. Humans live too short for me, I wants him to live as long as it possible. Drakes nod to themselves. Lucky lizard. Humans are a rarity on their land.They are renowned for their plasticity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- But you will share him with us? Maybe even you him borrow sometimes. The last one Oren, black bastard. He led the most powerful clan, and although famous for their love of domination and beating. He was a hundred times better than what any of his brothers.

A month passed, what ceremony, what's going on. Kobold gave your sticky prison to second dragon. Having no time to lose the dragon began to put rubber on his own hard cock.

Those heavy balls, that soft phallus, you only imagine what that hiding in between those firm thighs looked and felt like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but master.\" You spoke nervously, adapting to your situation but still in quite the shock from the events that just happened. \"I.. i don't wish to intrude at- at all.\" You blushed a bit. \"And... and those are you're *gulp* intemate parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKobold growled with laughter. \"Don't be so coy, we both knew sooner or later both of us would come to enjoy this.\" He began to turn to his side, but kept his upper body somewhat sideways while his waist and beneath was facing upwards, a strange but fluid lying position. \"Come John, i will allow my guest to indulge in himself, i am not the harsh, brute master that you think i would be. I care for my smaller subjects.\" He idly drew a finger over his balls. \"And besides, i love to get 'intimate' with my slaves.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last bit of wording was just to seductive for you and you just couldn't resist. You began to slowly walk towards his hind section. \"as you wish... Master.\" Your eyes began to see the soft underside flesh of the reptilian beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just call me by Kobold, i feal more comfortable that way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about that dragon earlier, he called you lord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to keep my kin in check, therefore they call me by royal regards.\" He lifted up his sack and grinned at you. \"Please, enjoy yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked up to his tail base, a strong potent small hit your nostrils, exciting your body and pumping blood into your already hard cock. You moaned in delight. It was not a nasty, nausiating musk, but a pleasent one. It kept getting stronger till you were finally at your designated spot where it hit the most. There it was, a soft wrinkled ring of flesh, pulsing every now and then.  You eagerly climbed onto whatever foot hold you could and positioned yourself in a spot where you could just dive in if you felt like it, the soft looking flesh certainly was big enough to fit you body inside, even if it looked closed at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead human, trust me, it will pleasure the both of us greatly.\" You nod eagerly. You reach out a hand and hover over the warmth for a bit before touching it. It twitches in response and you pull your hand back. The second time you push a little into it and it feels more inviting. \"ooohhhhmmmmrrrrrrr...\" You can tell your mas- Kobold is going to enjoy this, his cock already rising a bit. You bring your other hand to the hole as well and gently push in with that too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhythmicly, you begin to massage in and out of the hole, each time it gets looser and the musk intensifies. You eventually pull your hands out a bit and get into a position wher the middle of your body is snuggly rubbing against the meaty hole of the dragon, letting you rub your cock against his ring. Kobold looks down and chuckles \"You know that will never work, it's too small!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin back \"You can't blame a guy for trying.\" You rub for a bit more then return to your first position. This time you push all the way into your elbows, this recieves a pleasured rumble from above and a large hand begins to caress his own cock. \"Deeper John... i love you in there.\" You happily oblige, the ring of muscle loosening up to a very lovely shape. You can almost peer inside butinstead you just push up to your elbows. Your face is so close, the musk that enters your nose is heavy and mesmorizing. You still shift in and out. You could do this for hours, even if it did not pleasure you the most, it gave you a satisfactory feeling of pleasuring something way bigger than yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is quite a foreign feeling for me John, i don't think any one has ventured this 'deep' before.\" He lowers his head down to yours and gives an affectionate lick. \"Good slave.\" He reclines his head back and continues to stroke himself.

You slow your humping down as you realize it's not exactly a very snug  fit for your cock, in fact, there was plenty of space to move around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to the dragon first noticing his dwindling cock, it didn't look to excite and neither did the dragon, a blank stare on his face and a tap on his chin.

What's that?\" The dragon responded in a bored but sarcastic tone, his large, hefty sac in front of you. \"Oh, you stopped i didn't notice.\" He seemed rather upset by fine by the fact that you can't really satisfy him. You begin to gently rub at his balls, the very thing you came for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-im sorry, i didn't think you wouldn't feel anything.\" He rumbles a bit when you begin to ru in a clockwise motion against his beach ball sized orbs.

You stare back up to the big, red dragon whose eyes were concentrated on the ceiling with a lulled tongue hanging out. \"What the hell are you doing!?\" His grip loosens a bit, but your ankles are now pushed in even further. He looks back down to you and smiles with a friendly grin. His large snout lowers down to your body and licks your face. Then without another word, his large, lavish tongue rolls out and begins to wrap around your miniscule in comparison member. \"Ohh....geez..\" Your mind is lost in ecstasy as that slimy muscle slathers your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel it, you getting even deeper. The more you sink in, the muskier the aroma becomes, it's just so much. \"Im gonna..\" Your body tenses up a little and the dragon begins to now openly suck on your waist, the pressure is so much that you whimper as you shoot your tiny load. Gasping heavily, you hardly notice that your thigh deep in this dragons amazingly soft and warm asshole. The dragon releases your deflated dik then licks your face, almost smearing some of your own spunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy that?\" The swallowing motion of his anus stops for a bit, just about the rim of the great pucker is about to touch your own hardening malehood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes... that was... amazing...\" You lean against his soft sac flesh and rub gently, heavy moans can be heard from above. You are still a bit frightened at whats going on with your situation. \"Please... please don't kill me.\" You beg softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" The dragons reaction causes the pucker to push you out a bit. \"Kill you? Whatever do you mean human?\" You point to the hungry oriface that's swallowing up your body. \"Human, i would not think to harm you. You are giving more than the chance of a lifetime, having partner like you so willing to please!\" The sucking motion begins again, this time at a quicker pace. You begin to panic. It stops again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Im... i'll suffocate!\" You plead with the large beast.The dragon lowers a paw down to your body and gently strokes it then returns to fondling himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA!\" He chuckles loudly \"Us dragons have nothing like your inferior bodies. We can control ourselves inside and out way beyond comprehension of you.\" You are a bit confused. \"Trust me human, you will not suffocate or die in my bowels, in fact i envy you very much.\" He pushes your head down a little, you don't push back, a little intrigued. \"In fact, I envy you very much. You see, it's said that a dragons lower intestines are so soft, warm and inviting that it gives the occupant more than a life times worth of pleasure.\" The hungry rim pucker is now directly touching your balls. It gets you hard in an instant. \"But I see you are still worried. Rest assured little human, if I wanted to harm you i would have, but i love pleasure so much more than food. You won't die and i bet my life you will enjoy it.\" He pushes your head down a bit more. Your cock is fully encased in warm dragon ass flesh \"Please human, hump away!\" The large lizard grabs its throbbing erection and reclines into a lying position, you are now parallel to the ground and half way sticking out of a horny dragons rump hole. It couldn't be any weirder than this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling on your cock is amazing, and as the reverse parastalsis of the dragon pulls you in more, you begin to hump wildly into his backside. With each thrust, the soft folds and confinements seem to caress your body even more, causing you to thrust more violently. You use your arms and spread the hole a bit, wanting more of yourself in this beast. Up to our chest now, your cock is about to explode. Suddenly a load roar jolts your head and the warm, musky bum of the dragon clenches all arounf you, encasing you in the most pungent and arousing meat in the world. The smell begins to enter your nostirls to a degree where its all you could smell. Your waist is suddenly hugged in a warm, musky embrace, the inner bowels almost vacuuming itself into the shape of your waist. The feeling is to much and you explode right there. You once again stretch the hole as wide as you can, enter your arms inside next to your sides and relax. The anus pulses as the dragons climax wares off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drift off a bit inside this beasts amazing asshole, so much that you don't notice his head drift down to your face. You open your eyes to see his large snout holding a huge grin. \"Human, that was amazing. I cannot give enough thanks to you.\" He begins to slowly lick your face and head. With each lick he slowly pushes you in further, the rim of the hungry dragons tight, flexing anus now on your neck. \"You weren't so bad yourself big guy.\" you smile at him. Your face now comes into contat with his musky hole, the skin right on yours. With a couple more tugs and the large dragons tongue pushing you deeper you sigh and let the smooth walls begin to caress you to sleep. It's enjoyable and cozy, and surprisingly, though the chamber was filled with musk, was breathable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a soft slurping noise, the dragon slowly pulls his tongue out from his rump and fingers it a bit. Groaning a bit he lies on his back, the feeling of something this large and foreign moving slowly inside of him more and more was just so good. \"Oooh... good night human. I will see you in the morning. The two of you drift off into sleep, both with an excessive amount of jizz on your waists.</span></div></div>",

He eventually starts concentrating on doing so specifically to your cock, effectively giving you a blowjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cum onto his tongue, and you start crawling to the back of his mouth, eager to slide down his esophagus into his stomach. The dragon feels this, and you suddenly feel the mattress that is his tongue shift upward, and you are now traveling toward his stomach. As you reach the end of his long throat and enter the portion of his esophagus in his chest, you can feel his heart thumping away, turning you on again. You suddenly stop against a wall of flesh coated in saliva, the sphincter. It opens and you are spilled into the dragon's stomach. It's quite roomy, and very warm. \"My God, you and your cum taste delicious,\" you hear the dragon say. You start to sweat from the intense heat, and the fact that you're in a giant dragon's gut, added with the heat, turns you on even more. Your cock is now hard again, so you jack off and cum again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that while being in the dragon's stomach is incredibly sexy, it's also incredibly dangerous. You could be digested and turned into just another one of the dragon's meals if you don't get out of here soon enough. \"Hey, uh, can I come out now? I don't exactly want to be digested,\" you say. \"Well, we both slept all night, boy. What comes in the morning, again? Or do I have to spell it out to you?\" \"Um...\" you say, not knowing what means completely. \"Man, you humans really <i>are</i> stupid. <i>Breakfast</i>, idiot. I'm hungry, and this is just the food chain. You may try to escape, but it won't do you any good. No, you're mine for the rest of your life, which should end in a few minutes, really.\" Already, you could see some small amounts of stomach acid being produced. \"You and your semen may have tasted wonderful, but that's not enough to satiate my appetite. You're nothing more than a meal. Given our size differences, not even that; more like a snack. And soon you will be quite literally dead meat.\" You can either accept your fate and become the dragon's mid-morning snack, or you could try to escape...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You accept that to try to escape is most likely futile, anyway. As the dragon's stomach slowly begins filling itself with stomach acid to accept it's latest meal, you feel the dragon take flight, probably to find his next victim. He notices that you're not struggling to escape, and says, \"Good little whelp. Accept your fate as my delicious breakfast.\" You feel him land and start to rub his belly while jacking off. He cums, and and is lulled to sleep due to being full. You walk around his stomach, thinking that walking might make the time pass faster so you can be digested already. As you walk around the bedroom-sized stomach, you notice something on the opposite side from which you came in. You approach the dark shadow, wondering how you can see at all. You notice it's the remains of the dragon's last meal; a skeleton, just a reminder that you are officially worthless past being food. There is now a shallow amount of stomach acid coating the organ's floor, but only enough to barely cover your feet. You originally though the acid would burn horribly, but it only itches slightly at most. Still, you know that you can't be deceived by that, knowing that it's digesting you slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your imminent death, the heat gets to you again and suddenly, your member is rock hard. You think that masturbating will help pass the time more, so you grab the skeleton's left femur to use it as a dildo. It's not exactly a twig, so you dip it in the acid for lubricant, in spite of knowing that it's <i>acid</i>. \"It'll only make this whole ordeal end sooner,\" you think as you stick the femur up your ass. It may itch a tiny bit, but <i>god</i>, knowing this is your last time ever getting something shoved up your ass makes it feel that much hotter. As you thrust the femur in one last time before cumming, you realize the acid is now slightly above your knees and you've lost all feeling in your feet. You cum, and the acid-covered femur had apparently dissolved quite a bit of you from the inside, because as you thrust it in that final time, the end that was in your ass now rears its ugly head where you can see it: it had come out through your gut. Seeing that you have a femur going in your ass and coming out of your gut, you pass out, slumped in a heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ass is now high in the air as if someone was about to fuck you, and is also the only part not completely covered in acid. The dragon's stomach is now producing the acid at an alarming rate, completely filling the stomach within minutes. Completely submerged, you digest even faster and are soon nothing but a pulp of digested meat and a skeleton lying at the floor of the dragon's stomach, just like the other. Except that it seems like it would be missing a femur, while your skeleton has an extra one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon wakes up a few hours later, rubbing his gut, knowing that you were by far one of his most satisfying meals. He feels your remains, now turned into shit, in his rectum, the place where you were loving his cinnamon-smelling ass. You don't seem to enjoy it now, as the shit wants to go along its course and exit the dragon. He finds having you as shit in his ass in incredibly hot, and flies to a nearby village. He jacks off while taking a massive dump on a poor villager frozen in fear, gaping up at the dragon's puckered anus. At the same time, he was jacking off, covering another poor villager in buckets of cum. He snaps up two or three other villagers, digesting them as he flies back to his cave. The cycle begins anew.</span></div></div>",

The dragon felt you escape and he lied down and with surprise and arousal as you did everything you could to convince him you are worthy to live as his eternal pet. You kick and push and stretch his intestines you even got yourself sideways which caused the dragon to yell in delight, the dragon smiles thinking to himself \"Hmmmm he is pretty arousing and I guess there are tones of other human meals out there, I haven't found any human so devoted to please me but he really hasn't made me feel like he is worthy of me I do need a meal. Oh well I'll talk to him about this.\" so he waited until you squished your way right next to his large anus but you stopped and forced yourself sideways with your head and feet stretching the walls then you rubbed him and then squished back so his intestinal walls formed their original form and you started humping him and licking his anus sphincter at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon was roaring and rubbing his cock which was already fully erect and he exploded spraying cum all over his face and body and all around him, you continued to squirm vigorously and the dragon squeezed you with his muscles and then farted. Your head popped out and then you forced your hands out and pulled. The dragon smiled looking back at his beautiful round butt and clenched his huge anus around you but you were starting to get angry and struggled as hard as you could twisting and turning and kicking until the dragon loosened a little and you shot out and landed on the ground You got up quickly and walked to the dragons face with a really pissed off look you stared at the dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey do you know if you eat me you will be missing an opportunity of a lifetime do you know how many people actually would remain devoted to you, I mean look at you they would all run away screaming their pussy heads off in fright ok! and I solemnly swear to remain your sex toy for as long as I live.

You have seen things like dinosaurs, and these claws are way smaller than that.  Tho those claws were not confronting you in the middle of the night, and were not attached to ...  You look up a pair of oversized legs to..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   ...A dragon?  The very image of those you had read those about, complete with wings that surely can't lift such a big creature, but are too big not to?  How can such a creature be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   More to the point, what is it going to do?  And what should you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   This last is easy to answer, nothing.  Good advice in dealing with just about any wild creature, and you are too scared to move in any case.  All those stories you had read about dragons capturing virgin princesses have done nothing to prepare you for the reality [which is completely unreal.  Not only are dragons impossible, you are very much no princess.  Virgin yes, tho you have to admit this has more to do with loutish males than any purity of soul on your part, but you and yours are part of the common herd.]  Those princesses may have been scared, but they weren't worrying about soiling their panties scared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But what is it going to do?  Go away sounds so appealing.  A little part of your soul may be talking about all your dreams coming true, but it is being drowned out by the more rational parts that insist you do not want to be a midnight snack.<br>\r\n    In the stories, the dragon carries the princess off to captivity, and she is rescued by the handsome prince.  Just where are you going to find a prince?   The jerks you know?  You'd rather take your chances with the dragon.  <br>\r\n   That does bring up a point.  You have always had this fascination with the dragon's treatment of the princess and the heroic rescue was always a bit of a let-down.  They were just stories, and don't really mean anything, but you had never mentioned those feeling for fear they would mark you as some sort of sickie that actually wanted to be mistreated.<br>\r\n    But now that you think of it, you really would rather risk a [non-hungry] dragon than be grateful for rescue by one of those losers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As if the dragon is reading your mind, it now grabs you and pulls you to its chest, your vision now full of dragon scales [which are almost hot.  Dragons are said to be firebreathing.  Could that impossibility be true too?]  Holding you there, it turns around and you glimpse a huge shimmering ball of blue.  You vaguely realize it has been slightly lighting up the area all this time, and that is what was allowing you to see on this moonless night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But there is no time to think as the dragon leaps into the ball.  There is a moment of confusion and then you see...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

[Not that you were before, but the movie line does match your feelings.]  The pull of gravity towards a forest so very far below you follows quickly, as does the feeling of the dragon clutching you and watching those wings successfully keeping both of you aloft [you hope]. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Your panic attack [during which you both try to get loose from, and to clutch, the only thing keeping you from falling] is relatively brief, and completely ignored by the dragon, despite screaming loud enough to raise the dead.  But you are soon enough reduced to some whimpers, and finally become calm enough to try to make some sense of what has happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The dragon first of all.  Now that you can look calmly..well sorta calmly... it is a lot smaller than you thought.  Not that it is at all small.  It might measure 30' from nose to tip of the tail, and the wingspread is at least as much.  But it is built more like a snake than like a brick.  Instead of being bigger than any elephant you had ever seen, it probably only masses about the same as a hippopotamus.  Instead of being just a bite, you probably would be a full meal.  [Somehow, this does not comfort you.] <br>\r\n    It's scales are a riot of shades of red.  Scarlet, crimson, and other shades run wild over the entire body.  It seems to have a number of horns, tho with your face still almost jammed against its chest, it is hard to get a full view.  <br>\r\n   You do get a full smell, which reeks of smoke.  The idea this dragon breathes fire is looking all too likely.  The smell is also one more strike against your fading hope this is just a bad dream and you are still camping by that stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Another strike is that the dragon is talking to you.... Well, at you is more accurate.  It is babbling something, which you think is a language anyway.  You don't understand a word, but it does sound pleased with itself.  You presume that is with your capture, and hope he is not taking about how delicious you will taste after a barbecue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Looking ahead, you think you will find out pretty soon.  What seems to be your destination is coming into view.</span></div></div>",

More important, it seems new, not some preserved ruin.  Oh, it might be decades, or even centuries, old, but somebody has been repairing the roof , applying paint, and \"cutting the lawn\".  Somebody [or something?] is very much in residence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As you and the dragon approach, you make out more detail.  The \"lawn\" proves to be fields of crops, which are being worked.  You see some of them look at you and gesture.  This seems to cause considerable excitement, but not terror.  Indeed, some of the workers don't even look up as they continue their labor.  And most of the rest return to their own jobs before long.  <br>\r\n   Not all tho.  Some carefully stare at the dragon, watching its every motion.  Guards to call out a warning?  Could be.  They have to know the dragon is dangerous.  But maybe there is some protection she can't see.  A deal where it gets a virgin every year?  Hopefully not, but at least it would make sense.  The locals would not worry too much about the dragon, but would keep an eye on it just in case it decided to cheat on the agreement.  The idea is probably completely off.  At least it had better be.  But it at least makes sense.  And recently nothing much has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The dragon pays no attention to the peasants [whose tools may be correct for the Middle Ages too.] and flies on towards the castle.  Soon that huge work is looming up.  Guards are on top of the wall, and are blowing alarms and gesturing.  But as with the peasants, this seems to be, if not routine, at least no emergency or reason to be scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It is a reason for you to be scared.  That dragon is only going to barely scrap over the top of the wall, and you are on the bottom of the dragon.  If it misjudges by even a little bit....   You bury your face in the dragon's huge chest and pray.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A moment later, you feel something different.  You risk a peek, and see the dragon is banking down, preparing to land.  A look forward shows the opposite wall of the castle is approaching rapidly and the dragon is not going to land before it smashes into it.  Again, you bury your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Again, things feel different, and you look, and again are not thrilled by what you see.  Somehow the dragon has managed a 90 degree turn and is racing to yet another wall.  This time, you manage to keep watching as the dragon goes thru yet another scary turn.  <br>\r\n    The ground is close now, but the dragon must still make another turn, just as frightening, before it can make an actual landing, and then lets you go, allowing you to kiss the ground in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   That joy of course is short-lived, and you look up some what fearfully at some approaching people who have you as their destination.  There is no clear hostility, but they do not look sympathetic, or even friendly.    </span></div></div>",

Besides, if someone did manage to get past the castle servants and guards, there'd be no way he could leave, unless he fancied killing himself. I'll talk to the Master Carpenter to see about making it so that you don't need to rely on the guards outside the door to let you out all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at this. \"Than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing,\" Snarvar said. \"However, I do have something for you. Go to the wardrobe and you'll find a small wooden box. I want you to open it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to the wardrobe and found the box he was talking about. When you opened it, you found a gold ring that was studded with a number of small gemstones. \"Are you sure this is for me?\" you ask as you hold it in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar nodded. \"Put it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slip the ring on- it didn't feel too loose, or too tight. \"It fits perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar smiled. \"I put a spell on it that would sure that it would fit the woman I wished to take as a mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is beautiful,\" you said. \"I hope that this doesn't mean that I've accepted your offer of being your mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" Snarvar chuckled. \"That ring is your protection here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ring will protect you against anything that could cause you serious harm,\" Snarvar said. \"It will let me know where you are, and if you're in danger or not, especially when I'm not around.

More importantly, you'll be be protected from anything I could do to you, be it from flames, claws, teeth, or anything else that has to deal with me, including those of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In short, me and those of my line will be unable to cause you any serious harm,\" Snarvar said with a chuckle. \"Very useful because I am a snorer, and have a tendency to breath fire out my nose- I don't want to singe your hair while we sleep.

A dragon can't have enough of them. However, there was one spot that the two of us would go to, so that we could watch the sun rise, or set. After she died, I buried her on the crest of that hill, so she could watch them during her rest. Now, mind you, I've been working for the day I'd take another mate- it's basically a requirement for one as high in dragon society as I am to do so.

I was, and they extracted their payment from me- one day of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, just one day from me,\" Snarvar said. \"The trees provided the rest- being long lived, one day doesn't matter, especially when there are several hundred trees around, and all of them willingly contributed that part of their life. They also agreed to help me return you to your original home in thirty years, should you chose to go back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as for restoring me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a price I'll willingly pay in full,\" Snarvar said. \"You'll wake up, and just think that the whole thing was some incredible dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will I be able to remember it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every last detail,\" Snarvar said. \"So I'll do my best to make sure that your time here is pleasant.

If you chose in twenty-nine years and three hundred sixty-four days, that's when it will be done. Of course, Snarvar does have some say, especially if you haven't started the process of producing him an heir of your line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alight,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Gertrude. She then looked at a servant standing by the doorway to the Dinning Hall, and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded back, and said in a loud baritone voice, \"Presenting her ladyship, Lady Kim- Potential Mate to Lord Snarvar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the scraping of chairs and feet, and the rattling of armor, as people on the other side stood up to grace your presence.

If memory served you right, one had to be of nobility to wear the color purple, as the dye came from certain sea snails, and each snail only produced a small amount, thus making it very valuable. As for the color red, it was a symbol of authority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a look at his face. He was sporting something in the manner of a goatee, with a short mustache and some beard on his chin. It was likely the most facial hair he could have, and still breathe while wearing the visor on the helmet he held in his one hand. There was a certain amount of hardness in his face, as if he'd be more than willing to take on the world. However, this seemed to soften somewhat as he gazed upon you. Overall, he wasn't bad looking, and only seemed to be a few years older than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that you are the Lady from another land, the one whom strikes Lord Snarvar's fancy,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I am,\" you said as you sat in the seat that Gertrude had pulled out for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Lord William Cedric,\" he said, as he took his seat. \"Though those of our rank may call me William.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friends tend to call me Kim,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a nice name,\" William said with a polite smile.</span></div></div>",

Besides, he's a good friend of mine, and in spite of any minor issues we've had over the years, he'll be the first one to drop whatever he's doing, arm his men, and come to my aid whenever the castle is attacked. I remember a bunch of bloodelves that attacked me while I was out hunting- managed to snare my wings up in some netting, and they were jabbing at my nose, to keep me from using fire on them, and trying to get at me under my legs, right where the limbs join up with the rest of my body, as that's where my scales are weakest at, and then he showed up, and just charged right on in. In a one-on-one fight, he wouldn't have had a chance, let alone himself against a dozen of them. However, the ferocity of his attack, distracted them long enough for me to burn half of them. The rest scattered after that, probably because they thought that he'd had others with him.

Of course, he'll lose the female, with them being dead to the other. However, if all three are friends, and if the female does have affection for the one mating with her, her Mate won't be able to get angry enough to break their chains, and he'll be able to take his Mate home, and take care of things, including making sure that the female won't get pregnant with the other male's child, if she so desires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, how does that work?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar chuckled. \"By cleaning out your sex of course.

To be honest, my mother was human; lovely woman, though I was sad when the fever took her. I think you'd of liked her. Basically, the males of my ancestral line went back and forth between human females, and pure-dragon females, though they liked to look for human woman who had that hint of dragon blood, like you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, I'm part dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just barely- probably sixteen, if not more, generations back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, why am I not a dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that woman must have been pure human- children turn out to be human when a male dragon mates with a pure human woman. However, her female descendants, such as yourself, could give birth to dragons if a male one had taken them to be their mate, like I did with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else about them?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human with a dragon ancestor is very powerful,\" Snarvar said. \"You've heard of Hercules and Merlin right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were of dragon blood, same with others who had certain powers, be it in exceptional strength or magic, or other such things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that explains why I was good with girl's basketball and baseball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar chuckled. \"Yes, now cover your ears; I'm going to call to Zeffer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just cover your ears in time before Snarvar starts a strange bellow, that was more of a series of rising and falling undulations. After a while, he closed his mouth. A moment later, you heard an answering undulation, one that spoke of sheer power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He comes,\" Snarvar said. \"When he comes, you'd best be extremely respectful. He hates humans, and sees all who enter his territory as fair game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he eat them?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but he'll take their possessions, and split their hips, one way or another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean he has sex with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Females in the vagina, males up their asses,\" Snarvar said. \"The ones that survive the ordeal make it to their homes, with females eventually giving birth to his children. The ones that don't make it- well, there's plenty of predators around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To see if he'll be at my side when my Foe comes to try and claim you,\" Snarvar said. \"Zeffer might be short an eye, and be the last one that one would call friend, but he'll see to it that the Rules are respected, if nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you see a dark shape in the sky. Even at this distance, you could see that Zeffer was easily three, if not four, times Snarvar's size. \"How big is he?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Far bigger than me,\" Snarvar muttered. \"A pure-blood dragon at my age of a hundred years is easily twice my size.

Then, as if showing off, he did a barrel roll. The sensation caused your stomach to flip at least three, if not five, times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pound on him. \"Don't do that!\" you shout. You feel a rumble coming from you could touch him, and up through the saddle; you couldn't tell if he was saying sorry, or laughing. \"You can forget about me deciding on whether or not I've changed my mind on becoming your mate!\" You felt another rumble; he had to be laughing or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, he came upon a mountain range, and slowed down. Eventually, he came upon a cave, one that could fight something ten times his width and height. Landing beside it, he walked up to the entrance. As you undid the straps holding you in place, he said, \"Be sure to stay by me until I introduce you. Those who intrude tend to be Fair Game to any who reside in a dragon's cave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't your family recognize your scent on me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could be someone I'm playing a game of Cat-and-Mouse with,\" Snarvar said. \"And when a dragon plays that game with a human, the human is always caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you said.

Little brother would rather avoid either of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would he fight for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dragon could call him King if he wasn't willing to fight if need be; there was a Rouge terrorizing the area fifteen years back, and the three of them, Snarvar, Znar and Fnor, all went after him. During the fight, Snarvar's wing was broken by the rouge; Fnor saved his life, by catching him before he hit the ground. They were as close as brothers after that, up until Fnor's self-control got the better of itself. After Anne died, Snarvar was just as much mourning for his friend as he was his wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" You look back up. Snarvar had finally caught Zlima, clasping her talons. You thought that you caught sight of his maleness in Zlima's vagina. Over all, it reminded you of footage you'd seen of eagles mating, but far more magnificent. </span></div></div>",

After that, they'll be placed as servants of very distant dragon clans, ones that live in areas far away from towns and villages. It will ensure that they never threaten anyone again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a common practice?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar gave a slight smile. \"It is; dragons in remote areas always have a hard time finding servants. Sometimes there isn't enough gold to risk the trek to the caves. Even other races send their troublemakers to us dragons; like the dwarves, elves, and orcs, just to name a few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And these people behave themselves?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless they fancy being left in the middle of wilderness with no food, weapons, or clothes, they will,\" Snarvar said. \"These places are three days flying, both during the daytime and the nighttime, just for a dragon to reach the nearest village. It would take a human better than a month to reach them, even if they were dropped halfway to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, several servants came by with the tubs of warm salt water for Snarvar and Zuma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, excellent,\" Zuma said, as one was set by her. \"I don't mind the taste of burnt human flesh, but that oil is just awful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as the servants began brushing her sharp teeth, and then, to your surprise, John went, and assisted with the cleaning, going right inside of her mouth to clean the upper surface and tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar turned to you as the other servants placed a tub by him. \"Wouldn't mind it if you helped to clean my mouth,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

You wink at him seductively and notice the effect you are having on him, namely the 2 foot long dragon cock inflating before your eyes. Swaying your hips as you move, you make your way over to his head and pull it down to your level for a kiss. As the kiss breaks he looks at you, stunned. \"Kim, I thought you needed time to make your decision?\" You smile at that, loving how considerate he was. \"I had time. A whole night to think, and to dream. I've had the same dream ever since I was a little girl, Snarvar. Do you want to know what I dream of?\" Your voice is lusty and low, and the dragon simply nods. \"I dream of being taken away by some awful man who wants to do terrible things to me. But I am never frightened. Because as soon as he tries to hurt me and have his way with me, my gaurdian shows up. My big,\" You run a finger under his chin. \"Sexy,\" bring you head inches away from his. \"Red,\" your lips are almost touching now. \"Dragon gaurdian. And he ALWAYS protects me. And keeps me safe and warm. And the real kicker is that he has always looked exactly like you, Snarvar. You say you have a bond to me? Well I have one to you too.\" With that you kiss him again, earning a bit of tounge for your teasing. You break the kiss and walk towards the dragon-sized bed, bending over at the waist and exposing your dripping cunt to the dragon. \"So hurry up and claim me, sexy. I want to be able to call you my mate as soon as possible.\" You wiggle your hips at this last statement, inviting him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar doesn't need to be told twice and makes his way over to you, licking his lips. \"And how can I say no to such a generous offer?\" He climbs above you and you feel him prodding at your virgin cunt. He cranes his neck around so you two are looking eachother in the eyes. \"This will hurt at first. Not even the ring can stop that. But it will numb the pain almost immedeately. And, if Amara was to be believed, the stretching feels wonderful.\" You nod, the pure lust in his eyes being almost too intense to bare. \"How long and how thick?\" \"2 feet long, 5 inches thick.\" \"Oh, wow... Please hurry up... I REALLY need it!!\" He kisses you as he guides the very tip in. He was right about the pain, as he pops your cherry. But it is gone as quick as it went. He starts off very slowly, his long tounge snaking out of his mouth and finding it's way down to your left nipple, licking and playing with it as he thrusts. He manages to make his way past your cervix without you feeling much pain, and bottoms out inside of your womb. You notice a sneaky grin as he pushes further inward and the ring stops you from tearing inside and you know what he meant about the pleasant stretching. Soon, you have a massive buldge in your stomache shaped roughly like a dragon's cock and you feel his scaley thighs on your rump. You feel so full, and you never want it to stop. He retracts his tounge and kisses you as he begins to draw back, until the very tip is the onlything inside of you. You love that he's being so gentle to your virgin body, but you want more than making love right now. You thrust backwards onto his dick and he gets the picture as he speeds up his thrusts. Soon, the two of you are fucking like wild rabbits, and you are loving every second of it. You have cum atleast 4 times so far and he hasn't even slowed down, pushing you towards your 5th orgasm. Finally he lets loos an rumbling growl and you know that it means he is about to cum. As he does so, you cum one final time and colapse onto the bed, his lovely cock coating your inards with his thick seed. </span></div></div>",

He has his arms wrapped around you and you just sigh happily. You turn to face him and his cock slips out, a great deal of dragon seed flooding out with it. \"You know I might get pregnant by this, right?\" Snarvar smiles lightly. \"Not yet. A dragon can smell when a woman or even a female dragon is fertile. Your time won't be for another three and a half weeks.\" You chuckle at that. \"So, what exactly does being your mate mean, now that I've agreed to it?\" \"It means that the bond between us is so much stronger now. We can feel eachother's feelings and even hear eachother's thoughts. Amara and I used to communicate with just our minds whenever we didn't want others to hear us.\" Your eyes widen at that. <b>Wow. I need to test this. Snarvar, can you hear me?</b> <b><u>Yes I can, Kim. But there are more things to being a mate. Part of the relationship of a mate is the commitment to return to eachother no matter how far apart we are and that neither one of us makes major decisions alone, such as using the other for deals. And you also agree to carry my children.</u></b> <b>I kind of guessed that last part. But... Does it have to be right away? I really don't know if I want to be a mother yet.</b> Snarvar chuckles. <b><u>Of course not. You are still my mate even if we wait a few months, or even a few years to have children. What makes you my mate is the fact that you are willing to stand by me and I am willing to stand by you, not the amount of children we have and how soon we have them.</u></b> You sigh to yourself again, content with his answer. <b><u>One more thing: baring some unfortunate circumstances, such as what happened with my Amara, you will live exactly as long as I do. And you will never age a day.</u></b> Your eyes grow wide at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you mean I get to stay young for hundreds of years?!\" Snarvar chuckled again, and you decided you liked the vibrations around you. \"Try thousands. I am only 110 years old. That is still very young for a dragon.\" You just stare at him. \"Well, you certainly look hot for your age! But, how old do dragons live for?\" Snarvar tilted his head in thought at that. \"That is a very good question. The simple answer is that it is impossible to tell, as most dragons that die are killed for crimes. My great great grandfather is still alive, and he is 250,697.\" You nearly faint. \"We could live up to 250,000 years... Oh my god... Wow. I just don't know what to say to that. How long were you and Lady Amara together?\" Snarvar smiles at that. \"35 years. We had been too busy to have children until 15 years ago, then she became pregnant.\" The math of that was boggling around in your head. \"Wait, but you said she had children 10 years ago...\" \"Dragonesses and women pregnant with dragons have a term of 5 years. It doesn't start to show until around two and a half years, unles there are more that 4.\" \"Oh my God...\" There is a slightly misty look in his eyes as he remembers the time with Lady Amara. <b>Oh my God, I'm hurting him by bringing her up. God, I'm so stupid.</b> <b><u>Don't even think that. I miss her, of course, but I am honored that you are asking about her. I would be much more sad if you never asked about her and ignored the fact that she was my mate.</u></b> You shriek in shock, not used to your thoughts not being private anymore. \"I'm sorry. I can speak until you get used to it.\" \"No, it's fine. I need to get used to it. And if I'm honest, I wish I had met Lady Amara. I think we would have gotten along.\" Snarvar smiles at that. \"I believe so. She was always so curious about everything, like you are. And you don't have to call her 'Lady'. Considering you are my mate now, you are 'Lady Kim' and you don't need to refer to her nor I by our titles.\" You blush at that before getting an idea. \"Can we go to her grave sometime? I would like to pay my respects and honor the woman whose memory made it possible to be with you.\" Snarvar grins and says...</span></div></div>",

You've spent far too long at my grave in the past 10 years.\" Snarvar's mouth hangs open for a second. \"Amara? Is that really you?\" She smiles at the two of you. \"Yes, Snarvar, it's me. I'm sorry I didn't visit before, my time in the afterlife has been very educational.  But I see you found the young woman I wanted you to mate with. She's gorgeous, isn't she?\" You blush before hiding your face, and she quickly walks over to you and pulls your hand down, her touch being slightly cold. \"Now now, Kim, you are. No need to hide your face.\" You look into her stunning blue eyes. \"You would know beauty. God, I see exactly what he saw in you. You- wait! How do you know my name? I mean, I know yours from Snarvar, but how do you know mine?\" Her laugh is like a song to you. \"Being a ghost has it's advantages. While Lover-boy was looking for a new mate, so was I. I had the advantage of being able to visit other worlds, though. I found you, told the trees about you and they did the rest!\" Snarvar laughed for a quick moment. But you could feel the sadness behind it. \"Even in death you look out for me.\" She turned towards Snarvar, her brow slightly furrowed. \"Someone had to. Do you remember what I said just before I died? About not wallowing in regret? I can still feel you, even from the other side. And while you raised our children well so far I felt it every time you wished you hadn't impregnated me. Do you know how much that hurt?\" There are tears in Snarvar's eyes now. \"I'm so sorry, my love. I just miss you so much...\" She pulled his head up to look her in the eyes. \"I know. And I miss you. But one day we will ALL be together. You, Kim, and I will be together for eternity one day. But I came here to tell you two things. The first is that you need to stop looking back on what you think are your mistakes and just focus on Kim. Got it?\" Snarvar nods and Amara turns to you. \"You too. Don't look back and think that he loves me more just because he talks about me. After all, will you ever stop missing HIM?\" You smile at the reference to your old boyfriend, the first man you fell in love with who died three years ago. \"No. No I won't. I get it. The memories are who we've been and been with. But we don't live in the past, we live now.\" She beams at you. \"Exactly! And second, I'm going to check in every so often. You won't always see me, you two, but you will know that I'm there. And before I leave, to put you and Snarvar's fears to rest, you  WILL survive childbirth. EVERY TIME. Think of it as me looking out for you. Now I need to leave you two. Are we clear on everything?\" The two of you nod and manage to smile. \"Good. I love you two so very much. Goodbye.

You and Snarvar sit next to eachother and Snarvar is forced to listen to a very pale man with slick white hair and red eyes giving him a run down of what the day's activities would be. \"Oh, and Fraria will be here soon to cement the details of your 'arangement'. \" Snarvar snorts to himself and you look up at him quizically for a moment before returning to eating. <b><u>Lovely. A full day of aranging when to create a child. How fun...</u></b> You nearly choke on your food for a moment, barely noting the sarcasm in Snarvar's thoughts. <b>I'm sorry, WHAT?!</b> <b><u>A deal my father made with another dragon. If neither Fraria nor I have mated with another dragon by our 110th birthdays we would be forced to mate with eachother until we concieve a child. Fararia's 110th birthday was yesterday, and she is with a human mate, so now we have to have regular matings until she's pregnant.</u></b> Your face goes deep red. <b>So your father isn't a fan of humans as mates?</b> <b><u>He is, actually, seeing as I was born from a human girl. But Fraria's father is a biggot who thinks humans are too filthy for dragons. He tollerates your kind, but not by much.</u></b> <b>So why would your father go through with this?! I mean, if he had you with a woman why is he allowing this biggot to control him and you?!</b> Snarvar sighs out loud. <b><u>Because my father owes him a very old debt, and this is how the old bastard is cashing it in. Now I have to fuck my best friend until she gets pregnant by me.</u></b> A loud horn sounds and Snarvar stands, motioning for you to do the same, and the two of you leave the table and go to one of the many balconies. You see a blue dragoness that is slightly smaller than Snarvar kneeling down so that a figure dressed in black armor with a ripped and torn hooded cape can get off of her back. You look closer and see that he has on a faceplate that is shaped like a black skull. The Dragoness straightened out and aproached Snarvar. \"Snarls! How are you? Got a new mate, there?\" Snarvar grins and you find yourself giggle at the nickname. \"Lady Kim, this is Fraria, my oldest and closest friend. Fraria, this is my new mate, Kim. You smile and curtsey to her, an action that probably looks as awkward as it feels. Fraria nods to you. \"Happy to meet you, my dear. How long has Snarvar been keeping you a secret. You don't know what to tell her until Snarvar chimes in. \"Not very long. We actually only mated for the first time today.\" You blush, but Snarvar had warned you that this world was much more open about talking about things like sex. \"You know my mate John.\" You look up at that. \"Funny, I had an old friend named John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn takes off his hood and faceplate, and what you see makes you tear up. \"And I had an old friend named Kim. Hello again.\" His smile, his face, even his hair are exactly the way you remember them. Then you realize this can't be the same man. He died three years ago, and even if he hadn't, there was no way he could be here. You back away from him and begin crying. Snarvar is by your side in an instant, and you find yourself repeating \"It's not him\" over and over again. <b>How can fae be so cruel, Snarvar? To put my dead boyfriend's face on some stranger's body!</b> <b><u>I'm so sorry, Kim. I really don't know what to say.</u></b> You continue to cry until you feel a warm hand on your face, making you look into John's eyes. \"We met when we were 5. We were friends up until the freshman homecoming at our highschool, Calden Valley High. That was the night of our first kiss, and we were lovers ever since. We were both in love, but I had to leave to do some work for one of my classes.\" Your eyes widen.</span></div></div>",

How are you still alive?\" John smiles lightly. \"Surveying the cave for the geology class was just the begining. There was a rock slide. I was knocked down and my leg was broken. I did my best to limp towards a light source I thought was an exit. But it turned out to be a glowing blue gem. The moment I touched it I was transported here, to a cave a few hundred miles away. It was a Wolf's den, and when I heard the growling of a wolf I thought I was done for. But then Fraria showed up.\" You looked at her to see a brilliant smile on her face. \"I was hunting for food nearby when I saw a flash of light coming from that cave. I went to investigate and found him in time to stop 3 wolves from making him their dinner.\" You looked back at john, still in his arms. \"She saved me, and taught me about this world. A few months later I realized I was in love with her as she was with me. So we became mates.\" You laugh at that. \"I should have figured you would fall for a dragoness!\" He laughed as well. \"You should talk, Lizard Queen!\" The two of you laughed for a bit longer and you finally break the embrace when Snarvar speaks up. \"Seems we have quite the reason to stay together.\" Fraria laughs at that. \"Good thing you arranged for us to stay here. It'd be a shame to break these two up.\" You sniff for a moment. \"You mean you will allow us to mate?\" Fraria and Snarvar both laugh at that. \"It sounds like you two were already well on your way to mating! You two have my permission and blessing to court, mate, and marry.\" \"Mine as well!\" Fraria chimes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you talk together, trying to come up with ways to make sure Snarvar and Fraria could have a child together. As it turned out, both of them had harbored a crush on eachother for a long time, and that was why niether one argued with their fathers about being \"forced\" to mate. \"You know, Snarvar,\" you began, \"you told me that dragons often times have multiple mates. Why not just make it official with Fraria? That way neither of your fathers can complain that you didn't follow their agreement, and Fraria doesn't have to get pregnant before she wants to.\" Fraria looks at you with a twinkle in her eyes. \"She has a point, Snarvar. Plus, you can't deny we both find eachother sexy. Remember that time behind our parent's backs?\" You swear the scales on Snarvar's face turned a darker shade of red at that, but he nods all the same. \"Very well. Good thinking, My Love.\" It's your turn to blush now, as you realize that you just gave your consent for Snarvar to marry Fraria. Fraria glances at John for a moment. \"What do you think, John? If this happens we can work on having a child together without my father being able to say anything about it. John, who had been quiet thoughout the conversation, moves his hand to one of Frarias. \"To be honest, I think I would like that.\" \"Then it's agreed. After you and Kim marry, we will marry.\" \"Here here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the four of you hear squacking and notice some strange creatures flying towards you four on the balcony. Snarvar squints for a moment. \"Harpies? They appear to be coming from the western hills. What are they doing here?\" One of the Harpies lands close to Snarvar. \"Lord Snarvar! Trouble in the Western hills near your mate's grave! There's...\"</span></div></div>",

Suddenly you get a flash of an image in your mind of Snarvar crying over your limp body and you realize it came from his mind, not yours. And you realize that if you died, he may never recover. <b>You love me as much as you did her...</b> <b><u>You two are both so unique. So alike. But I love you because you would never try to be her, where so many would. You are like her, but you are you at the same time.</u></b> You almost cry at that. He was angry right now and he still found the time to be romantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four of you land at Amara's empty grave, you and Snarvar hear Amara's voice in your head. <b><i>Snarvar! Kim! He's bound my soul back into my body and is forcing me to do whatever sick things he desires! Please help me! I can't stop myself!</i></b> <b><u>I'll KILL this BASTARD!</u></b> <b>We're coming, Amara! Just HOLD ON!</b> You and Snarvar push onward through the forest until you reach a clearing, where a man in a black robe is forcing a naked black haired teenager to suck him off. Snarvar leaps into action, knocking the man over and clawing at his chest while you escort Amara back to the forest. You notice that she looks exactly like her ghost did, but she feels so very warm. And the strange thing is she looked very much alive. You then notice the ring on her finger and piece it all together. The ring must have protected her body from all forms of decay. The four of you watch as Snarvar breathes fire onto the man and he slowly and painfully burns to death. Snarvar walks over to you and Amara and tears drip from his eyes. \"I'm so sorry. This is my fault. I should have taken the ring off of you. Then he wouldn't have been able to bind your spirit.\" Amara actually smiles at him. \"Snarvar. Sweetheart. You don't get it. Yes, what he did was evil. No, I will never forgive him for it. But he didn't just bind me to him. He brought me back!\" Everyone's eyes grew wide at that statement. \"The Goddess told me that the one who took me from life took me BEFORE my time! She told me that one day I would be brought back to life, and I would only die again once you died ages and ages and ages from now!\" Snarvar's mouth is hanging open at this point. \"You really are back?\" \"YES!

It's kind of private.\" Fraria nods and John kisses your cheek before the John mounts Fraria and the two take off. \"We'll see you three back at the castle!\" Alone with the two of them, you feel free to allow your emotions to come out and you colapse onto the ground on your knees.

Granted, it was part of a deal thing, but it still hurt. But Snarvar's people have a need. So many call them selfish. They need to collect. Women, men, jewls, gold, silver... But not Snarvar. In a way. He only collects those that deserve to be collected. That need him as much as he needs them. You have that need as well. And so do I.

And we NEED you. Like you need us.\" You smile at that and look into her eyes. You can't help but love her too. Snarvar licks the tears that you didn't know you shed. \"Amy and I looked and searched for you before she even got pregnant. We knew that our family wasn't complete yet, and now if feels so much closer. And I know that I will always need the two of you in my life. No compromises on that.

I love you, Snarvar and Amara.\" Snarvar nods and Amara blushes. \"Please, call me Amy. It's what my family calls me.\" The two of you giggle and Snarvar lets out a chortle a that. The three of you rise and you and Amy get on Snarvar's back before giggling again. \"You know what just crossed my mind? Now Snarvar has TWO midnight snacks!!\" The three of you laugh together as you make your way back to the castle. You three bid John and Fraria goodnight and leave them to a special soundproof chamber as you make your way to Snarvar's bedroom.</span></div></div>",

And while you really want to spend some quality time together, you are way too exausted from the day's activities, a sentiment Snarvar and Amy seem to be echoing. \"Hey, I really hate to say this, but I'm exhausted, and you guys look beat. Do you think we could just cuddle with eachother tonight? I PROMISE I'll make it up to you in the morning.\" Snarvar yawns and Amy streaches her arms above her. \"I was actually about to ask you two the same thing. For now, I am just content to be with you two lovely ladies.\" Amara giggled at that. \"Agreed. Reserection really takes it out of you... or puts it into... you... Or whatever. Whatever sounds less morbid.\" Even Snarvar had to grin at that bumbling sentence. \"We all need our rest. Tomorrow Jenn, Elly, and Mike come home from my sister's den.\" You immeadeatly get an image through your bond of four red dragons the size of racing horses. Amy's smile could not get any wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get to see how my babies grew!\" Snarvar is smiling wide as well. \"Oh, and Kim? Don't wear anything that is short or easy to remove infront of Mike. Same goes for you, Amy. Dragons don't exactly have an incest taboo, especially at that age. He's just barely learning about his sexual side and he seems to be interested in someone from the Cedric's line, but his impulses are going to be hard to curb, especially around two sexually active women. He only doesn't mount Jenn and Elly because they bite him when he tries.\" You and Amara lie down on the bed, you having shed all of your clothes to be naked with your family. You smirk at that. \"Did you ever do it with your Mom?\" Snarvar is silent and you and Amara feel embarassment through the bond. You two grin from ear to ear. \"Tell us.\" \"Right now.\" Snarvar's scales on his face are actually glowing and he looks sheepish, but he tells the story anyway. \"A few times. She taught me a number of things, especially how to delay and make sure your partner is enjoying it as much as, if not more than you. She also told me what a horrible thing it is to be selfish and never to mate with someone against their will.\" \"You took those lessons to heart. Then why shouldn't we teach our son the same way your mother taught you?\" \"Will we get pregnant by him or something?\" Snarvar's eyes grew wide at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, nothing like that. Once I claimed you as mates your bodies became attuned to me. Of my family line, only I can get you pregnant. You can get impregnated by others just fine, but not by anyone in my family, including Mike.\" You look into his eyes, and Amara starts tracing lines on the scales of his chest. \"Then why can't we enjoy Mike the way your mother did you?\" Snarvar licks your naked breasts, making you shiver. \"You can. I won't get jelous. But it has to be on your terms. If he starts mating with you without your permission, he won't learn the lessons I did. You two must initiate it. And you can call him your son as well. It is my hope that they see BOTH of you as their mothers. The only distinguishing fact, if there are to be any, should be that Amy carried them.\" He licks Amara's breasts after that last statement. She shivers as well, and you grab onto her hand, interlocking your fingers with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it when you taste me. Are you hungry tonight, Lover?\" Snarvar chuckles at that, getting into character. The two fill you in through their bond that they often played roleplaying games, and that the \"Hungry Dragon, Maiden Morsel\" one was one of their favorites. You decide to join in on the game. \"Oh no, Amara. I think the Big Bad Dragon's hungry! What will we do to feed him?\" Amara giggles at that. \"I don't know, Kimberly. But I think we need to find something to feed him! Listen to his big tummy rumble!\" This was very true. He hadn't eaten anything since breakfast, and his stomach was growling by now. To be honest, it kind of turned you on. \"I already see two lovely little morsels in front on me, My Dears.\" The two of you giggle at Snarvar's mock intimidation voice. \"Oh my Kimberly, it seems we are on the menu!\" \"Right you are, Amara! And I don't think we can escape!\" Snarvar chuckles at that, loving that you two are okay with this. \"Yes, my little Snacks! Time for the Big Bad Dragon to have his meal!\" <b><u>Last chance to sleep outside of my stomach tonight, Ladies!</u></b> [b}<i>Not a chance, Snarly! I've misse this way to much!</i> <b>I never thought I would even think these words, but I REALLY want you to eat me tonight!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Snarvar licks his lips and places his open mouth on the bed. You release Amy's hand and place your hands on his tounge. It's incredibly long, but is shaped like a human tounge, and is fairly thick. You slowly bring your head inside and feel the raw heat as his breath washes over your face. It doesn't smell all that bad, and his teeth are very white and shiny. You feel the drool dripping down onto you and in a way it feels good on your bare skin. You feel his muscles contract and your hands and arms make their way down his throat. Your face is centimeters away from his gullet, and you feel a twinge of excitement that only increases once his tounge starts tasting your nipples, stimulating them. You hear him moan and feel a strange sense of pride that he can find you to be so delicious. You feel your arousal dampening your pussy, but all too soon he has gulped again, and your head and chest are in his throat. He licks across your bare stomach, snaking his way to your moist pussy, licking away at the juices that have formed there. You are so exited that you cum within seconds of his tounge caressing your bald mound. He gulps again, and only your feet remain outside of his mouth. You feel him tip his head back and swallow one last time and your whole body travels down his throat, giving you a sensual (and very damp) massage. Soon you are deposited into his stomach, which is just as comfortable and warm as your last time in it. You look down at your hand and silently thank God, or \"The Goddess\" as Amara and Snarvar call her, for the ring that lets you experience this side of your lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Amara's voice outside, fairly muffled through Snarvar's flesh and scales. But then you hear Snarvar very clearly. \"That's right, My midnight snack. And you're next!\" You hear Amara give out a half hearted and laugh filled scream at that, and soon enough Amara's body pops through the esophogus, and you two giggle together. \"I never thought I'd enjoy being gobbled up by a dragon! Thank you soooo much for these rings, 'Snarly',\" you say, knowing that he can hear you. Amy giggles an agreement and the two of you feel the chamber around you rumble as you hear Snarvar chuckle. \"Worth every day of my life, making sure you two are so safe! They have a glue enchantment as well. Nobody but you can take them off, and they will never fall off.\" \"Thank the Goddess for that!\" With that, you and Amy cuddle up to eachother and feel the chamber move as Snarvar lies down on the bed. You sigh to yourself, content. \"I love you two...\" \"We love you two!\" The two of them say together in unison. And with that, the three of you fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

However, she simply stands there, shocked at the sight of her long dead daughter standing before her, having just bathed. After an explaination of yesterday's events and how the Goddess promised her a long life, you and Snarvar are treated to the sight of her a mother and daughter reunited finally getting the chance to meet again. Gertrude then goes about grabbing clothes from everywhere, a dark green gown with some black and lighter green accents and trim for you, and a black gown in a similar style with white trim and accents for Amara. She then confirms that Jenn, Elly, and Mike are waiting outside of the room for their Father, none of them knowing the suprizes inside the room awaiting them. As a joke, Amara hides behind the changing divider in the room while Gertrude opens the door for the three young dragons. In an instant you are tackled by three speeding dragons roughly the sizes of racing horses. \"You have a new mate!\" \"She's Pretty!\" \"Why does it smell like three people in here?\" You and Snarvar laugh and you can feel Amy snikering through the bond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children quickly dismount you as Snarvar speaks. \"Yes, I have a new mate! I hope you will all come to see her as a mother to you. Yes, I think she is very pretty! And yes, there is a third person here. See if you can identify her!\" Mike is the first one to find her, and as she steps out, Jenn and Elly stop sniffing you and start sniffing her. Elly speaks up first. \"That can't be right... You smell just like... Mom? Is it really you? Are you back?\" <b><u>Dragon's instinctually imprint their Mother's smell. That's why I am so pleased they are smelling you, Kim. They aprove of you and see you as my mate and, thus, one of their two mothers.</u></b> Amara nods and holds her arms out to her children. There isn't a dry eye in the room, with even Snarvar and Mike sniffing back tears. The three of them run into her arms, practically knocking her over as each child tries to get more of a hug from their mother.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After breakfast, you and Amara tell Mike to follow you. You quickly and quietly move into a guest bedroom of the castle and look at eachother. You two had been mentally planning this moment ever since Snarvar confessed that he had learned everything he knew about sex from his human mother. You had been shocked to learn (when Amara filled you in) that Snarvar's mother is a human. And that if anything ever happened to his father, his mother had told him that he would become her mate, and that she would be his. Apparantly there was something she didn't approve of that his father was keeping from him, causing her to not trust him. And by all accounts, even Snarvars own memories that he had given free access to both of them to view whenever they wanted, both Snarvar and his mother Glenda were deeply in love with eachother, to the point where she had said many times that she wished Snarvar would fight his father for her, something that sorely tempted him. You had to admit, the idea was really hot. And apparantly, they found a way to override his fathers claim on her, as Snarvars \"little sister\" Kraytell was also his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see Mikes penis peaking out from being in proximity to two women who he could smell were sexually active. Before things got out of hand Amara put sat down on the bed, pulling you down with her and patting the spot in between us for Mike. He looked very lustily at us before getting on the bed. Amara spoke first. \"Hello, my darling baby! I had never thought I would get to see you through my living eyes again!\" She kissed his snout and tears began to form in his eyes. \"Mama, I'm so glad to see you! How are you back?\" We told him the story, and how the necromancer hadn't managed to fully bind her soul to him, binding it to her body again instead. He began to openly weap and the two of us hugged him tightly to us, comforting him. \"Hey now, it's okay. Just imagine how your father feels! He thought I was gone forever!\" \"Dad told us you were looking after us after you died. Is that true?\" Amara nodded proudly and you tilted your head, tears in your eyes too. \"Aww, that's so sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike, your mother and I-\" Before you could finish your sentence, Mike interupted. \"Mama Kim, you are my mother too. You didn't give birth to me, but I know you will care for me.\" You smile at that and it's Amaras turn to tilt her head. \"Aww, Michael, that's so nice of you!\" You smile at the dragon and he begins looking anxious. Time to move this along. \"Thank you, Mike, Son. What I want to say is that it has come to our attention that you are in need of some... lessons about sex.\" His cock shoots out of his sheath at that and you see it is roughly the size of a young buck's penis. You hear a snickering in your head from Amara. <b><i>And how do you know that?</i> Hey, the internet's a wonderful thing... espescially if you dream of getting fucked by a dragon when you grow up. <i>I can see your internet history in your head, you know. I'm not judging. My first sex experience was watching the horses in our barn do it. </i> LUCKY! <i>I know, right!?</i></b> You turn your attention back to Mike. \"When we play, you need to ask us for permission first. You always, always, always ask for permission.\" He nods at you and you notice he is shaking. \"Mommy, may I please have sex with you?\" You smile and shake your head. \"Not yet, Mike.\" Amara takes her sons head in her hands and guides him to looking at her. \"When you have sex, it is important to remember to give as good as you get. If she orgasms, she will be much more likely to want to do it again.\" You interject at that point. \"And remember, foreplay is your friend. Rub her nipples, kiss her, lick her neck, do whatever you can to get her ready. The wetter her pussy gets, the better it will feel for her.\" He nods again at you, practically vibrating as he turns and looks at Amara. \"And you always make sure that if it isn't your mate or your Mommies that you make a deal with her family first. If you feel the pull to your new mate, talk to her father and talk to your father and us. We can make an offer on her dowry. If you really lover her, we will make sure that the price is fair and met. Then when you get her father and mother to consent, you ask her yourself. Tell her you feel the pull to her, that you need her, and ask her if she feels it too. Even if she is too young to marry yet, she will know it and tell you. And if she is too young like I was, you wait for her. Your father almost couldn't wait until I came of age. Had that happened you would have a mother with the body of an eight year old rather than a fourteen year old. In fact, he didn't wait quite long enough, though I pestered him to take me even when I was eight. And no matter how young she is, if she wants you before she comes of age you pay her parents extra and you two can mess around. As long as you are not your natural size you will not complete the mating process. You have the ability to shrink and grow your member as needed. When you get older Mama Kim and I will show you some neat tricks with unique sizes.\" He nods, trying to take in all of that information. I turn his head to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're almost done talking, Mikey. The two final most important things are to treat your mate and any woman you sleep with with the uttmost respect, and to make a ring like your father taught you.\" He cocks his head. \"Why do I need to give the women I sleep with a ring? I mean I kind of get giving my mates rings, but why the other women?\" You smirk at him. \"Because if you are anything like your father, you are a sleep eater. It doesn't matter as much with dragonesses, but human women are bite size and delicious to a grown dragon. Trust me, you'd rather have a woman pissed off that you ate her and safe in your tummy...\" Amara continues my sentance. \"Than wake up to blood and bits of flesh.\" You notice his erection begin to wilt at that image. \"Yeah, no, you are right. I've already lost a few stuffed animals to sleep eating, I'm not loosing a mate or a sleeping partner.\" \"A wise choice, Kido. Your dad lost atleast 10 stuffed bears before he started putting enchanted rings on his inanimate sleeping partners. Seriously, for a while they were on EVERYTHING!\" Mike managed to laugh at that and soon he was full mast again. \"Well, Mike, that's everything for now. Is there anything you want to ask us?\" You give him a sexy smile, begging him to ask for permission. \"Um, as far as foreplay, Jenn and Elly told me that licking a girls privates feels really good. Is that true?\" You look at him shocked, and so does Amara. Apparantly he was paying attention to more than just his hormones. \"Yes, Mike, it does. But you have to do it right. No woman, no matter her species is the same. Ask her what she likes. For example, I really like my clit licked, but don't focus solely on it. The outer lips are sensitive as well, and with your long tounge you can penetrate her farther than any human man could ever dream of licking.\" I pulled his attention to me. \"And I'm a penetration girl. The deeper the better. Oh, and always be honest with your partner, and encourage them to be honest with you. If you don't like what they are doing tell them and let them know what you do like. And always stop if they ask you to. We will practice that today.\" Mike noded before finally asking the question we had been waiting for. He turned to Amara and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama? Can we please have sex?\" She gave him a loving smile and put her hand on his head, kissing him deeply. \"Of course, my Baby Boy.\" He then turns to you. \"Mommy? Can we please hav sex?\" I kiss him passiontalely, slipping my tounge into his mouth. \"We may, My Heart.\" Soon enough we were naked and he was on top of Amara first, showing some pretty decent staying power. His thrusts were slow and considerate until his mother told him to go faster and harder. Soon she was cumming on his cock, molesting my mouth with hers. \"He's so good... So so so so GOOD! Uhn, Baby Boy, harder! I can take it!\" He manages to make his mother cum three more times before shooting deep inside of her. He withdraws from her and flips her over on her back and cuddles with her. \"You like cuddling with Mama, Sweetheart?\" He noded. \"I do. I just need a few minutes before I can go with you, Mommy,\" he says, looking at you. You feel your heart skip a beat as you realize he does see you on the same level with Amara. <b><i>Told you, Kim. He loves you like Snarvar does and like I do. And he knows you as his other Mom.</i> Yeah, you did. I guess I need to work on my self esteem. <i>You need to talk to Snarvar about your father, Kim. He won't go poking around in your head for another few months, and he deserves to know why you have low self esteem.</i> Tonight, after you tell me what's worrying you two about me being Snarvars mate. What is it you are hiding from me? <i>After. Our son is ready for you.</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on that day you finally get Snarvar and Amara to open up to you about what's wrong. It's...</span></div></div>",

Amara grabs your arm and pulls you back out. \"Oh no you don't. That's not going to happen.\" \"It's the best spot to think! Let me go inside of him, please! You can go about your day and I'll be with you thinking about this messed up situation!\" Amy sighs and pulls you close to her, kissing you deeply, making you stop resisting her. \"If you have to hide out, then fine. I'll hide with you. But we are going somewhere more fun. Strip.\" The look in her eyes tells you she is serious you you strip down bare naked besides the ring. You glance at her and notice she has gotten naked too. \"Can we have Access to The Ball, my lord?\" Snarvar nods with a grin on his face and you sigh as his dick grows hard. \"This isn't the time for sex, handsome!\" Then you notice that it has kept growing and growing until it the slit is large as your head. Amy pulls you along and she enters his slit, dragging you with. You travel down a fleshy tunnel until you notice two paths. Amy tuggs your hand and you jump into one of the tunnels together, landing in, what you recognize as Snarvar's seed. Amy kisses you and smiles. \"Nice, huh? This is how I got pregnant! I took a trip directly to the source and bathed in his hot warm seed. Feels good, huh?\" You are suprised to note that it does. It's a bit like a hot tub, only with way less dangerous chemicals. She swims under the surface for a moment and when she emerges she spits semen out of her mouth and you catch it, swallowing it. It tasted delicious, slightly salty but very sweet. \"Now, are you ready to talk?\" You nod, looking her in the eyes. \"You get why I'm scared, right?\" Amy nods vehelmently. \"Oh, hell yes! I was terrified when I found out. I told him to eat me and keep me in his belly, to tell people he ate me so he had no more mate! Then I talked to William. And you know what? He was terrified too. He wanted me, of course, but he didn't want it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run it down for me again? Please?\" She nods and hugs me close. \"Okay. He takes a potion to make himself last for two hours. You take a potion that makes you crave his touch. Snarvar takes a jelousy potion. They chain him up and make him watch William fuck you for two hours or until you cum, which will be hard because the potion dulls your sex. If you truely love William, Snarvar doesn't get jelous. If you don't, you can fake like you do. It'll have the same effect. But if you act like you hate it and only want Snarvar, he breaks the chains and you and he are dead to eachother for a whole decade. Can't talk, can't look at eachother. You'll want to, but you can't. And it will just hurt so bad until you get back into his arms after the decade is up. And if he doesn't break the chains the trauma of being willingly and chemically raped infront of your love will kill you inside. He'll bring you back here and he'll clean you out from Williams inferior seed with his long tounge before the seed can take hold and impregnate you because the potion you both take makes you both super fertile and you will cry so hard into Snarvars arms and wings, wanting to forget. Over the next few months Snarvar will help you glue back the pieces of your mind and life and you will come to forgive William because you realize there is nothing he can do about it and he's a victim in this as well, because if Snarvar breaks the chains he might kill William. William is still looking for his love and he cares for Snarvar and me and I know he will care for you too. And all this because a sick old man wouldn't let Snarvar and his first mate be together, so when they ran away together Old Man Baron Joseph Tiberius Cedric the Third demanded his daughter be returned and Snarvar would have to go through this degrading ritual with a male decendant of his every time he gains a mate, and part of the ritual is that he can't tell us before we become his.\" You sniffed, feeling a tear falling down your cheek. \"Has he ever broken free?\" She shakes her head. \"No. Never. And the old man is dying. As soon as he's dead Snarvar gets his first mate back and our family becomes that much closer to being full. The only one enforcing it is Snarvars father, Trocren. Old bastard actually raped me just after I mated with Snarvar. We hadn't told anyone about it yet. Old Trocren wanted me for himself so he raped me to mate me to him. Snarvar found out and nearly killed him. Thats when Snarvars mother Glenda broke the connection with Trocren. She told me that the ritual was a scam, to have Snarvar talk to the Dragon Council, the governing body. But Trocren threatened to kill me if he did, and Snarvar didn't want that on his hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if Trocren couldn't find us? Snarvar is supposed to mate with Fraria today. What if we were inside of her while Snarvar is talking to the dragon Council? We would be save with her and Snarvar could find out why the ritual is a scam.\" Amy nods at that. \"I think that could work. Snarvar can't quite hear us in here, so when we get let out it will probably be inside of her anyway. I really like her.\" You blush at that. \"I really like her too. Maybe she can introduce you more formally to John?\" It is Amys turn to blush and you begin to smile. <b>He would really like you, Amy. Snarvar already said I could court and marry John. Maybe he'll allow you to do the same if you hit it off? <i>Maybe. I'm certainly not ruling it out. He did help you guys to save me.</i> <u>Are you calm, my love?</u> Yes, Sexy. I'm calm. I just needed the girltalk. Are you mating with Fraria? <u>We just started the nuptial flight. You will both be inside of her soon, if that is alright.</u></b> you and Amara giggle at that. <b><i>We are, Lover.</i></b> Soon the two of you find yourselves being forced back through his cock and you land in a soft and squishy environment.</span></div></div>",

I needed to have a talk and think things through after Snarvar and Amy dropped a bombshell on me.</b> You felt understanding rush through the link as Fraria started to put the pieces together. <i><u>Let me guess, that stupid ritual Snarlys stupid father makes him do because the head of the Cedric line is a dragon hater?</u></i> You feel a renewed sense of dread at the mention of it, which lessens only slightly as soon as Amy pulls you to her and kisses you. <b><i>For the Goddess' Sake, Fraria, I JUST got her calmed down about it. It's okay my Love. He won't break the chains. I promise.</i></b> Embarassment floods through the link. <i><u>I'm sorry. For what it's worth, I've seen him do it. I was there when he was required to do it for both his hidden mate, William's grandmother that is, and Amara. Snarvar, even a jelous Snarvar, is too good hearted and focused on your saftey to lose his cool.</u></i> You still can't shake the doubt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>But what if I'm the first? I can't spend an hour away from Snarvar. To be dead to him for ten years? I would die! I wouldn't be able to live with him, and to not hear his voice, to not feel his touch? I'm so afraid I would hurt myself on purpose just to try to break the spell! And it wouldn't matter to me because he is my love! Snarvar, I can't do it! Amara and Snarvar and John and Fraria are the names etched into my heart now! <i>Shh! Shh! It's okay! It's okay. I promise it is okay. And if it comes to it I will do everything I possibly can to break the curse. It's not right or fair to expect that you would be okay with this. But until we can talk to the Dragon council we have to face facts that this is the way things are. Believe me, I felt the exact same way. But no matter what happens, I will still be with you, okay?</i> <u>This is why I want my father gone. Even the Baron has forgotten about this debt by now. I can't put you through this, Kim. I can't put any mate through this ever again and I'm sorry that you went through it, Amy. We'll hide you both while I speak with the dragon council.</u></b> you try to compose yourself and Amy lovingly strokes your back. It gives you no small comfort to know that she has been exactly where you are. You lightly kiss her and finally you feel ready to talk calmly and reasonably. <b>Thank you all. When we get out of Fraria, I need to tell you all something important. It... might explain why I act so passionate about this.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two of you are out of Fraria and have bathed you sit down on Snarvars bed between him and Amara. John and Fraria are standing in front of the bed, but you tell them you think they should sit down. You notice John ogling you and Amy, as both of you have elected to wait to get dressed until this is over. You clear your throat and he looks up at your eyes, an apologetic look on his face. Snarvar grabs your left hand in his massive clawed hand and Amy grabs your right hand, both feeling your apprehension at talking about this. \"So, John already knows part of this story. My issues go really far back, to when I was little. At five years old I knew that my father was a drunk. He used to stumble into the house late at night and I think he may have hit my Mom alot.\" John shook his head, remembering my mothers near constand black eyes and the stupid excuses. Fraria, Snarvar and Amy all had wide eyes. Amy had seen this in my head, but she was still shocked that it had happened. \"So, when I turned 9, on my birthday he stumbled into my room drunk as could be, slurring about giving me my \"birthday gift\". And he took off his pants and made me open my mouth.\" John looked alarmed at this, not realizing that it had been quite this bad. Everyone else looked ill at what I was saying. \"After he was done I felt really violated. I couldn't sleep, I didn't come down for my party or dinner, and I just stayed in my room and cried. My Mom came up into my room and asked me what was wrong so I told her. She became so angry and I was afraid she was angry at me. When she stormed out of the room I cried again, bawling my eyes out, thinking I wasn't lovable until she came back into the room with the neighbor, who was a police officer, kind of like the night watchmen you have. He took a look around my room and asked me to open my mouth. I refused until my mother got me a piece of birthday cake and assured me that nobody was going to put their \"thingy\" into my mouth again. I opened up and he took a piece of cotton to swab my mouth and sure enough he found semen. He also found cameras in my stuffed animals. Cameras are these little things that record images or events, and he found more in the toilet and the shower. The police searched my fathers computer and found thousands of images of me that he had been selling online in the shower, using the toilet, or getting dressed. They took him to prison for a very long time, where the other prisoners found out what he did and killed him.\" I hang my head in shame at telling my story. Then I feel someones hands around my waist, then another pair of hands around my shoulders, then two pairs of wings covering us, and two tails curling around my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up to see everyone crying silently, holding me. \"I'm so sorry that happened, Kim...\" Amy's words were wrought with anger and pain, and they were echoed by everyone else. I concentrated and tried to send happy thoughts to everybody. To my suprise it worked and the tears were wiped away. \"I don't tell you that out of wanting you to feel bad for me, guys! I told you because you needed to know why I am so passionate about our love. I know what it's like to have someone hurt you, so I grab on to any chance for love. Come on, please cheer up? It's taken me a long time, but I am fine.\" They finally let you go and dry their eyes. \"Come on Amy, we need to get dressed,\" you say, leading her towards the clothes curtain. \"Your oldest is due here any second and I for one can't wait to see how she reacts to seeing you!\" That manages to get a smile from her and the two of you put on some nice dresses and overshirts. \"Hey, remind me to introduce this world to casual wear. I don't want heat stroke!\" She manages to giggle at that one and you pull her to you. \"There's the lovely laugh. Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to cheer up your family and you all make your way down for Dinner. You sit on Snarvars left and Amy sits on Snarvars right. The meal goes by smoothly until Mike begins to attempt to flirt with the server women. You and Amy both shoot him daggers and he stops, but not before licking his lips in a poor attempt at seduction with Jenn. She growls at him and he stops immediately. He looks to you for help and you shake your head. You stand up begin walking over to him, Amy following close behind. \"Come with us, you three,\" you state firmly, leaving no room for debate. The three young dragons follow you into the empty war room. Amy folds her arms. \"Mike, first off, no. The servents in the castle have been trained not to say no to you, but that's really not an excuse. It's still not acceptable and it is an abuse of power. If Kim or I ever catch you having sex with them you will be in very big trouble.\" He lowers his head slightly, maintaining eye contact with you two. \"Like no dessert trouble or...?\" You roll your eyes. \"No, like no more of our lessons for a month trouble.\" He looks down at the ground. You put your hand on his head, making him look at you. \"Hey, neither of us want to do that, okay? We want to teach you. We want you to grow to be like your father and we enjoy the sex. The choice is yours, okay Sweetie?\" He smiles at that. \"Yeah. Okay.\" \"Secondly, we hear you two have been biting your brother.\" Jenn responds first. \"When he tries to fuck us!\" \"A week ago he tried to mount me in flight! I had to bite him,\" Emilly added. You sighed at that and Mike looked down in shame. \"Have you ever just told him no?\" The two of them looked rather sheepish at that. \"No...\" they both said in unison. Amy smiled at her girls. \"Look, we are working on making him into a gentledrake. He now knows that he needs to always ask first. And when he does ask, you need to answer him. With <b>words</b> You may not like it, but we are the closest females he has around. All of us need to work together to teach him how to be like his father, polite and well mannered. Okay?\" \"Okay, Mom.\" \"Sorry Mike.\" You get an idea and share it with Amy through the link. She smirks and nods and you pull mike in close and whisper in his ear. He nods and you pull back. \"Now Mike, is there anything you want to say?\" He looks at his sisters and smiles. \"Emilly, Jenn, do you want to have sex?\" Emilly rolls her eyes and says \"No!\" Jenn bites her lower lip and looks her brother up and down. \"Not today, Mike.\" He turns to the two of you and looks hopeful. \"Mom, Mother, do you want to have sex?\" You and Amy confir for a moment before responding. \"Sorry Mike, but we have other plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five of you return to the main hall to see</span></div></div>",

She is slightly taller than her siblings. When she notices the two of you she makes her way over. She looks at Amy with shining eyes and looks like she may cry at any second. \"M-Mommy?\" Amy smiles at her, her lip quivering slightly. \"Yes, Keira. It's me. I'm back for good, I promise.\" The young dragoness breaks down and Keira pulls her close to her. \"That's it, sweetie. Let it out. Let it all out.\" She smiles and tears pour down her cheeks when Keira finally breaks the hug. \"I missed you so much, Mom. I needed you but... You were taken from us...\" \"I know, Sweetheart, I know. But never again. I got promised that by the Goddess Herself.\" Keira clears her throat and looks at you, getting close to you. \"You are Kim, right? My Daddies mate?\" You nod, trying to keep the damn from breaking. \"You are the one he fell in love with from another world. I want you to know that as my fathers mate I consider you my Mother as well. Promise you will take good care of them?\" A smile breaks loose on your face. \"I promise, Keira. I will always take good care of them.\" Kiera smiles at you. \"Good. Then I approve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you are preparing for bed together, you and Amara stripping down.

NOOOO!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up with a start, screaming. Suddenly you have arms wrapped around you and Amara is calming you down. You notice that you are in Snarvars stomach. You slept right through him eating you, and from the amount of liquid still dribbling from your cunt, he fucked you as well. \"It's Okay. It's okay. Just a nightmare. Everything is alright. Want to talk about it?\" You can't stop from shaking like a leaf as your brain tries to process itself. \"I had a dream... John got impaled on a sword and died in my arms. I have to mate with him, Amara. I need to. My brain is saying I'll lose him if I don't.\" She puts her hand on your cheek. \"I'm going to court him before I decide. If you have to mate this soon then Snarvar and I will understand, but you are welcome to court him with me if you decide to wait. Maybe your brain just doesn't want him around and not dating you.\" You think for a moment. \"I'll date him with you. He's changed too much since I knew him. The whole killing for money thing just doesn't sit right with me.\" She nods at that. \"I get that. You knew him in a more peacful time in his life. You want to learn if he's the same man underneath.\" You kiss her lips tenderly. \"How do you do this to  me? You calm me down, you comfort me, you make me need you and you make me want to be better for you... I always preffered guys before. But now you are my girlfriend. I want to marry you and Snarvar. How do you two make me so... Complete?\" You hear her giggle at that. \"Because we were meant to be together. The three of us fit so well with eachother. And Snarvar and I will always be there to comfort you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou setle back into Snarvar's stomach, holding Amara tightly to you, her holding you as well. Something big is bothering you. \"Amara?\" She looks up at you with her beautiful blue eyes. \"Hmm?\" \"Did you have your ring on when you...\" \"Died? Yeah. Let me guess, Snarvar told you it was that the dragon babies were too big, right?\" \"Yeah.\" \"I need to set him straight. That would not ever have happened while the ring was on. There's only one thing the rings can't protect from, and thats black dragon venom. Someone poisoned me to make it look like my babies were too big.\" You look at her in your arms and now she is shaking. \"Hey, Amara, no, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought it up.\" \"I want to talk about it. There's really only one who could have done it. Trocren is a black dragon and he probably intentionally poisoned me when he raped me. My system just got used to it until the stress of childbirth when it finally kicked in. That's why Snarvar doesn't want me to tell you this, but he is going to fight Trocren for his mother tomorrow after the meeting with the Dragon Council and he is going to give her a number of antidotes. Then she is coming back with him.\" \"Why doesn't he want me to know that? Doesn't he trust me?\" \"He does. He just doesn't want you to see him as a monster when he kills Trocren.\" \"Well he should have more faith in me than that. He's my mate. I'm his. I want to marry him and you and Fraria and probably even Glenda when I meet her. I love him and he should trust me more. Like he trusts you. And that hurts that he doesn't\" You suddenly hear a booming voice around you, filled with shame. \"I'm sorry, Kim. You are right. I need more faith in you. I should have told you.\" Despite yourself you smile and Amara shares your smile. \"Hey, as long as you realize I'm not going anywhere no matter who you have to kill and for what noble reason, I forgive you.\" You feel the stomach shake with a small chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, my love. And I already knew, Amara. I just didn't want to accept that he was that cruel.\" \"So that's another lie you told me then?\" You feel Snarvar freeze and sieze up for a moment. \"If you look at it that way, I suppose. Without the ring on, dragonbirth could kill you. Like childbirth could. But it was a lie I also told myself. I just didn't want to believe that my mother, who had raised me better than my father ever could, could have had anything to do with a murderer. And I didn't want to admit that I should have caught that Trocren poisoned you and given you antidotes right away.\" Amara looked at the flesh above her angrily. \"Don't you dare put that on yourself. You had no way of knowing. Besides, I'm back now. And he won't touch me or Kim ever again.\" \"I'm sorry darling. I'm just so used to blaming myself.\" \"Well don't. Blame that old bastard, never yourself. I love you, you stupid dragon, and I will never blame you for my death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any more things you want to correct that you may have lied about?\" \"No, my love. I'm sorry.\" \"Promise me you won't ever lie to me again and that you will tell me as much as you tell Amara and you are forgiven.\" \"I promise to never lie to you or Amara ever again and I promise to not keep secrets from you or Amara and to tell you both everything.\" \"Good. I forgive you.\" Amara smirks at you. \"I don't know, I think I may need to get fucked silly in the morning before I forgive you, Snarvar!\" \"Mmmm. Any time you wish it, my Bride.\" You look at her with longing. \"How long until you make me your wife, Snarvar?\" He thinks about it for a second. \"Whenever you wish I suppose. I hope soon for both of our sakes. I can't wait to make love to you on our wedding night.\" \"And I can't wait to watch,\" Amara chimed in. The smile on her face was genuine. You think for a moment. \"How about in a month? Gives us time to send invitations out. I could invite my- oh. Oh no. No, I can't invite my Mom.\" You know they feel your sadness through their link so you do your best to cheer yourself up. The sudden sweet hug from Amara helps immensely. \"Thank you Amara. A month from today. Does that work for you two?\" \"Yes. And just to be clear, you will be marrying the both of us, not just me.\" You kiss Amara at that. <b>I know, my Dragon.

But Amara reminds me of the word 'amore', which means love. And in tender moments I want to find my own way of calling you 'my love'.\" \"Is it part of your culture?\" \"Yes. My grandparents on my mothers side taught me Italian. They moved from Italy to the United States of America, where I was born, when my mother was still inside my grandmothers womb. They were always a big part of my life and the taught me so much about Italy and 'la mia famiglia', or 'my family'.\" \"How do you say 'My Love'?\" \"Amore Mia.\" Her eyes brighten at that and you watch as a shiver runs down her spine. \"Call me that again, Lover...\" \"Amore Mia.\" \"Please, call me whatever you want, but call me that before we sleep at night. It sounds so romantic.\" You grin at her. \"Of course, Amy. Se la mia anima gemella! Voglio passare il resto della mia vita con te e il nostra Drago!\" She looks very aroused and she pulls your hand to her cunt. You can feel how wet you have gotten her. \"What did you just say?\" \"I said 'You are my soul Mate! I want to spend the rest of my life with you and our Dragon!\" She leans in and kisses you passionately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the stomach shifts and you feel the two of you being pulled back up out of Snarvar. You and Amara giggle at Snarvar, who looks down at the two of you with lust. \"I could hear you two being adorably sweet to each other. It turned me on so much. What should we do about this?\" The two of you giggle louder and you look down to see his drakehood fully exposed and throbbing. Amy looks at you. \"You didn't get to be awake when Snarvar fucked you last night. Do you want to go first?\" You look into her eyes and see the pleading. She really wants to watch you two. Something you would have to ask about later. \"If you don't mind, Amore Mia.\" She nods and Snarvar moves to kiss you. You kiss him back, feeling his throbbing member pulsing at your entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break the kiss accidentaly as he thrust in, searching for his lips again as you moan for him. Snarvar grins and puts his lips back on yours and you put your tounge in his mouth in a lewd french kiss. He puts a small portion of his tounge in yours as well and you two start a steady rythem. You lift up as he pulls out until his tip is left inside and you thrust back as he pushes into you. It doesn't take you long to start cumming on his cock and he groans and pulls back from the kiss, his full tongue hanging from his mouth as he lifts his head up and moans at the tightening. You wish you had a camera so you could always see him like this, but considering how long the three of you were expected to live you realize that you will probably see him like this a lot in your very long life. He licks your chest and begins to play with your nipples with his tongue. You gasp and pant as you realize he isn't letting you come down from your orgasm, making it build up to another and another without stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach a point were the pleasure blends together and you begin begging him to cum inside of you. \"Snarvar! Please! Uhn! Ah! Uhn! Goddess Above! Cum in me! I need it! Uhn! Oh!\" You look over at Amara who looks like she is in pure bliss watching the two of you, fingers burried in her pussy and her left hand groping her breast. Snarvar sees what you are looking at and it sends him over he edge. His seed floods into you and he lets out a mighty primal roar as he climaxes deep inside of you. His seed is so hot you feel yourself cumming agian. As the two of you come down he looks into your eyes and you place your hand on his cheekbone. You come to a decision. \"Mettermia incinta.\" Amara and Snarvar look at each other before looking at you, Snarvar looks in your mind and finds the translation, looking at you sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" You gaze at him, determined. \"Yes.\" Amara looks confused. \"Wait, what did you say?\" \"I said 'impregnate me'.\" Amaras eyes widen and she moves close to look deep into your eyes. \"Snarvar, she really wants this.\" \"Not yet. We haven't known each other long enough.\" You glare up at him at that and take your hand off of his face. \"You mean you're too afraid you'll lose me.\" Amara looks up at him. \"We won't lose her. You'll end Trocren and you'll be able to have babies with us with no fear.\" \"I said no.\" You tear up at this. You really want his children inside of you. Snarvar won't look at you. You know he is afraid and getting angry at him won't help. \"Snarvar, are we your slaves?\" Kims eyes widen at that and she just stares at you. \"How could you think that, Kim? He loves us!\" \"Answer me, Snarvar. Then we can get back to the fun together. Are we your slaves?\" He finally looks and you and you see the pain in his gaze. \"No, you are not.\" \"What are we?\" \"...My mates. And my family.\" \"And we are here for you, right?\" He nods. You decide to continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy said it herself, the babies were not the cause of it. It was your fathers poison. And if you can get him to admit it you can legally kill him when you fight for your beloved Mother. And he won't ever be able to do that to any of us again. We are yours to have and to hold, not to be ordered around. I love you so deeply and I want to have your children as soon as possible. Yes, I know it's five long years of pregnancy, but I want it.\" He nods at that. \"I know that, Kimberly. I really do. I just don't want you rushing into this. You're 15. Childrearing is hard work. The reason Amara and I waited so long is because she wanted to make sure she was mature enough to be a mother.\" \"He's right, Kim. I forced myself to wait. I may still look 14, but I am 59 years old chronologically, and 49 intellectually. I waited until I was 38 because I needed to be sure that I was ready, that I was willing to give up 10-15 years of my life to raising my babies. And then there is the fact that my body wasn't ready. We tried for children every month for nearly 6 years until I finally got pregnant. To be honest, the day I met him I wanted his children, and I was 8 at the time. We had sex within the first week of meeting eachother, my mother bringing me up to the castle. By the time I turned 9 I didn't want to leave and my mother had to talk my father into letting me stay here permanently. The extra 10,000 coins of gold annually from Snarvar helped make that decision. And a month after that I began having my periods. Snarvar would lick his seed out of me with me yelling at him to just let it take. But he didn't. At one point I told him I was never going to have sex with him again if he didn't let me get pregnant. That lasted for a whole five minutes before he was inside of me again and I was moaning loud enough to wake the castle. That's when I realized he was doing it for my benefit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar interupts her for a moment. \"To be clear, I wanted to, but that would have completed the mating ritual even without my penis at full size. She would have been stuck in the body of a nine year old forever. Not to mention the shame on her if my subjects found out we were having sex that early on. We don't have that stigma in Dragon culture, but we do understand it. When we go to the Mass Den today after my father is dead you may very well see women who look as young as 5 years of age mating with their dragons, as no unmated human may enter the Mass Den.\" You find yourself oddly turned on by that thought. <b>God I'm messed up. I have some odd kinks.</b> Snarvar and Amara laugh at that. <b><i>We love you, kinks and all. Look, all we are saying is that we want you to have Snarvars babies. But you need to take a look deep in your heart. We will look with you, if you want. If you are truely ready to have Snarvar impregnate you, we will make sure it happens. Hell, we can even take another trip inside of Snarvars testies if you wish, and make sure you get pregnant. That's what finally worked for me.</i> <u>But if you aren't, it isn't a big deal. We can literally take a look into your mind at any time at all. We can do it on the days you are fertile and if you truely aren't ready you get to feel my big tounge inside of you after sex on those days.</u></b> You look at them and you feel their undying love for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Okay. I'm good with that. How do we do this? I want you guys looking with me. <u>That's the fun part. We must all be having sex. Get on your back with your legs out Kimberly. Amara, between her legs eating her out with your cute little ass in the air.</u> <i>My pleasure!</i></b> The two of you assume your positions and you moan as Amara begins lapping up Snarvars seed as it leaks from you. She nearly belts out a moan as Snarvar takes her from behind. The two of them look so beautiful together and you hear Snarvars voice in your head. <b><u>When we all cum, we will join minds and be able to look deeply into yours, Kim.</u></b> Soon the three of you are lost in rapture together and you can feel yourself getting very close. You look at kim thinking if she's close too and she reads the thought and nods. Snarvar does the same thing. Then the three of you cum together and are able to read everything about everyones minds all at once. The three of you concentrate on your mind and look deeply, finding the answer to if you are truely ready to become pregnant. You all find that...</span></div></div>",

But I guess I'm not quite ready for pregnancy yet.\" You sigh again and rub your eyes. The two of them look sad for you and Snarvar wraps his tail around you. You just look at him, not angry or sad or anything, just really taking a look. He has little flecks of green in his eyes that you hadn't noticed until then. \"I get it. I'm not ready because we don't truely know each other. Not yet, anyways. I think I want you guys to date me. We can always fuck afterwords.\" \"I'd like that, Kim. We need to get to know each other.\" Amara leans in and kisses his cheek, then yours. \"I want that too. It's not that I think you have changed, Snarvar, its just that we haven't been on a date in forever.\" Snarvar nods his head. \"I agree. It has been too long.\" Snarvar begins to get up before looking back at the two of you. \"Would you two please be willing to stay here? I know you wish to support me, and the issue with the Council affects all of us, but I would feel much safer knowing you two are nowhere near my father.\" You and Amara look at each other. Neither of you had thought of it that way. You both look up in Snarvars eyes and nod. Amara grins for a moment. \"Under one condition...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Amara are sitting outside in complementing green and blue dresses, waiting for your meals. The bar inside of the building also served food and you had to admit, everything smelled delicious. \"All that I am saying is that a little bit of tech would go a long way. You said you saw me in the other place. Even the simple stuff, like water purifiers and refrigerators.\" Amara laughs at that last item. \"How is a refrigerator simple? All of that wiring and the built in airconditioning! I get what you mean, but I think you should stick with introducing Snarvar to Pizza first.\" You giggle. \"We are never going to be able to get enough cheeze for a pizza that satisfies him. At least let me introduce people to bras. These corsets are killer!\" Amara nods at that. \"That we can agree on. Okay, bras and water purifiers. But thats it for now. Too much at once and we are likely to overload people.\" \"Deal!\" The two of you get your food and start to make your way back to te castle after paying \"Kim, I want you to know, I'm really glad to hear you want to help people. Everyone needs us to do our best to represent and take care of them.\" You blush slightly. \"I just don't want to see them suffering. Besides, this much alchohol all the time is pretty bad. Clean water is a right, not a privolege.\" Amara nods. The two of you suddenly hear Snarvars voice updating you about the Councils decison.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You could not believe what you heard from Snarvars head. You were in absolute shock and didn't know what to say. <b><u>The council banned this ritual as a punishment over 10,000 years ago. They have sentenced my father to death and my mother told them that he confessed to poisoning you, Amara. They also offered their condolances over your passing and hope you have a longer life this time. I'm bringing my mother home, I will see you both in a few hours. I love you, my Mates.</u></b> Amara looks over at you, a huge grin plastered on your face. You can't believe the news you have just heard. \"I really don't have to go through it?\" Amara grabs your hands. \"No, Kimberly. You don't. Come on, let's grab the children and tell them the good news!\" A smile forms on your face as the two of you sprint to the castle, catching the children playing together outside. They all land by you when they see you, although you and Amara notice that Mike seems to be having some trouble focusing on your mouths when you talk and not your breasts. You tell them the good news and everyone but Mike begins celebrating. \"Wait, you would have had to mate with Lord Cedric?\" You and Amara shake your heads no. \"Not mate, sweet boy. That implies love.\" \"And even if I loved him and wanted to mate with him, I would have been forced to do it against my natural will. It would have all been chemicals.\" All of the children look shocked at that. Kiera spoke with horror in her voice. \"So you would have been raped?\" Amara nods, looking somberly. \"Yes, she would have. And William would have too. Don't forget that all parties are forced into this. I still have nightmares about that day.\" The children all look at their mother like they are about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had to go through this, Momma?\" Jenn asks, looking at her mother with watery eyes while Mike and Keira move close to wrap their tails and wings around the two of you. You notice that Mike has rested his head on your shoulder and tears are rolling down his face for you and his Mother. You pat his left cheek and kiss his right one. Amara nods somberly. \"I did. And Baron Cedric played an awful trick, but it didn't work. Your eyes widen as you realize she hasn't told you this. \"Amore Mia, what did he do to you?\" Amara looks into your eyes as Mike holds you even closer, feeling your fears for his mother and you notice Keira is doing the same for Amara. \"The ritual has a stipulation that no matter what, it can't exceed a day long. After twenty four consectutive hours most dragons will break the chains no matter how in love the couple being forced to have sex are and all of the spells will be broken, including the effect that makes the dragon and mate ignore each other. They will still be a family, but it takes years to rebuild the mates mind after being raped for that long.\" She pauses for a minute to clear a lump in her throat and you move to kiss her, giving her a slight confidence boost. \"Amore, he didn't...\" Amara looks in your eyes as you feel the tears start to flow. \"Baron Cedric gave us all concentrated potions that forced us going for a week straight. And Snarvar proved to me that he loved me so much that he endured right until the very end. I was crying so much and Cedric was as well. Snarvar was furious and when the attendants and witnesses finally took the chains off of him he mauled the Baron. Cost him the use of his legs and his right eye. Snarvars first mate stopped him from killing the Baron and she helped Snarvar nurse both me and William back to health. We were dehydrated, malnurished, William was on deaths door for a while. The Baron was furious when his daughter came to live with us. It took me three years to recover mentally and your father was so sweet. He went a year and a half without mating with me because I was terrified to be touched like that. He carried me wherever we went, and he kisse me often and told me he loved me, even in public and during business. And Terra stayed with us for twenty years. She was even there when I got pregnant with you, my babies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunty Terra?\" She's Daddy's first mate? Why doesn't she still live with us?\" Elly's questions are punctuated with sniffs, and you can see the tears on her face. You hold your arms out to her and she scrambles over to join you and Mike, taking a note from him and Keira and wrapping her wings and tail around your middle while she rests her crying head on your chest. Your arms wrap around her as you see Jenn do the same with Amara and Keira. \"Because the Baron is a cruel man. Your Daddy had taken William and Terra back here because Terra had long been promised that if the Baron interfered with the rituals she would live with Snarvar. The Baron knew he had no hold on her, not after forcing her and Snarvar to go through the ritual. But he went back on his word. He claimed to be Ruling Party in Williams absense and threatened all out war if William and Terra didn't return. William returned and overthrew his grandfather, but the Baron just sent a group of his last remaining supporters to attack us. Snarvar was willing to kill all of them to keep us safe, but Terra... She knew it wouldn't end. She told Snarvar that she and William would work on creating a new law to combat this unfairness and that she would return to him as soon as either that law was passed or her father was dead. It's been 15 years and I had hoped that maybe she had succeeded when I returned to life, but... No. Not yet.\" Mike suddenly growls and you jump, terrified for a moment. When he realises he scared you he puts his head back on your shoulder and you notice something feels different. You look at him and then look down seeing huge burnt holes in your clothing where the childrens heads were. His sisters head is resting on your bare c cup breasts and you look at them wondering how they managed to tear your clothes. Amara sees your puzzled look and smirks, and you feel her mood through your link instantly improve. \"Dragon tears are caustic to non living things like cloth. Some stones and metal don't even stand a chance. It's okay, Snarvar actually decreed a long time ago that nudity is not only allowed in our kingdom, it is approved of. The subjects just don't want to offend visitors. If they know you are new they will get dressed so you are comfortable.\" You think back to earlier today. Suddenly the naked children playing outside made more sense to you now. \"Can we see your body, Mama Kim?\" You are shocked to hear Elly ask that question. If anyone would have you would have expected Mike to ask. Mike and Elly unwrap from you and you give Elly a kiss on the cheek. \"Alright, Elly. Help me with this corset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElly smiles and does as she is told, unlacing it and pealing it from your body. You sigh as you can breath again and notice the wetness forming between Ellys legs. Mike looks at you, licking his lips and growing hard. \"You to, Mama Amy?\" Keira licks her mothers face as she asks, unwraping from her mother as Jenn follows her actions. Amara laughs, exposing her perky B cup breasts on her small figure. Your breathe catches and you swear that she looks gorgeous. \"Snarvar mated with you at the right time, Amy. He sopped your aging just as you hit your peak of beauty.\" She blushes as the two of you continue to strip. \"Coming from you, I take that as the highest compiments. I love your curves. Swelling in just the right places.\" You giggle at her compliment. The two of you make it a game to see who can turn the children on more. Neither of you can tell who won, but judging by the way Jenn was looking at you like you were a fresh juicey stake and Keira couldn't take her eyes off of her mothers lower lips, there were no losers. Elly spoke up. \"Mammas, Mike told us about your lessons. Can we join you from now on? The rest of us want to learn what we can from you too. Curl your finger at Jenn and she comes in close. You kiss her lips and hear her moan softly. \"I'm okay with that. You, Amy?\" \"Sounds fun to me!\" The four of you are interupted from going further by Snarvars voice in yours and Amaras heads again. <b><u>We are going to be later than I thought, my Darlings. There is a village being attacked below us and we are going to help them.</u> <i>Stay safe, Lover.</i> Kick their asses, Tressaro.</b> You grin at the children. \"Well, your father is going to be even later. Did you wish for a lesson now?\" You giggle as Amara pours a ton of lust into her question, knowing that look in her eyes. Suddenly though, you hear a voice behind you. \"I would wait a moment if I were you.\" You turn around to see...</span></div></div>",

Long blond hair, large, full and perky D-cup breasts, toned, a slight hint of definition to her arms and legs, and a full hourglass figure. She had to be about 19, and you can tell that she took great pride in her body. Plus, thoes ocean blue eyes were absolutely breath taking. You feel absolutely drawn to her, and are snapped out of your thoughts when Amara runs up to kiss her. \"Terra! Is the Baron...?\" Terra smiles a radiant smile. \"Yes, Am. He is. I can finally be with you and Snarvar!\" You suddenly feel self concious naked in the field by the castle. Terra looked better than you, she DESERVED to flaunt her body. You shyly cover your breasts and mound. \"Who's this? She seems cute.\" Amara turns to smile at you, but her smile faulters when she sees you covering up. \"Kim. Our newest mate. And someone who should be proud in her own skin!\" She says that last part louder and you get the message and reluctantly drop your arms. Amara grabs your hand and drags you to Terra, who you smile shyly at, staring into her beautiful eyes. \"I think you're gorgeous, Kim. And I can't wait to get to know you better. You feel her eyes on you and you decide to be bold. You lean into the taller woman, raising your head. Terra gets the message and kisses you. Hard and passionate. She even manages to slip her tounge in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the kiss deepens you feel her lift you off of the ground and she slowly starts to dip you. You are taken aback by her sheer eroticism that you just let it happen. She breaks the kiss and lies you down in the grass, nibbling at your neck and leaving a hickey. You melt in her touch and hear a squeak when Terra pulls Amara down with you. You start to lift up to get access to her lips again, but she pushes you back down. Amara latches on to one of your nipples while Terra places her mouth just outside of your slit. You giggle at her warm breath, soon turning into moans as she attacks your poor little clit with her tounge. She lavishes it and kisses it and Amara is doing the same to your nipples, switching back and forth between them. Soon all thought leaves your mind as you cum, orgasming harder than you thought possible for someone without a dragon's tounge. You lie back and recover before hearing a squeal. You look up and behind you as you see Mike mounted on Keira thrusting away. She was obviously enjoying it, her expression mirroring her fathers earlier with her entire tounge hanging out of her mouth. You and Amara sigh. \"Michael...\" \"He... Asked... First... Ma... Ma...\" Keira explained between gasps and moans. You hear a new voice in your head. <span class=\"cppink\"><b>Looks like our babies enjoyed the show! I am very glad to meet you, Kim.</b></span> <b>Likewise, Terra. Amore Mia, you didn't tell me she was so... fucking hot! <i>That she is. I'm so glad to have you back, Terra. Our family didn't feel the same without you.</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire family catches up and you have to admit, you feel absolutely at peace. Then you see Snarvar in the distance. He makes his way to you all and lands. He has with him...</span></div></div>",

I'm so happy to see you again!\" Amara hugs back, smiling. \"It's okay, Glenda. I won't leave any of you again!\" Glenda releases Amara and looks to you. You take in her body and feel slightly self concious again, but you push it aside. Snarvar stopped your age at 15 because he loves the way you look. And you can see some similarites between you and his mother, the red hair, green eyes and C cup breasts, even if hers are a bit larger than yours. But you also see such long toned legs and luscious plump lips and you can see why Snarvar was so into his Mother. \"You must be Kim. Snarvar told me that you are the last of his mates.\" You look at him, shocked. \"I'm... the last? No more after me?\" Snarvar shakes his head. \"There is no reason to take any more. Unless something awful happens, Goddess Forbid it, you are the last one.\" \"But what about Glenda?\" Glenda laughs at that. \"Snarvar and I have been mated since before Amara got pregnant. I couldn't stand my husband and forcibly broke our connection, then I mated with Snarvar. Our family is completed, and we can focus on loving each other.\" You looked between them all and happy tears leaked from your eyes as you beamed at them. \"I'm so glad to be part of your family!\" Then Snarvar noticed Terra. \"Terra... he's dead then?\" \"Yes, my love.\" \"You will stay with us?\" \"Of course, Love! I will always be there for you and our family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five of you moved back inside and the children decided to continue playing. The bonding sex to secure your bond to all of your mates was... incredible to say the least, and Snarvar had given his mother and rings with stones matching their eyes. The family was full and you feel like you are in heaven. \"Hey Snarvar?\" \"Hm?\" \"Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm glad you kidnapped me.\" Glenda and Terras eyes widdened. \"You.\" \"Did.\" \"WHAT?!\" The two of them look furiously at Snarvar as he sputtered and you and Amara try to explain. \"No no, wait, Terra, Glenda, hear us out. I went searching through other worlds looking for the person Snarvar needed most in his life. Niether of you were able to be there for him and it looked like he was a week away from crawling in the grave with me.\" \"She found me and she told the forrest who I was, showed them what kind of a person I was, and how to get to me so we would become mates.\" \"I instructed the forrests protectors on how to contact Snarvar and what to say. They gave him a crystal that they enchanted that transported him to Kim's world.\" \"But he could only be there for a minute and rather than risk losing me and risking heartache he pulled me through immedeately. He saved me from my world and I was terrified. He saved me from what I might have done. I owe him my life. And he promised to take me back in 30 years if I wasn't happy. But I won't ever be unhappy because I love all of you and I found my place here.\" Terra and Glendas gazes soften slightly, but they still looked unhappy. \"Snarvy, isn't that how you got in trouble with my father in the first place? We ran off together. I mean, yeah, he was being stubborn and no amount of gold or jewels was going to change his mind, but technically you did kidnap me even though I went willingly. Why didn't you say something to her?\" Snarvar looks down in shame. \"I didn't have time. And if I didn't take and tried to talk with her instead she might not have come back with me.\" You put your hand on Snarvars. \"You did the right thing, Draggie.\" You turn and look at Glenda and Terra. \"Please don't make a big deal out of this. I wouldn't have come and I would have been misserable for the rest of my short life.\" Terra looks you in the eyes and sees the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say 'short life'? Were you that hurt?\" You nod. \"I was. My boyfriend John got brought to this world through some freak happenstance. But everyone thought he was dead, even me. We were really close and it was the third year anniversary of when I thought he had died. I went up to the mountains and... I was really strongly considering throwing myself over the cliff when Snarvar appeared. He gave me purpose to move on. And then, a couple of days ago I found John again. And I feel ashamed that I wasn't strong before.\" Glenda puts her hand on your knee as Terra kisses you. \"It's okay now though, right Kim?\" You nod. \"I have a family now, who loves me and whom I love. I couldn't be any happier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five of you get bathed and dressed, talking about the possibility of having official jobs and titles. \"So let me get this straight: You can give us jobs that hide us inside of you like being your meal or being in your testies that prevent people from courting us if you object to them?\" Snarvar grins widely. \"That's why we are seeing the Governers and Aristocrates tonight. To finalize your titles.\" \"And the titles have to be both descriptive and succinct, but can't be told to the subjects or the visiting dignitaries?\" \"Correct.\" You look over at Amara. \"And Amara is technically 'Lady Amara, Royal Breakfast to Her Lord, Royal Seed Ingrediant and Reciever, and Royal Sexual and Carnivorous Stress Relief to Her Lord'? Yeah, I can see why the Governers keep that secret.\" Snarvars grin gets wider still. \"Technically the last two are shared among all of my mates. It's just the Royal Meal order that needs to be addressed. I was thinking of Mother as Lunch and Terra as Dinner. You would be Dessert.\" You stop for a moment. \"Wait, why aren't I a meal, or atleast a second course?\" Glenda, Amara and Terra hug you and begin kissing different parts of you. \"Because you are so sweet and everyone wants a piece of you, Kimmy,\" Terra whispers in your ear. You blush at that and nod. \"Okay, I'm fine with being Dessert! Can we have a girltalk, Snarvar?\" \"Sure thing, just let the guards know when you wish to leave the room.\" He walks out the doors and they shut behind him. You make sure he is out of earshot before talking to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you heard my thoughts, right? It would be soo erotic if he got to eat us prepared like live versions of his favorite dishes.\" Glenda giggles at that. \"The rings would keep us alive and reduce any damage. We would probably barely feel it if someone were to cook spices and glaze onto our skin.\"  Amara laughs at that. \"Probably would tickle more than anything. And it would be sooo worth it to do something like this for him. Maybe we could even stretch it throughout the day, make him eat us for breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert according to our titles. We would have to be prepared tonight after we finalized things with the Governers and Aristocrates.\" Terra looks puzzled for a moment. \"But we can't leave him alone all day and night. And besides, it's not like we can just go up to the cook and ask him to prepare us like a meal. He would shoo us out of the kitchen and then tell Snarvar.\" You smirk at them. \"John is a master cook, and Fraria is Snarvars mate through contract. She can distract him tonight and tomorrow until breakfast when he eats Amara first. Then she tells him that he has to keep us in his stomach for a whole week and that we will be served to him in the order of our titles, and only durring the time of day he normally eats.\" Terra, Amara and Glenda nod. \"Then it's settled,\" Amara says. \"We'll ask John and Fraria for help when they get back.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm not really sure I shouldn't be jelous at that. I knew that Kim wanted him, and I was alright with that. Even Amara was showing some interest. But for Terra and my Mother to go with as well? I push these thoughts aside. I refuse to be the type of dragon that tries to control everything his mates do. That isn't the type of Drake my Mother raised me to be. 'Rari awakens and kisses me, a smile on her face. Even though we have a bond she is hiding something from me. And she is doing it quite well. I could power past her block, but it is nice to be suprised every so often. I get up, preparing to collect my mates from John and emotionally steeling myself for what I fear I will find beyond my door, But 'Rari beckons me back to bed. \"Snarvar, there is a suprise for you. Come back to bed and I will have it brought to you. A gift from your human mates.\" My intrest piqued, I turn and sit on my bed as she tells the servants to open the door and to leave. John comes in with a large cart and a platter covered by an ornate cloche. 'Rari nods and John lifts the cloche, reavealing my Amara, naked as the day she was born and covered in honey, milk, and with cream over her tender parts. My mouth waters as she stares at me. Rari smirks at my reaction, which also included an erection. \"Now before you say or do anything, you should know that your meals are only for eating, and must be within you for a set of time. Only the meal that came up with the rules may tell you how long that time is, and the other meals can only respond with a certain phrase. That being said, I personally like to taste <i>all</i> parts of my meals thoroughly... And with that, your meal, My Lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile down at Amara, licking my lips. \"How long must I keep you inside of me, Morsel?\" Amara gives a lustful smile back \"Breakfast doesn't get to respond, My Devourer. It simply gets to be eaten.\" I smirk at the answer and can tell she is waiting for me to start. I begin by licking her feet, drawing them into my mouth, tasting the sweet honey there. She shudders and I see the cream over her flower begin to flow. I snake my tounge around her legs moving it slowly up to her hidden petals and gently lick away the cream, causing her to moan. I pull her with by tounge until her rear is in my mouth, her legs just getting ready to enter my throat and I hold her there with my tounge, pleasuring her. All too soon she has climaxed, which simply adds to her amazing flavor. I remove my tounge from inside of her and slither it up over her stomach, tasting the fresh milk upon her body complementing the honey. She raises her arms above her head so that I will have them last as I pull her in, licking the cream off of her nipples. Another moan fills the air and I concentrate on her flaver, begining to swallow my lovely breakfast down. I slip my tounge into her mouth and find a cherry inside of there which she passes to me with her tounge. I accept it greatfully and withdraw from her mouth to taste yer lovely face. She giggles slightly as I lavish her face to get the rest of the honey off of her before swallowing again, bringing her arms into her mouth. I taste her sweet flavor mixed with the sweeter honey and I moan. Soon I swallow one last time, drawing her fully into my body. I hear her laugh as she slides down my esophagus and lands in my stomach with a giggle. \"That was quite the Beautiful Breakfast, my Love. Thank you for it.\" 'Raria kisses me and laughs. \"Now you must get to your duties, Lord. But don't work so hard you skip Lunch. It's absolutely Lovely...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My work slowly stretches on as I feel Amara inside of me. I place one of my hands over her shape every so often and feel her press against it. We have a pretty decent conversation going between our minds, but she hasn't talked to me about the other mates and what roles they will play, nor has she let slip for an instant who orchestrated this or how long she will be in there. She has also expressly forbidden me for looking for the answers in any of my mates mind. I get the feeling it is longer than a day, which is fine with me. When a mate is inside of a dragons stomach the dragon doesn't have to feed, and neither does the mate. Their bodies sustain eachother in a type of perfect symbiosis. Of course, the dragon starts missing the physical side of the relationship and, more importantly, the emotional side of having his mates with him rather than in him, so if they have set it for too long I may have to dissapoint them. Finally lunch time comes around and I am drawn to the wine cellar by Frarias mind. There I find my Mother driping in oils and covered with exotic smelling spices. Again I felt my mouth grow wet at the sight of her. \"Here's your lunch, Snarly. Sometimes you can eat a meal too slow. There is always a time to relish a meal, but when you are in a rush, the meal may be better quick and filling.\" I got the idea. Fraria was using her link to our mates to tell me how each one wanted to be eaten. I can expect more instructions durring dinner. My mother winks at me and I can feel my scales glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my Lunch. Can you tell me how long it will be until I taste you again?\" Mother nearly giggles, but composes herself with a smile. \"Lunch doesn't loosen her lips, Hungry One. It slides between yours.\" Fraria giggles at that and drops another obvious clue. \"She's definately <b>head</b>ed for a good time, Isn't she Snarly?\" Heads first then, got it. I open my mouth and slide my tounge all over her body. She tastes slightly spicey, with a very pleasant aftertaste. She giggles as I begin devouring her, lifting my mothers hands to my mouth with my tounge. I pull them to the back of my throat right away, quickly tasting every inch of her body as she begins to decend down my throat. Fraria is coaching me on how fast to go mentally and soon my Mothers feet are the only things left outside of my mouth. I slurp them up like noodles, noticing the increased spicieness on her soles. It tingles so pleasantly and I almost reluctantly swallow. Soon she is giggling in my belly alongside of Amara. Fraria laughs as she notes the look on my face. \"I hope you save room for your Dinner, Snarly. It's a big one.\" At that the two of us leave the cellar.</span></div></div>",

Finally it is nearly time and I am pulled by Kimberly and Terra to our bedroom. I enter and gasp seeing my Terra dressed up on a bed of lettuce as though she is a suckling pig, including an apple in her mouth. A ways away I see my Kimberly nearly covered in drizzled chocolate with strawberries surrounding her. These two are not nearly as covered as my other three mates were. I also see Fraria sitting infront of John, prepared much the same way Terra is. I cock my head at her. \"The other meals convinced him to be my meal. He had me roast him and Terra side by side. They are only tanned, not browned, so they are in no pain.\" She picks him up and I can see his manhood standing proudly. He and Terra are both hogtied, and I follow Rari's lead and lift Terra up as well. I remove the apple from her mouth. \"How long until I see you again, my precious meal?\" A lustful look appears on her face as I hold her above my jaws. \"Your Dinner is not allowed to know how long she will be in your stomach, my King. Only that she will enjoy it.\" That confirms what I had suspected. Unless Fraria had left a false clue and she is the one who came up with the idea. I place the apple to one side and genly place the Suckling Terra on my tounge, drawing her in my mouth fully as bound as she is. She fits perfectly and I can feel her mind begging you me simply swallow her down. I happily ablige. I relish her aftertaste before moving to the squirming Chocolate coated Kimberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You planned this, my delectable Dessert?\" She nods, not saying anything. \"How long am I to keep you all inside of my stomach?\" She smirks, having been waiting for the question. \"Todays meals should keep you full for a week, My Taster. We all hope you enjoyed our tastes.\" You smirk at her. \"I did. Now it appears I have one final morsel to gobble down. How do you want to be eaten?\" \"Fast, my love. Gulp me down. Don't take your time. Don't stop to taste my center, just get me inside of you so I can enjoy being with you!\" I nod. \"Anything for such delectable meals.\" I oblige her, taking her hands into my mouth first. She tastes fantastic, just the right amount of sweet with the zest of added strawberries. I lick her body as it passes through my mouth, taking in her flavor. Per her request I don't put much lingering on her, but I have to disobey her once her mound enters my mouth. Then, like all of the others, I make her add to her own flavor before swallowing her down. A whole week with a full belly certainly sounds like paradise, and I decide I may even keep them for longer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The three of you come down from your shared orgasm and you find yourself disapointed. \"I was so sure I was ready.\" Amara crawls up your body to look you in the eyes, lying ontop of you. \"Do you think it's because you see our babies here nearly grown up?\" You think for a minute. \"Maybe. I guess so. I just... I want to prove my love to you both so badly.\" Snarvar looks into your eyes just over Amaras shoulder. \"And you do. The way you talk, the way you act, the way you look at us, even the way you kiss us and have sex with us. Niether of us doubt your love for us. Maybe you need to give yourself more credit, My Love.\" You sigh dreamily, looking into his eyes. Your righ hand returns to his cheeckbone and you wrap your left hand around Amaras waist, who has both hands cupping your face. She kisses you and then Snarvar does. \"I'm sorry I've been a handful these past two d-\" you are silenced by Snarvars lips on yours again while Amy scolds you. \"You have a kind and loving spirit. You haven't been a handful. You have been concerned and you have every right to be under the circumstances. As I told you before, I was absolutely freaking out when I found out about the idiotic ritual, AND I have also experienced wanting to be impregnated by this Sexy Draggy before I was ready. These things are perfectly normal for the mates of dragons.\" Snarvar releases you lips and gets up off the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of stupid rituals, we need to get ready. We need to see the Dragon Council and bring my mother back here. And Fraria came up with an idea, she said you two need to be inside of me when we go, since my father would expect me to hide you in her. But you can't be in my stomache as he might smell you if I belched. You smirk at what he has in mind and watch his cock inflate again. Amy laughs and tells him to wait until you have gotten his digestive juices off of each other, since that might hurt the insides of his more sensitive region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you and Amara are tucked away in one of Snarvars testicles, making out pretty hard. You two break the kiss and you decide to indulge in your kinks. \"When did you first come in here?\" \"It was my 9th birthday. He told me that if I got hungry to drink some of it, and not to worry about sleep because I would fall asleep when I was tired. He also told me not to worry about drowning, because my ring would keep me alive without air forever if needed.\" She sends you an image of what she looked like when she was nine, stripped down looking in the mirror next to Snarvar. \"How long did he keep you in here?\" \"I was in here for half of the year. I absolutely loved it.\" \"Wait, how did he keep you from geting pregnant? You said you started your periods a month after you moved in with him.\" \"Spending half of the year inside of him was what gave him the idea for him to have me move in with him. It was a month after I got out of him that my periods started and he would put another ring on my finger to act as a contraceptive whenever I spent more than a week inside of here. He still has a few of those, if you ever decide to stay in here for an extended period of time. Even though your body won't let him impregnate you when it isn't ready it's still best to be sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you stay here with me?\" She smiles at that. \"Of course, my Darling!\" \"So what is the longest amount of time you've spent in him?\" She smirks at that. \"9 months in his stomache and 3 years in here.\" \"THREE YEARS!?\" \"Oh yeah, it works great if you get tired of being used for deal sweetening. Snarvar is really protective of us when we are inside of him, like even more than usual. Whenever some noble wants to court the mate of a dragon he or she can say no and their mate is \"performing her duties for an extended period of time\" and if they don't drop it the dragon can tell them that their mate is off the table indefinately and not to bring it up. Only William knows the truth of what that means. Plus it makes Snarvar look more intimidating if he has us suposedly taking care of some secret jobs, even if the only jobs we have are as his sexy stress relievers.\" \"I kind of like that title. 'Lady Kinberly:Royal Sexy Stress Reliever'!\" \"He actually has it written down that my job is 'Sexual and Carnivorous Stress Reliever', and it's part of my title along with 'Honorary Royal Dinner'.\" You look at her, your mouth agape but still smiling at the edges. <b>I just found out about Amara's official job and titles! I want to share in them!</b> You both giggle uncontrollably when you hear him in your heads <b><u>How does 'Honorary Royal Dessert' sound?</u> Add in 'Royal Seed Mixer and Receptical' to both our titles and you have a deal!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know he'll do it, right?\" You giggle. \"I'm counting on it!\" Amara shows you a scene through her link of a group of elderly men, Snarvar and her eight year old self giggling uncontrollably when they presented her full title and job description. \"Those are the aristocrates. They help Snarvar handle the work load. In exchange for keeping our titles secret they request that I go on occasional 'dates' with them. Little things, like being on an aristocrates arm at a ball. Most of them are too old for sex, and honestly the biggest thing I have been asked for from them was to attend a ball, dance with them, and bring them back to their wives safely. Sort of a stand in if their wives couldn't attend. They have a great sense of humor, as you can tell.\" \"Oh Goddess! Wait until they hear mine!\" The two of you break out into giggling fits again when you hear another voice. <i><u>It is good to feel you in happy spirits, Kimberly. I promise John and I will keep Snarvar safe.</u></i> You thank Fraria through your link and begin to focus on kissing Amara, who has taken it upon herself to finger you. You return the favor and soon the two of you reach your climaxes, noting that the level of seed has risen. <b><i>Did our playing turn you on, Lover?</i></b> You concentrate on an image of Amara from earlier this morning while she was orgasming and note that the seed level is even higher now. You grin slyly at Amara, who grins back as the two of you begin sending increasinly steamier memories and images to Snarvar and Fraria until there is barely any room left in his testicle. The two of you begin making out within the seed, you noting for a quick moment that Amara was right, you really didn't need air anymore. Then you get a wicked idea and begin eating her out, intentionally swallowing large gulps of Snarvars stickiness. The two of you carry on that way for quite some time.</span></div></div>",

Then you begin to feel him moving again, but you and Amara couldn't feel anything from your link. That was probably a bad sign. Then you felt your whole world shake as he sits down and you can feel overwhelming joy from Snarvar. Soon the two of you were ejaculated from Snarvars depths and taking baths as Snarvar and Fraria helped you get clean. \"Why are we outside of you? I don't get it. What about killing Troclen?\" Snarvar smiled at you, overjoyed. \"The council has imprisoned him for employing illegal rituals and forcing his progeny to take part in rituals that were outlawed in any form 10,000 years ago. The council said that they are sorry for what you went through, Amara, and that nobody else I take on or have taken as mates shall ever have to suffer that way again. They also offered their condolances, as they believe you are still dead. And, to top it off, my Mother publically dissolved the appearance of matehood and told everyone present that she believes that it was my fathers poison that killed you. He is facing a death sentence.\" You feel a huge weight lifted off of your shoulders and embrace Amara, who kisses you deeply. The two of you finish cleaning up and dry off, realizing that you have no clothes. Snarvar, Fraria and Amara assure you that it is very common for humans to be nude here, and it is also common to be clothed. It appears that nothing sexual is forbiden here, including voyerism and public bondage. There is a knock at the door and Snarvar winks at Amara and tells her to hide. Once she is well hidden Fraria send the message to John to open the door and you watch as he walks in the room with a very beautiful and very nude red haired woman who looks maybe a year or two older than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman walks right up to Snarvar and throws herself in his waiting arms, kissing him passionately. The two kiss for a long while and you look at them, knowing from the bond that this is Glenda, Snarvars mother. She finally breaks the kisses and turns around to look at you apraisingly as her son masages her brests with his large clawed hands. She has a fairly decent bust with an hourglass figure, and an ass that looked like two perfect globes, quite the contrast to your small body. You find yourself wishing that you had her possibly C cup perky breasts rather than your B cup barely theres. Snarvar, Fraria and Amara admonish you mentally for comparing your body to hers and assure you that your breasts are perfect on your tiny, \"tight figure\". Glenda smiles at you and winks just before she moans out at her sons minstrations. She grabs his hands and pulls them away from her breasts before grabbing onto a silver ring on her finger and chucking it away, Snarvar grabing her hand, placing a gold ring with an emerald stone set on the top (matching yours and Amaras, although Amaras was a saphire to match her eyes like the emerald matches your and Glendas eyes) and places it on her finger. He gives it a few test pulls and when it won't budge he is satisfied. Finally Glenda stops ogling your body and walks in close to you, kissing you. You are shocked momentarily until her tounge works its way into your mouth, dueling with yours. The kiss ends too soon and you half whine at the loss of contact. Glenda says her first words and her voice is so beautiful that it reminds you of your first girlfriend when you and John hit a rough patch. \"I definately aprove, young drake. She is astonishing.\" You look lustfully into her emerald eyes and grin at her aproval, biting your lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, make no mistake, I still want to mate with you. But is there any particular reason why you stopped requesting the gems for Amaras memorial statue a few days ago? I highly doubt it was jelousy on this ones part.\" You shake your head no, confirming what she said and she smiles at you before scowling at her son. \"Amara was the daughter I never had, and I expect you to finish her memorial, young drake. Now tell me why you stopped mid corespondance.\" She souns dissapointed and Amara peeks out from her hiding spot to watch with an impish smile on her face, unseen gy Glenda. \"Something came up, Mother. I think it may be best to show you. If you will turn around you will see the reason.\" At that, Amara sneaks around behind Glenda, smiling broadly and looking as excited as could be to see her mother-in-law again. \"I swear, this had best be worth it. If you spent those gems... on...\" She trails off at seeing Amara, alive and well infront of her and nearly passed out. You quickly grab her and steady her. \"Hello again Glenda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara is soon pervy to the biggest, sloppiest, most passion filled kiss of her newly restored life. The five of you then proceed to tell Glenda about how it came to be that Amara was alive and well again, and Glenda is crying happy tears, holding Amara close to her. Snarvar then asks John and Fralia to head back and wait for them at his castle, not wanting them aroud to see him, Amara and you mate with Glenda. The whole thing goes rather fast for your liking, more akin to a quickie than a mating ritual. But with three women of Snarvars preffered age group that he loved more than life itself are mating with him and each other, you can understand how things move fast. Soon the four of you are on a heap on the bed Snarvars father used to share with Gilda. Snarvar produces several glowing blue potions and has each of you drink three of them, explaining that it is an antidote to black dragon venom and that it would inocculate everyone present from the venom in the future while curing and purging any trace of venom in your bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenda gets ready to mount Snarvar with the two of you so that you could leave when you give her your hand to help her up and she smells it. She looks shocked for a moment before speaking. \"Snarvar, where exactly were you hiding these two?\" Before Snarvar could respond you and Amara proudly thrust out your chests and respond simultaniously. \"His balls!\" Snarvar glows bright red as his mother looks him in the eyes, licking her lips and you feel pure lust through the newly established link. \"You girls mind if I join you the next time?\" \"Sure!\" \"The more the merrier!\" At that you help Glenda gets on Snarvars back, holding you and Amara close as you make your way to the castle.</span></div></div>",

Some of the guards looked like they didn't mind!\" John laughs nervously at that. \"You've really changed since you got here. Pretty drastic change from a nevernude to an exhibitionist.\" You smile to yourself at tha and grab Johns hand, pulling it down to your crotch instead. \"Yeah, well, I was a prude before. Here I can indulge in my basest fantasies. I can literally jump into the mouth of my Dragon lover and be swallowed down to spend the night or maybe even the week inside of his stomach, his body keeping me alive.\" He blushes as he feels how wet this idea makes you. \"Yeah, it is pretty nice inside of Fraria. I may have to try staying inside of her for a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks into your eyes and leans in for a kiss. You lean backwards a little and watch as he instead kisses you between your breasts. When he realizes it isn't your mouth he quickly stands up straight and blushes. You giggle at his embarasment and pull his head down to your level so he can get that kiss. It wasn't the same tentative nervous kiss that you remember from a young 14 year old with shaky hands. Instead he wraps his arms around you and presses his body forward, absolutely exuding passion and, more importantly, confidence. The kiss ends and he sighs. \"I missed this.\" You giggle again. \"I didn't.\" He looks at you confused. You decide to elaborate. \"We never had 'this' before. You were too nervous to go far enough, and I was too nervous to let you. What you just showed me was passion and in the process you knocked a couple of dates off of the time until I mate with you. And just so you know, I'm actually willing to mate right now. That kiss told me everything I need to know. You and I have changed, but our compatability remains the same.\" He gives you a lust-filled smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't start what you can't finish, cutie. What if I take you up on that? Ravage you right here and now? Bend you over... Make you scream out my name...\" He strips down and begins sucking on your neck, biting and licking. You feel yourself starting to lose control and your body is begging you to just say fuck it to the whole dating thing. He is so filled wih passion it practically vibrates in his being. He trails down and captures a nipple in his mouth, sucking and licking, making it hard while you moan before he switches to the other one. It is now or never. What do you choose?</span></div></div>",

You take the ring off and tell him to try again and he gives you a hickey on the right side of your neck, just under your ear. You then slip the ring back on and tell him to enter you.

You huff and sit down next to Amara, who notices your mood. \"Things didn't work out so well, huh?\" \"Don't date him, Amy. He's an idiot.\" Snarvar looks at you and feels your dissapointment in John. \"What did he do?\" \"He made fun of our pet names. I mean, you call us 'Dear' and 'My Lady' and my heart skips a beat. Then he makes fun of them? The things you call us out of love?\" Glenda moves close to you and hugs your body to her. Her embrace feels nice. \"He sounds like a jelous idiot to me.\" You turn to look at her and see her comforting green eyes. You turn your head to the left and see Snarvars comforting yellow eyes, and to your right you see Amaras comforting blue eyes. You feel happy that this family gets you. \"I'm being a pain again, aren't I?\" Even Glenda laughs at that. Amara kisses your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to stop using that dirty word. You are you. And you are 15. Are you a little emotional? Maybe. Passionate? Hell yes. Loving? Beyond words. Your hormones are still raging and you may find yourself overreacting to a few things. All of us sitting here have been through that. Our babies above us are going through that right now. None of us will ever, <i>ever</i> fault you for that. It's just part of who you are and why we love you.\" You find yourself kissed on both cheeks and on the lips at the exact same time. \"So you think I may be overreacting to this?\" \"Fuck no, sweetie. Kick him to the curb. You don't owe him anything.\" You smile at Glenda as she says that. You can feel the atmosphere quickly turning erotic until you look up and see Anna and Mike having sex while flying with each other. Amy quickly gets up and yells after the two of them, who disentangle from each other and land near you, along with Keira and Jenn who want to see what is going on. Amy is reading the poor young dragons the riot act for having sex outdoors and you go right up to her and tip her backwards, diping her and plant a passionate kiss on her lips. The black haired girl immeadeately shuts up and puts her arms around your neck, pulling you closer for another kiss. When that kiss ends you give her a lopsided grin. \"Too much?\" she whispers. \"Too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting Amy get back up the young dragons all look at you astonished. \"What Mama Amy is trying to say is 'if you are going to have sex outdoors, do it where you won't get caught.' Right Amy?\" \"Pretty much.\" You look the two of them in the eyes. \"Practice or love?\" Anna and Mike look around awkwardly, saying it all. By the time they stammer out \"p-p-practice?\" you don't believe them. \"Uh huh. Well, in the intrest of 'p-p-practice' you should still get lessons from us, young drake. You still have a lot to learn.\" Mike nods sheepishly and he and Anna take off towards the nearby forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you enjoy a pieceful day outside until one of Snarvars advisors comes outside with news.</span></div></div>",

You have been warned that he will undoubtedly try to hit on you and make deals on you becoming his wife. Snarvar already knows that it is not alright with you and has said that he will handle any \"attempted flirtations\" and that he will not agree to have you date him, as there is no need any longer with the ritual gone. Amara is also expressing some concerns. <b><i>I don't want to be used like that anylonger, Snarvar. As far as I'm concerned, all relationships aside from my matehood to you ended when I died, and being your wife is the only one that survived my reserection.</i> <u>I understand, loves. You will not be forced into anything you don't want. Anything you wish to add, Mother? <i>You know my stance, my precious boy. You and our mates are the ONLY ones for me.</i></u></b> Amara grinned at you. \"What's the bet that he doesn't even notice me?\" \"Want to take a wager?\" The grin got even wider. \"Loser indulges in the winners favorite sexual fantasy.\" Your eyes grow wide at that. You have seen her fantasy and it is kinky as could be. \"Deal,\" you manage to squeak out, secretly hoping you lose. Suddenly the doors burst open and a blonde man with an old style mustache and goatee barges into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snarvar, what the hell do you think you are doing?!\" You gasp at the mans either sheer bravery or utter stupidity at talking like that to a dragon. <b><i>You'll find both of those words describe him at times.</i></b> Snarvar, to his credit, is remaining calm. \"Hello, William. What are you refering to?\" \"You know damn well what I'm refering to! I check on the status of Lady Amaras statue and the stone cutter tells me you have cancelled the order?! She was your mate for 30 years!\" \"35 years,\" Amara corrects him. \"35 years! Thank you! That's longer than I've been alive! Your people supported you in this. She was beloved by them, they adored her. She did more to help raise the financial status and the security of the people in all of the kingdoms in the country than most ruling families have ever done!\" Amara clears her throat, grinning at you at this point. You know you have already lost the bet, and your face is bright red at the thought of what she wants you to do to her. You know it won't be too bad, as she keeps herself immaculately clean, something you, Snarvar and Glenda pride yourselves on as well. \"So, what exactly is your reasoning, Snarvar? Why the hell did you pull the commission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar looks at Lord Cedric with an amused grin on his scaly face. \"Look around the room, William.\" Lord Cedric looks at Snarvar puzzled and looks at the three of you. His eyes lock onto Amara, who waves with a huge smile plastered on her face. \"Lady Amara? How?\" \"That's not your concern, William. I don't much care for how you just spoke to my husband,\" Amara chastises. 'William' looks absolutely astonished that she would talk to him like that. \"I think I deserve to know how you came back to life. After all, you are my wife-\" \"I WAS your wife, Will. Then I died and our business concluded. The only relationship that survived was my marriage to the one I chose, and that was Snarvar.\" She has him there, and you have to admit it is rather funny to watch a grown man opening and closing his mouth like a fish. \"You are right, Lady Miller. I apologize. Lord Snarvar, I request your forgiveness.\" Snarvar chuckles at that. \"For what, Will? Thinking that I had abandoned the memory of my wife when all evidence pointed towards that? You came to a logical conclusion and I can't fault you for that.\" \"Who are the rest of these beautiful women?\" \"Lord William Cedric this is Lady Glenda Macavoy-\" Glenda stands and offers her hand which he kisses, \"and Lady Kimberly Stewart.\" You stand up and offer your hand like Glenda did and recieve a similar kiss on your hand. You have to admit, he is quite charming when he isn't yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two new mates, Snarvar? The old man would love to get his hands on them. I take it this means I must perform the ritual with them?\" You notice a sad glint in his eye as he asks, like he knows how much failing the ritual would hurt you. \"No, William. I was able to consult the Dragon Council and they told me that it was, and I quote, 'extremely illegal', 'banned as punishment for 10,000 years', and 'degrading in the highest form for all parties involved'. So the ritual will not be happening ever again.\" William looked relieved at this development. \"Good. I didn't look forward to that. By the way, the real reason I came here is because my grandmother wanted me to give you this. She's still waiting for you, you know. The old man doesn't have much time left. A week, by my doctors estimations.\" He hands Snarvar a scroll which he reads and smiles at. \"Such a sense of humor. I miss that woman. Give her this for me.\" Snarvar hands William a scroll that he had on the table, rolled and sealed. Around the seal was a gold ring matching the rest of Snarvars mates with an amber stone laid in its setting. \"I will make sure she gets this. In the meantime I feel I must request that you address your subjects about Lady Millers condition. Most of them believe you are disrespecting her memory.\" \"Within the week, Will. You have my word.\" William turned and left through the same doors he entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you are all in your bedroom, Amara and you being the center of attention. Snarvar has his hands on Glendas hips, Glenda bouncing up and down slowly on his member, both watching you two intently. Amara is resting on the bed with her legs and most of her back in the air and you have your arms hooked up under her legs, sitting down and facing her with your tounge burried deep in her ass. You are thankful for her sanitary ways because her asshole tasted only of bath salts and the tiniest hint of salt from sweat. You are taking your time, your tounge fully extended and burried up to your lips within her. You have already cum twice from the sheer eroticism of fulfilling her fantasy and your second darkest fantasy at the same time, and you hadn't even been touching yourself. She is working up to a slow, powerful orgasm and you have already backed off several times at her request to stretch this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately all good things must cum to an end and you manage to make her orgasm and she stops you from continuing. \"Too sensitive, Kim! Please! That was wonderful. Kiss me!\" You back away from her kiss as she sits up in your lap for a moment. \"It's okay, the rings protect us. Besides, you know how hygenic we all are. I wouldn't ask you to do something that put any of us at risk.\" Assured, you kiss her passionately and hear Glenda moan loudly. Snarvar has just cum inside of her. The four of you bask in the afterglow for a while before preparing for bed. The tree of you decide to sleep out side of Snarvars stomach tonight, but you have a feeling atleast one of you is going to be swallowed in the night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You awake in the morning with a set of lips being pressed to yours and find Glenda giving you a rather passionate kiss. When she backs off you smile at her and she returns it. \"I'm sorry, I had to. You looked so sweet that I couldn't resist.\" You simply stare into her emerald eyes as she stares into yours. \"Aww, Tesoro Mia... That's so sweet!\" Glenda tilts her head slightly, hoping you will explain what you just called her. \"It's Italian, a language from my world. My family taught me how to express myself in English and Italian since my grandparents were from Italy. Well, not my father, my mother and her parents. I called you Tesoro Mia, meaning My Treasure. Snarvar is Cuore Mia, My heart, and Amara is  Amore Mia, My Love. Even though you are all my treasures, hearts, and loves, it helps me to keep you all together yet individual in my mind.\" Amara looks at you with mock anger and crosses her arms, fake pouting. You can see right through it and you pull her to you. \"Aw, I forgot, didn't I Amore Mia? I'm sorry. How can I make it up to you?\" She giggles and sticks out her tounge at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me fulfill your so called 'darkest fantasy' today. I've seen what you want, Love. I told you our rings will let us perform our kinks with no harm. And I know my husband well enough to know that he would love to watch, and maybe even contribute.\" You stare into her eyes before looking up at Snarvars, who you notice has been lovingly watching you three be sweet without interfering. \"I've seen it too, my love, and I can assure you that I would be more than willing to help. But I suggest we be out in the forest away from prying eyes when we try it.\" Glenda looks at the three of you, confused. \"Glenda, all three of you can look through my mind for any information at any time with my blessing. I love the idea of being an open book for you all. Please look into my mind?\" She simply nods at you and searches your mind through your link for what they are talking about. Then when she finally finds it she smirks at you. \"Kimmy, that's nothing to us. I would love to help with you living that kink out as well.\" You find yourself growing moist at the thought of your three loves fulfiling your favorite fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have anything to do today?\" Snarvar grins at you. \"No, we actually have the next month away from our royal obligations. I don't meet with any dignitaries until midway through next month, and the Aristocrates have agreed to hold court in my absence so I may bond with you all. I sent them word last night that Amara was alive again and through what means, all that remains is to recieve word back and possibly meet them tomorrow to officially grant Mother and You your titles and renew Amaras.\" You and Amara giggle at that and Glenda playfully rolls her eyes at her son. \"Really the only obligation after that would be addressing my people and telling them of Amy's reserection and inform them that I now have three mates that I intend to marry, remarry in your case, Amara. And that can be done at sundown tomorrow night.\" The three of you look at each other with lust at the prospect of a month to yourselves and your family. Of course you and Amy were still going to teach Mike how to be a decent male before, during and after sex. The only question on your mind involved Keira. You decide to ask it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snarvar, when you are around Keira I've noticed your eyes are drawn to her, and hers to you. She seems very fidgety under your gaze and you seem to try to conceal your drakehood, which I notice gets hard whenever she is around. Please be honest, are the two of you drawn to each other?\" Amara nods in agreement at your assessment and Glenda looks up with a naughty smile at her son, believing she knows the answer. Snarvar sighs before looking at the three of you. \"Yes, we are. It is not entirely uncommon for Drakes to fall for their eldest daughters, though many repress the desire to mate as it usually isn't shared. But Keira has confessed to me that she does feel the pull as well, and we have both been sorely tempted to mate numerous times. Neither of us has wanted to appear as a mated couple in the kingdom, however, until we both got the blessing of whichever mate I took. It has been... Dificult on both of us.\" Amara pulls her husbands face close to her and looks him in his beautiful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my approval, my love. You both deserve to be with your rightful mates, and like you said, no harm comes from incest in Dragonic families, even amongst their mates.\" Glenda nods a that. \"That's true. Dragons change our bodies with their magic the first time we have sex with them. If you were to take a brother and a sister as full mates they could have a child together without fear of any defects or abnormalities that could come from normal humans commiting incest. Same goes for mother and son as well as father and daughter. You two have my blessing.\" All eyes turn towards you and your cheeks grow red from being stared at. \"I'm really messed up from my childhood, but I think it's hot, a father mating with his daughter consensually. As long as she consents I say bring her up here and let us all mate together. To be honest, I really want to see you fuck her.\" The others eyes glaze over with lust at that statement and you find yourself inadvertantly thinking back to your own father. You quickly banish his memory from your mind and you look around the room. Amara speaks up first. \"Well, Snarvar, what are we doing first, flying to the woods to indulge in Kims fantasy or mating with our cute little eldest daughter?\" Snarvar thinks about it for a moment before responding.</span></div></div>",

Snarvar turns around and you can hear both irritation and restraint in his voice. \"We are busy. I will help her to clean and dress today.\" You hear Gertrude nervously agree. \"Yes, of course, My Lord. Sorry for intruding!\" You hear the doors shut and the two of you begin to laugh. Snarvar pulls out of you and brings his head down to your crotch as you roll over with the sole intention of turning him on again. You know you look hot as your long red hair flows around you and you wink at him, a twinkle in your emerald eyes. At age 16, you have a well developed body that looks a little more mature than it actually is, and you work hard to keep yourself trim where it matters. You have relatively small b-cup breasts and your body is definitely described as athletic, with muscle definition but not too much to make you look manish. Suddenly your eyes widden as Snarvar begins licking at the flow of his semen pouring out of you, snaking his tounge inside of you. \"What are you doing? No! Quit!\" You begin pushing his head away instinctually and he smiles at you. \"It is official, then. We are mates.\" You tilt your head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that was kind of a test? As long as I keep your seed in me we are mates?\" Snarvar chuckles. \"Not quite. The mating ritual requires that my drakehood be its natural size, as dragons can grow and shrink it when they want to. It also requires that I must attempt to clean my seed out of you. If you accept, we are tentative mates, able to have children but not experience the benefits of full mateship until you deny me cleaning you out. But since you denied me cleaning you out, you now experience the full benefits. We can hear each others thoughts no matter how far away we are, we can have children together, and you will live for as long as I do barring what happened with Amara, and given that no dragon has ever died of old age, we could be together for millions of years.\" Your eyes grow wide at that. \"So I can live with you forever?\" \"Unless I am killed in battle or for committing a crime against a group of the sentient species, yes.\" \"But you can't ever clean me out? What if I'm not ready for children yet?\" Snarvar chuckles again, resting his large head on your stomach. \"No, the only time I couldn't clean you out would have been like right now. I can't clean this load out of you. But I can clean the next one out, if you so wish, and we remain mates. The ritual only happens once, unless you or I break it.\" Your eyes grow wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me how to break it, I don't want to know.\" Snarvar looks at you lovingly. \"I have to tell you, my Love. If only so you know how to avoid it.\" You sigh. \"Fine. Tell me, Draggy, how does our mateship break?\" \"It breaks if neither of us loves each other anymore. If our hearts are so cold and hateful to one another that we don't have love for each other for five years, we loose our bond. The only good thing about that is that love can be rekindled, and so can the bond.\" You look into his eyes. \"I won't ever run out of love for you, so there is nothing to worry about there.\" \"Me neither, Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you kiss and you feel Snarvars cock prodding at your entrance again. \"Mmmm. Another round, Draggy?\" Snarvar sighs sadly. \"No, my dearest Kimberly. We have to get ready.\" You smirk at him. \"Tonight, then. And Snarly?\" \"Yes?\" \"I'm having you clean me tomorrow morning to feel just how good that tounge is inside of a girl.\" He smirks at you. \"Deal.\"</span></div></div>",

I wouldn't take them as wives if I could not care for them. They all have potential to be mates as well, but there is only one whom I feel I would want to fully mate with. But for the most part they are business deals and writes of protection. Unfortunately the one I wish to mate with is in mourning over not seeing her mate in a very long time, so she has declined my offer of courting and mateship, opting for the protection and release of sexual urges.</span> You nod thoughtfully at that. <span class=\"clgreen\">I probably would have fallen into that category a while back. I lost a loved one too.</span> Snarvar looks at you with saddness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">What was their name?</span> You smile at him taking an interest, knowing how caring he was. <span class=\"clgreen\">Her name was Natalie. I loved her very much. We had been together for years before she disappeared on a hiking trip. They never found her body, but her watch was found smashed to peaces. I still miss her. It's been 3 years.</span> Snarvar cocks his head a little. <span class=\"clred\">We may be even more alike than I thought. That is the name of the wife I wish to have as my mate.</span> You look up at him at that, your eyes wide. <span class=\"clgreen\">Huh. Funny how that works out.</span> The two of you arrive at the dining area and find it mostly abandoned, with the exeption of a few people. The most prominent being a man in his middle ages balding on the top of his head and with what remains of his hair being prematurely gray. Next to him is a woman in a full set of armor with her face covered by a faceplate. You can't help but have your eyes drawn to her, like she seems familiar, even though you haven't seen her face. Snarvar motions for everyone to sit down and has you sit on his right while the woman in armor sits on his left. You realize this must be one of his wives as he puts his wings over the two of you. He then tells you through the bond that the woman in armor is his Natalie and you wonder why she isn't taking off her faceplate. She eventually does and you are shocked to see the jet black hair and stunning blue eyes of your Natalie. You can't take your eyes off of her and she can't from you either. You mouth the word \"Natty?\" and she nods, mouthing the word \"Kimmy?\" back. You nod and she looks as though she wants to get up and come close to you. Snarvar and the bald man are busy talking about some sort of land deal. You and Natalie begin paying attention when the bald man mentions her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your young Natalie here is quite the fighter. She kept us safe from a number of threats on our way to and from Algon Cove.\" Natalie smirks at the compliment. \"Yeah, well I also prevented you from angering wolves. I told you they aren't man eaters. Only rabid wolves attack unprovoked.\" The bald man smiled wider. \"I never thought I would see the day a woman or even a man for that matter would make a wolf act so calm. You truely have a way with animals, Lady Calden.\" Natalie blushes at the compliment. \"You flatter me, King Grizlen\" You smile at Natalies blushing. It was difficult to make her blush when you two had been dating, but you had always loved it when she did. It made her pale skin look cuter. Snarvar speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it your travels were successful then?\" The king produces a large bag and pulls out a red jewel the size of a grapefruit. \"It was indeed, Lord Snarvar. I hope this is good compensation for mining rights in the hills for 12 years in the caverns we discussed?\" Snarvar picks up the jewel and looks through it, as if looking for something. \"This is perfect. It should be the perfect size. Our deal is finalized, King Grizlen. I must admit it is refreshing to not have nobles ask for the rights to my wives and loved ones as part of deals.\" Grizlen lets out a hearty laugh at that. \"Maybe back when I was young I might have, but surely not at my age. I prefer the life with my Queen and family these days to sexual encounters with others wives. And again, my condolances on Lady Tarrow. I hope that ruby is a fit in the statue after you have it cut.\" Snarvar nods. \"Do you need an esort back to your kingdom?\" Grizlen shakes his head. \"The roads back should be far less dangerous than the route to the Cove. I should be fine with my squad.\" Snarvar nods and Grizlen and his squad leave the room. Natalia turns to Snarvar and Snarvar sighs \"So you two were together in the other world then?\" You realize that he picked up on it through your link. Natalias eyes widen as she realizes that you two have a link and are therefore mates.</span></div></div>",

Calm down.\" \"He kidnapped you, didn't he?\" You sigh at her, knowing the answer would piss her off. \"Yes, but listen. He did it because he had no time to explain. He told me everything. Everything, understand? I thought you were dead and his mate had died. We bonded.\" Natalie scoffs. \"Did he rape you? Because it took five months of dating to even get a kiss from you in our world.\" You force her to look in your eyes. \"No. He did not rape me.

And it looks like I have no excuses not to mate with you, Snarly. You know I want you.\" Snarvar chuckles. \"We have time now...\" Natalie looks at you and you nod at her, a lustful smile on your face. You notice the ring on her finger and you chuckle as she strips off the armor but leaves the ring on. You soon find yourself naked as Natalie and Snarvar work together to literally tear the gown you had been wearing to pieces, exposing your body. You smile and shrug to yourself, figuring that the castle tailor could make more gowns. You soon find yourself pinned on the guest bed underneath a giggling Natalie who is happily tweaking your nipples and making you moan out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you find her lips on yours as you feel a very large dragon cock slide between the two of you. You her sigh contentedly as Snavar begins grinding against the two of you until he pulls back and lines up with her pussy. She breaks the kiss and winks at you as Snarvar pushes deep iside of her, stretching her like he did with you earlier that morning. He pulls his head down and turns her head to the side and you watch with lust as the two of them share a passionate kiss. You simply can't help yourself and find yourself massaging Natalies c-cup breasts and moan out when Snarvars large clawed finger slips inside of you. The ring stops his claw from hurting you and he thrusts quickly, bringing both you and Natalie to orgasm. Natalie gasps her orgasm and falls limply against you and you capture her lips again. She focuses again and begins running her hands through your hair, kissing you and dueling her tounge in your mouth. You sigh against her lips and Snarvar brings you both to climax again. The kiss breaks and you gasp and pant, not sure you can take so much pleasure. Soon however, you can feel Snarvar speed up his thrusting into Natalie and he roars, shooting his load into her. You smirk at him as he pulls out and Natalie rolls off of you onto the bed. You look into her eyes as she looks into yours and you put a hand on her cheek. \"I missed you so much.\" \"I missed you too, Love.\" Snarvar moves down between Natalies legs and begins to clean before she smacks him on the nose and pulls herself away from his tounge. \"No. Leave it in.\" Snarvar retracts his tounge and smiles, resting his head on her stomach like he did with you earlier. \"Good. Then we can all hear eachothers thoughts.\" Natalie nods, caressing the dragons face and you roll closer to them, kissing his snout. \"Our Draggy...\"</span></div></div>",

It is as you do that the three of you realize your problem. <span class=\"clgreen\">Um, you guys kind of shredded my clothes...</span> Natalie starts to giggle. <span class=\"cblue\">Looks like Kimmy and I have to walk the halls naked for today!</span> Your eyes widen at that. <span class=\"clgreen\">You guys wouldn't really make me do that, would you?</span> Snarvar lets out a devious chuckle and you feel a shiver run through you. <span class=\"cred\">In a heartbeat, Love.</span> <span class=\"clgreen\">But I'm covered in your seed!</span> <span class=\"cblue\">But it looks great on you! Besides, the castle staff are sworn to secrecy!</span> <span class=\"clgreen\">Come on, please don't make me walk naked infront of people I don't know!</span> Snarvar and Natalie laugh at that. <span class=\"cred\">You don't really think I would do that to you two, do you? You can hide under my wings as I fold them to my back. Then we go to our bed chamber and clean you two up.</span> You sigh in relief and glare at the two of them. \"You guys are jerks!\" Your thoughts betray your true feelings however. <span class=\"clgreen\">But I still love you.</span> \"We love you too,\" the both of them say at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting cleaned up the three of you make your way down to the Soldiers Quarters in the city surrounding the castle. You smile as you watch children playing together and you and Natalie swoon as a little girl gives Snarvar a red rose and he gives her a soft hug. The little girl giggles as he places the flower in Natalies hair just above her left ear and promises to find another flower for you. The three of you make your way to the baracks and you and Natalie watch as Snarvar christens a new captain among his guard. Soon after the ceremony was finished the little girl returns with a yellow tulip and giggles again as Snarvar places it in your hair above your right ear. She asks for another hug and when he gives it to her she kisses his cheek, blushes, and runs off giggling. \"Well aren't you a ladykiller,\" you say light heartedly. Snarvar smiles in response as he watches the little girl. \"She is to join our family.\" You do a double take and Natalie looks at Snarvar wide eyed. \"You can feel the pull already? She isn't even 10 years old!\" Snarvar nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is eight. The same age as Amara when we first fell in love. I need to make an offer for a dowry on her.\" You turn his head to look in your eyes. \"Would you... consumate your love when she is this young?\" Snarvar nods. \"It is her choice, but yes. If she wishes it we would make love. But I would not complete the mating ritual with her until after her sixteenth birthday. The aging stops after mating and I don't wish to curse her with looking eight for the rest of our lives together.\" You and Natalie look at each other, feeling the love Snarvar already holds for this girl through your bonds. Natalie shrugs. \"You know my preference, Kim. Little girls are cute...\" You can't help but agree. \"I know, I like them too...\" Natalie and you both sigh. \"Fine.\" \"Let's go make an offer on her dowry.\" \"But we get to play with her too.\" Snarvar nods at that. \"As you wish, my loves. Annabell? Will you take us to your parents?\" The little girl smiles and leads the way, her blond hair flowing in the wind and her light blue eyes shimmering.</span></div></div>",

You may have a tiny crush on the dragon, but one day is not nearly long enough to act on it. You walk over to the bathtub behind the clothing curtain and notice a large red snout poke in as you draw the bath. \"Kim, I find it strange that you were camping on a mountain so high up when I... took you yesterday. Is there any particular reason for that?\" You sigh as you get into the bath. \"Look, the water is distorting your view of me. Come on in through here.\" He obeys and moves his head in, his big yellow eyes gazing not at your body, but at your face. You continue to bathe yourself. \"Look, Snarvar, life hasn't been too good for me. I don't really ever want to go back to my world even if this thing between us doesn't work.\" Snarvar cocks his head at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" \"Look, I'm over it, and I really would prefer if you didn't make a big deal out of it, but... Snarvar, I'm fifteen and I can't ever give you my virginity. My own father was a sicko and he took it when I was really little. Like, really little. Ten years ago, actually.\" You see his eyes narrow and intensify and hear a loud growl. \"If I ever meet him...\" You glare at him. \"What did I just say about making a deal out of it? He's fucking dead. My mother found out and she reported him to the cops. When he got to prison the other inmates found out what he did and beat him to death. One of the prisoners who did that actually got out last year and tracked me down. He said that he was in for assault and told me that if anyone ever hurt me again to let him know and he'd make them pay. We actually became pretty good friends.\" The growling stopped and his expression returned to normal. \"Anyways, two years after my father was thrown in jail my mother was killed in a car accident. I went to live with my grandparents. They really didn't care much about me. Let me get in a whole lot of trouble. Then I met my girlfriend, Nadia. We were in love at first site.\" \"Don't you wish to return to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get out of the water and dry yourself off. \"There's nobody to return to. She died on a class hiking trip on that mountain two years ago. She was two years older than I was. Nobody ever found her body.\" \"Kim, I'm so sorry.\" You look into his eyes as you select a purple dress. \"Thank you, Snarvar. I... I wasn't just camping, Snarvar. I was up their to end my life. But then you showed up and no matter how scared of your appearance I was I still felt safe with you. You kinda... Saved me.\" Snarvar looks at you seriously for a moment. \"Do you promise not to take your own life, Kim?\" You smile feintly at him as you finish putting the dress on. \"Yes, Snarvar. I was being weak and selfish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you are walking down the steps to the main castle to get something to eat. \"Why do you take humans for mates? I mean we have such... short life spans compared to you.\" You hear him chuckle. \"Because they are more interesting than a dragoness. Humans have been creating ways to make the most of their lives since the begining of their species while dragons simply laze around counting their treasure for the most part, those who take an interest in politics not withstanding. Besides, when a dragon has sex with a human the dragon passes along some of its magical essence. If we mate, you will live for as long as I live baring an incident like with my dear Amara. You will also stop aging.\" You stop and look at him wide eyed. \"And this happens with every girl you have sex with?\" He chuckles again. \"To a lesser extent. Simple sex simply adds years to their life and cleans up any diseases or problems. They won't live forever, but it can add up to eight or nine years to their lives per session. Which is why the Queens and Dutchesses in the area have often tried to sweeten deals by adding a few nights with them.\" \"So, wait, how long do Dragons live?\" \"That's not really known, even amongst us. We know that most dragons who die are killed over territorial disputes or crimes. The oldest living dragon is nearing one million years old, and has yet to show any signs of old age outside of wisdom.\" You nearly pass out. \"Um... Yeah. Wow. So if we mate I could be with you... forever. Good to know.\" \"Something to consider, eh?\" You playfully glare at Snarvar. \"If I mate with you, it's because I like you for you. The rest really doesn't factor into my decision.\" Snarvar nods at you and continues onwards. You quickly catch up to him and smile at the idea. You may have said \"if\", but what you really meant was when.</span></div></div>",

He looks down at you with a wink and breathes a small amount of fire to cook the meat on his fork before taking bites. You giggle at him and blush as you realize that he is showing off. After the two of you finish you start to get up before a soldier enters the hall looking panicked. \"My Lord, there is a tremendous army amassing in the hills! They are coming this way!\" Snarvar gets up and heads towards what you realise is the armory. \"Tarrow, get my armor ready. Feidal, prepare the troops, we are under attack. Gertrude, send word to the townspeople and open the castle doors. Every citizen is to take shelter here until this is over. I don't want any casualties.\" You look him in the eyes as you notice the fire behind them. \"What do I do?\" \"You stay here, Kimberly. I won't lose another mate or mate-to-be.\" You glare at him. \"And would you have given Lady Amara that order?\" The guard whose nose you broke the other night looks at you incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't fit to speak my beloved sisters name, child! You should feel lucky to-\" Snarvar cut him off with a deep growl, barring his long jagged teeth. \"TARROW!\" You do NOT speak to her like that! She is the Lady of the Kingdom unless she chooses to deny marriage, and even then she will still be Lady By Title and you WILL treat her with respect!\" The guard, Tarrow, shrinks back. \"Yes, my Lord. I apologise, My Lady.\" Snarvar turns to you and his features soften. \"When we first met, yes. Eventually she was trained in combat and she joined by my side in battle.\" You look at him with conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine years of TaeKwonDoe which I became a Black Belt at, Six years of Karate, Master level. Nadia and I also trained with swords, nunchucks and throwing stars. I started Archery just after my father went to jail and I can hit a bullseye from 300 meters out.

However, if you truely can defend yourself, you are needed by my side rather than here. Tarrow, get her some armor that will fit her. Then you will choose your weapons and fly with me.\" You nod and follow Tarrow, who doesn't look very happy about the turn of events. He leads you to the other side of the armory and has you put on a gleaming suit of steel armor with gold flames added around the edges. \"This was my sisters. Be careful with it. And take that ring off, the armor is enchanted to protect you better than the ring and the two enchantments would cancel eachother out.\" You place the ring on the inside of the left gauntlet just under the steel in a pocket that seems to have been created just for it. You politely thank Tarrow and pick up a sword, a sheild, a quiver with nearly 80 arrows in it and a strong and sturdy looking bow, wraping the bow around your shoulder. You walk over to Snarvar and he smiles despite himself. \"Amaras armor. I nearly burried her in it, but something told me to keep it. It's yours now, Kim, unless you want a set of your own.\" You blush. \"I'll concider what I want after all of this.\" \"Very well. Let's go.\" He has you climb on his back and the two of you take off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you fly over the army and you gasp. There must be nearly 800 soldiers down there. They all wear red armor and you think you can see a number of them with horns. Snarvar quickly explains that these are bloodkin, an offshoot elf race that embraced dark aspects of magic and curses such as vamipirism and other forms of undeath. He then notes that it appears that the undead creatures are not among the blookin in this army. The two of you see another army clad in blue and gold aproaching from the south and you hear Snarvar breathe a sigh of relief. He lands near a man with semi-long blond hair and very regal bearing and lets you off of his back. \"Will. Thank the Goddess. I feared they may have already attacked you.\" Will smiles at Snarvar. \"Not yet. It appears they wanted the 'glory' of attacking you first.\" His eyes lock onto you and he takes a step forward only to have a black arrow land right infront of his foot. A female figure clad in black cloth and steel armor with a steel faceplate steps towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down, Dog. Or do I need to put you on a leash?\" Will blushes and steps back. \"I just wanted to introduce myself.\" \"And ask her to fuck you like you did when I saved your kingdom five times before. You don't change, 'Lord' Cedric. Ask a girl out first.\" You stare at the girl wide eyed while Snarvar is chuckling and the girl does a double take looking at you. Snarvar stops laughing and sighs happily. Will just looks at the ground embarassed. \"Kim, this is the mercenary Exiler. Exiler has saved many kingdoms in the last 2 years.\" Your eyes widen at that as you realize that you know Exilers voice. \"We know each other, don't we Kitten?\" You gasp, hearing Nadias old nickname for you. \"N... Nadia?\" She nods. \"Come with me, Kitten. We'll show these bastards not to mess with the kingdoms of dragons.\" She begins to lead you away as Snarvar turns his head curiously, but he allows you to go with her and talks with Will about how to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? Nady, how are you alive? Is it really you?\" Nadia takes her faceplate off and you see the tears in her beautiful green eyes. \"I got teleported here. A cave in trapped me and I found this glowing emerald. The moment I touched it... I was here. But you can't focus on that. Not right now. After the battle, okay? I need you beside me. We'll take the freaks out from here. Promise me you will focus?\" She takes out a black bow as she talks and noks an arrow. You nod, wiping the tears from your eyes. \"Yeah. Of course. It's just so good to see you. I thought you were dead. This is the best day ever.\"</span></div></div>",

You tweaked your nipple and rolled it under your finger tips. Deciding that your underwear was getting in the way, you reluctantly withdraw your hands and unhooked your bra, slipping it off and discarding it. You quickly wiggled your way out of your panties and began your efforts again, enjoying every moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could do this every morning\", you think lustily to yourself as you moaned with pleasure. You allowed your mind to wander and soon began fantasizing about Snarvar plunging his (assumedly huge) dragonic cock inside of her. Up to that point you had been thrusting two fingers up into your virgin pussy. At the thought of being with that sexy red dragon, however, you began frigging your clit like a mad woman, and you were panting like a dog in heat and covered in sweat (as well as drool and various digestive juices). You were practically shouting at the top of your lungs for Snarvar to fuck you, and reached an earth shattering climax within seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized that your shouting must have awoken Snarvar, because you felt the chamber around you move and you heard an amused chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I thought you would be angry if I sleep-ate you,\" chuckled Snarvar warmly. \"It's good to know that when this happens you will enjoy yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush at his comment, feeling embarrassed about being caught in the act. \"Yeah, I guess I will,\" you reply sheepishly. \"Can I come out of here soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar's reply was very gentlemanly. \"Of course, Kim. It will only take a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes you are wretched up, and it takes only a few seconds for Snarvar to realize something's different. \"You're not clothed...\" he said, awestruck at your figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at him and say...</span></div></div>",

Did Kim really just say what he thought she had said? Was it really possible that she was actually in love with him? He had to be sure. It certainly didn't help him register those words when she was standing infront of him without even a single stitch of clothing on. He was respectfully trying to avert his eyes away from her moist pussy and her beautiful and slightly bouncing breasts, but his eyes wouldn't obey. Like with his previous mate, he could scarcely believe that such a beautiful creature could actually hold any love for him. His mouth was incredibly dry and he gulped. \"I-I-I-I d-don't th-think I heard you r-r-right,\" he stammered nervously. \"What did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at the response. Clearly he hadn't been expecting you to make up your mind so fast. Snarvar looked really cute when he was flustered, but you decided to have some sympathy on him. \"I said 'I love you' and 'I wish to be your mate,'\" you said confidently, thinking you knew exactly what this means. You were then hit with a sudden harsh realization that it means that your parents would never be able to attend your wedding, nor anyone else you cared about. You sat down on the bed and a few tears streamed down your cheeks. Snarvar saw this and steped closer to you, his dragonic face filled with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Kim?\" His voice a mixture of worry and love. You looked up at him with tears in your eyes, seeing the concern in his eyes and you suddenly felt safe. He opened his mouth and licked the tears off of your face, making you giggle like a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just realized that this means I'll never see my family and friends again,\" you said, all the while looking into his reptilian eyes. \"And my poor family will look for me, but never find me. I won't even be able to have my sister or mother take part in my wedding. And I won't be able to watch as my friends get married and have children and-\" you stopped short when you saw the hurt look in Snarvar's eyes. He was beginning to tear up as well, and you felt like a selfish little brat. How could you do this to him? Where you that mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry...\" His voice was filled with shame as he whispered to her. Tears were now starting to trail down his face as well. He was so selfish for bringing this poor girl to his world without thinking about how she might feel. He began to back away, positve that Kim would not want to be around such a selfish dragon right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You saw Snarvar begin to back away and place both hands on the side of his face and wiped away the tears. You began whispering to him softly. \"Snarvar, wait... Please? Please... don't leave me...\" You pressed your lips against his muzzle and began prodding his lips with your tounge. You could tell that he was shocked by this, but soon he opened his mouth slightly to accept your tounge and returned the favor with a small portion of his tounge. You noticed that it wasn't as flat as most lizard tounges, and you were somewhat thankful for that. He laid you down on your back on the bed and kissed you passionately, never sticking too much of his warm and wet tounge in, indicating that he didn't want you to choke on it. This turned you on more than your earlier \"self-service\" session did, because it showed you that he really did care about you and your well-being. You are moaning into each other's mouths lustfully, enjoying every second of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reluctantly broke the kiss and hears a disappointed moan from Snarvar. You smiled up at him, as he had you pinned on the bed and you felt someting prodding against your pussy. You looked down and saw his cock prodding you and gasped immediately. It's over 2 feet long, and around 4 and 1/2 inches wide. You shuddered at the sight of it, both with fear and lust. Snarvar was looking down at you lovingly, and you looked up at him wide-eyed, but very eager. You slowly nod at him, quietly speaking. \"I'm sorry I was so selfish... I really do want you... Be careful, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar smiled at you, kissing you again. He broke the kiss to speak for a moment. \"Kim... I'm sorry too... I was so selfish for just taking you like that... I hope you'll forgive me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, Snarvar. I really do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Snarvar began slowly thrusthing upwards, trying to both get inside of you and to let you get used to his size. You grunted and groaned slightly from the pain of him stretching you out so much, but you did't have long to dwell on it as there was an urgent knock on the door. \"My Lord, there is a rather serious problem that needs your immediate attention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar sighed and reluctantly pulled back from his progress, almost having the head of his (gorgeous) cock inside of you. You moaned in frustration and pouted slightly, though you understood that he is needed. \"We'll continue this tonight, stud.\" You poured lust int every word when you said that, and realized that Snarvar was bringing out a sexy side to you. Maybe it was because he cared so deeply about how you felt and that made you want to reward that behavior. Maybe it was just you changing for him to be the type of person he deserved to have in his life. <i>Maybe it's both,</i> you thought to yourself. All you knew for sure was that you loved him and wanted to be with him forever. Snarvar grinned at this and said \"I certainly hope so, my love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly got dressed and looked at yourself in the mirror. You had to admit, you really do like the purple and red dress you were wearing. You knew that purple was reserved for nobility and red indicated power. As soon as you were ready Snarvar told the guards to let their company in. It was a man wearing mostly black robes with a hint of purple in them. He had jet-black hair and a very pale complexion, but that wasn't what attracted your eyes first. He seemed to have glowing red eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Fentis,\" Snarvar said calmly. \"Fentis, this is Kim, my Mate-To-Be. Kim, this is my highest advisor, Fentis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFentis smiled at you, and you thought you saw two fangs where his eyeteeth should be. \"Charmed, milady. Lord, there is a very serious problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is this problem,\" Snarvar asked cooly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloodelves.\"</span></div></div>",

Then, quicker than you could comprehend, you were inside a large room in the castle with weaponry and armor around it. You guessed that this was the armory, and that it also doubled as a war room. Snarvar was talking with a group of warriors, probably generals. Fentis pulled you aside for a moment. He spoke in rushed but low tones. \"It occurs to me that you have no idea what's going on here, am I right?\" You simply nod and listen. \"As you may have guessed, I am a vampire. I can assure you that I have my bloodlust under control and that you need never worry about me harming you or anyone else in the castle or even the city.

Fentis smiled and looked towards Snarvar. \"He has made an excellent choice in you, then. His former mate was the exact same way. She was always following Lord Snarvar into battle. Reminds me of my wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a wife?\" You were slightly shocked to hear that Fentis was married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile turned into a frown. \"Had a wife. But that is a story for another day. Let's go get you fitted for your armor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later you are wearing a beautiful suit of armor made out of what you guessed was probably steel. It had ornate carved patterns in it that resembled tounges of flame. You were also wearing a steel helmet that had matching carvings. You had a sword strapped to your thigh that was forged to look like it was made out of fire and had beautiful gemstones in the hilt and a shield in your left hand that had the image of a dragon breathing fire on it. When she walked by Snarvar he did a double take. He smiled at her brightly. \"Do you like your new armor, my love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile right back. \"I love it. Fentis told me how She used to fight alongside you. Was it hers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, She was buried with her armor. It seemed indecent not to bury her in it with the number of times we fought together. So, Fentis told you about her fighting beside me. Is that why you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFentis interjected at this point. \"No, my Lord, it isn't. I suggested she stay behind and she refused. That's when I told her about Lady Amara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar's smile was now even brighter. \"Good to know I have such a brave woman at my side.\" You looked at him proudly, enjoying his words of praise. \"Don't worry if you don't know how to use a sword and shield. They're enchanted to give you the knowledge. The armor is also enchanted just like the ring, to fit and protect you from anything. No weapons can pierce it. I also added the an enchantment to give you more energy when you wear the armor so that you can run and fight without tiring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at him, concerned. \"You're not giving up your whole life to protect me, are you Lover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \"Of course not. I was in the forest when I made it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed a sigh of relief, not wanting to lose this wonderful dragon before you absolutely had to. You move in front of him and whisper \"Stay alive, my love, so we can enjoy tonight together!\"<br>\r\n\"I promise I will, Kim. You do the same for me.\"<br>\r\n\"Deal, stud!\" You leaned forward and kissed him, trying to show him how much he means to you. <i>Judging by the dazed look on his face, I succeeded!</i> You walked away from him a little way, popping your hips destinctively with each step to tease him. You turned around and blew him a kiss, giggling when someone had to get his attention. You apologized and walked over next to him, putting your dirty thoughts aside and listening to what the generals had to say. This was serious, afterall. Then you feel something drape over you, enveloping you and pulling you towards Snarvar at the same time. You realize it's his right wing. You enjoyed the feelings he stirred up in you with such a simple gesture. <i>I guess we really were made for eachother. I never thought I'd fall in love this fast, but everything he does excites me. I really would do anything for him... Even die.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listened to the generals and realize that there were atleast 400 of the bloodelves ready to attack. You felt anger rise inside of you as you think about what they would do to the poor people in the city. You can't believe that these things were stupid enough to attack your Snarvar's kingdom with such foul intentions. Snarvar turns to you and asked you a simple question. \"Do you want to ride with me or go with the soldiers?\" You think for a moment and say...</span></div></div>",

Looking down at your own armor, you realized that not only did it's flame-like carvings match the carvings on Snarvar's armor, it was also plated armor. It was kind of sweet that Snarvar wanted you to look like him, like he was claiming you as his. However, you were slightly confused about something, so you decided to ask. \"Hey Snarvar?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes Kim?\"<br>\r\n\"Why are you wearing armor anyway? don't your scales protect you?\"<br>\r\nSnarvar smiled at this. \"They do, but I have far fewer scales on my underside to protect me. The armor makes up for that.\"<br>\r\n\"Makes sense. You ready to go?\" You are somewhat eager for the battle.<br>\r\n\"I am. Climb on, my love, and we will be off.\"<br>\r\nYou didn't hesitate at all, climbing onto his back and holding on as he took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight was nearly over. Except for their leader, the bloodelves were all dead. Snarvar's army had only lost 7 men, quite a feat considering they had only 210 troops to fight against the 400 bloodelves. Snarvar was circling around the bloodelf angrily while you had your sword against his throat while he kneeled before you. Snarvar was very upset, as after this he would have to tell 7 families that their daughter, son, sister, brother, mother, or father would not be coming home. It was a small number, but he would have preffered not to have to do it at all.He was yelling at the bloodelf leader, and it honestly scared you to hear how vicious he sounded.<br>\r\n\"Why did you attack us?! What could you POSSIBLY have to gain?!?! ANSWER ME!!!\"<br>\r\nYou realized that, if what Fentis said was true, there may have been no actual reason for the attack, other than bloodlust and the chance to rape people before killing them. Suddenly it spoke in a raspy voice. \"We were hired to do it.\"<br>\r\n\"BY WHOM?!?!\" Snarvar's voice sounded like thunder now.<br>\r\n\"Lord Cedric.\"<br>\r\n\"Liar!! Who really hired you?!\"<br>\r\nBy this point you were starting to shake. You wanted to just try to calm Snarvar down so he wouldn't kill you, even though you intellectually knew he wasn't trying to scare you, and that he wouldn't ever hurt you.<br>\r\nThe bloodelf pulled a stack of papers from his pocket and handed them to you. You gave them to Snarvar as he passed by you while continuing to circle the bloodelf. He cursed and handed them back to you. He then grabbed the bloodelf and flew incredibly high. He then let go, at which point he let out a terrible roar. You sheathed your sword and began running towards the castle town. This was not your Snarvar. Snarvar could never be that cruel to someone else. You were terrified beyond reason, and when Snarvar landed in front of you you began to cower infront of him, hyperventilating, fearing that somhow he wouldn't recognize you, somehow he would be angry with you and want to kill you too. You yelled at him to stay back, and he did. He was very concerned about you, worrying what had happened to make you act so afraid. \"Kim, what's wrong? Please, tell me what's wrong.\" His voice was gentle and soothing again, but you were still afraid.<br>\r\nYou were cowering in a ball saying \"Please don't kill me! Please! I didn't do anything! Please! I want to live!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, Snarvar knew exactly what was wrong. He had frightened you when he yelled and when he had roared. He bent down and got a little closer to you, and you let him. \"Kim, I swear on everything that I hold dear that I will never harm you, intentionally or unintentionally. I love you more than anything else. I'm sorry I scared you, my love.\"<br>\r\nThis  calmed you down a bit, but you still didn't want to move. \"Please hold me, Snarvar. I need you to hold me and never let me go.\"<br>\r\nSnarvar did as he was asked and curled himself around you, his arms and wings enveloping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the two of you did move, with Snarvar carrying you back to the castle. The day was still young, and the two of you have already made amends with eachother. You now realized how crazy you were being when you thought Snarvar would ever hurt you. Well, maybe crazy wasn't the word. You were being irrational. You would trust Snarvar with your life. Snarvar began watching you carefully, making sure you were alright. You began to take off your armor when you noticed his eyes on you. <i>I was a real bitch earlier. Why not make up for it? Maybe we can finish what we started this morning.</i> At that thought your pussy grew wet as you thought about his well-endowed dragonhood plunging in and out of you. You immediately knew that neither of you were leaving this room today...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You watch Snarvar, who is looking at you with a primal hunger in his eyes. Those yellow eyes make you feel so safe. You run your hands down your body and begin to shed the suit of armor piece by piece. You start with the boots, seductively tossing each one aside. You then take your leggings off and they fall to the ground. Snarvar had already shed his armor, and was sitting on the bed watching you intently. You take off your gauntlets and sleeves as well, letting them fall to the floor to join her boots. You take off your breastplate but managed to keep your breasts and pussy covered as the rest falls off of you. You turn around and show him your ass. You are locking eyes with him in the mirror and sense his excitement. You quickly spin around, revealing your breasts and pussy for him to see. You think you must look pretty good for him to be fully hard already, his fully erect cock poking out from his slit and nearly parallel with his stomach. You saunter towards him, popping your hips seductively like you did in the war room. Snarvar is looking you in the eyes and licking his lips seductively for you. \"Oh, Gods,\" he whispers to you. \"Gods forgive me for saying this, but you look more beautiful than Amara...\" You look at him for a moment. \"You don't have to say that, Snarvar. I know that I'm just your other mate. Amara's always going to be your truelove.\" He looks at you, hurt that you would discount his feelings like that. \"That is not true, Kim. Yes, Amara may have given me children, but I would never have picked a new mate if I wasn't able to love them as much as my last. You alone have my heart, now and forever.\" You smile warmly at him. \"That's exactly what I had hoped you would say. Now show me, Stud!\"<br>\r\nSnarvar doesn't need to be told twice as he grabs ahold of your hips and pulls you to him. The two of you begin kissing passionately and intertwining your tounges in eachother's mouths as Snarvar guides you onto your back once more. His dragonhood is once again prodding your pussy, and he looks straight into your eyes, brushing aside a strand of your crimson hair and whispering to you. \"Before we start, I wanted to make sure you realize you may get pregnant from this.\"<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" you say lustily. \"I kind of want to.\"<br>\r\nHe looks like he really wants to start, but he's still kind enough to say these things before sex rather than after. \"After we mate for the first time, a mental bond will form between us. You will be able to hear my thoughts and I will be able to hear yours. Also, if you do become pregnant and survive the first time you will survive every time after. Okay, Love?\"<br>\r\nYou are smiling at him. \"Okay, my darling. And remember, I will bleed since it's my first time. I'll tell you if you start to hurt me.\" <br>\r\n\"Understood.\"<br>\r\nWith all of that out of the way, you feel him push into you. It isn't very comfortable, but it is better than this morning, so that's good. He gets the head inside of you and you can feel him against your hymen. You prepare yourself as he pushes forward, breaking through the thin barrier, eliciting a small yelp of pain from you. He stops pushing forward and kisses the tears away that are now streaming down your cheeks. <i>Oh my God... Could he be any more sweet? I think I hit the jackpot the day I met him...</i> He waits until you nod to push further in, and he goes slow so you can get used to his size. Soon enough you feel something big touching the opening to your womb, your cervix. He pushes just a little bit harder and his cock is officially in your womb. You place your right hand over your pelvis and you swear you can feel it from the outside. You are looking into eachother's eyes and you see love in his, and you hope that he also sees love in yours. You kiss as he slides further into you, eventually bottoming out by hitting the end of your uterus. You look down and see that you only got one foot in and look up at him, slightly disappointed you can't have the whole thing in you. He looks to be in heaven and you have to say you feel very full. You like the feeling and want to experience it every day for the rest of your life. He starts pushing harder, a mischievous look in his eyes. He kisses her with a new passion and she realizes what he's doing. <i>Ooooh ffffffuuuuuck, he's stretching me out. Must be the ring preventing me from tearing from his siiiIIIIZE!!!</i> \"OH GOD!\"At that moment he has brought his right hand to her clit and started rubbing. You have your very first orgasm from sex then and there, your body shaking and your mind going pleasantly numb for a while. You distantly hear someone calling out Snarvar's name and realize it's you. He's just began thrusting slowly, drawing out your orgasm, your cunt trying desperately to milk the cum from this pleasant invader. He slowly thrusts in and out, making murring noises as he thrusts. You are still looking eachother in the eyes, both silently hoping this never ends. He begins to pick up the pace and moans loudly along with you. He snakes his long tounge out of his open mouth and you begin to suck on it, you and he both moanning loudly. You two are enjoying yourselves so much that you don't care who hears you. He snakes his tounge out of your mouth and uses it to lick and slimulate your left nipple, then your right, then back into your mouth. You begin cumming for a third time and Snarvar picks up the pace of his thrusting, knowing he is getting close. \"I'm getting close now, Kim!\" You kiss the sides of his face. \"Me too, Stud! Let's cum together!\" You both last a few more seconds before his cock finally explodes deep into your body, and you cum one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you pass out before you can talk to eachother. You wake up first with a semi-erect dragon cock still inside of you, though it's shrinking fast. Snarvar wakes up and smiles at you. \"So, how was it?\"<br>\r\nYou smile back as you hold him close to you. \"Mmmmmmmmm... perfect, Stud. Can we do this forever?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, that reminds me, Kim. I forgot to tell you, you won't age now.\"<br>\r\n\"What? How's that possible?\"<br>\r\n\"It happened when I came inside of you. You now have dragon nutrients flowing through your blood making you practically immortal like me.\"<br>\r\nYou were both so interested in talking that you didn't notice you had company. A pale young woman with black hair was standing in the room with you, and she cleared her throat to get your attention. \"He's quite good, isn't he?\"<br>\r\n\"Whoareyouandwhatareyoudoinginhere?!\" you yell. <br>\r\nThe girl just smiles warmly at the two of you. Snarvar recognizes her immediately. \"This isn't possible... Amara?\"<br>\r\nYou look at her dumbfounded. \"No way!\"<br>\r\nAmara giggles and keeps smiling at you. \"That's right, Snarvar. I'm here. But I'm also not here. It's kinda hard to explain to nonghosts.\"<br>\r\nSnarvar is tearing up at seeing his long-dead love again, but holds you tighter than ever. \"Why... *ahem*\" he hesitates as he chokes back tears. \"Why are you here?\" His voice is sad, and makes you want to cry. This whole scene is so sad.<br>\r\n\"Aaww, don't cry! I came to tell you not to feel guilty about this! I understand completely, okay? So don't you <u>ever</u> feel bad about loving her. I always wanted you to be happy no matter what. So let her into your heart, okay? She's very special! And you guys can be together forever, I promise.\"<br>\r\nSnarvar clears his throat and smiles at you with tears in his eyes. \"She really is, Amara. I love her as much as I loved you. Maybe more...\"<br>\r\nYou look into his eyes as he says that, amazed. \"Really? You love me more than her?\"<br>\r\n\"I... I do,\" he said, looking deeply into your eyes.<br>\r\nAmara giggles again. \"Good! I always knew you had a big heart! How else could you get so much bloodflow to your huge cock?\" She turns to you next. \"Oh, and congratulations on the baby! You will survive, I promise!\"<br>\r\n\"Baby? What ba- wait, did he just get me pregnant?!\"<br>\r\n\"He sure did! It's growing as we speak!\"<br>\r\nNow your eyes are tearing up, but it's a combination of joy and sadness. Snarvar kisses you and takes your hands in his, showing you how excited he is. \"And you promise not to die, alright?\" he asks me, almost demanding it. You smile at him. \"Of course I promise.\"<br>\r\nAmara seemed to be getting teary-eyed as well. \"Gods, this is so romantic! I need to leave, you two take care of eachother! And don't let me get in the way!\"<br>\r\nShe vanishes into a cloud of smoke and everything seems peaceful. Then you start to laugh joyfully and fidget. Snarvar is grinning and laughs as well. \"We're going to have a baby!\" you yell together. You proceed to celebrate with sex for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up to a dark surrounding again and know what to do right away. You feel your surroundings and know you are...</span></div></div>",

I hope we have more days like that in the future!</i> You remember Snarvar saying you now shared a mental bond, so you immediately start reliving yesterday in your head. It works, as you feel everything around you move. You hear Snarvar's voice in the back of your head speaking to you. <u><i>Good morning, Kim. Sorry I ate you again.</i></u> <i>It's no problem, Snarvar. I take it as a compliment! I must really be tasty, huh?</i> <u><i>Like you wouldn't believe. But I still wish I had better self control while I sleep.</i></u> <i>That's okay, Snarvar. As  long as I wear the ring I'll be okay, so I just won't take it off. Can I come out now? I can't kiss you from the inside, can I?</i><br>\r\nYou're outside your love and somewhat cold, still covered in his juices, but you  don't really mind. Gertrude is helping to clean you off, all the while smiling knowingly at you. Finally you decide to ask her the obvious question. \"Uh, Gertrude, why do you keep staring at me like that?\" \"Because, my dear, I know about the egg inside of you.\" You look at her, sort of creeped out. \"How could you possibly know that already?! Am I showing?! Am I already getting fat?!\" Snarvar hears this and walks over, putting his arms around your wast from behind, pulling you towards him and kissing your cheek. \"If you're fat, I'm a howler monkey, Lover-girl.\" You lean back into his embrace, feeling assured that 1 your mate loves you and 2 you're not fat. Gertrude laughs at this. \"Then it was real. I had a vision of my daughter last night and she told me how Lord Snarvar was finally letting someone else into his heart, and that person was now pregnant with his child. I'm glad to see that it's you!\" Snarvar smiles at you, his yellow eyes still so enchanting. <u><i>I love you, Kim. If you'll accept, I'd like to have our wedding today, free for all to attend.</i></u> <i>I love you, Snarvar. I do accept! Nothing in the world would make me happier!</i> He holds you closer and you swear he's trying to pull you inside of him. You think you still have to get used to the idea that your thoughts are no longer completely private, but that somehow makes it that much more intimate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are dressed in a purple and blue wedding gown and blushing profusely. <i>I can't believe I'm getting married! Wow!! How do I look? Is my make-up on well? God, these shoes are killing me!</i> <u><i>Kim, calm down! I'm sure you look beautiful! Besides, I don't care about how make-up looks on you. It takes away from your natural beauty. So please, just relax.</i></u> <i>Okay, you're right. I just want to look my best for you is all. You're my mate and I want you to think of me when you're with other girls.</i> <u><i>That's understandable. But realize that I'm mating with you. I only have sex with others. I love you now and forever. That whole thing about courting others really bugs you, huh?</i></u> <i>I'm getting used to it. It doesn't feel good knowing that you'll be with other women and using me to make deals sweeter, but I guess I'll just have to get used to it.</i> <u><i>Kim, I will always always always give youthe final word in whom you court.

Now you were walking down the isle with a purple and red bouquet in your hands to the awaiting Snarvar, the beautiful red dragon who stole your heart and wouldn't give it back. You could hear his thoughts in your head and blushed even brighter red. <u><i>Wow... Kim... I was wrong earlier. You look far better than just beautiful. You look... Wow...

He looks so handsome that you're having trouble not throwing the bouquet and riding him like a horse infront of everyone. The priest says the usual stuff about being gathered on this occasion to celebrate your union, and you smile to yourself, thinking about how the <b>real</b> celebration of your union is growing inside of you now. Snarvar picks up on this thought and quickly glances down at your pelvis where your child is growing, and lets out an excited murr. The priest is droning on and on about how holy marriage is while the two of you are already considering what to name your child. <i>What if it's a girl? She'll need a good name, something sweet...</i><br>\r\n<u><i>What about Setiri? It's ancient dragon tounge for spring.</i></u><br>\r\n<i>Perfect! What if it's a boy?

Snarvar is concerned about how he's going to approach the issue with Lord Cedric. <u><i>The problem isn't just my problem, it's our problem. I owe a debt to his family that you and I need to repay together.</i></u><br>\r\n<i>Snarvar, I get it. I really do. But that debt is complete crap! Plus, I don't want to risk never being able to talk to you again over some stupid ages-old debt! I love you, not him! Think about it: You were just a kid. You grew up just fine and have a mate who adores you with a child on the way! Do you really want to risk throwing that all away over a stupid mistake you made as a kid?!</i><br>\r\n<u><i>But my father came up with the punishment to teach me a lesson.</i></u><br>\r\nYou think back to your own father and the things he used to do to you. <i>Snarvar, just because a man is your father doesn't mean that they are right, or good for you.</i><br>\r\nSnarvar senses the pain you in your last sentence and grows worried. <u><i>Kim, is there something about yourself you haven't shared with me? About your father?</i></u><br>\r\nYou sigh aloud. <i>No sense keeping it a secret, I guess. My father was a very angry man.</i> You both stop walking and Snarvar looks into your eyes as you \"speak\" to him. <i>He used to get drunk often and hit my mother and I when he thought we were doing something wrong. And when I turned 13 he... used to do things to me. Rubbing my breasts, squeezing my ass, that sort of sick thing. One night he was realky drunk and he stumbled into my room. He grabbed my cheeks and he...he... He tried to use me in my mouth!</i> You begin to cry and shake uncontrollably. Snarvar grabs onto you and pulls you into his arms and wings, allowing you to cry into him and let the emotions out.<br>\r\nSnarvar holds onto you the entire time you cry, repeating the same words over and over again. \"It's okay to cry. He won't ever touch you again. I promise he won't.\"<br>\r\nYou sniff and look up into his eyes. This is your one and only mate. You will never love anyone else like you love him. This caring dragon has got to have the biggest heart in the world to be able to put up with you. You kiss him and rest your head on his shoulder. <u><i>I see your point, Kim. Maybe my father was just trying to save himself the embarrassment of having his son killed by a human. I will find a way to erase this debt without resorting to my father's arrangement with Cedric's great grandfather. I promise you.</i></u><br>\r\n  \"Thank you,\" you say meekly, your head still resting on your mate's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you are interupted by a low moan. You look around and see a man lying on the ground wearing some weird black clothing and a mask over his face. The two of you get close to him and you bend down. \"What's wrong?\" Then you notice the rips in his clothing, and the blood pouring out of the wounds underneath the clothing. \"What happened to you?\" you ask in shock. He moves his head and speaks in a weak voice. \"I know you... Kim?\" You urgently take his mask off of him. \"JOHN?!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Snarvar lands in the castle courtyard carrying you on his back and John in his arms. John really doesn't look well and you are worried for his saftey. <u><i>We need to get him to the chapel. One of the priests there has experience as a healer.</i></u><br>\r\n<i>Thank you Snarvar! This really means alot to me!</i><br>\r\nThe two of you run through the castle's dinning hall where everyone is eating breakfast to get to the chapel. Upon seeing You and Snarvar running through the hall with a bleeding body Fentis, Gertrude, and a number of other members of Snarvar's court follow you, offering their help. When you reach the chapel you find that somebody had run ahead and alerted the priest that you were coming.<br>\r\n\"Set him on the altar. I'll do what I can to save him.\"<br>\r\nYou're glad you found John when you did. As bad as he looked before, he looks on the edge of death now. The priest is muttering incantations and you saw a few of John's wounds closing, but not all of them. The priest keeps muttering and muttering, but it isn't doing any good. Suddenly John begins coughing up blood, looking like he was choking on it. The priest looks up at you with a somber expression, and you know it doesn't look good. Suddenly Fentis is whispering to Snarvar, and you can feel a glimpse of hope through your bond. He nods and Fentis addresses both you and John. \"I know of a way that might save the boy, but it is very dangerous.\"<br>\r\nYou are desperate to save John. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n\"I can attempt to turn him into one of my kind and that may heal his wounds. I would then administer an antidote which will cure him of the early-stage vampirism, making him human again.\"<br>\r\nYou are a little leery of that idea. \"And what's the dangerous part?\"<br>\r\nFentis sighs deeply, apparently not liking the idea any more than you. \"My bite may kill him.\"<br>\r\nThe priest interjects at this point. \"If we don't do something soon, he will die anyway!\"<br>\r\nYou look down at John and he nods and puts his hand up beside you, which you grab. \"Do it quickly,\" you say. \"Before I lose my friend.\"<br>\r\nFentis leans down and bites John, who squeezes your hand as the teeth sink into his neck. You feel the hand you are holding onto go slack, and fall out of your hands as his eyes close and his skin grows pale. You can't believe you just found one of your old friends only to lose him so quickly. You feel numb and don't want to believe he is dead. You hear Snarvar's voice in your head offering comfort. <u><i>Kim... I'm so sorry...</i></u>Then you notice his wounds are rapidly knitting themselves back together. You can't believe what you are seeing. Fentis quickly poured the antidote into his mouth and his skin almost instantly returns to a healthy pinkish color, and he jolts upwards, gasping for air. You breath a sigh of relief before punching John in the arm.<br>\r\n\"Ow! What was that for?!\"<br>\r\n\"Making me think you were dead, you jerk!\" You have a smile on your face even as you yell at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later You, Snarvar, and John are in the room you and Snarvar share with John explaining how he got to this world. \"Well, I was exploring this old cave for a company that wanted some rock formations catalogued.\"<br>\r\n\"I remember that company,\" you say. \"Earth Enterprise, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Exactly. So I'm exploring the cave and I notice a strange formation in one of the rocks. It was a fossil, some old bones of some kind of dinosaur. Then I realize that this creature couldn't be any normal dinosaur, since it was obviously a carnivore, but it was too small to be a tyrannosaurus and too large to be a raptor. I look closely and I see what appear to be wings jutting out from its back. I knew right then that the dragon stories were true. This creature was a living dragon at some point. That's when I called you, remember?\"<br>\r\nYou nod. \"Yeah, of course I remember! I always thought that was the last conversation I'd ever have with you until just a couple of minutes ago!\"<br>\r\n\"Right,\" he frowned. \"Sorry about that. Anyway, after I told you that you had to see it I stepped wrong and fell through the rocks I had been standing on.\" They colapsed and I landed in a big room with a glowing white sphere in the center of the room. I reached out and touched it and it brought me here. Unfortunately it was a one way trip, so I couldn't get back to tell anyone what I saw. Though I do get along well here. How about you, how'd you get here Kim?\"<br>\r\nYou share your story with John, leaving out some of the more intimate details.<br>\r\nJohn smiles at Snarvar. \"Hope you take good care of her, Snarvar. She's worth <u>your</u> weight in gold!\"<br>\r\nSnarvar smiles and kisses your lips. \"Don't I know it.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this place is quite the case of culture shock. Imagine my surprise when this noble and I are bartering my payment for a job I did for a job I did and he throws in a night with his wife! I'm standing there going 'wait, what?!' And I tell him I'd rather have cash and he gets offended! I had to make up some story about being from a different continent and he explains to me that you guys ofer spouses to sweeten deals, so I tell him that while his wife is indeed beautiful, I'm not comfortable sleeping with another man's wife, so I'll gladly accept his previous offer!\"<br>\r\nWait a second, You think you just heard something you and Snarvar could use. \"What kind of job were you doing for the nobleman?\"<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"I'd hoped that part would catch your attention. I do mercenary work from time to time under the alias 'the Exile'.  I wanted to tell you two that, as a way of saying thank you I am more than willing to do any job for you free of charge. However it looks like I may need a new outfit before that happens.\"<br>\r\nYou and Snarvar grin at eachother, and you speak through your bond. <u><i>I think your friend may be the solution to our problems with Lord Cedric and his family, my darling.</i></u><br>\r\n<i>I agree, Lover. Let's set up the details first, then approach him with it tomorrow.</i><br>\r\nYou feel a sense of pride in John that he has  been so successful even here. You quickly surpress that feeling, not wanting to bring back your old feelings for him.<br>\r\nSnarvar speaks suddenly, causing you to quickly get your thoughts back in order and listen. \"Well, John, why don't you follow Gertrude here. She'll see to it that you get cleaned up and get you some decent clothes and something to eat and drink. You can stay with us in the castle in one of the spare bedrooms.\"<br>\r\nHe nods and follows Gertrude out the door and it closes behind him. You look up at Snarvar for a long while, wondering just what he picked up from your mind.<br>\r\n<u><i>I picked up all of it, my Love. You loved him when he was on in your world, and he loved you. You were devastated when he never returned and overjoyed when we found and rescued him. You do remember what I said, right? You may take him as your mate.</i></u><br>\r\n<i>But what about you? I <b>love</b> you! I <b>adore</b> you. I want to be with you forever!</i><br>\r\nSnarvar turned his head quizzically. <u><i>What <b>about</b> me, dearest? I will still be here. I don't mind you having another mate as long as I still have you by my side as my queen and mate as well.</i></u><br>\r\n<i>So you just don't care?! I see! So you're just going to go off and find another mate if the feeling strikes you and you expect me to do the same!</i><br>\r\n<u><i>Sweetheart, please listen...</i></u><br>\r\nAt this point you are glaring at Snarvar. <i>I've \"listened\" enough! All you want from me is to be some little fucktoy whenever you get horny and you can just toss me aside and loan me out to others like I was a thing!! I thought you loved me!! I thought you thought I was special!! I don't EVER want to see you again!! EVER!!!</i> You rip the ring he gave you off of your finger and throw it at him.You then... </span></div></div>",

It is starting to scare you, because he is just staring at you. He may be mad. Could You blame him? You did just yell at him that you never wanted to see him again. You don't even know why you said it. It was like it was another person. You honestly wish you could take it all back. Then you understand his emotion. He is hurt, in emotional pain, and is numb trying to process what you just said. God, you are such a bitch! This is the second time you've hurt him emotionally, and this time you don't know why you did it. You hate yourself now. Snarvar finally moves and picks up the ring you threw at him. You still can't feel his feelings or hear his thoughts, and that's scary to you. \"Snarvar?\" He doesn't respond, he just looks at the ring. \"Snarvar?\" He still won't look at you, and you can't really blame him. God, why can't you feel him? You miss that having him in your mind. \"Snarvar, please... I'm sorry! I don't have any idea why I flipped out! I'm never like that! Please talk to me!\"<br>\r\n\"Leave.\"<br>\r\nThat one little word cut you like a knife. You begin to cry again. \"Snarvar, no, please, we can work it out! I'm sorry! Please don't make me leave! I love you! Please!\"<br>\r\n\"Leave now.\"<br>\r\nSnarvnar, the creature you thought loved you more than anyone else was kicking you out. You stand up and walk towards him, tears streaming down your face. You kneel down in front of him, waiting to hear him yell, and wincing when he does. \"I said LEAVE!\"<br>\r\nYou bow your head down, simply wanting to die. \"Then kill me,\" you whisper. This takes him by surprise. \"What?\"<br>\r\n\"I said 'kill me'.\"<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Becase you are killing me inside.\"<br>\r\n\"I could <b><i>never</i></b> kill you.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes you could... You have the ring. Breathe fire. Bite my head off. Swallow me whole. Please. You already shut me out of your mind somehow. I don't want to leave you, so if you really want me gone you have to kill me! Do it! Show me you don't... love\u00a0 me anymore...\"<br>\r\nHe bends down and you close your eyes. If he really is going to kill you you won't move to stop him. He grabs your left hand and slips the ring back on your finger before embracing you. You realize your shoulder is wet and you look over to see he is crying. \"I love you too much to kill you...\"<br>\r\n\"I'm so, so sorry, Snarvar! I really am! I hate myself so much for yelling at you. I don't know why I even yelled at you. You were right, I do want John as my mate. I want you both! I want him, but I need you, Snarvar.\" He nodded. \"I know, Kim. I'm sorry I shut down our bond, that was cruel.\"<br>\r\n\"Can you bring it back? I miss you in my head.\"<br>\r\n\"Not without putting fresh semen inside of you.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n\"Before we have make-up sex, I think I know why you said what you said.\"<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Because you are pregnant with a dragon egg. Your hormones are going crazy and making you say and do stuff you wouldn't normally do. If you wish, we can find a way to turn you into a dragoness. Then you will be able to manage your hormones better.\"</span></div></div>",

He hid nothing from his past, showing you all of what made him who you are, and you embraced the knowledge again. That was how you knew of the debt, earlier, and how you know exactly how many dragons were born from his mother. There were darker elements to this as well, such as why he wanted you to have a human mate, but you prefer to remain positive. You also realized that it was rare for a dragon male not to change his human female mate's name, which made you feel extra special. <i><u>I like your name just the way it is, Saphire.</u></i><br>\r\n<i>Thank you Sn-Wait, what?</i><br>\r\n<i><u>Just kidding, Kim.</u></i><br>\r\n<i>That's it, no more sex today.</i><br>\r\n<i><u>Kim, come on.

I love it when you roll your hips. It feels so good!</u></i><br>\r\n<i>Snarvar, do you mind if I look through what you used to do with Amara in bed? I just want to get a few tips on how to make it better for you.</i><br>\r\n<i><u>Go right ahead, like you said, you have unlimited access.</u></i><br>\r\n<i>..............Holy shit! You two were kinky! Wow!</i><br>\r\n<i><u>That's not bad, right?</u></i><br>\r\n<i>Not at all! I love kinky! Shows imagination! She really gave you oral? How did she survive?</i><br>\r\n<i><u>It's the ring. She knew I loved oral.</u></i><br>\r\n<i>I'll just have to remember that for later.</i><br>\r\n<i><u>You really love this, don't you?</u></i><br>\r\n<i>I do. There's a kink in your mind that makes me wonder. You loved it when she went topless for you. Did she ever do bottomless?</i><br>\r\n<i><u>Bottomless? No. Not even sure what that is.</u></i><br>\r\n<i>It would be if I put a shirt on but no pants or panties right now.</i><br>\r\n<i><u>Wow, that sounds REALLY hot!</u></i><br>\r\n<i>I promise to show you tomorrow.</i><br>\r\n<i><u>I can't wait!</u></i><br>\r\n<i>Snarvar, why didn't you tell me that by the end of her life she resembled a human-size wingless dragon? According to your memories that is normal durring pregnancy, and that it might happen to me as well.</i><br>\r\n<i><u>I didn't know how you would react. Besides, I never loved her for the scales on her body, I loved her for being her.</u></i><br>\r\n<i>Is it permanent?</i><br>\r\n<i><u>Rarely.</u></i><br>\r\n<i>That's kinda too bad. I'd love to walk around looking like that.</i><br>\r\n<i><u>Maybe you'll get the chance, my love.</u></i><br>\r\n<i>I really hope so. She really sneezed fire?!</i><br>\r\n<i><u>Once, yes. We were just lucky it wasn't in the city or there would have been more problems.</u></i><br>\r\n<i>Cool.</i><br>\r\n\"You don't know the half of it!\"<br>\r\nThe two of you turned your heads towards the source of the voice you just heard and once again see Amara. \"Hello again Kim, Snarvar.\"<br>\r\nWow, She's in front of you again, but this time she looks concerned. \"I wanted to talk to you two about what I saw when I watched you today. Snarvar, I know that you love Kim. And Kim, I know that you love Snarvar. But what I saw today needs to stop.\"<br>\r\nYou blush and glance away for a moment, preparing for a scolding you know you deserve.<br>\r\nAmara pauses for a moment to gather her thoughts. \"Look, to address the question I know you are begging to ask, I am going to pop in from time to time. You won't always see me, but you will both know that I'm there. I will be there holding your hand when you give birth. No mother should ever have to do that alone. Second, Kim, I get it. I have been in your shoes and I know just how hard it is to control your pregnancy hormones. But don't EVER throw around those evil words you said. You know he loves and cares for you. He had a couple of mates when I was alive. For him, you are his true mate. He may wander around, but at the end of the day it's you wearing the ring in his stomach, not them.\" This makes you smile. That's one thing you don't really want to change. Third, don't ever tempt an angry dragon. I'm not going to lie, I was 1 second away from breaking the two of you up. I was scared that he really was going to kill you, and I'm dead. I don't scare too easily any more.\" Snarvar bows his head in shame, angry with himself for letting it get too far. \"Chin up, sexy.\" He lifts his head and gets a kiss from you as a reward. You both look to Amara again. \"Fourth, that ring isn't to be removed. He is so strong it's scary. He could accidentally hurt you doing the simplest of things. Fifth, never tell your lover to leave in a harsh and callus tone. I could feel Kim's emotions and that hurt worse than being stabbed. That is on the same level of verbal abuse and it is a terrible thing to do to someone who loves you. And finally sixth, never cut off the mental bond you share. That was cruel and should never happen again. You learn much more about eachother when use it and taking it away is not only mean, it deprives you both of the ability to put yourselves in your mate's position. Now I'm done scolding you two for today. I love you both very much and want to see you happy.\"<br>\r\nThe two of you smile at her and tear-up at her final words. \"I love you too, Amara.\" You heard him say that last time, but this time Snarvar didn't sound quite so sad.<br>\r\nAmara giggled at him, looking happy. \"You've done such a great job of opening your heart to her so far. Keep it up! Oh, and Kim, put your hand on the back of your neck. The scales always start there. Goodbye, you two!\"<br>\r\nAfter she has disappeared you put your hand on the back of your neck. Sure enough, you feel a small patch of scales!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you make plans to help John eliminate Snarvar's debt and promptly spend the rest of the day having sex. You wake up in the morning and immediately know you are...</span></div></div>",

You are awake. How are you feeling?</i></u><br>\r\n<i>Well, I'm honestly a little disappointed, Snarvar.</i><br>\r\n<u><i>Why is that, Kim?

Laugh it up, Lizzie!\"<br>\r\nYou smile at the Childhood nickname while Snarvar searches your memories to make sense of why he called you \"Lizzie\". <i>Let me save you some time, Lover. When I was a little girl A boy picked up a gecko and dropped it on my shoulder. Instead of screaming like most little girls wold do, I started petting it. The boys in my school were facinated by this, so they all called me \"Lizard Queen\". When I met John in the 3rd grade, I told him about this and he started occasionally calling me \"Lizzie\". From anyone else it would have been insulting, but from him it was endearing.</i><br>\r\n<i><u>Ah, so you've always had a thing for lizards! I'm glad you do, otherwise you might not be my mate.</u></i><br>\r\nYou shove Snarvar playfully and laugh.<br>\r\nJohn sighs. \"Look, If you're going to talk without words then atleast warn a guy. I had enough of being ignored back on our homeworld.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry. By the way, how did you know we can talk in eachother's minds?\"<br>\r\n\"A dragoness I did a job for a while back told me about what happens When dragons mate with humans. I consider information valuable, so I accepted her explaination as payment. She wanted to pay me in... other methods, but I was afraid she'd kill me by accident, since her scales formed spikes all over her body.\"<br>\r\nSnarvar interjects. \"A wise choice. Those spikes can really hurt a dragon durring mating. They would have ripped you apart without some form of protection.\"<br>\r\nYou think back to when you and Snarvar found John. \"Is that what hurt you so bad? Did she take offense?\"<br>\r\n\"Nah. It was a trio of bloodelves. Apparently they were the only survivors of some conflict around here, and they were yelling about trying to find a new leader. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and got the tar beat out of me. I'm just glad my adrenaline kicked in and I killed those jerks before they could kill anyone else. I ran towards the city for medical help, collapsed, then you found me.\"<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel really guilty about his attack. Maybe if you had fought harder those three wouldn't have...<br>\r\n<i><u>Kim, it isn't your fault. If you want someone to blame, blame Lord Cedric.</u></i><br>\r\n<i>You're right, Snarvar.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you fill John in on the details you come to realize that Snarvar may be right about how you still feel about John. You think back to the time you had together, and how crushed you were to learn that nobody could find any trace of him, like he had vanished into thin air. He had always treated you with respect and knew exactly how to make you laugh. In a way, he is just like Snarvar. Both wanted you to be happy and were willing to go to extreme lengths to help you. After all of this was over, you think you may want to ask Snarvar if he will truly let you mate with John.<br>\r\n\"Wait a second, let me get this straight. You wanted to court a woman when you were younger, but you were still essentially a kid and you went about it the wrong way. As a punishment, your own father suggested a ritual that is not only degrading for two of the three parties involved designed specifically to make it possible that you could loose her forever and never talk to eachother again. Right?\"<br>\r\nYou and Snarvar nod at the same time.<br>\r\n\"Not content with the possibility of making you miserable, the grandson of the woman you courted who would be taking part in this evil ritual recently made an attempt to take your city by sending in a horde of bloodelves to go on a murderous rampage?\"<br>\r\nThe two of you nod again.<br>\r\n\"And, to top it all off, you got the contract to prove his involvement in attack which in essence reunited Kim and I. And he just happens to want a large and profitable portion of your land. <b>And</b> Kim has only just recently talked you out of the ritual. Is that about the size of it?\"<br>\r\nYou both nod once again.<br>\r\n\"I'm in. Nobody tries to break you two up without dealing with me. And what's more is I'll do it for free. Consider it a gift for saving my life. You ready to do this?\"<br>\r\n\"Almost,\" you say. \"There's one more thing that you need to know. I'm pregnant with Snarvar's baby, and very few people know about it right now. I'd like to keep it that way for a while, but I thought you should know.\"<br>\r\nHe looks shocked, then smiles. \"Congrats! I'll make sure the baby stays safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a 30 minute trip, the two of you are dismounting Snarvar's back. The three of you have agreed to tell everyone here that you are Snarvar's mate-to-be and that John is a bodyguard snarvar brought along to protect you. He is now wearing silver armor with a gold dragon on the breastpiece. The three of you walk up to the doors of the castle. You are greeted by a young woman, apparently a handmaiden. \"Oh, Lord Snarvar! Come in! I'll let Lord Cedric know he has visitors.\"<br>\r\nThe three of you are escorted in and it isn't long before you meet Lord William Cedric. Snarvar is incredibly polite to the trecherous snake, although you think this guy might take that as a compliment. He has brown hair and blue eyes, is wearing some silver armor and a purple cape with red trim, and looks rather young to be running a castle. His goatee/mustache combo looks rediculous and hackneyed. He kisses your hand and you repress the urge to vomit. You despise the idea of him touching you, wanting to leave, but knowing that you have to stay around him. You know he wants you, and you know you want him... to jump off a cliff.<br>\r\n\"To what do I owe the pleasure, Lord Snarvar? Surely there is a reason for this unexpected pleasure?\"<br>\r\n\"Lord William Cedric, this is my mate-to-be, Kim. I'm showing her the kingdoms of the land so that she knows who runs what areas and what is expected of her.\"<br>\r\n\"'Mate-to-be'? I'd heard you had just been married.\"<br>\r\nSnarvar smiled cooly. \"We haven't consumated it yet.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see! You're very lucky, Lord Snarvar. Men would kill for such a beauty at their side.\"<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you should show her around. Get to know eachother.\"<br>\r\n\"An excellent idea. Are you coming along, Lord Snarvar?\"<br>\r\n\"No, but my bodygaurd Cicero is. Can't be too careful after that bloodelf attack. I need to speak with your priest for a moment.\"<br>\r\n\"A grand idea, Lord Snarvar. One can never be too careful! My dear?\" He holds out his elbow and you take it, faking a smile. <i>Snarvar, if he tries anything I'm cutting his manhood off.</i><br>\r\n<i><u>Agreed. Let's just hope \"Cicero\" hurries.</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through the tour, John delivers his lines perfectly. \"Is there somewhere I can stop for... relief?\"<br>\r\n\"Ah yes. Down the hall, take the first left, then it's the forth door on the right.\"<br>\r\n\"This armor is going to be hard to get out of. Are you okay with going on without me?\"<br>\r\nYou step forward. \"We understand, Cicero. Go ahead, Lord Cedric will take care of me.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll catch up with you, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCedric finishes his tour, not surprisingly, with his bedroom, acting very cocky. \"And this, dear lady, would be my bed quarters. Come right in, we can wait for Cicero in here.\" You fake a smile and enter the room, feigning innocence. You know exactly why he brought you here, and your stomach was crawling at the thought. You hope John gets here soon.<br>\r\n\"So, how did you and Lord Snarvar meet?\"<br>\r\nYou speak in excited tones as you recall your lines. \"He appeared near my camp in the middle of the night and brought me here.\"<br>\r\n\"No explaination? That beast!\"<br>\r\n\"He told me he hadn't had the time, that he could only be in my world for a small period of time if he wanted to return.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course he said that! That filthy liar would say anything to keep you here! Don't you see? He kidnapped you and trapped you here. That filthy animal doesn't care about you!\"<br>\r\nYou smile inwardly. <i>Bastard. He can't even tell I'm playing him!</i> \"But...\" you force a tear to role down your cheek. <i>Thank you, acting lessons!</i> \"But he told me... he loved me...\"<br>\r\n\"There there... It's never easy finding out you've been fooled.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly two swords appeared from out of the darkness behind Cedric, held by John like a pair of scissors at his neck. You lean in and whisper \"you outta know...\" You lift your head up and look at John while you move away from Cedric, who was already starting to sweat. \"What took you?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" John said. \"I got sidetracked by his great grandfather's journals. It appears deception runs in the family. Snarvar's innocent. He was set up and I have the proof right here.\" You smile at this.<br>\r\nLord Cedric seemed to grow a backbone for a moment. \"Now see here! You can't take those, they're mine. They belong to my...family?\" He squeaked out the word family as John tigtened the makeshift scissors slightly. You grin maliciously. \"Snarvar and I found the contract you made with te bloodelves, William. John just retrieved the letter they sent you agreeing to invade our castle for the gold you sent them. And it looks like your grandfather conned Snarvar's father into making that deal.\"<br>\r\n\"How do you know about that?!\"<br>\r\nYou continue to smirk, loving every second of this. \"Because I'm not his mate-to-be, I'm his mate. We share a bond and I know <b>everything</b> he knows, and he knows everything I know. And William, I know you're going to be dragon food for trying to have us killed and for trying to seduce me. You didn't even ask first. What a shame.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Lord William Cedric, John, Snarvar, and Lord Bartholomew Cedric (Who you gathered was William's father) all stood in what was formerly William's court. Bartholomew was addressing you while reading the journals. \"I see. Well, Lord Snarvar, it seems I owe you a long-overdue apology. I knew my grandfather wanted your land, but I never thought he'd sink so low as to tell my mother to try to seduce you. It says here that when you were to fulfill the debt, you would have been distraught no matter the outcome due to the potion's effects, whether it was from losing your mate or putting her through such a degrading ordeal. You wouldn't have been fit to rule and would have been open to an attack. I'm glad this is cleared up, old friend.\"<br>\r\nYou smiled watching Snarvar look as though a huge weight was lifted from him. \"As for my son, he has shamed me terribly. I leave his fate in your hands. I know that if it were up to me he would be executed.\"<br>\r\n<i><u>What do you think, Love?</u></i><br>\r\nYou smile at Snarvar. Even in this matter he trusts your council. <i>I say...</i></span></div></div>",

I'd love to know that the descendent of the man who framed you was dying in one of the most agonizing ways possible. And I think we owe the dead soldiers' families the knowledge that the one ultimately responsible for their loved ones' death died in a slow and agonizing way.</i><br>\r\nSnarvar smiles at you. <i><u>Spoken like a true dragoness, my Love.</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush at the compliment and turn towards Bartholomew. \"Have you come to a decision on what to do with him?\" Snarvar nods his head. \"I am going to swallow him, whole and alive, so that he can feel a small amount of the torture that the families of my dead soldiers feel.\"<br>\r\nBartholomew nodded his head. \"I understand. While it is a shame that I am loosing a son, I have another who is far more worthy of the crown than him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar nods and picks up the bound former-Lord William Cedric and walks away with you and John close behind. Once you exit the castle wall, Snarvar sighs. \"I realy wish it didn't have to come to this, William. I truly thought you were my friend.\" You walk up to him as he puts William down and grab hold of his hand. You give it a quick sqeeze before releasing it and glaring at the terrified Wiliam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar grabbed William by the shoulders and brought his head into his mouth first. You could sense that Snarvar did't usually eat his prey clothed since cloathing tasted terrible, but he didn't want to give William the satisfaction of disrobing him. He violtently shoves more of William into his mouth as he gulps down the parts inside of him already. He does this quickly, not deriving any pleasure from it like you sense he does when he sleep-eats you. Snarvar lets go of William and tilts his head back, letting gravity make it easier. Finally his legs are the only thing left of William outside of Snarvar's mouth, and those are soon sucked inside and sent down his throat. You smile at Snarvar, who smiles back at you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<i>Finally gone! Now I never have to worry about having to court that jerk and risk losing you!</i><br>\r\n<i><u>I know what you mean. I feel like that I had a curse hanging over me, and now it's over! Finally I can honestly say that you and I will be together until death.</u></i><br>\r\n<i>I love you, Snarvar.

John was shocked. \"So you're sure you want me as a mate?\"<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n\"Then I have no choice but to leave.\"<br>\r\n\"What?! Why?!\"<br>\r\n\"Because I simply can't do that. I'm a very jealous person and I would want you all to myself. Trust me, it works better for us all this way.\"<br>\r\nYou know when John is lying, and he's lying right to your face. \"Fine. Leave. Door's right there.\"<br>\r\nHe hesitates and you know that he does want to be your mate. \"I knew it.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you want from me, Kim?\"<br>\r\n\"How about the truth!?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You all want the truth. Fine. Truth is I'm not willing to give up my pride just yet. You don't get it, Kim. For three long years I resigned myself to never seeing you again. Just when I think I'm finally ready to move on you show up again and ruin it all! Now I  can't stop thinking about you and the body I never got to touch! I had finally had control over my life here and just by being here you've thrown it all out the window. I can't be with you because I resent you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare at him, and Snarvar is growling. \"Quit lying to me! I know you too well! What are you afraid of, huh? You think I'm going to just up and die like your parents-\"<br>\r\nHis head falls and he slouches over.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God... That's it, isn't it? You think I'm just going to die somehow and you won't be able to stop it. That's why you won't get close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar stops growling. You're surprised how well he tunes into your emotions. John nods slightly. \"That's the way my luck runs. But that's not the whole story. The truth is I did get over you. Within my second year here I did a job for a man who was down on his luck. He had too many debts and he couldn't feed his daughter, Kara. Someone had kidnapped her and was holding her hostage in exchange for money he didn't have. I did the job free of charge, went out, found his daughter, and brought her back. On the long trip back we fell in love and one night nature just took its course. We both agreed that we wanted to be together. When we got back her father was overjoyed, especially when she told him I wanted to marry her. He refused to take any money from me, saying that my only payment needed to be to give her a good life and get her as far away from the slum they were living in as possible. I eventually talked him into taking some money so he could atleast afford to eat. We found a new home together and it wasn't long before she was pregnant. One day I left to go hunting and I came back and our home was trashed. I found her in the corner of our bedroom, bleeding and crying. The real reason her father had wanted us to leave was because he knew there was a man who jealously loved his daughter, but was too selfish to pay the dowry. I was on my way here to ask for protection for my new family when the bloodelves attacked me. The home is on your property, so I thought it was the best thing I could do. She's staying with a cousin who lives here, waiting for a reply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Snarvar, we have to help them.</i> <i><u>I agree, but it is imperative that I mate with this woman.</u></i> <i>Can't you stop thinking about sex for one moment?!</i> <i><u>Of course I can, but I really do need to mate with her. If I do that I will become protective of her and her current mate, John. I can forge two more rings, one to protect John and one to protect Kara. The trees will help me.</u></i> <i>I'm okay with it, but you need their approval, not just mine.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, stop that! It's creeping me out!\"<br>\r\nYou giggle. \"Sorry John. We can help you, but your wife would need to become Snarvar's mate. He'd be protective of her that way.\"<br>\r\nJohn looks relieved. \"I need to ask her first if she'd be willing to do that. Hold on.\" John just stands there quietly for a few moments, then smiles. \"She agrees, and she's given me permission to be your mate, Kim.\"<br>\r\nSnarvar laughs. \"Good. Tell her to come up to the castle.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You, John, Kara, and Snarvar are together in the forest on the hills Snarvar owns, somewhat near Amara's grave. You and Kara are talking back and forth, with Kara nervously looking around. \"Relax! Snarvar's scarier than anything that would want to attack us! So you and John have a bond, right? How's that even possible? I thought only dragons could bond with their mates.\" Kara smiles at you. \"No, humans can do it too, as long as they are a descendent of a dragon or already mated with a dragon who has a bond with them. My ancestors were really powerful dragons that liked to mate with women. So you're really from a world without dragons?\" \"Yep! there are no dragons there at all, which is a shame if you ask me. By the way, how far along are you, if you don't mind me asking?\" This earns you an even brighter smile from Kara.\"Nine months! I'm ready to pop at any second! And thank Gods too, because I can't stand being so fat!\" John slips his arms under her waist and kisses her cheek. \"You're still sexy to me, babe!\", which earns his a kiss on the lips from Kara. Suddenly she stops and grabs his right hand, pulling it up to her belly. \"She's active today, isn't she?\" John smiles at her. \"Yes she is!\" You feel a little embarassed, like you are intruding on a private moment until Kara beckons you. \"Come on over and feel this!\" You feel her stomach and are amazed when you can feel two little lumps moving. \"Wow! That's so cool! How do you two know it's a girl?\" John smiles warmly at you. \"We don't. We both just hope it's a girl. Snarvar, come feel this!\" Snarvar laughs to himself. \"I've felt enough pregnant humans to know what it feels like. Not to sound harsh, but I prefer eggs. Less likely to be injured on the way out. However, I'm sure I will love helping to raise your child alongside mine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all go a little further when Kara stops the group for a moment. \"Um, guys? Before we do this I wanted to thank you for offering to protect us. I also wanted to lay down some ground rules on my mating with you, Snarvar.\" Snarvar looks at her, listening carefully. \"My first rule is that you absolutely can't mate with me while I am pregnant, or at least when I get this far along. Kim told me how big you are and I <u>don't</u> want to put my baby at risk, and I do want at least one more human baby. I'm also not ruling out carrying your child.\" \"Understood and accepted,\" Snarvar says politely. \"And the others?\" Kara continues, glad she's getting her points across. \"The second rule is that I'm not going to completely forsake John for you. I may have nights where I'm going to want to sleep and mate with you and I may have nights where I'm going to want to sleep and mate with him. Please don't try to force me to sleep or mate with you. You can ask me to mate with you, but never tell me to. This goes for you too, John.\" The two of them nod, indicating that they agreed. \"And my last rule is that you can use me to sweeten deals only when John agrees to it. I may not like the idea, but I'm not going to ignore the customs of our lands until they are changed.\" Snarvar nods again. \"As with Kim, I will not force you into a situation that you don't want to be in. If John agrees but you do not I will not force you to court or mate with anyone.\" \"I appreciate that, my Lord. Is it weird that I'm already starting to love you?\" <br>\r\nSnarvar grins mischievously. \"No, it's not. You should ask Kim how she fell in love with me!\"<br>\r\n\"SNARVAR,\" you squeal, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you get up to the spot where Snarvar saw you in the trees and suddenly a gout of fire hits Snarvar, but it doesn't seem to phase him. In fact he breathes fire in the direction that it came from. You hear a seductively feminine voice address the four of you. \"Ah, Lord Snarvar. You honor me by speaking to me as one of your own kind. I see the two dragons have brought their pregnant mates, the dragonesses.\"<br>\r\nJohn looked towards the source of the voice, shocked. \"I know your voice, Terra. I'll never forget it.\"<br>\r\nA woman with long dark hair, glasses, and a pantsuit stepped out of the shadows. \"I imagine you won't. After all, I am the one who sent you here, although my real name isn't Terra, and I don't run any actual company named Earth Enterprise. I was a once a dragon in ages long past. Now I am the representative of the trees, and my name has long been forgotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Why lure me here?\"<br>\r\n\"So you could uncover your true potential.\" At these words she changed into something different and not quite human. She looked like stylized statue, with grass growing where her hair was, wood replacing her skin, and a few random twigs sticking out of her now naked body. You realize something isn't quite right about the way you were greeted. \"Wait, you said 'two dragons and their pregnant mates'. You also called us 'dragonesses' Are you saying John is a dragon? That we all are?\"<br>\r\n\"And why not? You show your true form everytime you get pregnant by a dragon. It isn't Lord Snarvar's seed turning you into a dragoness, it's your heritage. I can see the scales on your hands that you have not noticed. You are excited by the change, and that is bringing it forward quicker. As for the boy-dragon, he is royalty. He was born of the great Dragon Queen Kita, who had heard of the other world and brought him there to meet his human father. She was accidentally separated from you when a storm hit and carried off her connection with that world, a glowing orb that you would later touch to come here. Without it she was forced to leave by the forces of majik. It was called the 'Eye of Tialma', and I give it to you now. You were then found by your 'family' who raised you. Should you wish to meet her she would welcome it, as she to this day thinks you to have died in that storm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn is very quiet. \"Where can I find her,\" he asks after a long period of silence.<br>\r\n\"In the city of Shimmering Harbors. She is still the queen there. Snarvar would likely be willing to help you find it. He is familiar with that city. I warn you that it may be both a happy and sad reunion for the two of you. Now Snarvar, you have come seeking my help, correct? You wish to enchant another ring, as you may now realize that enchanting two rings today is pointless.\"<br>\r\nYou interject at this point. \"Why are two rings pointless? My mate also needs protection!\"<br>\r\n\"He doesn't, though. As the direct child of a dragon he is as durrable as his mother.\"<br>\r\n\"But I stood there watching him dying from his injuries after being attacked by bloodelves!\"<br>\r\n\"Kim,\" John says. \"That wasn't entirely true. While there were bloodelves, there were far more than three. If I'd have to guess I'd say about thirty. I just didn't want you thinking I was a freak.\"<br>\r\nYou stare at him blankly. \"Thirty... Wow! You survived that?! No wonder you were so beat up.\"<br>\r\nSnarvar speaks up. \"Are you willing to help?\"<br>\r\n\"The trees and I have already done it. Consider it a gift for your marriage.\" At that she produces a gold ring, which she slips onto Kara's finger and disappears. You all stand there for a moment, taking in what had just happened when your stomach suddenly growls, reminding everyone that they hadn't had any lunch. You all agree that you should head back to the castle for something to eat.</span></div></div>",

You look at her for a moment. \"Kara, what's wro-\" then you look down and stop talking. You see a clear liquid with streams of red gathering on the floor from under her dress. She picked a bad day to not wear underwear! \"Ohmygod. OhmyGOD! Your water just broke! Guys! We need to get her lying down NOW!\" The entire assembled court hears this and begins clammoring, offering suggestions. <i>Snarvar, is there a guest bedroom near by? We need to get her on a bed.</i> <i><u>Just down the hall. We need to hurry. I can smell her panicking, and that's never good for the baby. We need to get her comfortable so both her and the baby survive.</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you rush Kara to the bedroom and get her lying down on the bed. Members of Snarvar's court are coming in, trying to help but only making Kara more nervous. Snarvar rushes them all out and goes to the edge of the bed. He quickly shreds her dress off of her body so she can breathe better, leaving her bare for the three of us to see, but none of us are really paying attention to her body, except to gage what's going on. You're on her right side and grab her right hand, while John has her left hand and is stroking her cheek. You can tell that they are talking through their link and John kisses her cheek. Snarvar is looking at her pussy to see how quickly her contractions are coming., and you decide to tease him for it. <i>No, Snarvar, you can't stick your cock in it yet. You have to wait until the baby inside of her comes out.</i> <i><u>Funny, Kim. I'm just worried about her. Her contractions are coming really fast. That can be good or bad. I'm not sure.</u></i> <i>I'm glad you're so worried about her. No girl deserves a jerky mate.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting for a good two hours while she's in labor, you watch her body rise and fall. At this point there is no denying it: You are attracted to her. She is beautiful to you even during childbirth. You're just glad you came to terms with your bisexuality years ago. <i><u>Wait, I see something! I think it's the head.</u></i> Judging by the way she's squeezing your hand, it's definitely the head. Snarvar quickly trades spots with you and you find yourself instinctually guiding the head through. This is so beautiful. This is a true miracle. \"You're doing great, Kara. Keep breathing. Now push! That's it!\" You qickly look up her body and see her face twisted in pleasure. You had always heard that women could achieve orgasm during childbirth if they were open-minded about it, and here's your proof. \"Almost there, Kara. Almost! Gods, you're doing great! Alright! Hard part's almost over! Time for the afterbirth! Almost out! Perfect! You're done! It's a girl! A healthy baby girl!\" Snarvar quickly grabs some cloth blankets from a chest in the room as John and Kara look on, longing to hold their new little girl. Snarvar cuts the umbilical cord with his claw and you wipe her clean and wrap her up in a blanket, handing her to her mother, who is happy to lay eyes on her for the first time. You quickly poke your head out the door to say \"It's a girl! Their both just fine!\" You then close the door again and watch the two new parents and their baby. It warms your heart and you know that they will be good parents. Kara's talking to her child and John is now holding her. \"Hello Cassandra! I love you so much! You're so beautiful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar gets behind you and wraps his arms around your waist, and you place your arms over his, leaning back into him. <i><u>That's us in 9 months.</u></i> <i>Honestly, I can't wait. I really want to see what baby dragons look like! Plus, I've always dreamed of getting kidnapped by a dragon and having his kids.</i> <i><u>Nice, Kim. I told you why I took you. Please don't hold it against me forever.</u></i> <i>Snarvar, that wasn't an insult. In the other world they tell children stories about \"evil\" dragons who kidnap princesses from their homes and have their way with them. Then some idiot knight comes to kill the poor dragon and rescue the princess. As I grew up I hated the ending, so I imagined that the knight got killed and the princess realized she wanted the dragon anyway and had his kids.</i> <i><u>Alright. Sorry for thinking the worst.</u></i> <i>No problem, my beautiful dragon!</i></span></div></div>",

It was a prelude to reintroducing her to John, but Snarvar was supposedly making it appear like he was in need of some supplies that she could provide, which was true in a sense. He was in need of a few objects. However, he had explicit instructions that he was not to promise the girls as payment. You and Kara have just finished having sex with John, who looks like he could die right now and be happy about his last hours of his life. Cassandra is in her crib and you are watching her sleep, while Kara watches you \"I can't get over how cool you look, Kim. You look so... powerful.\" \"I feel powerful, Kara. I love this new body and hope it's permanent. Snarvar says that sometimes women don't change back if they develop dragon characteristics early. They can even grow their own wings if their lucky!\" You have developed all of your scales, which are blood red just like Snarvar's. You have also developed a dragon-like face (including a lizard-like snout), claws that retract, sharp teeth, yellow reptilian eyes and a tail. The only things that didn't identify you as a dragon is the fact that you have no wings and your still large breasts. You don't have nipples anymore, however, as there is no way for a reptilian mother to feed her children from her own body. You can even breath fire. \"Hey, can we grab something to eat? I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you head down the steps leading to the main floor, Kara carrying the fourth person, her baby girl Cassandra. Cassandra has apparently decided that she's hungry as well, because she starts moaning and fussing, prompting Kara to expose her left breast and place Cassandra even with it. Sucking noises fill the air as Cassandra drinks to her heart's content and promptly gets burped. You sit at the head of the table next to the empty throne and sigh. While you enjoy the raw deer meat now, you can't help but have an urge to go out hunting for yourself. It's a dragoness's instinct to not rely upon those other than her mate. Just then Snarvar arrives and sits next to her. You smile warmly at him.  \"Welcome home, lover! How did it go?\"</span></div></div>",

I think if we are going to bring you to her, John, it should be today.\" John looks over at him, then to Kara and his baby. \"What do you think?\" Kara looks down at the half asleep baby in her arms. \"I think that if we lost Cassy, I'd want to know right away if she was still alive.\" John leans in and kisses her and kisses his baby girl on the forehead, then turns to you. You smile at him. \"Before you ask, I'm in agreement. I know how  much you've wanted to meet your birth parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five of you set off right away, flying to the harbor town of Shimmering Harbors. Once you arrive, you, John and Kara marvel at the beauty of the town before them. It was close to dusk and the way that the sun reflected off the water was beautiful. You hear Cassandra cooing slightly and look over. Kara was feeding her again and she was looking down at her baby, sighing, obviously content that her daughter was so healthy. The five of them enter the castle after Kara pulls her shirt back up, and immediately hear an exasperated voice. \"Lord Snarvar, your family sure is nice, but I don't want any guests right now. Please leave.\" Queen Kita is a beautiful dragoness, her scales are white and her eyes blue. Her body was very sleek and she looks to be about a head shorter than Snarvar. John steps forward and speaks. \"You don't even wish to see your son?\" She looks at him for a moment. \"That's not possible. My son died when I was ejected from the other world without him.\" He shakes his head. \"I was found by a young couple who took me in. They died in a fire later in my life.\" \"How did you get here?\" Her voice sounded almost hopeful. \"I found this.\" At that he pulls the \"Eye of Tialma\" out of the sack he had been carrying on his back. It's shining very brightly. That seems to prove it to her. \"Only one of my bloodline can touch the Eye of Tialma while it is burning this brightly,\" she says, amazed. She takes it from him and places it on a pedestal beside her throne. John beckons to Kara to come closer, which she does. \"And who is this?\" \"This is my mate, Kara, and our daughter, Cassandra.\" Kita is smiling brightly now, all traces of her sadness gone. \"I have a granddaughter? Oh, she's so beautiful!\" She then looks up at you and Snarvar. \"Thank you for this Snarvar. Should you ever need anything, I will be happy to provide it.\"</span></div></div>",

You are disgusted by the creatures. Snarvar tells you that they are twisted creatures that were infected by vampirism and proceeded to experiment with black magic, robbing them of their rationality while increasing their powers. They were supposedly once a group of orcs and elves who sought to end their curse through magic, but wound up corrupting themselves further. Snarvar flys past the bloodelves and lands near a large platoon of soldiers flying different colors than his own Army. A regal looking man with a moustache-goatee combination on his face and a full suit of armor with a purple cape and red trim approaches Snarvar and you. You think to yourself that he doesn't look too bad, but he seems a little smug, which you find offputting. However, that may just be because he looks like he has never had to really work at anything. You, on the other hand, are wearing a full suit of armor that Snarvar enchanted in a way that made it near impossible to pierce, as well as a sword and shield. The man approaches you and Snarvar as you dismount from Snarvar's back. \"Ah, Lord Snarvar! Good to see you, my friend. I take it this lovely lady is your mate?\" Snarvar smiles at you. \"Kim, this is lord William Cedric, a long time ally of mine. William, this is Kim. She is a possible mate of mine. We only just met, afterall. I hope that someday I will have the honor of calling her my mate.\" You smile back at Snarvar, assuming that he had a reason for lying like that. As far as you're concerned, you're already mates. Snarvar looks back at the man. \"So, William, any ideas on why bloodelves would be here?\" \"My guess? The gem mine inside of the hills. They always do love things that shine.\" The three of you look on towards the armada of bloodelves. You have a feeling that things are going to get very messy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour and a half of fighting you find yourself looking around. The battle is over, for the most part. There are no surviving bloodelves around being taken prisoner, and you find yourself glad because of that fact. Snarvar had told you that to take a bloodelf prisoner was suicide, as they almost always found a way out and kill their captors. You look around at all of the carnage and you know that it's going to be a long time before you don't see this bloody mayhem at night when you try to sleep. You thank God that it's over. However, you look at William and yell for him to look behind him. There's a rather large bloodelf behind him, raising its sword to attack. It doesn't do that for long, however, as it suddenly has an arrow through its head. You and William look towards where the arrow came from and notice a man dressed completely in black and with a black metal mask over his face and head. \"I keep telling you to watch your back, William. I won't always be around to save you. That makes eight you owe me, and that's not including the whole dwarven fiasco.\" William laughed. \"Someday I'll find the right way to pay you back, Exile.\" \"I doubt it, my friend. Having a few favors in my pocket is far better than all the gold in the world.\" He turns around and see's Snarvar. \"Speaking of favors... I got <i>his</i> location for you, Lord Snarvar. Wish you'd let me kill him, the sick bastard.\" Snarvar stares intently at Exile. \"Why? Don't tell me he's...\" \"Up to his rapist of a brother's ways, or at least that's what it looks like. He's enslaved some Orcish women, and appears to be trying to make them into an army. But anyway, on to better thinks.\" You could swear you know his voice from somewhere, but you can't be sure when he is wearing that metal mask. He turns his head towards you. \"And just who is this lovely-\" He stops in mid sentence, appearing to look at you carefully. \"Is that... No, that's not possible... Is it? Kim? Is that really you?!\" You step back, slightly creeped out. \"How do you know my name?\" You watch as Exile takes off his mask, and you are stunned to see who is underneath it. \"Oh my god... John!!!\" You step closer to him and once you absolutely know who it is, you pull John closer to you and kiss him, full on the lips. You break the kiss apart and bury your head in his shoulder, wanting to treasure this moment.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly it he stops screaming and straightens up, wiping the blood from his eyes and face. \"Well that was a bust. No traces of demonic activity.

What's wrong with me?\"<br>\r\nYou don't notice that Fentis is slowly backing away from you, but John does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back here, <b>vampire.</b>\" John grabbs Fentis by the throat and lifts him into the air. John sounds mad. You have no idea why until you realize that one of the powers vampires are said to have is a hypnotic gaze. He could have easily reconstructed your memories the first time you met him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else... did I forget?\" You ask it tentatively, as you do remember being in emotional pain for quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at you for a quick moment before adjusting his grip on Fentis, but that moment tells you everything you need to know. \"We haven't seen eachother for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over three years,\" you finish, remembering the emotional agony. \"You went on some trip for a college group assignment. To a cave in the Rockies. You were the only one in that group that didn't come back.\" Tears were streaming down your cheeks at the memories. \"Search crews looked for weeks and never even found your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's when I wound up here. I found a weird crystal orb in that cave that brought me here. It was a one way trip, however, and I couldn't get back, no mater how much I wanted to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing all of this makes you both sad and mad at the same time. You don't like being forced to forget things, even such sad things, because your mother always told you that how you handle the bad things in life defines who you are. \"What should we do with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn smiles at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and John arrive at the dining hall, John carrying a very stiff Fentis over his shoulder.

Fentis immediately clambers to his feet and attempts to run when John cuts him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar stands up when he sees this and walks over to you. \"What's going on? Why's Fentis shackled like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at snarvar, still upset about this whole ordeal. \"Fentis has been messing with my mind.

He will be the death of her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn and you are holding hands, both of you glaring at Fentis. \"He is mine, and you tried to take my memory of him away from me. I trust John and would put my life in his hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you are a fool. Ask yourself; how did he know about vampire weaknesses? That silver is agony to me? That oak stakes cause paralysis when plunged through a vampire's heart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point John interjected. \"Gee, I don't know, maybe it's because the culture Kim and I are from obsesses on them? Ever think of that, or are you too paranoid to realize that vampirism isn't exclusive to your world? And to be honest, I had hoped the oak stake would kill you, but I wasn't that lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arogant blood bag! You will die by my hands! I will drain you of every drop of blood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar is getting tired of this.\"ENOUGH! I'll not have a bloodbath in this castle! Since you have committed crimes against my mate and Exile you will be punished! In addition, this is not the first or even the third time you have done this. However, since you have served my family well during your time here I will give you a choice: Death or imprisonment. Choose wisely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFentis didn't even wait a moment to think this choice through. \"Imprisonmet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. You shall be put in a coffin and buried under the foundation of the castle for the next 100,000 years. It is my hope that during this time you will come to realize that humans are not toys to play with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFentis looks like he is pannicking by this point. \"No!

However, I am required to court you until you wish to mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at that. \"You do realize that I was willing to mate with you without going on dates, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I still want to court you. After all, you only get one chance to impress beautiful females.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush. \"Flatterer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar leans down to kiss you, which soon gets hot and heavy. Then you hear a loud thump and a very feminine voice. \"Gods, you two! Get a room already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break the kiss and turn towards the voice. Your eyes widen when you see a very curvy female dragon with red scales. She is a lot shorter than Snarvar, and she looks to be only a foot and a half taller than you on her hind legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar smiles warmly at the dragoness. \"Kiera, this is my mate to be, Kim. Kim, this is Kiera, my daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at Kiera, happy to meet Snarvar's daughter. Kiera, in turn, smiles back. \"So your the one who caught my daddy's eye. Have you two mated yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush at the straight forward question. You want to avoid it, but you realize that in this world that is not an inappropriate question. \"No, but we came very close earlier. Got stopped by an attack on the castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaw, I'm sorry to hear that. You seem so nice, I hate to think you couldn't share in Daddy's love!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are surprised at the way she talks about you and her father being together, and not in just a physical way, but an emotional way. You are beginning to like her. \"I want to make it up to him, but he insists on courting me first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiera laughs. \"Daddy! I would've thought you had more sense than that! When a girl as hot as her tells you she wants you in her panties it's rude to say no! Hell, I'd even go for her if she were willing to have a 'females only' thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself getting wet just thinking about this dragoness licking between your thighs. You've been bisexual all your life, and it has never served you wrong before. Without thinking you start to respond. \"Any time you want, babe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiera growls sexily at you. \"You'd better watch out, Daddy, or I might have to take her to my den for a few days! Kim, if you ever do want to mate with me, let my Daddy know! You'd be a damn step up from Ragnar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar snaps to attention at this. \"Don't tell me he's still chasing after you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! It's getting so a girl can't even fly around for her own leisure anymore without getting chased around! He almost mounted me in midair last night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar looks angry. \"Kiera, you don't have to take that. Why don't you come back to the castle with Kim and I, and you can stay there until I can talk to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... I don't wanna bug you two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step beside her. \"Hey, your Dad doesn't mind, and neither do I.

You are a nine year-old again, and you are just sitting on your bed, waiting for it all to start. You know you are going to be okay, and that thought gives you a little comfort. Not enough, however, as you know exactly what happens next as you hold your favorite stuffed animal to you. It is a rather large plush dragon, and it is red all over except for the black doll eyes. You wince but don't turn around as you hear the monster stumble drunkenly into the room, wearing the face of the man you probably should respect. It reaches out to you, groping you and manhandling your immature young breasts, grabbing and squeezing your ass, all while whispering how beautiful you are, and how you make it feel naughty things. It says to trust it, that is will do you no harm. You then notice its hands on your head and its appendage coming towards your mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up screaming with terror and drenched with sweat. You are chilled and you know that despite the nightmare being over it will never stop haunting you. You feel around yourself and notice that you are outside of Snarvar's stomach, which is a relief right now. As comfortable as it is on the inside, you really need to be held right now. You look up and see Sanarvar looking down at you, obviously worried. \"Kim, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look him in the eyes and you see love for you. You were going to lie, but you can see he won't back down. Even still, he doesn't need to know all of the truth. \"Just a nightmare, Snarvar. Nothing to be afraid of anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar wraps his wings around you and lifts you to his level to talk better. \"That's not everything, is it Kim? Please tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh to yourself, hating your father for doing this to you. \"Snarvar, I have a really big secret to tell you. I... I am not... I know you know that I am a virgin... But I am far from innocent. I was... When I was a little girl my father...\" a tear rolls down your cheek. This is way too hard, but you need to tell him. You NEED to. \"He was so evil, Snarvar. He beat my Mom and I when he got mad. When he got drunk... God this is so hard! He used to touch my privates! He groped me and touched me and molested me!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar puts his arms around you as well as his wings, holding you close. \"It's okay, my Love...

This is a big decision, after all.\" Snarvar then turns around as Gertrude comes into the room. Her eyes get large for a moment before she realizes what must have happened. She chuckles to herself and walks over to you. \"Don't worry, my dear. It all washes off rather easily. I had quite a bit of practice washing off my daughter after they woke up.\" The two of you quickly get the various fluids off of your body and find you something to wear. It's a long purple dress with red lines crisscrossing around the hem and a purple and red corset. While the corset isn't too uncomfortable, you make a mental note to try to introduce this world to the wonder that is the bra, for simplicity's sake. Gertrude tells Snarvar that he can turn around, and you love the way he is looking at you. It may be too early to decide to be his mate or not, but you definitely have a crush on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGertrude informs you and Snarvar that there are guests here on important business, and that it is very urgent. Snarvar accompanies the two of you as you walk to the main hall. When you finally arive you see a regal looking gentleman who looks to be in his early twenties with brown hair and a mustache/goatee combo wearing purple clothes with red trim, a rather short man with long and wirey red hair and a long beard wearing a suit of armor that appears to be made of gold, and a figure wearing completely black metal armor with a black metal skull-like mask and a black hooded cape with gold trim. Snarvar introduces you to each one. \"Kim, this is Lord William Cedric,\" the regal man bows to you, \"Dwarven King Rodnik,\" the short man bows to you, \"and the mercenary Exile.\" Exile bows slightly, but he seems to be watching you closely. Snarvar clears his throat. \"This is Lady Kim, my potential mate, she's just arrived from a distant land.\" You smile at the term. Atleast he's not acting like it's a done deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what is your business here?\" Lord Cedric goes first. \"Well, to get the small matter out of the way, your son has been causing some trouble. He's taken eleven goats and three cows from the area, and he has been paying some attention to my younger sister. Fortunately she's not betrothed yet or this would be a bigger problem.\" Snarvar nodded at that. \"So I take it that he's smitten with Anoria. To be honest, I can understand that. She is rather stunning. I take it you came he to arrange a wedding dowry and compensation for the livestock, then. First things first, how about 400 gold coins per cow and 250 gold coins per goat?\" William smiled at that. \"More than generous, Lord Snarvar. Now, for the dowry I would like to request the southern hills near your kingdom.\" You are shocked at this. They were really bartering over Snarvar's son being able to take a woman as his mate? You want to say something, but before you do Snarvar laughs. \"And let you have those mines? I think not. How about a years worth of gems from the central mine instead?\" William seems determined to get more. \"3 Years worth.\" Snarvar is very stubborn, though, and won't let concede. \"A year and a half.\"  Willam has a mischievous look in his eye, and you don't like it. \"Only if you grant me the right to court and marry Lady Kim.\" You stare at him wide-eyed, not believing your ears. Sure, he's attractive, but you haven't even decided if you're going to be Snarvar's mate yet, not to mention the fact that you only got here a day ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar looks at you and you shake your head no. Before he can say something to Lord Cedric, though, Exile speaks. \"William, you are overstepping your boundaries,\" he says warningly. You swear that his voice sounds familiar, but it's too distorted by the mask to tell. \"While most dragons falsely claim that their mates are from another land to make them more seem more exotic and appealing to dignitaries when sweetening deals, Kim truely is from another land.\" Rodnik looks at Exile disbelievingly. \"And how the hell would you know that!?\" Exile's head turns towards you. \"Because I'm from the same land, and I know her very well. And where we come from, monogamy is the norm. So she's likely experiencing some culture shock here. If she is to be added to the payment, it has to be her choice, by her terms, with no influence from others.\" You think you finally recognize Exile's voice, and you smile at him. Then you realize everyone is waiting for an answer from you. You think for a moment and say...</span></div></div>",

What are your conditions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou speak with confidence, more than you feel. \"First, we will court until I am ready to marry you. Second, if I don't like you as a person then I can call it off. Third, I get to live with whomever I choose, be it you, snarvar, or some other mate.\" As you say the last part, your eyes drift towards Exile momentarily. \"And finally, there's something you should know about me.

There is an image of a strange looking man with 2 teeth poking out from under his bottom lip, pointed ears, and a large number of scars on his face. \"Orc Chief Gorthol here has made me aware that the Elves are expanding their territories quite rapidly, and at the expense of the other races. They have already destroyed the Orcish Strongholds of Lordash-Ta,\" an image of a city surrounded by a river appears on the orb, \"and Feran-Yal.\" Another city appears, surrounded by rocks. \"Gorthol fears that his tribe may be next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar looks as if he is concerned. \"Why doesn't he fight them back? There are plenty of other strongholds full of Orcs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExile speaks this time. \"They feel that if they were to strike out against the Elves without support, others may view it as a violation of the pact they made when their ancestors were allowed to create Strongholds here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodnik nods. \"Aye, and even the fiercest warrior among them follows that pact to the letter.\" He smiles for a moment. \"Like the Dwarves, the Orcs are noble warriors. They would each die to protect their tribes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam spoke at this point. \"I've told these two that I would gladdly supply troops to help their cause.

My ancestors helped the Orcs when they first arrived here. And with some encouragement I'm sure that the other Dragon families will help as well. Do we have any idea why Queen Tsunade would violate the Crater-Blood treaty like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExile nods as the image on the sphere changes from a beautiful woman with pointed ears and a crown with many jewels on her head to a handsome looking young man with pointed ears. \"It's not her. It's her son, Tsunda. He's often voiced his distaste for the 'lesser races'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar looks at the image solomnly. \"Very well. I shall speak with the other families.

Your world is not ready for the death toll they would undoubtedly cause. Imagine being able to kill someone with just the pull of a trigger.

After the two of you break apart you look at him longingly. \"Hello, John. Care to tell me how you got here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn smiles weakly at you, obviously not liking the fact that he has to tell you what happened. \"I was on a trip for my internship with ProRezz Industries when the cave I was surveying for them collapsed. My leg was trapped under a boulder when it colapsed, so I couldn't get out. I had no food or water, and I couldn't feel my leg at all. I eventually passed out from pain, and woke up in a completely different cave. My leg was free, but I could tell it was broken. So I had to hobble my way to the nearest town. It turned out to be an Orc Stronghold, Maren-Kai, the largest in the area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at him, stunned. \"God, that must have been hard. How'd you get that armor? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn kisses your cheek. \"Thanks for the concern. The orcs wanted to attack me at first, but when they saw the blood running down my leg they took me to their healer. She took care of me for a few weeks and helped me heal with various potions and medicines. After I was healed the Orcs were kind enough to let me hunt with them. After one of the hunting trips we returned to see bandits trying to attack the stronghold. They wanted the mines, as they have a lot of precious metals and diamonds in them. The hunting party and I attacked them, and I used one of my guns from my days in the army to kill the bandit leader. The orcs gave me this armor in thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are enraptured by his story. \"What about the name? Why Exile?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn smiles at you. \"They called me that when I told them I was going to move on to another place. The Orcs are very proud, so they said that instead of me leaving, they were kicking me out before I became their newest cheiftan. They said that I was allowed back any time I wanted, but only as a visitor and not as a citizen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to laugh at that. \"Typical male ego! God I missed you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you kissed again, long and passionate. John smiles down at you. \"What do you want to do know?\"</span></div></div>",

We can discuss the rest of the payment later. Exile, you and Kim can talk in the next room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, your Majesty.\" Exile stood up, and walked around towards you. He held out his hand. \"Kim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab his hand, as Snarvar begins talking to the dwarf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the trouble, Rodnik?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's those blasted elves. They've been giving me trouble, raiding my mines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely not,\" Snarvar said. \"Queen Inzanzi and I are on good terms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish it were her; placating that sour old hag would be easy, even have some diamonds set aside,\" Rodnik said. \"It's her one younger son; thinks he'd make a better King than the one that she's proclaimed to be the next ruler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could hear more, you were in the other room with the Exile, and a couple of guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're alone,\" he said. You look at the guards. \"Unless I were to do something foolish, they don't count.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you take off your helmet?\" you ask. \"I mean, I have an idea as to who you are, but I'd like to make sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExile's chuckle was familiar. \"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he took it off, you were stunned. \"They told me that you were dead.\" You embraced him. \"They told me that you'd been killed in that cave in,  Johnny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn chuckled. \"I've missed you to.\" He then gave you a kiss. \"Your father can't complain about me being two years older than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile. \"I guess he can't.\" You let go of him, and walk towards a window-like opening. \"It's hard to believe you're alive. How'd you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn shrugged his shoulders, which was funny due to the sounds the armor made. \"I haven't figured that out. No dragons or mages were involved, that I know of. One moment the roof of the cave was falling in on me, next thing I knew, I was in another cave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the whole Exile thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know I was in Basic Training for the National Guard; I used some hand-to-hand techniques in a fight with some bandits,\" John said. \"The local villagers wanted to know who I was, so I said that I was an exile; seemed fitting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's your opinion on Snarvar and Cedric?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cedric's a little easier to explain,\" John said. \"Stubborn and pigheaded at times, likes to use his fists more than his brain, but you couldn't find a more loyal fighter to have by your side in a brawl. He'll save your life, and then complain about how stupid you acted, when someone almost slipped a blade between your ribs. I'll say this, he's no fool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Snarvar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never make him angry,\" John said. \"He heard of a group of outlaws that burned down a village. He hunted them down, tossed them in a pit, threw in a great deal of oil, and set fire to it. The smell of their flesh roasting made me sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp at this. The image of those men burning to death frightened you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, he's the most trustworthy friend you could have,\" John continued. He walked up to you. \"Both of them are good people, and I could understand if you took either of them for a husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a mercenary here,\" said John. \"Snarvar and Cedric are lords, with Snarvar being the King of Dragons, and Cedric being next in line for the human throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I've wanted you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn smiled, and gave you another kiss. \"Marry one of them first; I can handle being a Second, or a Third.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you said. \"I'll tell them my choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walked back into the dinning room, where you found the others in deep discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you,\" Rodnik said. \"We must go to war with the elves to get rid of the son!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But by attacking the cities, we'll incur the anger of the average elf, and they'll side with this Rouge,\" Snarvar said. \"I cannot commit the dragons to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad we can't just fight him in a Duel,\" Cedric said. \"Coward would never go for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you could beat an elf in single combat,\" scoffed Rodnik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I killed six once, when that robber band tried to kill Snarvar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar then noticed you, and nudged the other two, quieting them. \"Did you make up your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you said. \"I've decided... </span></div></div>",

She speaks of him every day in high regard.\" You look at Snarvar again and he cocks his head, wondering what you are up to. You just give him a smile. \"Lord Cedric, I have a counter offer. I'm not ready to have multiple husbands yet. <b>However,</b> I haven't been on a date in a long time, and I plan on dating Snarvar before I decide if he is right for me as well as one other.\" You glance towards John in his Exile gear. \"I am willing to date you as well and give you a fair chance. You seem very kind hearted from what I can tell so far. If you accept I agree to act like I am expected to while courting you, including other 'activities' if I like you well enough.

Instead you lean in and kiss him, briefly but passionately. You smirk at the dazed expression on his face. \"Consider yourself lucky.

You are fading in and out of the conversation. Apparantly one group thought they were better than everybody else and had taken to taking it out on those they considered benieth them. Sounds like every war ever to you. You look up as Snarvar and remember the dream you have always had, even since you were little. A horrible monster would kidnap you and try to scare and hurt you. But then, just as it was about to violate you, a great red dragon would fly in and protect you, flying off with you on its back. When you had first seen Snarvar you had been scared, but not as scared as you should have been. It was because he looked identical to the dragon that protected you in your dreams. You look up at him, thinking about abandoning this whole \"learning period\" thing and forcing him to date you rather than letting him have you. If you were honest with yourself you did enjoy his company and you knew it was a matter of time before you broke down and begged him to ravage you and make you his mate anyways. You steel yourself and try to force yourself to make a decision.</span></div></div>",

He is the only one who would truely protect you no matter what, and you feel like it would be foolish to make your protector wait. Just as you come to that decision, you notice a girl standing in one of the corners of the room that you know was unoccupied before. She is gorgeous, with piercing blue eyes and long raven hair. She looks to be somewhere around 15 years old. You start to open your mouth but she smirks at you and puts her finger over her mouth. You begin to hear her voice in your head, soft and sweet like an angel singing a lullaby. <b><i>Hello, Kimberly. I am Amara, Snarvars mate. I know I am dead, but I just wanted to let you know that my fate won't be yours. If you do decide to have his children, you will survive.</i></b> You nearly jump out of your skin at hearing her voice without hearing her speak, which causes Snarvar to look down at you, a loving gaze in his eyes, and he pulls you closer to you with his wing. You look back over at Amara. <b>How do you know my name? And how can we hear eachothers thoughts?</b> You hear a warm chuckle in your head. <b><i>I know everything about you, my Love. It wasn't just Snarvar who fell for you. I found you first and told the trees to show him. He spent too much damn time at my grave and not enough looking after himself. And as for how you can hear me? We are both the mates of the same dragon. You will be able to hear his thoughts when he puts his seed inside of you and he will be able to hear yours, but we became mates the moment you decided to be his mate. Now I need to tell you something very important. Snarvar needs to see this conversation inside your head after you mate with him. He made an awful mistake. He left my ring on my finger. It has preserved my body from all forms of decay, and a dark evil is coming. A necromancer is going to try to raise my body and make me his. He has sensed the magic in the ring and will use that to enslave my body. Please save me from this fate. But you must wait until after you mate, alright? I can't tell you why yet, but if you arive too early I will never be able to appear before you or Snarvar again, and the Goddess has demanded I must be there to guide you both through times of trouble. Do you promise me to do that Kimberly?</i></b> You feel yourself tear up for a moment, feeling the love she has for you and Snarvar and you nod to her. <b>I promise, I will show him this memory.</b> Amara smiles at you and walks to you, brushing her cold etherial hand across your face. <b><i>Thank you, Love. Goobye for now.</i></b> You close your eyes and sniff as a few tears roll down your cheeks. Snarvar notices and puts his head level with yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kim... What's wrong?\" You smile despite the tears at the sweet dragon. \"I just... I just thought about something sad.\" You wipe your eyes and look at him, your heart breaking for his loss. He licks the tears from your cheek. \"Do you want to talk about it?\" \"Later. I need to talk to you about something first...\" He nods and holds you close enough that you can feel his heart beating in his chest. The same heart you could hear earlier, and you knew that he couldn't survive another heart break. You duck down so that his wing is hiding all of you and begin tracing your fingers along his scales, feeling for the strongest beats where his heart was, and as soon as you find it you whisper, knowing only Snarvar can hear you. \"I promise to keep this heart whole and beating, my Lord.\" You feel it skip a beat and look up to see his eyes, wide and glancing at you questioningly. You just nod and smirk, noticing how it skips a beat again before settling down into its rythm again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting finally ends and you are walking beside Snarvar, his wing still drapped over you. \"Can we find somewhere private? I need to tell you something.\" Snarvar smiles at you. \"Of course. Are my chambers alright? You nod and he leads you to the giant doors, the two of you stepping inside. You get an idea and duck behind the clothing screen before he can notice and quickly strip down to nothing. \"Kim?\" \"Just getting changed, these clothes are not what I'm used to!\" You lie to keep him guessing. \"I see. What did you want to talk about?\" \"I was thinking maybe I was a bit of a bitch earlier. We got off on the wrong foot and I didn't quite believe you when you said you could love someone like me. I'm just a little human girl, what appeal could I possibly hold for a big dragon with such a big heart?\" Snarvar begins to interupt and you cut him off, still behind the curtain, poping your head out and nothing else. \"Let me finish. During that meeting I saw you doing your best to avoid violence, and even when it became obvious that it was needed, you still showed distain for it. John, that's Exile's name, told me about how loyal you are. He was my boyfriend in the other world, long story, ask him about it some time. And I came to a decision.\" You pause, waiting for him to ask the most obvious question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim, are you saying what I hope you are?\" You step out from behind the curtain wearing only the ring and your best smile, your red hair flowing down your back. His jaw drops and you notice his slit parting for a very big cock. \"Now I'm not saying I don't still want to date. That's still required. But I think you are sweet enough to know that. And besides, we can always fuck after dates. I want to be your mate, Snarvar. I want you to fill me, make me yours, and when we are both ready, to carry your babies. I know it's sudden, but you loved me before you met me. I just want the chance to prove that I was destined for you.\" You walk up to him, swaying your hips and thrusting your chest out. You hear him breathe out raggedly before he grabs you and pulls you to him, crashing his dragonic lips down onto your human ones. You've never felt such passion before and you have to close your eyes to keep from being overwhelmed. You feel something poking at your nethers as he breaks the kiss. You look down and see something that would put a draft horse to shame. It is easily 4 inches longer than your arm from top to bottom just as thick. The slit looks big enough to fit your hand comfortably. You shudder, not sure if it is lust or fear. \"I can shrink it later on, but the first time it has to be this size. Your body will not be harmed, and the ring will keep you from being injured by it. I promise all you will feel is peasure.\" You look up in his eyes and nod. \"I trust you, Stud. Whenever you are ready.\" He nods and lines it up with your pussy and you are amazed that you feel it slide in. You feel a minor discomfort when he gets through your hymen, but that is soon gone. He lets you adjust to it and when you nod he grins mischeviously. He bottoms out at your cevix and keeps on going, penetrating to your womb and stretching you out so wonderfully. He finally stops, having gotten his full length inside of you and you cal feel his scaley thighs on your butt. You gasp, unable to think from the pleasure. He leans down and places a portion of his long tounge in your mouth and you focus on that, playing with his longer tounge with your much smaller one. If you could register it, you would see love in his eyes. He begins to thrust and you imeadeately are thrown into orgasm. He keeps on pounding away at you and you can only thrust back, squeezing around his lovely member. He withdraws his tounge from your mouth and begins wraping it around your right breast, flicking the nipple with the tip of his massive tounge, his right clawed hand grabbing and tenderly squeezing your left breast. His left arm goes behind you and lifts you to him as he begins panting loudly. You have lost track of the number of orgasms you have had, loosing count around 30, though you have a feeling it's closer to a hundred. He suddenly roars out and you feel him pump his seed inside of you, and there was a lot of it. He quickly curls around you on the bed and the two of you pass out together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally wake back up you notice that it is nearly dark outside. You two fucked most of the day away. You then hear his voice in your head and smile as you realize that he is still soft and burried inside of you. <b><u>That was fantastic.</u> I know, right? Oh my Godess that was fantastic! Is it always going to be so intense?</b> He smiled down at you and pulle out of you, his male parts retracting back into his slit. A rush of semen flows out of your now gaping privates. <b><u>Always, my love.</u> Oh, Snarvar, before I forget, search my mind for earlier this afternoon. Your mate Amara... She appeared to me. She needs our help. <u>I can see that. I'll collect Exile. Maybe he can help us with this necromancer.</u> I hope so, love. Then we need to go to her grave, don't we?</b> Snarvar nods and you tear up again for a moment. \"We're coming, Amara.\"</span></div></div>",

He seemed to love her very deeply and you found yourself feeling more suprised at the lack of jelousy at that. After all, he was supposed to have been your boyfriend a few years back. <b><u>That is because you are acclimating to our culture faster than even I thought you would.</u> Goddess Damn you scared me! I mean, don't get me wrong, I love hearing your thoughts and sharing mine, but I only just learned about this a few hours ago! <u>Sorry Kim. But to explain, Exile, or John as you call him, is mated to Frallia, my best friend from childhood. And she has her 110th birthday coming up, meaning according to her father and mine means that I need to impregnate her.</u> Um... Ooookay... Why do you need to impregnate your best friend? <u>Her father saved my fathers life when they were both young. This is how he is calling in the favor. Old bastard is a bigot who thinks humans only belong with dragons when they are either business partenrs or our food. </u>Wow. What a jerk! So I take it he doesn't aprove of John? <u>Not in the slightest.</u> Hey, Snarvar, you know I can feel your feelings, right? I have no illusions about being your one and only. Why don't you just become mates with Frallia? I know you care deeply about her and that way you can both have babies when you are ready without her father being able to complain? <u>You make an interesting point, Love. I shall bring it up with her. But later. We are here, and I smell dark magic.</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar lands by Amara's empty grave and you get off of his back. He had given you a bow and a quiver full of arrows at your request and you take the bow in hand. \"This place reaks of darkness, Snarvar,\" Frallia said as she landed next to your love and John got off of her. You all hear a scream and you and Snarvar feel fear course through your minds as part of your link to Amaras spirit. Snarvar and Frallia go one way and direct you and John to circle around the other way. You readied an arrow, hoping that all of those years of Archery practice wouldn't have to be used today.  The two of you come across a cave, seeing the necromancer inside, forcing Amara's beautiful body onto her knees and you notice she is fighting him. John tells you to stay there and he gets close as you both call for your mates. Interestingly, Amara stops struggling when you do this and looks in your direction, her eyes filled with knowing. Suddenly John loses his footing for a moment and you hold your breath. The necromancer heard that and throws Amara aside. \"Who's there? Come out and I'll only kill you once!\" You begin to feel rage as he threatens John. Quickly you yell at him. \"Wrong move, Asshole!\" You let loose your arrow and it pierces him in the chest dead in the center. He stumbles to his knees in pain and you quickly put another arrow in his left eye. The necromancer falls over, dead and you and John run over to Amaras body. \"I'm fine. I'm fine. Hold on.\" She kicks the body and spits on him and turns around to the two of you.\"Thank you both so much. Now lets find Snarly. I need to tell him and you the good news!\" The three of you exit the cave and you see the dragons land before you. Snarvar and Frallia brace themselves when they see movement, but then you feel puzzlement from Snarvar. \"I don't understand. Is the necromancer not dead? Why are you still here, Amara?\" Amara smiles at Snarvar and pulls in tight to him. You do the same, but you have the urge to be caressing Amara as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly Draggie! Didn't you wonder why I told her to wait to tell you? They stopped the ritual at just the right moment in time. He had put my soul back in my body, repaired my old wounds from giving birth to our babies, restarted my heart and brain, but he was just starting the binding spells. I would have been bound to him and died when he died if Sexy Kim here hadn't killed him when she did.\" Snarvar looks at her wide eyed. \"Wait, so you are alive again? Really, truely, fully alive?\" She giggled at that and you felt a warmth through the connection. \"Better than that, my body has been repaired, not just healed. The Goddess told me I would come back to you today, and that if you got me pregnant again I would survive, and so will Kim for that matter.\" Overcome with emotion, you turn towards her and wrap her up in the biggest hug you could give and peppered her with kisses. You weren't sure if this was your reaction or Snarvars, but it didn't matter. Snarvar had the both of you wrapped up as tight as possible in his wings, whispering that he wouldn't ever let go of either of you. \"By the way, we need to reconsumate our marriage, Lover.\"</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re fascinated by his long fangs, and the way his forked tongue flickers in and out of them as he speaks. You shake your head, suddenly realising the hypnotic affect he is having on you.

[Strangely, it seems to work.  At least the dragon is not laughing anyway.]  \"You just take me back home.  Then maybe you can e-mail me or something and we can consider the idea.  But I am not having anything to do with you otherwise.\"<br>\r\n     Instinct has raced ahead of reason and you are not sure of why you said any of your little speech.  But as your mind catches up, it reminds you that you have your instincts because they served a lot of your ancestors well, and there is a good chance they are right here too.  <br>\r\n     Certainly if you are going to get out of here, the sooner the better, and this beast had better learn right away that you are not falling for his nonsense.  And if you are staying here... well, a boy values more what he has to work for.<br>\r\n    Now why are you even considering that idea?  Surely it is impossible in so many ways... He is nothing like your dream guy, even if he is 'ruggedly handsome'.  [A term you have never been quite sure of the meaning of, before.  You have seen it used about some really ugly guys, by girls who seem to find something attractive about them.  That still doesn't apply here, surely.  OK, you have always liked lizards, and when one brat tried to tease you years ago by sticking a snake in your face, you were worried that he might hurt the poor snake, but...]<br>\r\n    \"But that is impossible.  I can't...\"<br>\r\n    \"Can't? or won't?\"<br>\r\n     \"...lose you after going to so much trouble...\"  Snarvar pauses to consider your interruption.  \"...I'm not sure actually.  meek said the whole thing was dangerous and I should not count on getting a second chance.  I'm sure it is much safer not to try.\"<br>\r\n    \"Well, let's get that Meek in here and be sure of that. I...\" you pause before you can say \"am not going to stay if I don't have to\".  Not that you trust any expert that Snarvar can trot out anyway, but there is no reason to encourage him to fix the answer.<br>\r\n     Somewhat to your surprise, Snarvar is willing to indulge you [which likely means he expects an answer you won't like.]  He takes a step and then extends his neck until he hits a part of the door, and a small window opens.  \"Bring the mage.\" he orders someone you can't see.  The reply seems to be affirmative and the window shuts.  <br>\r\n     This gives you time to notice that both bed and room are built to dragon needs, which most obviously means large.  The bed is bigger than your bedroom back home, and while the rest of the room is not fully to scale, you consider it more of a house than a room.  For a moment, you feel like a very little girl in mother's bedroom.  <br>\r\n    However, Snarvar's attention returns to you, and you try another tact.  \"Look.  As big as you are, there is just no way we can even have physical relations, much less that I can give birth to your children.  I'm just too small.\" [This is not the time to mention you have always felt your hips were too big.]<br>\r\n   \"There won't be a problem that way, I can assure you.\"  [Is he blushing?  Could that mean he has already done it?  And does that mean you are going to have to worry about ex-girlfriends as well?  Hopefully, it just means you can't read dragon expressions.]  \"I...I can't tell you much about the details, but many women have given birth to dragon children without harm.<br>\r\n    \"But it is much too early to talk about children.  Perhaps you would like a ride so you can look over my kingdom...\"  If Snarvar were human, you would be sure he is trying to change the subject, but even then you would not be sure if he is just embarrassed or if there is something he really does not want you to find out.  However, a knock at the door signals the arrival of this Meek and means you will have to find out later.</span></div></div>",

He seems the very picture of your fantasy magician; long white beard, ornately carved staff, tall pointed hat, a flowing robe, haughty attitude...<br>\r\n    ...which he promptly loses at the sight of you.  For a second his flustered behavior confuses you.  Then you recall you had been about to go to bed when you were kidnapped.  Since then you had been too scared or too angry to consider the fact you are practically naked.  Suddenly that is important, very important...  With a shriek, you dive for the bed [not at all where you want to be, but at least it gives you something to cover yourself with.]   Once covered, you peek out of the covers and glare at the males.<br>\r\n    Snarvar looks amused, but Meek has completely lost it.  He looks totally unable to decide if he should look away from you or look at nothing else.  [His compromise is rather the worst of both.]  His eyes bulge out and he seems incapable of saying whatever he is trying to say.  <br>\r\n    He has also lost that white beard, indeed is now beardless, and instead of being two or three times your age, is now several years younger.  His staff, hat, and robes have also gone from grandly impressive down to a cheap kid's outfit.  Apparently all of what you saw was some sort of illusion [which would be pretty impressive under other circumstances, but not when you are dealing with a dragon.]<br>\r\n    Snarvar comes to the rescue.  \"The lady wants to go back.  Can you convince her that is out of the question?\"<br>\r\n    \"huh?  Oh...Oh yes, quite so.  The laylands are weakened, and the spheres are misaligned.  The humours are out of balance and...\"<br>\r\n    \"I have no idea what you are saying.\" you break in.  \"Put it in layman's terms.\"<br>\r\n    \"Ah...\" Meek is having trouble talking with you while not looking at you, and trying to look at the same time.  \"...Well, pretty much it is suicide.  If you are lucky, you will totally fail.  If you do make it, it will likely be as a dead body, and probably one damaged beyond recognition.  The chance of you getting back undamaged is too small to consider.\"<br>\r\n    You find yourself reluctantly convinced by his statement.  Oh, he has every reason to lie to you, but as flustered as he is, you just don't think he could manage to be so convincing.  \"So Meek...\"<br>\r\n   \"meek\"<br>\r\n    \"That's what I said, Meek.  I'm stuck here?\"<br>\r\n    \"No, my name is meek, not Meek.  The spell I cast to let you speak our language left you with quite an accent.  I'll have to see if I can correct that.\"<br>\r\n    \"I rather like it myself.\" Snarvar breaks in with.<br>\r\n    Meek, meek... You still can't see a difference, but it hardly matters at the moment anyway.  \"But you say I can never leave here?\"<br>\r\n    \"Well, I can't say never.\" Meek/meek says.  \"But it will be at least a year before you will have a serious hope of surviving.\"<br>\r\n    Well, if you are going to have to stay here... \"But this nonsense about my having his children, that's just not possible...\"<br>\r\n   \"It may not be where you come from, but it's merely unusual here.  It is quite possible that there are no humans or dragons that do not have ancestors of the other race.  I myself am about 1/16th dragon, which means I can change shape into a dragon, if I want to kill myself, or suffer enough pain to make death preferable.  Most people have less, considerably less, dragon ancestry, but it is still there.<br>\r\n    \"You can successfully mate with a wide variety of races, tho I assume you have no interest in doing so.  Most of us have a powerful preference for our own race.  However, the standard rule here is that one female of any race plus one male of any race equals three.\"<br>\r\n    meek seems to have regained his composure, and about twenty plus years of age.  The rest of his appearance has also grown more impressive again.  Odd.  Worth asking about?<br>\r\n    Snarvar did mention taking you on a flight.  Maybe you should accept that invitation.  Or maybe you should get more facts about the situation.<br>\r\n    Of course the first thing is that you are going to do is demand some decent clothing. </span></div></div>",

However, it is the dragon that is important.  \"But how would such a system work?

How does any girl know a boy is lying to her?  His lips are moving.  \"The truth, now!\"<br>\r\n     \"OK, OK...\" Snarvar crumbles.  \"The truth is that I can mate with just about any woman, but I don't dare...  I'm .... well, I'm too pure a dragon.  By all rights I ought to be a ravaging monster who doesn't care a bit about anybody and prefers people stay away except when I want to eat or rob them.  It's only half-dragons who like to be around people.  But if I am so uniquely tame, my children will be unusually violent.  And that means I mustn't mate with anyone with the least dragon ancestry.  My children would be monsters that would be destroyed as soon as I was unable to protect them.  But as Meek told you, everyone has some dragon ancestry.  So I had to go to another world to find a wife...\"<br>\r\n    \"And you just picked me at random?\"  That is the sort of reason a girl should believe a boy's lies.  The truth can be rather deflating.<br>\r\n    \"No...not exactly.\"  Snarvar tries to explain.  \"Peace says we will fit together well.\"<br>\r\n    \"Peace?  Who is Peace?\"<br>\r\n    \"She is my chief priest.\"  Snarvar answers. \"I don't know how she knows that.  But I do know she and meek considered quite a few women before you were selected.\"<br>\r\n    \"If pure dragons don't like people, how are there any half dragon?\"  You are not sure you really care about the answer, but you do have things to think about, and the answer will at least let you absorb some of what you have been told.<br>\r\n    \"Nobody really knows, tho a lot say they do, and tell very different stories.\" Snarvar admits.  \"The most common guess is that some dragon attacked a flock of sheep, ate the sheep, and then raped the shepherdess.\"<br>\r\n    \"Wouldn't he have eaten her too?\"<br>\r\n    \"Well, actually you humans don't taste all that good.\"  Snarvar opinions.  \"Meat is meat, but the main reason there are lots of stories of kidnapped princesses being rescued is that the dragon didn't deem her tasty.\"<br>\r\n    \"And just how do you know this?\"<br>\r\n    \"We have a Murderer or other condemned prisoner now and then.  A little too often for my taste, but death by dragon is the standard penalty, and there is no sense in letting the meat just rot.<br>\r\n     \"Now if everybody were fully rational, I suppose I would be eating everybody when they died, but that makes people upset, and I prefer cows and goats myself.  So I only eat a few criminals.  However, that makes it a good punishment.\"<br>\r\n    You are not quite sure how to take this, but the entry of someone distracts you.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

How the hell do you know me?!\" you yell at the dragon.  Snarvar smiled a little and pointed to a shallow bowl of water on a pedastle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That water is magical.  I used it to scry for a female who could bare my children.  And it showed me you,\" Snarvar replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you fell for me at first glance?\" you ask, feeling violated by this peeping dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the water showed me you just when you were able to conceive children,\" Snarvar said, \"Over the last month I watched your life as you matured and grew up into the beautiful woman you are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I had my first period over five years ago!\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.  I do not know if time flows differently between this world and yours or I only saw your life in retelling.

You stole it from me!\" you reply coldly, \"Why the hell do you think I'd take this offer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Working at that small place gaining minimal amounts of money, never truly accomplishing anything in that world?  Yes I stole such great things from you,\" Snarvar's voice was cold and sharp, but in a breath turned into a soft, gentle sound you would never expect such a creature to make, \"And in return I offer you to be my Lady, of near equal standing to me, to never have to worry about a meaningless job or being alone ever again.\"  He lowered his head to you, his ruby eyes stared longingly at you, wanting you to say yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I still refuse?\" you reply coldly, not wanting to admit his offer was tempting.  A college drop out making fries really did not have many options in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are my guest until the next new moon where I will return you to your land,\" Snarvar replied.</span></div></div>",

Get her ready.\"<br>\r\n      \"Ready?  Ready for what?\" you ask with an undertone of fear.<br>\r\n      The knight turns back to you and smiles evilly then started to walk away.  The two knights he spoke of step on either side of you and grab your upper arms in a tight grip.  You find the courage to struggle and get their hands loose from your arms.  Then you run the opposite direction, struggling with all your might to make your legs pump faster.  You hear the clatter of armor as someone is in pursuit.  You get a few more leg length in before something hits you in the back, knocking the breath out of you and dragging you down to the ground.  As you're trying to force air back into your lungs the knights bring a length of rope turns you and binds your hands in front of you and also hobbling your feet.  They set you on your feet and again place their hand on your upper arms this time in an even tighter grip that was sure to leave bruises.<br>\r\n      They lead you through wooden doors and into the castle beyond.  You pass through lavishly adorned stone hallways.  But as you continue, the adornments get fewer and far in between.  Finally you come before a thick oak wood door.  One of the knights\u2019 pulls a key out and unlocks the door.  It opens without a sound which scares you more than it would have if it had opened with a loud menacing creak.  It takes a moment for you eyes to adjust to the darkness beyond but when the do you rather wish they hadn't.<br>\r\n       Excluding the blood and the dead bodies the room looks almost like a torture chamber, except the instruments in here looked pristine, like they had never been used either that or had been taken good care to keep them in fine condition.  Another thing you notice that most torture chambers don't have was a king size bed, only this bed had shackles hooked to the four posters of the bed.<br>\r\n      You nearly pass out as you realize this is the 'special guest room'.<br>\r\n      The knights pulls you through the door way with a hard tug and the door slams behind you.</span></div></div>",

Those approaching show no sign that they understand you.  [Figures.  The ancients often stayed all their lives within a mile of their birthplace.  Only the locals spoke the local tongue, and they often spoke no other.]  They don't look interested in trying either.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Instead of asking more questions that won't be answered, you look over those approaching.  All but one are quickly identified as soldiers of some sort.  Their weapons look middle ageist, tho you can only guess if they are utilitarian or for show.  [You recall a picture of the Queen of England that had included some ceremonial guards bearing weapons like their's.]  The somewhat oldest one of them might be in charge of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   However, it is the different figure in the center who is clearly in charge of the entire group.  The soldiers may surround him, but they still follow the path he is taking.<br>\r\nA noise from behind causes you to look at the dragon, who has adopted a pose which, while not necessarily servile, shows it is aware of the man's approach, and is reacting to it.  The man makes no such acknowledgment the dragon is even present.  His attention is focused on you, and not in a particularly friendly way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Physically he is not a particularly impressive individual.  Definitely on the far side of 50 and not in prime physical shape, he was rather ordinary.  She would have never noticed him in any crowd, if he were wearing clothing she was used to.  Now that of course is very much a point.  The costume he is wearing is very much the picture of the fantasy wizard, complete with pointed had and long beard.  But magicians are impossible, aren't they?  <br>\r\n   Aren't dragons impossible too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Magician or not, he is running the show.  At a word, two of the soldiers grab you, gently perhaps, but quite firmly.  You make a quick attempt to get free, but realize quickly enough that you are going nowhere and subside.<br>\r\n   The mage? now does some strange gestures, meaningless to you, and says some words that seem even more meaningless.  When he is done, he opens his mouth wide and then points to you, clearly demanding you do the same.  When you hesitate to obey, he gestures to another soldier who advances with a weird device, whose function you fear you know.  It seems you can surrender with your dignity or without.  You choose with, and open your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Something goes into it, and for a moment you try to spit it out.  But at the order \"Swallow!\", you do so, before realizing you had understood the command.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Now then.  You are the slave of Snarvar here.\"  He gestures at the dragon casually.  \"You will do as he says and will stay in his quarters.\"  With that, he turns and leaves, as if you are a matter of no importance.  Your demand he wait and explain...well anything... is ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With no idea what else to do, you turn to consider your new \"master\".</span></div></div>",

He may weigh two tons and have a mouthful of sharp teeth, claws, and a fire breath that can kill, but he is still just a kid, barely big enough to know girls are neat to have around.  He's not the captain of the football team or the campus king, not anything close to those huge powerful, self-confident dragons of the stories.  He's the little loser that you chased away when he followed you like a puppy.  [For a moment you wonder if somehow you have actually fallened into some stupid video game.  You should be so lucky.  Ignoring other points, any little twerp like this wouldn't be acting like this.  He would be doing a bad imitation of a real hero.  No, just your luck that this is entirely real, and you are the slave of this little, 4000 lb geek.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    This is just too much.  All your terror becomes fury.  \"You beast!  You jerk!  You have the nerve to treat me like this!\"  The dragon is unwise enough to bend its head down to see what was the matter.  Your swing of a fist at that huge nose may well have hurt you more than him, but it still feels good to you.<br>\r\n    Not to the dragon.  It jerks back in shock, confused and wondering what has gone wrong.  You are in no mood to stop, and march forward and kick a massive leg.  Again, your foot probably hurts worse than any part of the dragon, but it is the dragon who is retreating, almost whimpering \"But...but...what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"WHAT'S WRONG?!!  You jerk me out of my bed in the middle of the night, carry me off to God knows where, scare me more than half to death, and you're just a kid... What's not wrong?!\"  As you pause for breath, you realize you have continued to advance on the dragon, which has retreated from your attack until it is positioned much like an overgrown puppy that knows it is about to get a spanking and hopes that big tearful eyes will save it.  Fat chance this time.  \"Now, you take me back to my home, Right Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But I can't.  I don't know how...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You brought me here.  You can take me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now Ma'am, he's right.  He doesn't.\"  A new voice.  Who?  You turn to see one of the soldiers, amused by seeing the puppy take on something 30 times her size, or maybe the standard amusement of any male at the discomfort of another one when dealing with a woman.  Either way, he continues  \"Only Lord Highhat knows that, and He's not about to tell you, as you should know.  You are stuck here and will have to make the best of it.\"<br>\r\n    \"Just follow Lord Lizard to his quarters.  You should find clothing there, not that I am going to object if you don't want to wear it...\"<br>\r\n   The leer in his voice causes you to look down.  You had only been wearing panties and bra when you started this misadventure, and both have suffered during the trip.  A quick scream of horror is followed by hands trying to cover entirely too many places, and \"You, you big jerk.  You take me to those clothes right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A look of fear in his big eyes, the dragon turns and moves at a run, which you deem humiliatingly slow as you run after him to ....<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

The dragon is completely humiliated, but you don't care. it serves him right for kindnapping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon takes off and you both quickly arrive at the dragon's room. You don't give him time to let you off. You hop off and look around. The room is very large an it bigger than a few house put together.

One of the beds is larger and just a bunch of pillows that formed a circle on the ground, it is obviously the dragon's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush to the desser and take out some clothes.

Turn around and close your eyes!\"  Reluctantly, the dragon complies.  Having had a little experience with boys [You are not sure if it has been too little or too much.  It could be both.], you wait, and catch his head turning to sneak a peak.  \"You keep that head looking away from me until I say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Sheepishly, the huge head turns to stare out the window/door.  You take a quick look to see if there is any mirror the dragon could be using, but apparently he is not up to that level of sneakiness, at least not yet.  So you turn back to dressing as the dragon complains \"This isn't what I expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It's not what I expected either, and you at least had a choice about it.  So you are just going to have to suffer the consequences of that choice!\"  As you say this, your hand dives into the dresser to get the rest of your clothing and pulls out ... a duplicate of what you are already wearing...<br>\r\n   This is it?  This can't be all you are expected to wear.  It barely is enough to qualify as the sort of underwear you wear when you want to feel extra-sexy.  You can't be expected to run around exposing such a slutty outfit to public view, can you?...<br>\r\n   A quick look in all the drawers says that is exactly what is expected.  There is a grand total of 3 outfits, the total of which is not enough cloth for a decent dress, much less a full outfit.  You might as well be stark naked.  Indeed, for a moment, you consider the idea.  There can be almost acceptable reasons for not having any clothes on.  The only reason for wearing something like ...this... is entirely unacceptable.  Are you supposed to be the dragon's sex toy?<br>\r\n   You have heard that \"one size fits all\", but also that there can be too much of a good thing, and you are not saying that any part of that dragon is any good either.   But he has got to be too large, among other things.  You resist looking to see.  It would be horrible if he caught you, and you seem to recall that reptiles keep it out of sight anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Is there anything else you can wear?  The sheet from the bed?  No, that sounds pretty inviting too.  Anything at all?  Nothing?  You sigh.  For now you will just have to resign yourself to looking like something from a porn shoot.  <br>\r\n   Now is it good or bad news that you look pretty hot in it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Well, there are more important questions to consider... \"Speaking of which, why did you choose me?\"</span></div></div>",

But I do know it's important, and that you fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   This sounds like nonsense.  \"ridiculous!  That has got to be poppycock.

No.  I told him I needed a girl that fit, and he provided the means to find you.

You can't really recall.  Of course, flying on a dragon is odd in and of itself, but there was something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Dragon.  Lie down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Could you call me Snarvar?  It is my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You are tempted to say no.  Using his name implies a degree of approval, which you do not want to even start to do.  Still, it doesn't imply it that hard and you have to get along with this monster, at least for a little while... \"Alright, Snarvar, lie down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   He does as told, and you climb onto him, a process hampered by parts of him being downright hot to the touch.  Fortunately you move your foot before it gets burned.  But most of his hide seems to be pretty much typical leather.  It's a bit like alligator and feels like it too ....  What was that?<br>\r\n   You move your hand back over this one area.  No, that is not like alligator, or anything else you can recall.  It's quite hard to really describe but it is just different.  As you explore to see how big this area is, you realize you can see the difference too.  Again, you can't seem to put the difference into words, and in many respects, you can't even say there is a difference, but it is still there.  <br>\r\n   The area proves quite large before you begin to find the edges, rather precise edges too.  It is definitely much longer than wide and as you probe forward with your hands your legs are also fitting into this different area...<br>\r\n  Fitting?  Quickly you test and verify this is indeed a woman shaped area on the back of the dragon, one of precisely your size.  Moreover, you seem to be slightly sinking into the dragon, and the sides are almost grasping you.  For a moment, this panics you and you try to get loose, which is absurdly easy.  Relaxing, you come back in contact with the area, and are again gripped.  But again when you life your hand, it come free.<br>\r\n   This some sort of magic velcro?  It does sorta act like it.  You seem stuck, but can easily get loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     That's what was so odd about the flight up here.  You just should not have been able to hold onto the dragon when it was flying.  It was too bumpy and you had too little to hold onto.  You should have fallen off ... except that you had fit into this area and it held you to the dragon.  That makes sense ... at least as much as anything around here does.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   That also explains why there is so little to your clothing.  This patch of dragon skin is bonding to your skin, not to the cloth.  In a decent outfit, you might fall off.  So that is explained, in part.  Even with that explanation, it is still half the size it could be, and shameless even by that size.  Definitely designed by some perverted male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    So you and the dragon are supposed to be some sort of flying team?  You are not sure how you feel about that.  For that matter you are not sure the idea is more than speculation.  You need to get some more information.</span></div></div>",

Of course, it is only a very basic test.  \"OK, now stand up on your hind legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hey!  You are my slave.  You should be obeying me, not ordering me around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Drat, the dragon is getting his spirit back.  Well, it would have happened eventually.  So you will just have to deal with it now instead of later.  \"Tough!  You are a boy wanting me to do what I have no intention of doing.  If you want me to change my mind, you do as told.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"And why should I care what you want?  I'm way bigger than you are.  I can just take what I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You do, and I'll find a way to make you regret it.  You have to sleep sometime, and even if I can't find a way to kill you, I can still do terrible harm.  You want to lose an eye or a wing?\"<br>\r\n    You wonder how much you are bluffing.  You are not sure how vulnerable the dragon is, nor if you can find a weapon in this room.  There certainly isn't much in it that is promising.  You should be able to find something to use on a vulnerable point, but...<br>\r\n   Moreover, you know of a lot of women who have been too brutalized to resist their oppressor.  If he beats you often enough, will you still have the nerve to fight him?  You certainly can't win anything at all close to a fair fight.<br>\r\n   Wait... Maybe he can't use anything like his full strength.  He wants you alive after all, and you are so fragile compared to him that he could kill you by accident so easily.  That is a real perverted way for you to win, but maybe it will hold him back from attacking.  Maybe...<br>\r\n    Maybe you had better give him a reason not to attack.  \"Besides, it is more fun if the girl is willing.\"  More fun for the girl anyway.  You wouldn't know about the men, and given their perverted nature, you are not interesting in finding out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    For a moment the dragon is silent, considering your arguments, and you barely can breathe as he makes his decision.  Then with a sigh, he gets up on his hind legs and you can go back to finding out how well you stick to the dragon.<br>\r\n     Pretty well really.  Despite holding onto nothing, and nothing under your feet, you are not falling, or even feeling that you are pushing it.  You lift your arms away from the dragon, but there is still no sign you are straining things.  For an instant, you consider some Spiderman sort of stunt, but decide not to try it just yet.  You did OK in gym, but you weren't even best in class.  You can just see any such stunt ending in humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"What are you trying to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh!  Well, I have found I can stick to part of your back.  I think we are supposed to be some sort of flying team, but before I risk a flight I am trying to make sure I won't fall off.  <br>\r\n   \"Isn't this what you meant by fitting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I don't know.  It could be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Odd the dragon doesn't know.  Maybe you should ask him why?  But maybe it can wait until after the 1st flight.</span></div></div>",

Out the window with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Snarvar does as told, just in time to make academic sudden doubts that you had tested your velcro ability sufficiently.  Even as you open your mouth to countermand your orders, the dragon is leaping onto open air and you are desperately try to find something to hang onto, a desperation that increases as the dragon starts to lose altitude...<br>\r\n   Then his wings beat, and you are almost slammed into his body, breaking what little hand holds you have.  For a second you panic, but then you realize you are still sticking to the dragon.  It's working!  You are flying!  <br>\r\n   Boy that was scary at first.  But at least you didn't lose your dinner. ...  Well, didn't lose it right away ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You are still green a few moments later when Snarvar asks \"Well, now what.  You ready to go back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ye...yes.\" is your answer and the dragon makes a tight turn.  As he does so, you suddenly find yourself enjoying the ride. \"Whee!  Do that again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But didn't you want to go back?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"A lady has a right to change her mind.  Make a real tight turn again.\"  He shrugs and obeys, a little too well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You had thought the previous turn was tight.  Obviously it was not.  This time Snarvar seems to stand on his wingtip, if not flip over entirely.  You can see only ground instead of the sky you had been seeing, at least until you bury your head into the dragon hide.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It seems like forever later that you hear \"Now what?\"  The dragon may weigh tons, but you can still hear a little boy proud of himself for pulling off a difficult stunt.  You'd tell him off if you hadn't asked for it [or maybe because you had], but you are not sure you can control your stomach while you do.  Just as well it is already empty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Once your have control of yourself, \"I..think that's enough for now.  Let's go back..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The dragon is agreeable, and soon the castle is growing in your vision.  And your stomach is making itself known, an opinion not shared by your mouth.  But maybe it is time to investigate the food conditions here.  Or maybe ask the dragon about its history first... </span></div></div>",

Probably best not to push, at least when you have other questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But what's your story?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Huh?\"  The dragon has turned the tables on you, and if you are to get the information you need, you are going to have to answer some questions yourself.  Well, no reason not to answer.  \"My name is Kim Johnson.  I\u2019m nobody special.  I did do well in school, but not that well.  My folks were just average folk.\u201d  You would just as soon he not pick up on the \u2018were\u2019.

There is a delighted cry from the dragon \"Dinner's ready!\", a cry you are pleased with too, but you still want some answers.  Perhaps ask these soldiers who are easy to reach, but may not know?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    The dragon's landing is quicker this time and more direct.  You suppose you will have to ask him about that some time, but everything is pretty confusing right now, and you doubt you would understand the answer.  Besides, there is dinner to consider at the moment, not to mention more basic questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Dinner for the dragon proves to be a pile of meat, about as large as you are [a distinctly unsettling thought].  As the dragon starts to eat with a fair degree of gusto, you are handed a bowl of what looks to be stew.  At home you would have debated between throwing it out, or leaving it in the back of the fridge to age a bit first.  Still, you have eaten worse when the alternative was actually doing the cooking.  It at least proves no worse than you feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As you pick at it, you notice the serving woman is sitting down to her bowl and attacking it with a good deal more enthusiasm than you are.  From her figure, you seriously doubt she is at all starving, but none of that stew is going to be wasted.  Waisted, quite possibly.  But she is definitely enjoying it.<br>\r\n   As she finishes and leans back to relax, you decide it is time to start asking some of those questions.  \"I am Kim, Kim Johnson.  Can I have you name?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She turns a friendly face towards you \"I'm Wigana.  You gettin long with mi little lad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Your lad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Did most of the raisin of him, if you please.  More of a mom ta him than his mom was.  He's gotten grown up now and bout all I can do these days is help with the feedin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh...well, I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hear tell ya put him in his place.  That's likely a good thing.  Lad was gettin a bit big for his britches of late.  But mind you, don't you hurt my little boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You are not sure you can, but... \"I won't, but what is going on?  Why have I been brought here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Now that I can't say.  And I'm not so sure anybody else can either.<br>\r\n   \"Ya see.  Lord Loy, he's the ruler here, he's somethin of a vision mage.  He can see ta future, but not too often and not too clearly.  <br>\r\n   \"Ya can tell when's he's had a vision.  He gets all quiet and gloomy fer a few days.  Then he starts givin all sorts of orders.  Lots of them don't make any sense, but he won't have it any other way, and he's ta lord.  And he won't explain neither.  Tryin ta pretend he knows more than he does if ya asks me.  <br>\r\n   \"But we's can usually guess just how much he knows, and with Snarvie, he's actin like he knows lots more than he does.  He's sure the dragon's very important, but probably not much else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You are tempted to tell her that seeing the future is impossible, but then so are dragons flying around.  And you recall a poly sic prof who told you that if the man with the gun said he was a god, it was a very bad idea to tell him he wasn't.  So to more practical points...<br>\r\n   Try to see Lord Loy?  He has to know a lot you need to know even if he doesn't know all you want.  Or just keep talking with Wigana?  She knows a fair amount, even if it is not the big picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Ta's just the way things is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You press on.  \"But why?  What does the dragon do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Wigana admits \"Well, I don't really know.  Tain't my place fer one thing.  But ta Lord, he may not be as smart as he thinks he is, but he's still a pretty bright guy, and he really wanted that dragon.  Paid a lot of gold fer that egg.  That's good nuff fer me, and should be fer you too.\"<br>\r\n   Seeing you are not convinced, she adds \"One thing I do know is we ain't been attacked since that egg hatched.  We had ta suffer several sieges fer that, but none since.  Now I can't say it had anything to do with it.  Maybe Lord Loy just ran out of enemies.  Maybe...whatever.  But we've had a pretty good span of peace and I figure feedin ta dragon a couple of cows is a small price ta pay fer that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But you have no idea what I am here for and what I am to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Well, I've heard that every dragon needs a rider.

And there ain't no female dragons round here far as we know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You recall some of the dragon's behavior with you.  \"I am not going to be his sexual toy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Suppose we really ought ta marry ta two of you, if that's ta idea.  But it's early on ta be makin plans like that.  Til we does know better, yer probably right.  Never have met a man who didn't treat his woman better for her having said no ta him til he got serious bout marriage.  <br>\r\n    \"But ya really should consider the bright spots.  Ta lad's a pretty good sort.  Better than a lot of men round here, if ya asks me.\"  [Given she is his \"mother\", you are not convinced by her claim.]  \"Ya could do a lot worse.  That's sure.  And ya probably will do durn well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Fortunately, you don't need to answer.  The dragon is done with dinner and Wigana must get to work with the cleanup.  But you still don't have any answers, just more worries.  Now the dragon seems to to want to fly back to his room, where you would be alone with him, a distinctly disquieting prospect, given what Wigana just said.  Still, you have been able to control him so far, and he may be able to tell you more about what is going on here.  But maybe it is time to demand Lord Loy tell you something...</span></div></div>",

Tis already late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With a bit of shock, you realize it is almost dark.  You almost make a remark about time to turn on the lights, but then you recall where you are.  There are no electrical lights here.  Not even any gas ones.  These people are ruled by the Sun.  They rise at first light and stop when it gets dark.<br>\r\n    And now it is getting dark.  The day is done.  That means next on the calendar is sleeping.  As far as you are concerned, it is hours early, but you have no choice in the matter.  On this at least, you will just have to adjust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Well, off to your room.  Fortunately Snarvar makes no trouble.  He has likely had a harder day than you have and could easily be quite tired.  Not that you are sympathetic since most of that energy was used to kidnap you, but at least he is not objecting to you giving the orders despite being considered his slave and being outweighed about 20-1 or more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You seem to be adjusting to flight quickly tho.  Of course it is just a little hop, but you do have a full belly and you were rather sensitive earlier.  But this time, you don't even feel a bit of distress.  One good thing at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Getting off the dragon, you now have to consider the problem of getting ready for bed without that \"little\" pervert watching.  You consider again ordering him not to look, but you are just not going to get much privacy with him in the same room no matter what you do.  You will just have to crawl under the covers and remove your clothing the...  <br>\r\n   Covers?  What covers?  Or blankets?  The bed has nothing but a sheet!  But,.. but...  Well, there is nothing to be done about it.  At least it is not transparent.  So under it you go.<br>\r\n    As you had expected, you do not fall asleep quickly.  [Besides your not being sleepy, the dragon snores, loudly.]  You try considering your predicament, but without really making much progress in what you should do.  Eventually sleep does come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Briefly it seems.  You wake, shivering.  The room is downright cold, and you have no clothing worth mentioning, and a sheet that is almost worthless as insulation.  Maybe it's not cold enough to kill you, but it is getting cold enough that you are not sure that death would be a bad thing.  You can't even stop your teeth from chattering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Was the dragon waiting for that?  Or does he just have excellent hearing?  In any case, Snarvar asks \"Cold?  Come to my bed and I can warm you up.\"  You can hear the delight in his voice.  He is going to get a free feel out of this, if not a good deal more.<br>\r\n   But the dragon is warm, hot even.  And you are in a very cold room, effectively naked for all the good what little cloth you have is doing.  OK, he is not going to be a complete gentleman, but surely you can stop him from being too improper.  And it is really cold...<br>\r\n   But you can see where that is going to lead, and that is not going to happen if you have anything to say about it.<br>\r\n   But you are going to lose any war with the dragon.  Surely you can be friends without .. well, things getting out of hand.  Can't you?  <br>\r\n   But...<br>\r\n   Well, you had best stop considering the offer and answer.  All you are doing by thinking is getting colder.</span></div></div>",

You don't want to rush into his [warm] arms.  That might give the wrong impression.  But if you hesitate, you are hinting you are aware of that aspect, and still being willing.

The consequences may be dire, and not far away either, but you can't think of anything but getting to that heat and you are hugging that gigantic beast as hard as you can, and welcoming that arm that curves around you and warms your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It doesn't take too long to warm up enough to become rational again, but that is too late.  You are either doomed or in no great danger.  Either way, trying to escape isn't going to help.  And the cold is waiting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Come on.

But that was a dream and I'll wake up in my sleeping bag in my tent.\"  Kim's eyes opened slowly, but they did not find her tent's ceiling.  Instead, they found a a stone floor moving beneath her.  \"What is this?\" Kim wondered, \"Oh yeah, it wasn't a dream.\"  She gave a heavy sigh and elbowed Snarvar's stomach as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're awake,\" Snarvar said, looking down, \"There are nicer ways to greet me in the morning, since we'll probably be sleeping together more often since winter's coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just great, what are you doing?\" Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was testing our bond,\" Snarvar said, \"Yesterday you were concentrating on staying on me.  I wanted to know if you would stay on, even if you weren't aware of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like it,\" Kim said, once again trying to get off the stomach.  She was both relieved to know this, but also didn't like that he could moved so easily with her on him without her knowing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there's something I think I need to tell you, while I have your attention,\" Snarvar said, smiling a toothy grin, which Kim couldn't see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kim asked.</span></div></div>",

Just how a patch of skin and scales could have held onto you in the first place is a mystery, but somehow he was doing it.  For the moment, you are just happy you felt the change in time to land on your feet. <br>\r\n   But this increased bond between you will need to be explored.  If nothing else, it may mean you can finally wear some decent clothing and not have to worry about falling off.  [A voice in the back of your mind hints you are not going to be so lucky.]  So there will have to be some testing on the ground and in the air.  So to start...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n    Wait ... Was he referring to this physical bond?  His wording sounded a bit odd for that.  Perhaps you had best check...  \"Snarvar, what do you mean by bonded?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Snarvar looks superior, and then confused  \"Why bonding is ...  It's ...  Well, I know it happened, and it's important, very important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    So it is something beside just this magic velcro.  But just what?  You recall reading that baby birds will bond to whatever creature they see at hatching as their mother.  Has the dragon bonded with the first female he slept with?  Are you now his wife?  or fiance?  You suppose that is better than being his lust toy, but it is not something you are going to approve of.  You didn't bond with him<br>\r\n    ....did you?  <br>\r\n    Are you taking this situation a little too calmly?  Shouldn't you be hysterical?  Or catonic?  Shouldn't you be horrified by the very idea of sex with this monster?  That sort of bestiality is surely something you would never do.  [You shut down the sudden memory of that wonderful horse ride and of your wish he could have talked and said some very romantic things.]<br>\r\n   But you have always been a pretty practical lass, ready to roll with the punches, so you don't really think you are behaving differently than you would have predicted.  Besides, you were not behaving that differently yesterday ... or were you?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    There are some scary implications, and you are not sure you want to explore them, at least not just yet.  For now, maybe it is better to check on how much your ability to stick to the dragon has increased.  Or maybe it is time for breakfast...</span></div></div>",

In particular, whether you can get some decent [well, maybe just a little indecent...] clothing instead of this slutty trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Snarvar, hold still a moment.\"  When he does, you climb onto him.  You are careful not to look for foot or hand holds.  Instead, you just touch him as if you expect to stick to where you touch.  A totally silly notion, ... which works quite well.  It is no more trouble than a set of steep stairs.  Soon you are standing on his back.  So far so good.  Now for some stupid stunts.  ...<br>\r\n   You jump, and stop where you land.  No slide.  No slip.  Now you make a longer and harder jump and land on your feet ... and then flat on your face.  This sticking is not all good then.  Still, it is good to know you are not letting go until you want to.<br>\r\n   OK, try a roll ...  Pretty good.  You roll until you want to stop, and suddenly you are sticking to the dragon again.  <br>\r\n   Now that real sticky spot ... Yes, it is even more gripping now, but it still releases at will.  So why is it there if you can stick anywhere?  ... Maybe that means the grip on the rest of the dragon may not be adequate for some flying.  Or maybe ...  Well, you will have to test that somehow, but later.<br>\r\n   Now for clothing.  You scramble down and grab the sheet from your bed.  Way too thin to be of much use as a protection against cold, and frankly too thin to really qualify as clothing either.  You can see right thru it.  Wearing this, you still feel like a slut.  Still, it may do as a test...<br>\r\n    Back to the dragon and you climb up ... and slide right back to the floor.  You try again, and get to his back only after struggling all the way.  Over to the sticky spot. ...  Well, at least this is still sticky, but it's not nearly as strong.<br>\r\n    Does this mean this entirely inadequate outfit is all you can wear?  If so, that seems to be proof that there is a god, and that He is a loutish male with no respect for a woman's privacy!<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n    Well, you are not going to give up yet, but ... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Kim, it's breakfast time.  Let's fly down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OK\"  Toss the sheet and get into the fitting area.  It seems now you can fly down on tiptoes without risk, but only a boy would take such a risk.  \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It was only when you are in the air that you remember that he called you \"Kim\".  When did you tell him your name?  It's a casual thing.  Surely you just forgot it, or maybe he heard when you introduced yourself to his \"mother\".  Or maybe this bonding means something...  That's a rather scary thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Well, it will have to wait until after breakfast, and you should learn something then.  Tho that will likely just add a dozen more questions.</span></div></div>",

Of course, the locals don't seem to sit around much, so maybe you will get enough exercise to burn off the calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Now to see if this Lord Loy will answer any of your questions.  You head for the door, only to be blocked by the guards.  The important looking one tells you \"Lord Loy's orders.  You are to return to the dragon with me.\"<br>\r\n    Your protests are ignored, and somewhat half-hearted anyway.  The attitude of this guard suggest something is up and so some of your questions will be answered soon enough anyway.  You try asking anyway as the two of you head to Snarvar, who has finished his meal too, and get the unencouraging \"Lord Loy will explain when he feels the time is right.\"<br>\r\n    He does unbend enough to say \"His Mageship does not ask my advice or explain things to me.  There have been times he could have benefited from doing so, but he has been right a much greater number of times.  So I hear and obey, and you will be wise to do the same.  [Advice you don't plan on taking if you have anything to say about it.  Of course, it is not clear you do.]<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    Once he has the dragon's attention, the guard takes off a belt pouch and hands it to you.  As you strap it on you, trying to find some way it covers a little of you, the guard announces \"This is to be delivered to Lord Tangye.  It will likely take you all day to get there.  So you presumably will stay the night before returning on the morrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"And how do we get there?\"  The answer sounds terribly complicated and confusing.  It is repeated upon request, but sounds little clearer.  Snarvar insists he can follow the directions, tho he admits to having never been there.  Your protest that there must be easier directions is rejected and you are told to be on your way.<br>\r\n   Well, Snarvar is eager to go, and so you see little choice but to climb aboard and .. fall down when the dragon immediately jumps into the sky.   That bond can come in handy it seems.  You would have fallen right off the dragon without that connection.  Of course, about the time you figure this out, you are 100 feet up in the air and with nothing but the bond keeping you on the dragon.  Not a good situation, but at least your terror is keeping your stomach quiet.  <br>\r\n    Getting to the stop where you \"fit\", and stick harder, sounds like the best plan and you carefully crawl to it, being careful not to pull too much of you away from the dragon.  Finally you make it, and feel a grip on you that seems as strong as steel.  You can relax a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Which reminds you.  Is Snarvar following the directions?  It seems so and he confidently recites what sounds like the directions.  So you wonder if this is your purpose here, to be a showy and fast messenger?  Seems rather inefficient to you, but maybe it works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As time passes, you grow more relaxed, and begin to stop trying to burrow into Snarvar's skin.  Indeed, you start raising yourself enough to look around and get comfortable.  You wonder if eventually you will be standing straight up for the better view.  Not this time anyway, but you are beginning to think your bond is that strong.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But as the hours pass, you begin to worry.  You can't be sure, but you feel lost.  Were the directions wrong?  Did you miss one?  Take the wrong direction somewhere?  Snarvar is still confident, but you try suggesting he stop for directions.  Typical male, he insist he knows where he is going, and there is really little you can do but be a worried passenger.   </span></div></div>",

OK, you shouldn't have opened the letter, but he was the one who gave you the bad directions and left you with little choice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    He was, wasn't he?  And he was the one who wrote this letter too, before you left, much less before you were thinking of opening it.  He knew this was going to happen. But why would he cause this to happen?  It makes no sense.  He spent a fortune on that dragon, and all she had heard said the dragon was considered quite valuable.  Odds are it wasn't cheap to get her here either.  So why throw all that away?<br>\r\n    Had he seen some vision where the two of you destroyed him?  You recall a story where the one seeing the future killer tried to kill him, only to give him motive to kill the viewer.  At the moment, you rather hope that is the case here.  Hurting Lord Loy is quite appealing right now.  <br>\r\n    But this requires he just had this vision very recently.  And why not kill you and the dragon at the castle?  However dangerous this forest is, there is definitely a chance you will get out of it alive.  It does sound safer to kill you at the castle where your death was sure.  So maybe he doesn't want to hurt you.<br>\r\n  So are you being unfair to Lord Loy?  Maybe this is some sort of the mother bird kicking the baby out of the nest?  That doesn't seem likely.  You could definitely use some more nest time.  Of course that is what most kids think.  Maybe Lord Loy knows something you don't.  <br>\r\n   But that letter seemed rather nasty for such a reason.  Or were you misreading it?  Maybe you missed something...  You start to read it again ... and remember you tore it up.  Half the pieces seem to have vanished already.  Bother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Well, it really doesn't matter.  You have got to deal with the current situation.  And that means apologizing to Snarvar.  Even if this was a trap by Lord Loy, you were the one who fell into it.  You are also the adult [emotionally anyway.  Snarvar might be older than you are for all you actually know, but he is acting years younger.] who should accept responsibility.  And your chance of getting out of this forest alive is quite likely low without the dragon  Even if you are not a total stranger to the great outdoors, there are plenty of things that could kill you at home, and the dangers are surely greater here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    So you follow the dragon.  Fortunately he has not gone far.  You find him still crying. [Crying?  Didn't you read somewhere that lizards can't cry?  Well, you have some rather definite evidence to the contrary.]  Giving him a kiss he may not be able to feel, you blurt out \"I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have opened the letter.  It was a foolish action.  But I didn't realize Lord Loy would be so mad.<br>\r\n    \"I also didn't realize he intended for this to happen.  But he had to have written that letter before we left and so he was intending to get rid of us for some reason.  I don't know why, but I don't think there was any way we could have avoided this.<br>\r\n   \"So now we only have each other, and we have to worry about our survival. It won't be as hard as he says [you hope].  So buck up and we'll be alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But he has always been so good to me.  How could he be so mad?  Maybe if we go back, he'll forgive us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    At least he is saying \"we\", but ...  \"Maybe, but that letter sounded pretty definite.  Killed on sight isn't encouraging.

Snarvar is say \"My sweet, my beauty.  I have a gift for you\", and it suddenly feels like he is carrying you like a box of chocolates.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   In a moment you are out of the clearing you landed in, and into a smaller one, and very much wishing you were not.  On the far side of the clearing is a creature from horror, with teeth that look bigger than you are... OK, you are just being scared.  But those teeth are as long as than the swords you had seen on the soldiers.  One bite and you won't care and you won't care if she makes another.<br>\r\n   She?  How do you know such a monstrosity is female?  Aw, who cares?  Snarvar is handing you over to this huge hungry mouth like a handful of flowers.  He let's go, and you fall ...right to the ground.<br>\r\n    This terror didn't try to grab you and eat you like a snack?  What?...  Not that you are going to complain, but what is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    A casual comment from one of your teachers comes to mind.  A predator's teeth are designed to kill its favorite food. ... But these huge teeth ... They are way oversized to kill people.  You could cut them in half and they would still be more than big enough. ...  So they are designed to kill something larger than people.... Something as large as .... a dragon?<br>\r\n   Yes!  This thing is not a people killer.  It is a dragon killer.  But why isn't Snarvar running away?  Or at least not acting like a love sick loon aching for a kiss?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But now when you look at the monster, you see something different.  She is surrounded by an image, an image that looks like a ... female dragon?  How do you know that?  Is that bond allowing you to see what Snarvar is seeing?  Or maybe it's just that she can't transmit the picture as clearly to a non-dragon and you can see thru it.  <br>\r\n    It doesn't matter now.  Snarvar is stretching out his fool head for the dragon equivalent of a kiss, and his throat will be cut in a second.  You have got to stop this!  But how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Your ability to hurt something this big has already been shown to be limited, but you have got to try.  A rock?  It will have to do.  Quickly you throw it at her.<br>\r\n   The result are not all you hoped, but at least there is a reaction.  The creature does flinch a little.  Snarvar reacts too, tho not the way you want.  \"Kim!  That's no way to treat the nice lady!  Be nice now!\"<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    Great, he thinks you are supposed to stay still while being eaten alive.  \"That's no lady.  It's a great big mouth of teeth, teeth that can eat a dragon!  And will if you don't get away from it.\"  With that, you fling another rock, which also hits, probably only annoyingly, but at least a hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Maybe a costly achievement.  The monster now focuses on you, and its teeth clash as it springs at you and you frantically try to dodge.<br>\r\n    And are surprised that you succeed.  Then another part of that lecture comes back to you.  A cat can catch a mouse, but a lion can't [usually].  And you are the mouse.  This thing is designed to kill dragons, not bothersome little humans.  Embolded, you scramble to your feet and toss another rock, and a few insults ... and almost get killed when she tries again.  Right, that is \"usually\" the mouse is safe.  If it gets lucky, you will get a tooth all the way thru you.  The fun of this contest vanishes as quickly as it started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    However, it seems this thing must concentrate on its illusion to maintain the disguise.  Snarvar gives gives out a cry of horror, presumably from seeing his lady love turn into a thing out of nightmare, and turns and flees.  She tries to follow, but even by human standards she is slow and soon gives up.  <br>\r\n    You of course don't stay to be sure of that and are quickly following Snarvar's trail, which is thankfully easy.  Before long you are back in the landing clearing approaching a quite shook up Snarvar.</span></div></div>",

Of course, he is probably not fully grown, not to mention you know next to nothing about dragon sizes and growth, and this may well be an impressive specimen among dragons.  Still, Snarvar will likely never make the front four of any dragon football team.<br>\r\n   [Now why are you reminding yourself of that little nerd you knew in high school who made a pile from that bright idea of his, and is now able to buy the entire school team?  That surely has nothing to do with the current situation.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Back to this Katherine.  Can her tomb tell you anything?  That dragon and girl are buried together ... Does that mean they died together?  Easy enough to have happen.  Just about anything that could take out Snarvar can likely take you out by accident.  But a couple of more chilling thoughts.  You are bonded, and you assume Katherine was too.  Does that mean you and Snarvar will share fates?  When he dies, you die?  You recall that's what happened to a pair of Siamese twins.  Of course the doctors say that needn't have happened, but ...  It might be very wise to make sure Snarvar stays healthy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"...mate and friend...\"  Does that mean Katherine and Dracon ...  More important, does that mean you and Snarvar will...  The idea still seems physically quite impossible.  [You quickly stamp on that little voice that suggests finding out just how impossible it is.]  There are plenty of types of entirely satisfactory relationships that might be described this way without being quite that physical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"... of the dragon riders..\"  There could be a word missing before that.  Could she have been something like queen of the dragon riders?  That would make sense of this big tomb.  However you are not even sure there is a space here, much less that there was ever a word.  And if there was, it could have been \"least\", or \"cursed\" as easily as \"best\" or \"inspiration\".  Best not to draw any conclusions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But as you consider, you hear Snarvar cry \"Kim!  Look out!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Turning, you see something besides your torch is lighting the room.  It rapidly changes from a glowing ball to a humanoid figure of uncertain race or sex, but armed with a dangerous looking sword in any case.  Without a sound, it advances and swings at you.<br>\r\n    Dodging quickly, you step back, and off Katherine's coffin.  Snarvar coughs out a spear of fire, which passes thru the ghost without bothering it.  So maybe the thing is harmless?  That is answered by its next swing cutting your torch cleanly in half.  [Later you can wonder how it can be this sharp.  Right now you are angry that it has a real unfair advantage, able to hurt you without being hurt.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You continue to dodge and step back as Snarvar makes more futile attacks and the unearthly thing continues to advance and slice at you, which rapidly forces you off Dracon's coffin as well and onto the floor on the far side of the room from the exit.  So far this thing has been faster than you and your attempts to move around it unsuccessful.  The wall is not far from your back now, which may be why it suddenly speaks in a terribly inhuman voice \"Die!  Despoiler!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    If it talks maybe you can talk it out of killing you.  \"I'm not a despoiler.  I'm a dragon rider, like Katherine.  I just go here by accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   For a second, the thing hesitates.  It seems to have understood you at least, but it has yet to put down that sword.</span></div></div>",

And as a matter of fact, your guess was not that far off at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will fly due west, past the edge of the continent,\" said the ghost, [with a very Jedi-like tone as well] \"To the floating island of Namine', accessible only to the dragons and their riders, and then take the trails at the Firetongue caverns. I shall meet you there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could ask for any more details, the ghost dissappeared into the mist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares about the details!!\" blurted Snarvar, wings unfurling, \"I'd always wanted to go on an adventure!! Just like a game of Dungeons and Dragons!! Can we go Kim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged, at least you couldn't say that you hadn't seen something like that coming. \"Sure,\" you said, shrugging, without really thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar jumped up and down like a little boy who'd just received a toy he'd always wanted. It was a better alternative than slogging around in the wilderness with no purpose, or going back to a vengeful Lord Loy, and besides, you didn't want to attract any sort of bad karma by not following the rules of the fantasy cliche. Also, it might keep his mind off of that picture of Katherine and Dracon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second,\" said Snarvar, catching himself, \"What's Dungeons and Dragons anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind, but that's beside the point!!\" said Snarvar, \"Lets go right away!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think maybe we should get some rest instead,\" you replied, \"It was already pretty dark when we got in, so it has to be very late now...\"</span></div></div>",

A somewhat reluctant Snarvar concedes \"I suppose we won't get too far before we have to camp.  We might as well stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    A hungry and uncomfortable camp you realize.  Lord Loy could at least have sent you off with a little food.  But no such luck.  Well, you can survive a night without, and hunt on the morrow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Kim... do you think it is really impossible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I would think so ... but ...\"  You try to control your thoughts, but the impossible idea will not go away that easily.  Maybe if you were on top and in control and...  No, even if the idea is practical, this is not the time for it.  For one thing,  if you are going to start laying scads of eggs like that picture implies, you at least want a safe place to do it.  Maybe when you get back to the castle.  Yes, Snarvar's room would be a much better place for a romantic tryst than this cold cave.<br>\r\n      There still are all sorts of unthinkable thoughts in your head.  You try to calm them by thinking about having to give birth by laying such huge eggs, but find yourself deciding the eggs are no bigger than a human baby, and you have heard that reptile eggs tend to be leathery and at least a little more flexible.  If they can squeeze a little, you figure you can hack it ok.  Still, thinking about that as difficult, and picturing the large number does tend to dampen your eagerness, [Was that missing word, if one was missing, \"mother\"?] and it seems to leak over to Snarvar as well.  You are in control of yourself, tho not that convinced that is a good thing.  You sigh a bit.  There looks to be a quite good chance Snarvar will be ending your virginity, maybe soon, and you can't say if you are dreading that or hoping, maybe both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    In any case, you have got to divert your thoughts to something else.  \"Say, if there was one mural, there may be another.  Let's look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The next wall does indeed have a mural, tho time has made it hard to see.  After struggling to remove a little dirt without damaging the picture, and looking closely, you are able to see this too shows woman and dragon, thankfully not engaged in ..surprising.. activities.  Instead they are shown flying.  Most interesting to you is that she is in armor.  A few days ago, you would have called it rather scanty, but compared to your present outfit, it is a tent.  You sigh in envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Wow!  That lance looks neat!\" Snarvar interjects.  What lance?  Oh, yes, the woman is holding one, a huge thing really. Figures a boy would look at the weapon first [and, you have to admit to yourself, that you would be looking at the clothing.]  How can she possibly support it?  Oh, there is a support stand that must take most of the weight.<br>\r\n    Looking at the rest of the picture, you notice Katherine is also carrying a huge shield, again way too big to be useful, except that here too there is a support that must allow her to move it at need.  The dragon is also armored.  A very martial figure.  Is that what dragon riders are?  A superior cavalry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Do you suppose that lance is around here?  That would be so cool to have.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"It might be, tho I have read some stories like this.  The hero almost never gets everything at once.  So I'd bet we won't find more than one, if that.  And I'd like that shield, or the armor [You realize you didn't specific which armor, and that Snarvar's safety may be the more important.  That is not how you would have thought of your kidnapper a day ago.]   But we have not checked the other walls.  Maybe they have murals too.\" </span></div></div>",

These were all connected by leather straps that seemed tough and easily adjustable. Unfortunately these straps were also what covered (if that was the right term!) the space between the torso armor and the greaves leaving it a little... breezy on her crotch!

Is it her imagination or has it grown slightly in the last few seconds? That thing is easily 8 inches in diameter and over three feet long! She MUST have it!<br>\r\n\"Please! Snarvar, push, PUSH!\"<br>\r\nHe does.<br>\r\nKim's eyes spread wide as enormous pressure builds down there, squeezing, widening. Inch by inch she opens, his cock head oozing into her body. She's doing it, he's going in!<br>\r\nTwisting her hips she wriggles down further till she feels the faint 'PLOP!' as the head enters completely. How is she doing this? Oh she doesn't care, just as long as she can!<br>\r\n\"Oh Kim! You feel so good!\" Snarvar says as he starts to push, sliding himself deeper into Kim's body.<br>\r\nKim groans as she feels her insides shift, stretch and move around, letting Snarvar slide inside. She looks down and sees the huge bulge slide up her body, her hips spread wide around the intruder. The sensations are incredible, his smooth, persistent motion into her feels like a waterfall of pleasure filling her deeper and deeper! The bulge slides up her belly, under the armor, nudges at her ribs which part and lift, letting him enter deeper, oozing up behind her ribs, then chest. How the armor finds room for her chest AND Snarvar's cock when it was tight before is anyone's guess! Finally she feels the scales of his hips press against her thighs, her body having accepted all of his massive shaft! It looks like she was only just big enough to take him. Any further and he'd have gone up her neck!<br>\r\n\"A... are you OK Kim?\" he says, obviously struggling to stay still inside her.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, yes YES! Thank you Snarvar, that was so smooth, slow and gentle. I know *pant* how hard it must have been to hold back.\" She says, feeling the bulge below her ribs with one hand \"But now you're in all the way don't hold back. Just let go. DO IT!\"<br>\r\nSnarvar takes firm hold of Kim's waist and pulls up, sliding his length out of her, the bulge deflating till only the head remains inside and... THRUST!<br>\r\n\"OOOOOOOOH GEEAAAARD!\" Kim cries, coming instantly as he slams the full length back into her, her chest bouncing inside the armor as his flesh crams in behind her bosom. He slides out once more and slams home again, and again! Kim's mind fogs as a virtual continuous orgasm washes over her.<br>\r\nSnarvar is struggling, trembling, the bond letting him feel all her emotions, but he struggles not to come yet, not to finish. Not yet.<br>\r\nKim's cries echo through the chamber, the loud squelching sounds in the background merely giving emphasis to Snarvar's motions. But soon both partners can wait no longer and Snarvar thrusts one final time.<br>\r\n\"YEEEEEEEAAAAARRRR!\" he yells, fire scorching the ceiling as he clutches Kim tight to his belly, his shaft buried all the way as he comes.<br>\r\n\"Oh *pant* Kim I... *Gasp* I never believed it could be so *pant* good! Kim... Kim?\"<br>\r\nSnarvar looks down and sees Kim has feinted dead away from the sensations.</span></div></div>",

Oh! *giggle* Not that... I mean... er, just hang on a minute.\"<br>\r\nSlowly she just sits there feeling the considerably smaller swell of Snarvar inside her. Looking down she can see the bulge in her groin and belly where it still sits. Is this wrong? It didn't hurt and Snarvar didn't go nuts. He certainly seems careful and loving. Oh this is so confusing. To have... sex, with a dragon? The thought is very odd, both arousing and frightening, though after having felt it that latter is fading. On cue his shaft starts to slowly inflate inside her. Oh right, the bond! He's feeling Kim's arousal.<br>\r\n\"Um, Snarvar. I... Ooooh!\" she moans as once more he fills her, spreading inside, making the armor creak slightly as Kim's body strains against it. \"Um, this feels wonderful and... I think I...\" Kim's mind whirls. Does she really want this? It seems wrong and right at the same time. \"I... do want this again, but can we wait? Please?\"<br>\r\nSnarver's huge face slips down to look you in the eye. The loving and tenderness are written plain across it and even if she couldn't see him the bond starts to flood a sea of caring to her. It looks like that bond is getting stronger.<br>\r\n\"I do feel for you Kim, this is so.. Oh!\" both of you gasp as the armor shifts in the blink of an eye back to a dress. \"Just as I started to... want you. So that's how it changes.\"<br>\r\nMaybe her arousal doesn't do it, even with him feeling her emotions, but when he gets aroused... it changes. That could make life difficult. The dress is tight across her belly where Snarvar is swelling slowly then her chest rises as he oozes behind it once more.<br>\r\n\"Snarvar... Mmmmm, this feels good but can we not... um, do it?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course Kim, whatever you want. But... can I stay inside you for a while? It feels so good.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You couldn't say that you had ever been a big fan of art, yet these murals have piqued your interest. The next wall also has a corresponding mural, this one in a bit better shape than the previous. Unlike the previous two, which depicted woman and dragon, this one depicted two dragons, one male and one female, nuzzling each other as they proudly gazed at their clutch of eggs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe larger male dragon, you recognized as Dracon, which could only mean that female dragon had to be Katherine, except that she was in her 'dragon form'. You weren't all that surprised at the revelation, more intrigued as a matter of fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd considering that the first scene depicted Katherine in her human form, with those same eggs in the background, you could also conclude that she had the ability to switch between forms at will. You also figured it would be easier to lay such a quantity of eggs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted by a ragged panting noise off to the side. There was Snarvar, literally salivating as he gazed at the picture next to the one you were looking at, squatted on his haunches and pressing his crotch against the stone floor. Very much like a kid looking at porn sites on the internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a morbid curiousity, you take a look, and it is indeed a very graphic porn scene. There was Dracon riding Katherine in her dragon form, doggy style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh...yes...\" said Snarvar, reaching for his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snarvar!! Stop that!!\" you chastised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar blinked, and lowered his head, \"Oh...I-I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou supposed it was understandable. Snarvar after all had only seen an illusion of a female dragon once, and now exposed to the most graphic dragon porn imaginable. It would be like taking a 15-year-old to the Playboy mansion, and when you thought of it that way Snarvar was actually taking it quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Kim,\" interrupted Snarvar, \"I'm finding it quite easy to imagine you as a dragon, and you'd probably be an intimidating one also, if you consider how much you already boss me around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was indeed a heady thought. You wondered what it must be like to fly, or to breathe fire, and it did indeed occur to you that it would be much easier to boss Snarvar around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several more murals featuring Dracon and Katherine, depicting more of the every day life, and thankfully, there were no more that depicted erotic scenes. You wondered how it would be like to live like this, and decided it wouldn't be so bad at all, especially if Snarvar became more manly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look Kim!!\" interrupted Snarvar, \"There's a door over there!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to it. The door was constructed of the purest and smoothest ivory, of human proportions and featuring no handle. Curious, you placed your hand upon it and tried to slide it open. Not to your surprise, yet to your disappointment, it didn't open, however, the door's surface shimmering, and script in dragon tongue appeared in large, glowing symbols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had expected the message to read something very cryptic, yet to your surprise it was rather clear and direct to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Whence you return sister, fully-fledged from Namine, this door shall open...\" you read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou removed your hand, and the door returned to its former state. Guess that meant you wouldn't be getting that lance any time soon, and more to the point you were probably stuck wearing a skimpy outfit for the indefinite future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Kim,\" teased Snarvar, dangling his head directly over your body, \"I think you look rather nice with what you have on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes, and pushed his head away. Not that you expected anything different from the pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar backed up and yawn. He sauntered over to the wall and curled himself into a ball. \"Well Kim, I'm going to bed now, care to join me?\" Again, there was that all-too-eager look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably the best thing was to not make a big deal out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think we'll call it a day,\" you replied, walking over to him and snuggling against his warm scales. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Kim,\" said Snarvar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too Snarvar,\" you replied, closing your eyes. Only three days ago, the thought of sleeping against a male dragon with nothing more than panties and a bra would have been the most revolting thing imaginable. Yet now, you almost seemed to take it for granted, which was more alarming than anything else that had happened to you. What would be happening between you and Snarvar in another few days? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought lingered with you as you stretched out and fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

I don't know how much our bond may be affecting my judgement, but I honestly say that though you're a bit weird, and a tad immature, that I do like you, and I care about you. When I talked with Wigana, she told me that you were a nice guy, and I think you've proven her point on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finished, Snarvar lowered his head so that it was level with your face, his eyes watering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Kim.\" said Snarvar, \"I just want you to know that no matter what, I will protect you with what feeble strength I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are taken aback by his confession, yet you know without a doubt that Snarvar meant every word of what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't bear thinking about what I would do if you decided to abandon me, you mean so much to me,\" he murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up and wrap your arms around his neck, placing his head on your lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Snarvar,\" you say with a motherly tone, rubbing his crest, \"I won't abandon you. Everything's going to be all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar relishes your touch, letting out a contented murr that was not unlike that of an oversized cat. It was almost amusing to see him wearing that spaced out expression of bliss. After a few minutes of rubbing and caressing, Snarvar is wearing that goofy smile again.

Indeed Snarvar was still quite immature, yet not quite so much as when you had first met him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyhow Kim, before we set off, would you want to get something to drink? I spotted a river nearby when we were in the air, and it heads in the general direction where we're going anyhow\" said Snarvar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked, had Snarvar just thought about that? Just yesterday he had gotten completely lost, quite a change from the previous day. Regardless, the fact remains that you indeed had had nothing to drink since you left Lord Loy's castle yesterday morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Lets go then.

There is no third test.\u201d The ghost asks in even more confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Usually there are at least three tests in any quest where hero has to pass tests.\u201d You comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar nods his head in agreement, \u201cYeah there are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost sighs in exasperation, \u201cDo I look like some kind of clich\u00e9d phantom to you? If you want three tests go cry to someone else. I\u2019m sure you saw that large fortress on this floating island so go there to meet your fellow dragons and dragon whores\u2026 er\u2026 riders. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me I have to go back to guarding Katherine\u2019s tomb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the ghost fades Snarvar turns to you and grins, \u201cDo you think the three tests thing is a touchy subject for him or something? Anyway let\u2019s go meet the other dragons and their riders!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and follow Snarvar out of the cave. As you walk you can\u2019t help but wonder if you really heard the ghost say dragon whores instead of dragon riders or if it was just your imagination.</span></div></div>",

As you look around you see dragons and dragon riders going about their business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dragon turns toward Snarvar and says, \"Follow me please. The council likes to meet all new arrivals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing after Olibar and his dragon rider Jessica you and Snarvar enter a large doorway into the fortress. As you walk down the corridor you see murals painted on the walls similar to the ones found in Katherine's tomb. The murals are a little too similar in fact. Almost every third mural seems to show a dragon (sometimes more than one) having sex with their rider. All the dragon riders appear to be female as well. You even see a few murals of Katherine in her human form and some in her dragon form. Snarvar chuckles as he sees them but thankfully he doesn't stop for a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would such erotic murals be displayed in such a public place? You're starting to wonder if all the other dragons and their dragon riders are a little... loose with their sexual inhibitions. Is this what the ghost meant when he said \u201cdragon whores\u201d instead of dragon riders?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right now you have a bigger question on your mind. As much as you might regret the answer you turn to Jessica and ask, \"Um... the ghost that gave me the tests said that a dragon rider would die if they mated with their dragon. So why do most of these pictures show dragons having sex with their rider?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry the initiation ritual takes care of that problem. Yours is scheduled for tomorrow night.\" Jessica blushes and giggles and then to your surprise she intimately runs a hand down the side of her blue dragon Olibar. The blue dragon smiles as Jessica whispers sweet promises to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe!\" Snarvar chuckles as he overhears one of those whispered promises then he turns to you with a grin on his face, \"When will you do that to me Kim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I do this to you instead?\" You reply in irritation as you bring your foot down on the clawed toes of his closest foreleg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yowch!\" Snarvar yelps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention back to Jessica and ask, \u201cDoes this initiation ritual also give a dragon rider the ability to transform into a dragon like Katherine in the murals?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes but there are some rules about that. The rules will be explained during the ritual so don\u2019t worry about that for now.\u201d Jessica explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlibar and Jessica lead you and Snarvar to a large doorway and stop outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlibar then says, \u201cThe council is waiting for you inside.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you step into the council chamber both you and Snarvar are surprised by what you see. There is a huge table in the center of the room that curves into a half circle with the open side facing the entrance to the room. On the outside edge of the circle 12 women are sitting in evenly spaced chairs. Each woman is obviously a dragon rider judging by her scanty clothes and the fact that each woman has a dragon sitting on the floor behind her. All the dragons are at least double Snarvar's size. Seems like Snarvar definitely isn't full grown yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most surprising thing however is that each dragon is wearing a large steel muzzle over their snout. Some of the dragons even have a collar around their large neck. A few of those collars even have leashes attached to them that are being held in hands of which ever woman they're sitting behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar whimpers nervously at the sight. You on the other hand are slightly amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman sitting towards the middle of the half circle table stands up, \"Welcome to the dragon fortress. I'm the council chairwoman Diana. What is your name new dragon rider?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Kim.\" You introduce yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Snar...\" Snarver starts to introduce himself but gets interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence!\" Diana the chairwoman interrupts your dragon before turning to you, \"Council law requires all dragons to be silent while inside the council chambers. One more word from him and you will have to muzzle him. Our dragons on the other hand must always be kept muzzled inside the council chambers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar's eyes bulge in fear but he remains silent. He always finds you intimidating when you're angry, but he finds Diana the council woman to be downright terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dragons allow this?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe council woman smiles, \"Because of the nature of a dragon's bond to their dragon rider it is physically impossible for a dragon to intentionally hurt their rider. This makes it very hard for a dragon to resist being muzzled by their rider. The buckles and clasps of the muzzle are design to be impossible for a dragon's paws to open. It can only be removed by human hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would you want to?\" You inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you.\" The chairwoman reaches over to her green dragon and removes his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expect the first words out of the dragon's mouth to be something like: \"I hate that damn muzzle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever you're completely shocked when the dragon looks at his dragon rider and says, \"Can we have sex now please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana ignores her dragon's request and puts the muzzle back on him before returning her attention to you, \"The older a dragon gets the more their sex drive increases. By the time your dragon is 800 years old he'll be constantly asking you for sex as well. Dragons must be silent in the council chambers because their sexual comments are a distraction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a chuckle. You thought that Snarvar's horny mindset was because he's the dragon equivalent of a teenager. But it seems that dragons only get hornier as they get older. Snarvar however is horrified by this news. Sure he likes women but he doesn't want to grow up to be a sex crazed maniac! He's also getting angry at how the dragons of the council women are being treated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you said he would be asking me stuff like that when he's 800 years old. But I won't even live that long.\" You point out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bond with your dragon lets you live as long as your dragon does.\" Diana replies simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you struggle with the idea of living for centuries, Snarvar's anger finally boils over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't right! You can't treat us like animals!\" Snarvar shouts. Diana the council woman turns her gaze to Snarvar and he suddenly feels his anger turn into cold fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid you must now put your dragon in a muzzle until he leaves the council chambers... or for longer if you feel like it.\" Diana smiles at you, \"There is a spare dragon muzzle on the table next to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no Kim please don't put one of those... those THINGS on me!\" Snarvar begs desperately.</span></div></div>",

The two black dragons are at least double the size of Snarvar. He thrashes at them but they easily pin him to the ground. Before you can try to help him you feel something slam into the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Snarvar give out a loud roar before you blackout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you regain consciousness you find yourself collapsed on a cold stone floor. You stand up and fight down a rush of nausea as a splitting pain in the back of your head makes the room spin for a few moments. Then you take stock of your surroundings. You\u2019re in a strangely large dungeon cell that has a big steel door set in one of the walls. Judging by the size of the cell you\u2019d guess it\u2019s meant to hold a large dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you start to wonder where Snarvar is the cell door opens and one of the black dragons shoves Snarvar into the huge cell with you. Once he\u2019s inside the cell door is closed and locked. Snarvar\u2019s thirty foot long body takes up about a quarter of the available space, but it\u2019s clear that this cell could hold a dragon double Snarvar\u2019s size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSnarvar you\u2019re okay!\u201d You try to approach him but to your surprise he moves to keep his back to you and his head out of your view, \u201cSnarvar why won\u2019t you face me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar\u2019s only response is a muffled whimper.

You see that a large dragon muzzle has been firmly place around his snout and head. He tried to hide his head because he didn\u2019t want you to see him this way. It also explains why the normally talkative dragon hasn\u2019t said anything yet, because he can\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad Snarvar just lower your head and I\u2019ll undo the buckles holding it on.\u201d You say reassuringly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise Snarvar shakes his large head and keeps it firmly out of your reach.

You gasp as you see that all the buckles, hinges and clasps on the metal muzzle have been welded closed. Snarvar already knew that you wouldn\u2019t be able to remove the muzzle but hadn\u2019t wanted you to worry about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright Snarvar.

How is Snarvar going to eat with that muzzle on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSnarvar I know that muzzle keeps you from talking, but are you able to open your mouth even a tiny bit with it on?\u201d You ask the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar tests the muzzle and discovers that he can only manage to open his mouth a fraction of an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh-no, you mentally groan. Snarvar can\u2019t open his mouth enough to possibly feed himself. You\u2019ll have to feed him by sliding small pieces of food past his muzzle and through the tiny gap between his lips. The idea is extremely embarrassing to you, but you realize that you don\u2019t have a choice. Snarvar has to keep his strength up in case an opportunity to escape ever presents itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you tell Snarvar this you can feel he\u2019s humiliated at the idea of being hand fed like a pet. You then sense him think, *That\u2019s okay Kim. I\u2019m not hungry.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know he\u2019s lying however as you hear his stomach growl. You sit on the floor next to the pile of food and in a stern voice you simply say, \u201cPut your head on my lap Snarvar\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar winces inside his muzzle at the tone of your voice. Letting out a muffled whimper he reluctantly does as instructed and puts as much of his huge head in your lap as he can fit. You reach towards the pile of food and grab a small piece of meat that you then slide into the small gap between Snarvar\u2019s lips. Then you repeat the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes awhile but you realize that Snarvar is finally full when you hear him think, *You know this is almost like I\u2019m being pampered.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shove his big head off your lap as you roll your eyes in disgust.</span></div></div>",

In fact, the real Snarvar wasn't even in the same concile room as you when you went to see the leaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Note* The folloing is from Snarvar's point of view.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked into the chamber, you saw something strange. You saw several large dragons, many larger than you by several times your size, being servoused by their human riders. However, they were not doing things like helping to polish their scales or something. Insteed, the male dragons either had their reproductive organs down the throat, or up the vagina of their female riders, or up their buts if they were male, and the female dragons had their riders, male or female, either up their vaginas or their own buts, with their heads sticking out, so that they could breath, moaning in pleasure the whole while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, you were getting aroused yourself, but when you looked at Kim, you realized that you couldn't just do that to her. After all, you wanted your first time to be plesurable, not only for you but for her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kim asked, \"What's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused the largest one to look at you and say, \"Why don't you shut your human up, like everyone else does? Then, we can talk without them interupting us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when you looked back at Kim, you could see the fear in her eyes. She was afraid of you, and you didn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at him and said, \"No, I will not do that to Kim. She is my friend, not some sex toy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you knew, you were in a cell, chained up, and forced to watch as three of the larger dragons raped Kim, one with his dick up her vagina, another with his up her but, and the third with his down her throat. You could hear her scream in pain, as they did this to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, they left, but you were still chained up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally worked up the courage to look at your friend, you were shocked, beyond belief, as she was huddled on the stone floor, in obviouse pain and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, no matter what you said, she seemed to curle up even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(From Kim's point of view.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked at your muzzled friend, you couldn't help but feel sad for him. The councilwomen had no right to do what they did. While there may have been times that you wished that Snarvar would shut his mouth, you didn't want something like this. You wanted back the dragon who could chatter up a strorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when the sun set you, (both Kim and Snarvar) went to sleep, wishing that you had never come to the floating island in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose point of view do you contenue as in the morning?</span></div></div>",

You then feel some sort of concoction go down your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll do,\" he said, as you try to cough it up. He then released the chains holding you, and stepped out of the cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Kim, and see that she's still huddled in a ball. \"Kim, it's me,\" you said, as you carefully place a claw on her. She turns her head to look at you, and that's when you feel an urge, a <i>Strong</i> urge, to impale her on your shaft. You start to breathe heavily, as it comes out of its sheath, and Kim's eyes widen in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" you shout, as you rush towards the wall. You thrust your front limbs through the stonework, and have them clap on the other side. \"I won't do it, not even if it kills me! I'll die before I do that to her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you a Kim stand up, and walk towards you. She stopped at your ear, and whispered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n(Kim's Point of view.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awake to the sounds of the door opening, and three black dragons came in. One of them pinned you to the floor. \"Don't interfere,\" he said as the other two grabbed a hold of Snarvar. You could only cream in agony as you watched the two of them proceed to just beat and claw him. By the time the three finally left, Snarvar was a mess, about the only things that were not harmed were his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd they do that to you?\" you ask as you touch his bloody face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I don't know,* he thought, with great effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any thing I can do to help you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*There is,* he thought, as he stood up, carefully. His shaft came out of its slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to have sex with you?\" you ask with a chuckle. \"How'd I figure that out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*It will help me heal.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look into his eyes. They are serious for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you said. \"If it will help you heal, I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then lowered his head and thought something that shocked you to the core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You passed the third Test!\" was what both of you (Snarvar and Kim) had heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the two of you found yourselves back in the council room. Unlike what either of you had seen, both the dragons, and the humans, were sitting together, none being forced to do anything they didn't want to, no muzzles, and no sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry we put you through that,\" said the head woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had to test you, to see what you'd do under a situation that compromised both of you,\" her dragon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Needless you say, you did quite well,\" the woman said. \"Kim, you must realize just how important sex is to a dragon. They are incomplete without it, and could potentially die if they don't have sex at least once a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Snarvar, you yourself need to have restraint when the urge is upon you,\" the dragon said. \"If you force your rider into having sex with you, your relationship becomes nothing more than a perversion of the bond we share.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, the two of you did very good,\" the two of them said together. \"Better than most dragons and their riders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" the two of you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to continue your training,\" the woman said as she and the others stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must follow us to the training rooms,\" said the dragon.</span></div></div>",

As you did, you found yourself looking at plenty of murals, plenty of which depicted sexual scenes, involving dragons having sex with dragons, dragons having sex with humans, and humans having sex with dragons. Also, they seemed to be very open in other sexual matters, males with males, females with females, and the various combinations. Not even the <i>Kama Sutra</i> was this detailed, between oral, vaginal, anal, and more. There were even scenes where two dragons had a human as part of their loving, in the fashion of some sort of condom or between a pair of tongues that were doing something akin to French Kissing. Then there were other things, like humans being inserted up anuses or vaginas, and a few were a human was being swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as you saw one such mural, where you saw a dragon with an obvious human-sized bulge in their stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana looked at you and chuckled. \"More than a few dragons like having their partner in their belly, and more than a few riders like being in their dragon's belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that even possible?\" Snarvar asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the armor that all riders wear,\" Guthar said. \"Renders them impervious to physical harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Almost</i> Impervious,\" said Diana. \"Or are we forgetting about that one tumble we had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuthar chuckled nervously. \"I'd rather not recall that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do I, but she needs to know the limits of the armor,\" said Diana. \"Simply being that if she falls from the height of a mountain while in midair, she'll also break her back, and fracture every bone in her body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did that happen to you?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was a newly-made rider,\" said Diana. \"Me and others of our class were doing some routine training, running and jumping from dragon to dragon as they flew. Problem was, someone wasn't in position, and instead of landing on a dragon's back, I ended up falling through the air, down to the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you still alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The armor- wear it, and almost nothing can kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, you said that you were injured; you don't exactly look it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana chuckled, and patted Guthar. \"It took a lot of sex to heal me back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's how we heal,\" said Guthar. \"As long as a dragon, or their rider, is being sexual pleasured, they will recover from any injuries they may have sustained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I can see how that might work for a dragon, but what about their rider?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Diana opened a door. \"Put it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put on what?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last suit of armor you'll ever wear.\" She then went into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Snarvar, and he looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she just rip off <i>Men in Black</i>?\" he asked, reading your thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\" you then followed after Diana, where you saw a skimpy set of clothes that looked similar to what she had on. \"That's the armor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana chuckled. \"Let me put it to you this way; appearances are deceiving.\" Suddenly, her clothing looked like that of some royal princess. Then it looked like a suit of armor that a knight might wear. \"It's perfect for any occasion, and will offer the same protection no matter what it looks like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Special enchantments. Now, put on your armor, so that we can begin your lessons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you had the outfit on, and Snarvar was seeing you in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look good,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now for the lessons,\" said Guthar. \"First one being How to have Sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Diana. \"And for the lesson, it's imperative that you have sex.....</span></div></div>",

On the outside edge of the circle are 12 dragons sitting on their hind legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surprising thing however is what their dragon riders are doing. Several of them are obviously sucking the shaft of their dragon while several others have the tool of their dragon shoved up their pussy. You even see a female dragon being serviced by her human male dragon rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Snarvar chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dragon with green scales and his cock inside the mouth of his rider calls out to Snarvar, \u201cHello new dragon to Dragon Fortress. My name id Guthar and I\u2019m the council chairman. What my I ask is your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Snarvar.\u201d Your dragon replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself getting angry when Guthar doesn\u2019t even ask who you are.

I\u2019m here too you know!\u201d You shout in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuthar sighs and rolls his eyes, \u201cSnarvar could you make your rider suck your cock already?

And you can feel his desire towards you through the bond you two share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! What if I won't do it?\" you yell<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuthar manages to combine sigh and chuckle \"Then, it seems, that we should show you - what happens to disobedient humans here... Lady Kathe, may you show it to our guest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFemale dragoness, with silver scales, whom you noticed before, grins and nods, while her rider, still servicing her, turns pale. He looks like he is going to protest, but quick flick of Kathe's paw and several hissing words make him silent - it must be a spell of some kind - he opens his mouth, like he is yelling or screaming, but no sound comes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like when they are screaming\" comments dragoness, before picking up her rider and rising him into the air \"And I'm not much fond of human males - they are to small to satisfy me... And while you can place spell upon a female to be stretchy enough for dragon to mate with her, placing enlarging spell onto male would make him unable to walk... Quite a disappointment for female dragons, you know?\" she chuckles and tilts her head up, dropping the wriggling human into her maw. Her maw is large enough to take him up to the waist and then long pink tongue slides from under him, wraping around and she makes deliberately slow gulp that pulls his rider into her throat a bit. The sight in both horrific and enthralling - you can't take your eyes off for the whole process, while dragoness devours her silently screaming rider and the human-shaped bulge travells down her neck and eventually settles in her belly, causing it to bulge a bit, mostly thanks to her extremly slim form for a dragon of her size. For a few second silence falls upon council chambers, interrupted only by lewd wet sounds, produced by female riders, still servicing their dragons, until it's broken by a soft belch of dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the bond?\" it seems that sight of rider being devoured by his dragon is shocking to both you and Snavar, because you ask that question almost in unison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathe grins, rubbing her still slightly squirming belly with her paw \"There is one catch - bond makes rider to be felt by a dragon as external part of himself... While I simply made him internal part of me. A bit of pain is countered by my pleasure... and fear is one of the best spices to add to your food. And with a bit of practice - dragon can bond with any human he wants, not only with sensitive ones\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not mentioning about bonding with several at the same time... What is your record?\" adds Guthar<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five. Three packed in my belly and two others pleasing me... It was a great thing to feel\" replies Kathe with a smile on her muzzle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while dragons continue their talking you...</span></div></div>",

So on the dragon you go and Snarvar takes off and confidently flies away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As you fly, you start to think about things, in particular about Snarvar's comment about you dominating him.   Do you actually want that?<br>\r\n   Well, you certainly don't want him dominating you.  More than one boy ruined his chances with you by trying to push you around.  You certainly want him to respect your rights.  But dominating him?  That sounds a bit extreme.<br>\r\n   If nothing else, if you can dominate Snarvar, odds are good so can any other dragon, and a lot of humans.  You are just guessing, but odds are Snarvar is going to have to go toe to toe with something a whole lot bigger than you are and he had better not back down.  You may not survive if your partner is a wimp.<br>\r\n    Yes, partner does sound a lot better.  This seems to be something that neither of you can succeed at unless you have a strong partner.  Yes, you will have to build Snarvar up, not tear him down...<br>\r\n   ...Of course, if he doesn't want to be built up, you will likely have to build him up anyway.  And he is going to have to treat you with proper respect.  [Just how this differs from you dominating him, you don't ask.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But now you notice it has been quite awhile since you started flying to this \"nearby\" river, and it is still not in sight.  Does this mean... \"Snarvar, we are getting close to the river, aren't we?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Snarvar's response doesn't fill you with confidence.  \"It should be right past that hill.\"  You can almost hear the \"I hope...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You're not lost again, are you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"No, no,  ... not exactly... I ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"How could you possibly get so lost you can't find a river?  The thing's a line.  You can be way off course and still hit it.  How can you miss it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ... you pause to think.  \"You know, that is a good question.  Just how could you miss it?  Was there something confusing us?  Maybe there is something about that tomb...  Maybe anybody who leaves it gets lost...  <br>\r\n    \"Well, we still need a drink and that river could be a long way away now.  Now what? ...  Ah yes.  Head down hill.  If we go to the base of a valley, it will have water.  Water is what formed the valley and we will find a river or a lake coming out of it.\"  [You try to forget that the water that carves out a valley can be seasonal, or can be entirely underground.  After all, those are the exceptions, and with all this forest, there is bound to be a lot of water.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It is not long before the land becomes distinctly flat and you direct Snarvar to a thick area of vegetation, figuring it needs a good deal of water to grow that thick.  Landing and getting off, the two of you head into the plants and are soon rewarded by the sight of water.  Not so rewarding is what else is there... <br>\r\n    \"</span></div></div>",

After three days of not bathing in any way shape or form, what was a little more dirt anyhow?  You snuck close enough so you could see each of their faces clearly, but far enough so that if they somehow discovered you, you could get away.

He whimpered as he clutched his groin, blood seeping between his fingers. By the sheer amount of blood, it wasn't likely the axeman was going to live, or even if he had he wouldn't have wanted to either. The remaining three, trembling with their hands protecting their privates, started to back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let this be a lesson for the rest of you, now get out of my sight before you too lose what is most dear to you!!\" hissed Snarvar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men scurried away as fast as their legs could take them and quickly dissappeared from sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked by the level of measured revenge Snarvar had taken upon the axeman, who had now collapsed upon the ground, bleeding himself to death. Part of you wanted to put him out of his misery, yet considering that he'd just tried to rape you, the axeman got just what he deserved. Yet still, you had never seen anybody die before, and the sight of all that blood and his whimpers of agony make you sick to the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim, are you all right?\" asked Snarvar, placing his body next to you, looking visibly less nauseated. He didn't seem to mind how his claws were dripping with blood and gore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned against his body and trembled, tears coming out of your eyes. He placed a wing over you protectively, and you welcomed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Kim, they're not going to hurt you anymore. I wish I hadn't had to, but I had no choice,\" replied Snarvar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogically, Snarvar had done the only thing he could have done, these men had attacked you and Snarvar had protected you from their ravages, yet still, the fact you had played a hand in killing two men... men who might have had family and friends. When you pictured it in that circumstnace, it made it that much harder to reconsile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we have to get out of here,\" you muttered, \"Before more of them come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Kim.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scooped you up and then crawled toward the west along the river, traveling for about an hour straight, or until you felt sure you were far enough away from the scene of the crime. Once there, you got off Snarvar, rushed to the banks of the river and took a long drink of water. Not only because you were thirsty, which you were, but also to clean away that sense that you had their blood on your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a long look at your reflection. It was hard to believe that it was only a week ago that you'd left home to go on that camping trip, and since then basically, your world had turned upside down. Come to think of it, you hadn't bathed since you'd left home either, as your body was strewn with dried mud, dirt, probably blood too, and other impurities you could only imagine. A bath in the river would be indeed inviting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, of course, there was the problem of a certain pervert with wings whose name you would not mention, and what his, reaction might be if he caught you completely naked. Yet how long could you delay? The trip could take weeks and even though standards of cleanliness were more lax in the Middle Ages, waiting that long could bring about disease, which would be really bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, after much debating, you decide to....</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately he is so hysterical with fear that he doesn't watch where he's going and trips on a vine, falling face ground on the floor.

He doesn't respond, either that he is beyond reason now or thinks that you're lying. However, he has stopped babbling incoherently, though he is still shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um...what should we do with him?\" said Snarvar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clench your fists.

Snarvar has never even seen another dragon.  Lord Loy, or rather his servants, raised him from the egg.  He has dragon instincts, but no actual dragon knowledge.  You turn back to the lad, looking for anything attractive about him, with distinctly limited success.  Of course, you already have Snarvar.  And the jerk had hardly given you reason to view him favorably, so you have to admit to being a tiny bit prejudiced against him, but you still think you would be doing this unknown lady dragon a favor by killing him.<br>\r\n    But you have seen enough blood today, and there is the possibility he and the female dragon are linked in some way so that killing him kills her.  That is very much just wild speculation.  You don't really have any idea, but that is a good reason to be cautious.  However, what is Snarvar thinking of?  Why not just chase him back to his farm and let this possible lady dragon find him on her own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I don't know.

We are not going to walk, and he can't ride you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"He can't?  Well, let's find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Easy enough to test, and if he fails bad enough, maybe Snarvar will drop the idea.  So... \"You!  Strip!  Naked as the day you were born.

Step out of line and you are lunch, literally.\"  However, Amadeus makes no trouble and is quickly strapped into Snarvar's claws.  Then the three of you are off, while Amadeus' kin watch fearfully from a distance and among enough bushes to make unsure how many of them there are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Flying can give a grand view, but it is fairly dull after awhile.  Maybe not as dull as walking, but even so, you find yourself wanting more amusements.  And so your doubts about <br>\r\n Amadeus resurface.  \"Snarvar, are you really sure he is a dragon rider?  And how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"I just know it, not how.  But I do get this feeling I had with you.  It\u2019s like he was trying to grab hold of me, or maybe I\u2019m trying to grab him.  I don\u2019t know.  But it\u2019s there.  Only he doesn\u2019t fit.  He\u2019s just not right for me.  So it only stands to reason that he would fit some dragon somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    That assumes there are other dragons.  It is possible Snarvar is the only one.  Probably not.  Lord Loy seems to be a small time lord, so if he could afford a dragon egg, they shouldn\u2019t be too rare, and the locals were familiar with the idea of dragons, even if they hadn\u2019t seen any except Snarvar.  So there ought to be a number of them around.  Still, the number is likely small.  It seems to you there is a pretty good chance he has no match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cMy Great Grandma used to say she was seduced by a dragon.\u201d  Amadeus interjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWell, nothing like that happened in my family.\u201d Is your response.  At least you don\u2019t know of any such thing.  If Snarvar could get to your home, so could somebody else, and maybe leave a baby or start a family.  But you have absolutely no hint of anything like that which would apply to you.  Oh sure, you did have daydreams of being a princess that was secretly adopted.  [You preferred the versions where the king and queen were fleeing some terrible enemy and had to leave you with loyal servants and really hated that history prof who pointed out any actual case was more likely to be where the king was too cheap to give his daughter a decent dowry.]  But all the kids had such dreams at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cMight not have happened in mine either.\u201d Amadeus answers.  \u201cIt does happen, at least so I\u2019m told.  But if a girl has a baby and doesn\u2019t want to name the father, she\u2019ll often say it was a dragon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cBut we were told dragon-human sex would kill the woman.\u201d Is Snarvar\u2019s objection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As Amadeus tries to argue, from ignorance as profound as your own, that such sex does happen, you notice that this was not what the ghost had said.  It had merely said sex then and there would have been fatal.  The more you have thought about that [&amp; you are definitely not going to tell Snarvar just how much you have been thinking about that], the more you are becoming convinced that if Snarvar just lets you take the lead, you\u2019ll survive just fine.  Of course, you are not ready to do that even if there was not a risk, but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    In any case, the conversation breaks the boredom until it is time to land for the night, happily right next to a deer that was not watching the sky [happily for you if not the deer.]  But there is a serious matter to decide over dinner.  There is a mountain range in front of you.  You are still too far away to be sure of much, but Snarvar may not be able to get over it.  Following this river to the South might be a better bet.

Inside, he saw a large dragon.  She was at least ten feet longer than Snarvar.  She silver scales on her back, and blue on her belly.  Her horns, however, were smaller than Snarvar's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Hi,\" Amadeus said, \"I'm Amadeus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Meia,\" the dragoness replied, \"Do you know why you are here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, to see if we can 'bond'?\" Amadeus asked.

Who or what can be any, but the bond exists, even if only the very lucky will ever find the bond, and when you find your bond, you become greater.  How much and how varies widely.  Often enough, only the very close can notice, but few have become members of the great and wise without finding their bond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But Snarvar was able to tell Amadeus was a dragon rider, not that others had bonds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yes, because the bond was similar enough to be noticed.

The two of us can not spend as much time together as we would like.  But that is our problem, not your's.<br>\r\n    \"Your bond is ultimately spiritual.

Still, you would expect Meia would realize this is faint praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But \"Why, thank you.  I don't get to go far from the monastery, but I bet you are considered a quite handsome fellow.\"  is her response.  Has she no taste?  And Snarvar is worse.  You can feel him thinking foolish male thoughts.  Can't he see he is making a fool of himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But no... The two continue to exchange stupid and annoying remarks, and Snarvar is being entirely too friendly with this ... this slut.  This is intolerable.

They reported that several people had come this way and have not been seen since, but that they had seen nothing.  Since the Lady had no trouble either, there is a reasonable chance whatever it is will not bother two dragons when it would not bother one, which is why we suggest the path to you.

You had best be cautious, but it may not be a real danger to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"And now back to the business at hand\" Father Guinness announces.  \"The dragon is a very sensuous creature, particularly when sex is involved.  It would be an exaggeration to say they will have sex with anything at any time, but that is the way to bet.  The dragons today were behaving, if anything, with restraint by their standards.  You are just going to have to get use to your dragon acting like that, because he will act like that and you can't prevent it.  You can only make the two of you unhappy.<br>\r\n   \"Moreover, you are bonded to the dragon.  You already know emotions flow thru the link.  That link will get stronger, and the dragon's emotions are stronger than your's.  So you will find yourself lusting after a variety of partners as well.  So you had best learn to forgive Snarvar so you can forgive yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I'm going to be acting like a complete slut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"People and dragons both vary widely, and the combination even more so.\" the brother tells you.  \"My experience is limited, but it is wide enough to make no firm predictions.  I believe it is said one dragon rider died quite old and a virgin.  I do know such a case must be close to unique.

She appeared and killed it.  Then she demanded that as a reward, we hatch and raise her egg.  We knew this to be a common scenario.  A dragon does a great favor, but demands an egg be raised as a reward.  The reason is that the egg would not survive otherwise due to the actions of other dragons.  There are many variations to the tale from there, but the egg is rarely refused.  One both owes the dragon and fears it.  But one must hide the egg from other dragons who deem this a crime that endangers their own children.  We were not unusual in our response and Meia is the happy result.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n    \"Snarvar's case is of course less known to me, but I hear of many dragons who sell eggs to humans and other races.

Such, if they survive, become wild animals, who frequently kill people and are killed by people.  There are many heroic tales of their battles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Dragons tolerate these and some other means of cheating.  They have to because their ability to eliminate it is limited.  But they do make efforts to some extent.  The number of dragons needs to be controlled, or they end up killing each other.  Every other dragon is a problem, and a possible solution is killing you.

That should make most dragons at least hesitant about attacking you.  Of course, I can't be at all confident of that.  It might make you a special target.  Still, it should be a little defense, and you may be able to defend yourself well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Now I do have a story that might offer you hope.

Then as now, the dragons were struggling with how to deal with their excess eggs.  Then as now, the problem was very hard to solve.  Katherine proposed that all eggs be placed under the care of the most worthy dragon who would raise just one from each clutch of eggs, assuring all dragons a share and that a child of theirs would be raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"The other dragons and dragon riders were not enthused and it took a long time with much struggle before all would agree.  It was almost as long a struggle to select who would raise these eggs.  Finally they compromised on Katherine.  It is said she was the 2nd choice of each dragon, each wanting the position for themselves first.  The tale is probably a myth, but it may not have been far wrong.  <br>\r\n     \"In any case Katherine was selected, and did an excellent job.  The result was the longest period known of peace among dragons.  It was also the greatest period of dragon glory.  Some, perhaps all, of the greatest dragon achievements happened at this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"However eventually all must die, and eventually Katherine did, tho the stories differ on how.  And with her death, the flaw in her idea came to light.  It could only work if the mother was both trustworthy and trusted.  The stories differ on which her successor lacked.  Enemies claimed she was favoring her own eggs, and that of her favorites.  Friends claimed this was a lie being used as a justification for keeping and raising their own eggs.  In either case, the system rapidly broke down and dragon was soon fighting dragon for the sake of their children, who generally perished in the struggle.  The dragon went from their greatest glory to their lowest within a human generation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"There have been many attempts to re-establish the system over the centuries, with varying success.  None have been as successful as Katherine was.  However what should interest you is that many of these attempts were said to be by dragon riders that had been blessed by Katherine's ghost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"That wasn't much of a blessing I got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"The others may have received no more.  But this means you are in a position of great promise, and danger.  If you tell of visiting Katherine's tomb, many dragons will be expecting you to be the next Katherine, and a great many more will be fearing that.  Your supporters will be wanting you to do some great and risky deeds, and your foes will want to make sure you fail at them.  A year from now, you might rule all dragons, but I fear the odds are high that you will die in the attempt instead.  <br>\r\n    \"You are in danger in any case, but you are in a great deal more if you mention Katherine's tomb.  So you will need to decide if you want to take the risk.  Fortunately there is much time to think it over, but that time may soon come to an end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You start to think of it, but are distracted by the movement of your wings [now when did they grow in?] and instead you start to consider trying a test flight</span></div></div>",

Within her unconscious mind, she was witness to a raging debate since she had enter her shocked state after discovering her tail, signalling her transformation into dragon form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe debate that she was witness to had, for some unknown reason, a direct affect on how her body would change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one side of the debate, represented by micro versions of Snarvar, was the pro-dragon transformation physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever this side gained a upper-hand in the debate, her body would continue with its transformation; scales would form on her body and other appendages would add themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, when it was the opposite side that was winning the debate; depicted creepily by micro Kim's, to representing the anti-dragon transformation physique the opposite would happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes made would go into reverse with scales pulled back into her body and other appendages deformed, creating great discomfort for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim had begun figuring this out after the first day of the debate, now moving into its third day. She was witness to all that was happening outside and within her mind but could do nothing to help it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarvar was looking over her constantly, she knew that and she could sense his thoughts but could not responded to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing subjected to this constant arguing, she wanted to scream and shout at the parties and get them to stop what they were doing to her body but she could not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if she was an extra in a bad soap drama, unable to have any affect on the main scene but subjected to watch non the less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the first day, she had try every which way to gain contact with the warring parties; shouting, whispering, screaming, pleading, talking with hand signals and any other way she could think of but nothing got through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she could do was be witness to the same arguments over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf she were to become a dragon\u201d roared a miniature Snarvar, \u201cshe could grasp a control over Snarvar far greater than any she could as a human\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf she were to become a dragon\u201d retorted a micro Kim \u201call she would be is a vent for Snarvar's lust &amp; then she would truly become his slave\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh\u2026.\u201d signed Kim, \u201cthat's the umpteenth time that's been, God can't they think of something different for this rabble\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf this keeps going on, I sure to go insane\u201d she joked to herself. She knew it couldn't go on till she went insane, it was evident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the to-in and fro-in of the transformation were putting untold strain on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim could feel it in her mind that her body was weakening from this constant state of flux but could do nothing about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing in her unconscious state, she had not been able to eat for for the past three days. The monks had managed to force feed her water on the second day but, try as they might, could not even get her to take even the weakest of soups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownhearted by the constant bickering, Kim prepared herself to sit through another long day. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He feels so grown up suddenly and he feels himself being the type of dragon-man he was meant to be. He reaches out, gently, and with more kindness that he had ever felt before...and lightly, silently runs a claw through her lovely hair. In the process he seems to get her to move in a motion that maneuvers her sleek gown off her shoulders and then Kin moves, in her sleep removing the sheer fabric from her well-endowed breasts.<br>\r\n'Wow....' he thinks to himself, his horniness growing along with the length of his dragon's cock. Snarvar feels his heartbeat rise, and he moves his body back, away from her's as if to give her more room. Plus, he was fighting his inner demons....and losing his control.<br>\r\n'What is going on with me?' he wonders as he watches Kim's youthful, tho very matured body seem to shed its outer protection....the sheer gown now exposing both of her firm orbs to his surprised gaze. Then he made a look down to where her legs were spread eagled...and his jaw dropped....as it seemed Kim was inviting him to mount her...in her sleep...<br>\r\n'No!...No....oh,....Gods......she is so beautiful.....I-I-I......got to have her.......' he groans to himself...while he slowly, silently moves over her, seemingly inviting body. Then he hears her sigh in her sleep....and say one word...and that makes up his mind for him....<br>\r\n\"Snarvar.....mmmmmmm\" she sighs...then she lays her hands on her naked breasts and start to squeeze them as she sleeps....<br>\r\nBy now, Snarvar's cock is a raging, hard member, his pre-cum leaking out of his throbbing cock's head.....he is on his knees...his huge dragon's body.....aching to thrust into her slit, to make her his....to make them one....<br>\r\n'Go very easy....we don't want to hurt her....she is THE ONE!' Snarvar says to his defeated brain....and sighing takes another 100 or so heartbeats to start smearing his fluids all over her groin, her pussy slit.....to better lubricate her for what was soon to come...<br>\r\nAfter making sure Kim was greased up and her creaming sex helped too, he aligned his thick, lengthy dragon's cock,....and with more heartbeats....slowly pressed his head into her tightly feeling slit. At first there was resistance...and his head would not go in her cunny. He tried again...and again, but every time it would not yield.<br>\r\n'Aaaaahhhhh...got to try again....for her sake,...and for mine!' he whimpered and as he pushed lightly this time...his cock's head finally started to enter her sliming, frothing slit. Kim's legs even spread open, wider...and wider, making her swollen vagina stretch before his constant pressing...and then with a soft 'POP!'....as he let go a gasp.....he popped through her virginity...and sent 6-7 inches of his dragons shaft into her tightly-clasping, milking vice of love.<br>\r\n\"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\" moaned out Kim in her sleep... feeling as if her belly was filled by some unmovable object....her eyes rolling into the top of her eye sockets....pure bliss with her soul.<br>\r\nAll the while Snarvar was in seventh heaven....his dragon's cock getting the milking of his young life...and not knowing how he had done this....he thought of when he had seen some horses mate, and he smiled...<br>\r\n'So???...this is what they were doing ?.....ooohhhh.....Kim....I LOVE YOU!' he thought inside his addled brain...as nature did take over control of his movements....He just continued to kneel over Kim lovingly, as she kept on sleeping, dreaming of someone loving her body now....and bringing her to such heights that she had never dreamed were possible. She too moaned out loud as he started to pull his thick cock out of her still milking slit, ,,,,<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\" they both cried out in unison as he then bore back into her creaming sex, as she too pushed up into her dream lover's member.<br>\r\nThe two slowly, deeply, tenderly made love to the other....one asleep, one very much awake,....and never once did Kim awake to know Snarvar was being this gentle...this loving...to the only one he would ever love......Snarvar also never noticed the set of eyes that watched them coupling from the shadows.....<br>\r\n\"He is now mated with the rider....good, good! They make a perfect team,...and the sooner she has been bonded to him...and this act will solidify this, the sooner she will make the dragon into a man. Now I must go and make sure their new room is made ready for them....\"Lord Voy smiled.

One of the men is a tall and lanky with black hair wearing a skintight cotton shirt that has no left sleeve with the right sleeve extending down into a fingerless glove. He's wearing a pair of black jeans (You didn't even know that Jeans existed in a fantasy world) and black boots. Strapped to his hips are two long swords.<br>\r\n      The second man is about the same height as the other man, he is quite muscular and has hair that seems to be both red and black. A look into his eyes betrays some kind of bestial nature. This man is wearing a black cloak and red plate armor that seems to be made of metal, crystal and bone at the same time depending on how the light hits it. He has what you, as an archeologist, know to be a hand-and-a-half sword strapped to his side, as well as a scabbard for another. After a second you realize that there is a small red dragon perched on his shoulder.<br>\r\n      The young boy comes running up to you and looks you over excitedly. He looks no more than five years of age, has bright blonde hair, and sparkling orange eyes. Like the second man he is wearing a black cloak, only his seems more like a robe rather than the man's which looks like a cape. Strapped to his back is a hand-and-a-half sword, as large as the child. He babbles to the man in the same language that the Dragon spoke during your journey. The man shakes his head.<br>\r\n\"Konohoramu si mi zi baleka persvek wux. Gethrisj spical jaka ekess wer cayosin.\" The man says slowly holding out his hand as though to grasp a sword's hilt. The dragon burst into flames and streaked towards the man. as the flames disappeared you note that in the man's hand is a crystaline sword which resembles a toungue of flame, the hilt of which is fashioned into the dragon which brought you here. The man then turns to you.<br>\r\n\"A thousand apologies Kim,\" he says bowing to you, \"Yes I know your name, yes I speak English. I think you deserve an explanation so here it is. Konohoramu is an idiot.\" The young boy chuckled and a gutteral growl came from the sword. \"I sent him into your world in order to try and find a person who carries blood that is sacred to my people in their veins and, unfortunately he brought you.\"<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" you say nervously, \"I guess that I should just be going then...\"<br>\r\n\"It's not that simple,\" the other man said, \"you were brought here without the knowledge of the council, as such you cannot be returned to your world until you have given birth to a child, and unfortunately since you are an outworlder, only a Mage or Dragon would mate with you. Mating with a Mage is tricky because many of them have no interest in having children until they are at least seventy which leaves Dragons and Draconi. Neither Amelf or myself are looking for a mate, so you will have to find someone else.\"<br>\r\n\"True,\" Amelf, you're guessing, replied. \"As Nuada said, you will have to mate with a Dragon. We will take you at least to the nearest Draconic village I'm sure someone will be willing to take you there.\" As the two men walk off the young boy tugs on you.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry miss,\" he smiles sweetly, \"Dragons don't eat people, regardless of what you have heard, now come on, there are plenty of nuts out here who will try to kill you.\"<br>\r\nAfter three days of travel and six days in town you find a male dragon who will take you in he is...</span></div></div>",

Curious, you step closer to this monster of myth and legend to get a better look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is huge and almost fills the cave up, but he is so brilliant to look at that you can't turn away. Creeping closer you reach out to touch him and feel his scales that are warm and kind of silky to your fingers. He shifts in his sleep and you back away from him. Once he settles back down you walk over to him and run your hands over his shoulder and his back and wonder if you dare to climb on his back and admire his wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling something watching you, you turn and realize the object of your curiosity is watching you and reaching out to touch you and stoke your skin as you stroked his scales. For something so large he is gentle and it sends shivers down your back.

Mark?\" You stammer, looking around. You appear to be on a ledge in front of a cave. There's bones all around. \"Is that, like, a normal name for a dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, I guess,\" Mark says. \"My mom just liked the name Mark. It's a human name of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course?\" you echo. Some of the bones are pretty big. You aren't sure what kind of animals were involved, and you're scared to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, since she was a human.\" he answered. \"What'd you expect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... a girl dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" he laughs. \"A dragoness can only make dragoness babies. Male dragons come from women. Human females, I mean. Why do you think I brought you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" you swallow and admit, \"I thought you might be planning to eat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" he nodded, then grinned, huge rows of teeth frightening you half to death. \"Yeah, I should have realized that. Sorry. It's true, humans are very tasty, especially tender young women like you, but they don't have much meat. It's hard to get a full meal that way. I prefer cattle and deer and stuff. But I will eat you if you don't cooperate. That's what happened to Mom. She tried to escape one too many times and Dad finally got sick of it and ate her. He save a leg for me though. She was good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're horrified at the idea. \"You ate your mother? Didn't you love her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! So did Dad. He still misses her. But it's like he always tells me. 'Son, women are sexy and wonderful creatures, and they're the best loving you'll ever have, and there's nothing wrong with loving them right back, but don't ever forget, all they are is meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not just meat!\" you protest, and Mark looks at you quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course you are. What else would a girl be good for other than sex, babies, and meat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're totally at a loss for an answer. You realize that none of the many other things you could do mean anything to a dragon. He puts a claw behind your back and leads-- or pushes--- you into the cave. It has a sandy floor after a few feet, and you realize your captor has made it his home. He fumbles around in the dark, then breathes fire on something and now he's holding an old-fashioned torch in his paw. He puts it into a hole in the wall that's angled to hold it up.  As your eyes adjust to the dim fire light, you turn around, trying to look at your surroundings and then jump a little as you feel claws hooking into your panties and sliding them down your legs. Afraid you'll trip if you don't, you go ahead and step out of them. You shiver as the claws scrape your back slightly as they grab the back of your bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can never do these fastenings,\" he grumbles. \"Unhook it or I'll just break it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfraid to lose what little clothing you have, you quickly reach behind your back and undo the bra strap. You slip it off and drop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe makes you turn all the way around so he can inspect your body. He leans close to you and licks various places as you turn. You realize it isn't wet and slimy, but dry. When he slips his tongue around one of your tits, it feels a lot like the time you took your clothes off for your boyfriend and let him play around. Then you gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" you ask fearfully, pointing at two neat piles of bones. They look human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" he looks and then laughs. \"Oh. The one on the left is Maria. She was my first girl. I mean, I've fucked my dinner a few times, but she was my first try at taking a bride. The first night after we made love she tried to stab me in my sleep and escape. So I told her we would have sex until morning, then I would have her for breakfast. All night she kept begging over and over again that she would be good from now one, but I finally told her, there's plenty of other girls out there, and I'm hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tongue starts probing around lower, then he said. \"The one on the right is Sandy. She was a wonderful bride, actually. She never gave me any problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you ate her?\" you quail. He sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually she was pregnant and doing fine, but then something went wrong and she died. I tried to get the baby out after Sandy's heart stopped, but he died too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly instead of being afraid, you feel sorry for him. He genuinely sounds very sad about his loss. Then you realize...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you ate her anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course!\" he answered, surprised at you. \"Why let good meat go to waste? You humans are crazy, you know. Every time one of you dies, you could enjoy the best meat on the planet, but instead you bury it and let it rot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's back to his careful caressing of you, and it really is making you horny, but as he nuzzles you, he adds, \"So try to remember if you start thinking about misbehaving, that you may look sexy and make me want to fuck you, but at the same time you will also look very, very tasty to me.\" His tongue runs down between your legs and you shudder. He breathes in deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, I smelled right when I spotted you. You're a virgin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly technically, you think to yourself. You've had oral sex, but he's right that you still have your cherry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can smell a girl's cherry?\" you ask, surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's important to us,\" he explains. \"We don't want to bring some girl to our cave and then discover months later that some guy had already made her pregnant. Big waste of time. So we look for virgins. If I had found you weren't one, I would be getting ready to cook dinner right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder at the thought, then swallow as his tongue begins probing again. He begins coaxing you to lay down on the sandy floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You've never felt anything even vaguely like it! You don't know if a man would feel like this, because you're sure no man would be as large as this tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your blood is delicious,\" you hear him say. \"It's always hard to not eat the virgin when you open her.

Soon he has you raising your butt off the sand and rocking on him as he tongue-fucks you. You grab your tits and start groping them hard, trying to relieve the pressure as they swell up in arousal. You've had orgasms before from rubbing yourself, but never one like the one that comes over you now, ripping through your body so intensely that for a long time you can't even breathe because every muscle in your body has gone rigid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou collapse back down to the sand, breathing hard.

The overall effect is creamy colored but it... the lightning doesn't last long enough to see much more, but you do note it is only about ten feet tall, not the huge dimensions you associate with dragons. Maybe this is some sort of mutated person or something? Though how would that explain the wings?<br>\r\n\"Um, can you speak? I just.. HEY!\" it's large clawed hand just gripped you under your left armpit. Then it just...<br>\r\n\"OOOF!\" you grunt as it... TAKES OFF! You gasp as air swooshes by you, your head thrust hard against it's side, blocking your view and almost smothering you. Every beat of it's huge wings surges you upwards, almost knocking the wind from you till it levels out, soaring high above the trees. You manage to wriggle till your face tips back, seeing past it's side to the view behind. Every time the wings beat they block your view, but it's mostly soaring now, barely moving them, and the view... it's incredible! You can see your camp site disappearing behind you you, very rapidly! This thing is really moving fast, and at least with your face pointed backwards the wind isn't in your face stopping you from breathing!<br>\r\n\"Hey, HEY! Stop this, what are you.. *Ungh!* He*Mphl!*\" you manage before it twists you and jams it's arm against your head, yet again smothering you against it's side and blocking your vision.<br>\r\nYou struggle, but it just presses harder with it's arm and you strain to draw breath! Once you calm down it relaxes it's grip and you can breath once more.

Light from a camp fire in this... cave? Well, where ever this is is lit fairly well by the fire and you can see it is fairly clean in here, bare stone walls, seemingly crudely carved to give a smoother finish and stones carved (by claw?) into simple chairs and tables.

You can feel the taught skin stretch around your head, tongue weaving across your face, then over your neck. Somehow that small mouth stretches wide enough to fit your shoulders in,then she lets go with her hands, her mouth now pinning your arms.<br>\r\nAs you try to wriggle free one of her hands snips the strap of your bra with her claws, then the sides of your panties.

It stretches around you, but only just enough for you to fit. Surely this should be too tight for the dragoness? Surely she's going to stop and let you out!

You groan, the sensations getting to you despite the desperate situation. You shouldn't be aroused now, you should be just fighting for your life! But as she swallows further, heaving you inside herself, you feel yourself getting wetter between your legs.<br>\r\nSoon those hands on your rump press it between the dragoness' lips and let go, tipping upwards and gulping, sucking your legs up slowly. You feel your head press into a tight chamber and realise you've reached the stomach... your final resting place? Your efforts to struggle get more intense but don't help at all. Slowly you are forced into that tiny pocket which stretches around you. As her lips glide down your legs, tongue tasting you as you slip in, you feel your body react way too much, almost begging for that tongue to have slipped into your sex while it was still in that mouth!<br>\r\nThe stomach is tight, VERY tight and as more and more of you is heaved inside you can't help but curl into a fetal position, crushed against yourself. She finally tastes your feet, gulps them down and in a few more moments all of you is pressed into this tiny belly. Your bones complain from being crushed too hard against your self, your head pressed between your knees, but you aren't in too much pain, and the throb of sexual need overwhelms it.

The white one's paw clenches on you and pulls you close to it's body. The trio stretches their wings and take flight. They climb high into the the air, so high even the birds looked like specks. Despit all this, you don't scream. Sure, you feel the terror trying to get you your brain, but it's waiting in line behind awe and excitement. You feel the cold biting at your face, but the dragon's body is hot enough to keep your's warm. You pull up your shirt in an attempt to keep your face warm. The aqua colored dragon flies closer and watches you rubbing your cheeks to warm them up. It grunts at the white dragon, and the three fly lower until the air warms up to a tolerable level. The white one looks back at you. \"Err, thanks?, you stammer uncertainly. Can dragon's even understand humans? Apparentley so, since it nodded and turned it's attention forward again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A half hour or so later, they came upon a small cluster of mountains. This seemed to be their destination. They circled down until they came to a large cave 2/3 of the way up. The white dragon set you down and went into a chambe in the back. The other two lay down and watched you. You decide to have a look around. The main cave seemed natural, but the attached caves were obviously carved by something, maybe claws or other rocks. A pile of bones, fur, and antlers lay near the entrance, probably a recent meal of deer. A large room with shallow, bowl-like depression was filled with leaves, animal fur and feathers, and what looked like shed skin. Maybe this was the dragon's bed? The wierdest find should have been the most ordinary, a typical, human bed. What did a dragon need a bed for? At that moment, a low growl emenates behind you. You turn on your heels to face it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The white dragon looks down at you, and despite your complete lack of dragon emotions and body language, you feel like it won't hurt you. It lifts it's paw to reveal a rough wooden box, which it pushes towards you. You open it to find a steel chain necklace.

Nervously, you say,\"Um, thank you for the necklace, er, dragon.\" <i>Your welcome, human</i> a strong yet feminine voice in your mind says. You jump in shock. \"What the hell, who was that?!\" <i>That was me, human </i>the voice says, and the dragon taps it's claws. \"Wait...the dragon,\" you ask, confused. <i>Yes, the dragon, and I would prefer you call me by my name.</i> \"Well, what's you name?\" <i>My name is Mayla, human, and if you would tell me your name so I do not have to keep calling you that?</i> \"My name is Kim\" <i>Kim. rather ordinary, I think, but where am I to judge human names.</i> The dragon chortled in her throat, a rumbling growl. \"Um, Miss Mayla, may I ask why you, well, kidnapped me?\" Mayla stopped laughing and lowered her neck to look you in the eye. <i>Just Mayla, and I kidnapped you because I have several problems. My mate abandoned me recently for another female, and I am nearly ready to lay my eggs. My eggs need to be watched over, and my belly needs to be filled. You can solve at least one of those problems.</i> You gulp. \"Aren't I a bit small for you?\" <i>Yes, but your meat would keep me full for months if I go into a hibernative state. I would prefer to have you as an egg-sitter, than as a meal though, so I will let you choose.</i></span></div></div>",

I can't have them going out to tell their friends there's a dragon in the forest.</u> \"That's kind of harsh, isn't it?\" Now Mayla spoke. <i>Maybe it is, but secrecy is our best defense. You should know, humans respond to the unknown with violence and destruction. We'd be driven to extinction.</i> You nod in reluctant agreement. <u>Well, I'm feeling that pang in my gut. I saw a herd of white-tailed deer near my lake, and I should get them before they move on. Goodbye sister, goodbye Kim</u>. Shura dove backwards out of the cave and twisted into flying position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>Show off</i>, Mayla snorted, a small puff of smoke escaping her nostrils. Mayla turned her attention to Kim. <i>I'm going to teach you about how to care for my eggs.</i> \"Okay then,\" you reply. You follow her to a room attached to what would be her bedroom. In it was a much smaller, but deeper depression, as well as lot's of \"Wood?,\" you ask. <i>Yes, wood. As you probably know, eggs have to be kept warm. Dragon eggs are no exception, but they have to be kept exremely warm. The wood is fuel for fire</i>. \"We have to cook the eggs?,\" Mayla snorted. <i>In a way. the fire will burn over and around the eggs to keep them nice and hot while they incubate. You just need to keep the fire burning while I'm gone.</i> \"That reminds me, I have a question\" <i>Yes?</i> \"Well, why do you need me at all? I'm sure you or your sisters could place wood on the fire as well as I can. Mayla hung her head slightly. <i>Normally, dragons care for there young as a pair. One hunts while the other tends to the eggs, or young when they hatch, and they take turns doing each. But my mate left me.</i> Mayla roared and whipped the cave wall with her tail. <i>He abandoned his family, his mate for 24 years, for some new fling</i>! Mayla pounded the ground, making the cave shake. You fall on the ground and curl into a defensice ball. The shuddering stops. You look up to find Mayla curled up like a cat on the floor. Her body shakes rythmically. You realize with a shock she is crying. You come around to her head and stroke the ridge above her eyes. She looks at you with light grey eyes sparkling with unshed tears. <i>Thank you, Kim. I think I'm going to like having you around.</i></span></div></div>",

There's really nowhere to go except out into the open air. Suddenly, an aqua-colored blur whizzes past the cave entrance, knocking you on your butt from the wind. Shura loops around and lands on the cave edge. <u>Come on, Kim, let's give Mayla some privacy.</u> You prepare to be grabbed by a dragon paw, but instead, Shura extends her neck across the floor. <u>Hop on</u> <b>Shura! Have you no dignity!</b> this voice was harsh, deep, and angry. The red dragon, Taklu, landed beside Shura and growled at her. <b>It's bad enough having a human in a nest, but letting it ride you like a common beast!</b> Shura was calm and stepped between you and Taklu. <u>I have plenty of dignity, Taklu, but I also have plenty of kindness. This girl has been through a lot today, and has a lot to deal with in the coming months. I thought a peaceful ride in the sky would help solidify her trust in us and reward her for her service</u>. Taklu growled with disagreement, but said nothing. She turned to leave, and as she did, you saw trio of long scars along her underside. Each line was as wide as your hand and went along her belly from her front legs to the base of her tail. You gasp when you see them. Taklu left hurridley, and Shura visibly relaxed. <i>Poor thing, so distrustful of everyone and everything</i> \"What happened to her, her scars?\" Mayla shifted to lay down. <i>Her mate kept her against her will. Had her since she was little. He didn't count on how strong she would become, though. One day, when he mounted her, she turned on him. I don't know the details, but it ended with her bloodied and free and him dead.</i> <u>Whatever, we won't let her ruin our day. Come on, Kim, I have some things to show you.</u> You climb onto Shura's neck, thankful she doesn't have spikes like Taklu, and grip the sided of her neck. <u>Hold on tight!</u> Shura leaps into the air, wings folded in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The two of you free fall down the mountain side. The wind rushing over makes it tought to hold on, but you do. Less than a hundred feet from the ground, Shura's wings extend and she swoops up, flappin until she's level with the cave again. <u>Having fun</u>! \"Uh, sort of! Can we not do that, I almost lost my grip!\" <u>Well, I guess.</u> Her disapointment is temporary. <u>Would you like to see my home? </u> \"Sure,I'd love to,\" you agree. Shura turns sharply and begins to dive, much slower this time, towards a bean-shaped lake at the base of the mountains. She hovers above the middle of the lake. <u>Hold your breath.</u> You suck in as much air as possible. She dives into the lake, swimming down towards a faint glow. The glow comes from an underwater cave system, which she enters. Your breath is almost gone when she emerges into a large cave. <u>Welcome to my secret cave.</u> The cavern is oddly beautiful. The light comes from the ceiling, and it's aqua color adds to the peaceful mood. \"Why is the light that color?\"  Shura looks up to the ceiling. <u>A few enchanted quartz crystals. Creates a nice mood, don't you agree</u>. You give her a quizzical look. \"Enchanted? You mean, like, Magic\" <u>Yep. A few dragons can use magic to some degree. I can manipulate certain forms of energy, especially light and elctricity.</u> You gaze at her with awe. \"That's amazing!\" <u>Well, it's really nothing. Just a neat little trick.</u> She turns her head away as she says this. She's obviously flattered at your praise. <u>Well, what should we do now?</u></span></div></div>",

Mayla is great, but she's not really the fun-loving type, and Taklu...well, you've seen her.

Many angry honks and growls were exchanged. <u>Stupid geese, only dragons should fly this high in the air. Anyway, Taklu's mate, if you could call him that, apparentley had that necklace in his possesion, and Taklu took it when she left.</u> You take another look at the pendant. \"Maybe I shouldn't wear this, it is Taklu's.\" <u>Nah, it's fine, besides, I don't think it will fit around her neck.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n  They arrived back at the cave to find Mayla sleeping peacefully. <u>She must be worn out from laying.</u> \"Is it difficult?\" you ask. Shura looks you up and down. <u>For you, it would be like passing rocks the size of your fist through your...what do humans call it...vagina.</u> You make a fist. Small as your hand is, you shudder just thinking about it. \"So, where are her eggs?\" Shura sniffed. <u>In the room she showed you earlier.</u> The two of you head to the room, the nursery, you decide to call it, to find a large fire. And in the fire, stark white against the red and orange of the fire, are five large eggs. <u>Five, a good clutch, not too big, not too small.</u> You admire the egg nearest you. It's shaped a lot like an ostrich egg, and similarly colored, but much larger, as large as a bean bag chair. \"So these are what I'm going to be keepin an eye on?\" <i>That's right, Kim.</i> Mayla had woken up and was standing near her, gazing at her eggs. \"How long do they take to hatch?\", you ask, wanting to find out how long your sentence here will be. <i>It should take about 6 months to hatch and another 18 after that until they can leave the nest. Your in for quite a stay, Kim.</i> Your stunned. Just when your starting to like these dragons, you find out you'll be here for 2 full years! \"WHAT! I have a life to live, I can't be stuck her for two...\", your tirade is interrupted when Mayla picks you up and slams you into the wall, pinning you against it. <i>Don't forget, human, you only live as long as you do as your told.

Your 'bed' was really just a pile of soft animal furs, but it was warm and comfortable. You adjusted your patched clothing and looked yourself in the mirror, a large shard of a mirror Shura had scavenged from a dump over the mountains. You may not have seen a human for 6 months, but you still liked to look nice, if only for your own eyes. Your eyes were bright and alert, your hair, long and a little dirty, but pretty. Your skin, slightly scratched, but otherwise a flawless pale tan. Over the last half a year, constant activity and a reduced, more natural mealplan had stripped the fat from your body and left a layer of toned, sleek muscle in it's place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, yeah, and you were turning into a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was subtle at first, your nails were a little too thick, your eyes unusually bright, your clothes a bit ill-fitting. It soon became obvious what was happening, though. Shura had been testing the necklace and found it's primary enchantment was to transform the wearer into a dragon. It's first effect was on the mind, which was what gave you the ability to understand them. You had worn it so much, though, the weakened magic was working on your whole body. Your nails had thickened and spread to the entire front of your fingers and toes, forming thick claws. Your feet extended backwards until your legs had an extra joint, like a big cat's or, rather, like the other dragon's. Scales, a deep, rich violet, spread from your hands to your elbows, with a ridge along the outside of your arm. Your legs also had scales up to your first joint, and a small, horn-like spur grew from it. You pulled back your hair to see your ears. They were now pointed and tough. Tiny scales, almost like freckles, dotted your cheeks. Your eyes were slitted and purple. You smiled. Your teeth were sharper and my fangs longer. You even felt the ridge of your spine growing denser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled wider. You could have removed the necklace at any time, and stopped this transformation. Something deep in me, though, wouldn't let me. A realization of a fantasy you'd had since you were little. So you'd let myself go down this path and see where it took you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finished looking over yourself, a whoosh and thud told you Mayla was back from hunting. <i>Morning, Kim.</i> \"Morning, Mayla. How was hunting?\" <i>Fair enough. I caught a pair of wolves.</i> \"Your eggs have been active. Do you think they'll hatch soon?\" <i>They may hatch today. I can smell the young inside. They are ready.</i> \"Really!\" I ran into the nursery. Mayla was already there. <i>It's time.</i> She let out a voluminous wave of flame over the eggs. That seemed to be the catalyst. The eggs started wiggling, and before long, a crack appeared in the egg nearest to you. <i>Help them out. You scales will protect you.</i> You didn't hesitate. You griped the edge of the cracked shell and pulled it out. A long, scaly arm shot out and nearly maimed you. The chick worked it's way out of the egg the rest of the way by itself. The other chicks were also hatching, and Mayla was helping them. Soon, a menagerie of four dragon chicks stood, or lay, around you and Mayla. \"What about that one?\" you asked, pointing at the one unhatched egg. <i>I sense nothing. No beat, no movement. That one is lost.</i> She started to roll it to the edge of the cave andit was obvious she intended to toss it out. \"Wait! Don't! You can't just abandon it!\" <i>I can. It is dead.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou newfound, dragon-enhanced strength allowed you to wrest it away from her and you shattered the shell with your claws and fists. A pale green dragon head flopped, lifeless, into your lap. You started to cry and hugged the small head. You'd spent 6 months looking after these eggs alongside Mayla. You felt like a mother losing a child. <i>I know it hurts, Kim. It hurts me, too. I didn't expect this many to survive to hatchday. Let it go</i></span></div></div>",

So innocent, and it didn't even get to see it's first day. \"Please...please wake up, little one.\" As you stroked the dead head, you gelt...something. A huge rush of energy. You felt alert, strong, like you had all the energy of a dragon coursing through your small body. Your claws glowed with pale blue light, and Mayla retreated. <i>What the...where is this magic...</i> The light from your claws receded, only to reappear in the scales of the dead chick. After glowing like a lantern for a few moments, the chick began to stir. \"It's alive!\" You cried. You hugged the chick to your chest. It cooed and licked your face. It's tongue was rough, but it tickled more than hurt. \"He's beautfiul.\" <i>She, acutally. What could have done this...</i> \"I don't really care right now! She's alive!\" The edges of Mayla's lips curled in a rough imitation of a smile. <i>Yes, she's alive. Now, why don't you give her a name?</i> You looked over at Mayla. \"But, she's your daughter.\" <i>Biologically, yes, but look. She likes you much more.</i> The chick was all over you, cuddling up against you like a cat. \"Well, if your okay with it...\" <i>I have 4 others to worry about. Not to sound cruel, it will be relief to have one being cared for by you.</i> The 4 others in question were crowded around Mayla's legs, cooing up at her. <i>Okay, little ones, dinner is served.</i> Mayla's head jerked forward several times, then she regurgitated a mostly whole wolf. The chicks quickly tore into the carcass. The green chick in your lap looked up at you pleadingly. \"Um...Mayla?\" <i>Yes?</i> \"She's hungry, and I don't....or can't...\" Mayla nodded and tore a leg off the wolf and tossed it to my chick. She cooed in thanks and ate. I noticed she was much slower, less ravenous than her kin. You stroked her neck as she ate and eanred a friendly sounding growl from her. \"Hmm, she's a beauty. I'll call you...Keiko.\" Keiko...I like that. What does it mean? \"It's Japanese. It means, if I remember right, adored one.\" Fitting. Still, I wonder how she is even alive. You remembered what Shura had told you on the first day you'd been kidnapped by the dragon sisters. <u>It contains a great deal of knowledge and power relating to dragons. When you don't kow what to do or lack the power to do so, it will help you</u> You palmed the amulet and gripped it. \"I think this amulet gave me the power to save her.\" Mayla looked down at the amulet. <i>Perhaps. In any case, the chicks need to rest. Hatching is strenous ordeal.</i> Mayla called her chicks to her and curled up with them in her \"bed\". However, Keiko stayed with you. \"Okay, Keiko, let's get some shut eye.\" You carried her, finding she was suprisingly light despite being over 4 feet long, and curled up with her on the bed of furs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You had a curious dream. In it, you were walking through a thick forest of tall, tropical trees, strange plants, and swooping vines. There were no animals, but you kept seeing a green blur streak in the shadows. You wandered through the forest, trying to follow the mysterious shape through the undergrowth. But as you followed it, the forest got thivker and thicker until you reached a clearing, where the trees themselves seemed to be closing in around you. Then, the blur started circling the clearing, spiraling in towards you. It slowed until you saw the shape of a dragon. A small dragon. It was Keiko. You smiled and reached out to stroke her head. She responded to your touch and licked your hand. Suddenly, though, she bit you! You instinctively retracted your hand to suck on the wound, but when your finger went into your mouth, you tasted...something. Soft and rubbery. You looked at your hand. A small, weed-like flower was growing out of your finger! You picked it out, but it regrew, and grew, and grew. Vines creeped up your arm and snaked down your torso. Your whole body was being bound in a green cocoon! As the vines engulfed your face, your last sight was of Keiko, looking at you with pleading eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You awoke suddenly in a cold sweat. Keiko stirred next to you, but didn't wake. You pulled on a fur coat made of a few smaller pelts sewn together. It was night, but the moon was full, giving plenty of light to see. You didn't want to sleep, not after that nightmare. <u>Bad dreams, Kim?</u> Shura swooped in and landed next you. \"I had a strange nightmare. I was chasing a strange, green shape through a forest, and when I caught it in a clearing, it was Keiko.\" <u>Keiko?</u> \"Didn't you know? Mayla's eggs hatched!\" Really! That's wonderful! \"Yes, 4 of the eggs hatched, but the last...\" <u>That's a shame</u>. \"But it wasn't! I cracked open the egg and pulled out the dead chick. I held it and begged for it to come back to life, and she did!\" <u>Amazing...</u> \"I know. I think it was the amulet.\" Shura looked over at Keiko. <u>To come back from the dead...that's powerful magic. She is a blessed dragon</u>. \"Yeah,she's a miracle.\" <u>Not just that. I sense powerful magic about her.</u> You looked over at the sleeping chick. She stirred slightly, whimpering. <u>She misses her mother.</u> \"Mayla said I should care for her. Does that mean...\" <u>I think Keiko sees you as her mother. It's a rare thing for a dragon to imprint on any but it's true mother, let alone on a human. You must be a wonderful person, Kim.</u> You smiled and scratched Shura's chin. \"I'm glad you three kidnapped me. This is much more interesting than my old life.\" Shura nuzzled you gently. <u>Well, you've managed to grow on me as well, Kim. I'll be sad to see you go.</u></span></div></div>",

Her transformation had advanced quickly over the past week now that more dragons were around to influence it. By this time, another dragon who did not know better would assume she was born a dragon.

The small meadow floor was filled with soft green grass with some beautiful flowers and even had some trees that were filled with apples, oranges and pairs.

You mean you didn't love her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I did! She was my wife! Well, she was just a slave I took to have sex with for a while before eating her, but after she got used to it she started calling herself my wife. Then she went and got pregnant. Guess I got used to it, and fell in love. But, the thing a Dragon wants to do most to somebody he loves is eat her.  He's a dragon! So I gave her that charm.  She just had to go and take it off. By the time I knew what I was doing I'd already bit her head off, so I just went ahead and enjoyed the rest. She was very tasty, especially those lovely, tender thighs. I took my time on those.

You don't know too much about babies, but you think she must be about three months old. You fall in love on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't sure what to do, but you hope the baby does. You put her up to your breast with her mouth close to your nipple and the next thing you know, she is latched on and sucking greedily, making cute little swallowing noises. It hurts a little at first, but then it feels good to feel the milk flowing through the ducts under your skin and out into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt actually feels a little like sex. You wonder if some women might actually come while nursing, then wonder if maybe it's an aftereffect of the lotion instead. You definitely will come again before this baby is done with her dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to hold your voice steady and not let him hear the returning arousal, you ask, \"Will I have to use that lotion every day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon, who is happily watching his daughter finally get her meal,  laughs. \"My wife enjoyed it so much I let her believe she needed it on a regular basis. But really, you're going to keep giving milk forever, or until I give you the antidote. Or I eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still going to eat me.\" Here you are giving milk to his daughter, and he can talk like that. Well, he is a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned. \"Make me fall in love with you and I'll marry you. Don't, and once my daughter is old enough to do without you, you're Sunday roast. Or, make trouble for me, and you're Sunday roast and then I go find another wet-nurse. That's your choices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, how did you even... I mean what does a dragon and a human do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a big laugh.</span></div></div>",

He's big, almost seven foot tall, and built like a football player. He is also completely naked, so you can see he's big in other ways, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy,\" you say with a slightly worried voice. You'd seen cocks in pictures, but this is your first live one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckles deeply again. \"So what do you suppose a dragon and a human do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hide your face by looking down at the baby sucking on your tit. To your surprise, he kneels down near your legs and pulls them apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\" you beg. \"I'm a virgin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Dragons always smell out virgins.\"  Instead of jumping you like you thought he was about to do, he produces another jar of lotion. This one says 'Young Lady's Lover.\"  It has a picture of a beautiful nude maiden combing her hair. He begins applying the lotion to your feet, then your legs,  your front, your arms, your back. It isn't making you horny right away, but the massage sure is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to do this while I'm feeding your daughter, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she wants to change nipples. You're probably done on that side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou detach the baby and switch her to the other nipple as he watches, smiling still. He speaks after she is hard at work sucking on the new tit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In answer to your question, of course I am \" He pushes you back to lie on the floor and pulls your thighs into his. You feel the rod pressing into your lips, which are wet from the very sensual lotioning he just gave you. Then you feel his fingers pull  them slowly  apart and the tip slipping in. Between that and the titsucking his daughter is giving you,  the feelings are incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" you gasp. \"OH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rod penetrates and pushes through something with a painful surge. Then he  has you with your hips on his thighs, your legs folded so that your feet are near your ass, and your back arching painfully. Taking pity on you, he pulls you up into his arms, cradling you and his daughter together as he makes love to you and she continues her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt truly is a lovemaking. You realize how a slave and future dinner could fall in love with this gentle lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you see?\" you ask as you rock in his lap, feeling the great thing moving inside you. \"A lover, or a meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles and tousles your hair. \"Both, of course. Right now I'm thinking about how wonderful you feel around me, how pretty you are as you move for me, how happy I am to see you feeding my daughter, and how delicious your flesh would be, how lovely your aftertaste would linger on my tongue as I lay down for a nap to digest you. I'm a dragon. I'll always be thinking that, even if you can get me to fall in love with you. Actually, you will look even more delicious then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what to think but you do know that  a whole new feeling is welling up inside you, like a big fountain springing to life. You shudder and work harder to get more of it, humping and hopping as you dance on his pole, finally coming in a great, surprising explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to stop moving and enjoy the feeling, but he isn't quite done. He grabs your hair and pumps against your thighs until he, too, finds the finish, then clutches you to his enormous chest. His daughter protests a little, because she is pretty cramped in the space between you. He smiles and lets you sit back a little to give her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful,\" he declares. \"If I don't end up keeping you, I will truly enjoy the meal. I'll be able to treasure this memory as I dine on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that lotion? A love potion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughs. \"So you think I had help? That was all me, my dear.  This,\" he holds up the jar, \"Is a lotion to preserve your beauty and youth. That way you stay young and tender, even if I keep you a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm not going to get older?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... maybe slower. I don't know. I rarely keep girls around more than a year or two.  My wife was something of any exception, but she was only with me ten years. Really, I just use the stuff because I like how it makes your skin taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a decision to make. Your life as it was is all over, of course. You don't know if its a magic spell he's cast on you, or if you're just being realistic, but you know you won't be getting away from this man. So how will you handle it?</span></div></div>",

There is a large medieval city built around the outside of the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon circles above it a few times before it goes into a dive. You scream in fright as the dragon plummets downwards with you in its claws. Just as you think you're going to crash into the castle the dragon pulls out of the dive.
