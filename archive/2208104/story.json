Nudity, sex, and killing characters is not allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Male characters can be added in, but they are not allowed to gain weight, they can support or give encouragement to there fellow female blobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Please balance the characters between sumo matches, none will be overpowered to the other one, if need to, they will most likely just have to fight with sumo skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Romance can be allowed as long as it doesn't reach a 18+ rating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Keep story chapters at least a good amount of length, and try to use proper grammar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Have fun and be creative.</td>",
