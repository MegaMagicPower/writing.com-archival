            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two years apart had changed the Straw Hat Pirates in many different ways. They were all stronger, their personalities growing along with their ability to fight for their dreams. Separated from each other every one of them had to learn a little about themselves as they trained themselves to get stronger. They became better people in some cases like Ussop gained more courage and Chopper gained more self-confidence. For Luffy however all that grew was his strength, he was still the exact same immature, idiot he was two years ago. Take for example what he was doing right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do Nami and Robin have so much boring stuff?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy tossed a pair of Nami\u2019s panties behind his back as he searched through her things. The crew had gotten back together on Sabaody Archipelago as planned, but before they began to the Fishman Island they stopped at a small island not too far to pick up some supplies for the journey. They had docked the ship behinds some rocks and after a game of straws, Luffy was selected to watch the ship. Left alone, the bored captain was going through everyone\u2019s things like a bored five year old and was now going through the only female crewmember\u2019s belongings. The simple fact that he was invading his friend\u2019s privacy was lost on Luffy as was the entertainment value most men would get out of fondling girl\u2019s underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t Nami or Robin have any cool toys or something, they don\u2019t even have any candy I can eat. I thought girls hid candy,\u201d Luffy pouted as he emptied both girl\u2019s belonging into a big pile. All he saw were clothes and other junk like books and map writing equipment. Luffy saw nothing that interested him and he was ready to leave, maybe go through Sanji\u2019s stuff and see if he had any food stashed away, when he spotted something glittering in the pile of stuff. Luffy reached into the pile and pulled out a glistening amulet with a big red ruby in the middle. His eyes widened at the sight of the treasure. The two things Luffy loved most in life were adventure and food, but as a pirate, he was obligated to be fascinated by treasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the amulet over in his hand, he stared at the strange inscription on the back in those weird words that Robin understood. The amulet probably belonged t her, but it could be Nami, it wasn\u2019t that odd to find the orange haired thief with treasure. Didn\u2019t matter too much to Luffy too much who it belonged to, it was a nice piece of treasure, probably worth a couple million berries. It was kind of surprising that whichever girl owned it hadn\u2019t put it somewhere safer. They probably thought that no one in the crew would go through their things. Luffy was starting to wonder if looking through everything his friends owned was a mistake as he lifted the amulet up over his head to look at with better lighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops,\u201d was all Luffy could say when the amulet slipped from his rubber fingers and dropped to the floor. He wasn\u2019t paying attention or he would have caught it, instead it landed on the floor, shattering like glass as it hit the wooden ground. Staring at the hundred broken pieces, Luffy\u2019s face dropped as he realized how much trouble he was going to be in. If that was Nami she was going to kill him and if it was Robin well\u2026Shudder\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe they won\u2019t notice!\u201d Luffy laughed as he turned away, missing the red mist coming from the broken amulet. He muttered to himself in a vain attempt to believe that the owner of the priceless looking treasure wouldn\u2019t notice it missing as the mist surrounded him. When his body started to shudder, Luffy just put his hand over his stomach thinking it was his stomach rumbling for his next meal. Knowing there was nothing he could do, he tried to leave, not even bothering to hide the evidence. He started walking towards the door, but as he moved he found the door getting bigger and further away. Confused he walked faster, but the door continued to move back and get larger. Luffy ran towards the door as it got huge, looming hundreds of feet over him and a hundred times further away then he started. He had no clue what was happening until he looked around and saw everything else in the room just as big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome! Franky got the Thousand Sunny to grow!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy attributed the sudden increase in the size of everything to the engineering skills of his shipwright. The fact that everything from Nami and Robin\u2019s stuff to the dust mites under their beds were bigger were all ignored by Luffy who believed that Franky had somehow made it possible for the Thousand Sunny to become a hundred times bigger. With his eyes gleaming with excitement, Luffy was already trying to figure out how his crew was going to steer the giant ship when the ground began to shake. Luffy stumbled around as he looked for the cause of the trembling and found his answer as the door to the room swung open and a large boot stomped into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Luffy had to crane his head way back, looking past a pair of breast that stuck out like two mountains. At first, he thought he was seeing a giant, maybe the biggest giant he had ever seen, but he recognized her and his immature mind slowly began to unravel the mystery of why everything was so much bigger. As he was figuring it out, the female was looking at the floor, but her eyes weren\u2019t on Luffy. Instinctively, Luffy flinched at the sound of a loud, angry woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Amulet!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Across it she found much of her belongings in a huge messy pile. She only knew one individual who was capable of doing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luffy!\" Nami screamed as she clenched her fists in anger and slammed her foot on the ground. The vibrations caused Luffy to jolt up into the air briefly before landing back down on the ground with a thud. Although the sound was faint, she heard it. She scanned across the room, searching for the item that made the faint noise. She found the item and smiled in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no mistaking the straw hat, red vest and blue jean shorts. At her feet, as small as can be, was Monkey D. Luffy; Captain of the Straw Hat Pirates. Luffy's and Nami's eyes made contact and there was an awkward silence before Luffy put his arm behind his bed and smiled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hi, Nami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luffy! Do you know the meaning of personal space? God, how many times have I told you don't go through my stuff! You've really done it this time, Luffy Do you know how much that amulet was worth? Well do you?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...five, maybe six thousand berries.\" Luffy joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you joking!? It was worth four hundred million berries!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like me!\" Luffy said while pointing to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...like you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gears turned in Nami's head as she formulated a plan. Luffy could only watch in utter as fear as he awaited Nami to express what idea the recess of her dark mind conjured up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Luffy. Since you broke something of mine that was worth four hundred million berries and you're worth four hundred million berries, I'll take you to as repayment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! That's not fair!\" Luffy protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami growled angrily. Luffy looked at the sheer size of Nami's body. It was huge. It had enough power to kill him a thousand times over without breaking a sweat. He had no choice, but to accept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine.\" Luffy reluctantly pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Luffy. It will only be until you repay your debt to me. Now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No way, you're going in my backpocket to be nice cushion for my cheek.\" Nami said she then moves Luffy to the edge of her pocket. The pocket is so tight that Nami can barely get luffy in.<br>\r\n\"It's way too cramped in here! Don't put me down there!\" Luffy yelled as he was pressed against his navigator's finger and butt cheek, being forced in the pocket.<br>\r\n\"Oh hush, most guys would actually be glad to be so close to my ass.\" Nami then pokes luffy hard and he is finally in her pocket.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"left\">\"Well, my 'captain', what do have in mind to please your new mistress?' Robin asked while walking to a nearby chair, still holding Luffy tight in her hand <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Robin, it was an accident !\" Luffy begged, unaware of the incoming danger \"I'll find you another one !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your excuses are getting me tired slave, but you are gonna help me out with this problem\" She said smiling, while taking off the cushion of the wooden chair. \"You see Luffy, this old cushion is almost useless. It's quite old, and my butt hurts after using it for a few minutes, but our Navigator doesn't want me to spend her precious money in buying new ones. That's when you come handy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't have any money, Nami doesn't let me. She says I'll probably waste it all in meat\" He answered, while trying to find out what Robin wanted, not paying attention to her hand, which threw the cushion away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry little slave, I don't need your money, just your body\" She grinned as she opened her hand, letting Luffy fall onto the chair. He landed with a *thud* , his rubber body saving him for taking any damage from the fall, even thought he still felt pain. A shadow overtaking him, Luffy looked up to see Robin's gigantic buttcheeks slowly descending on him \"Brace yourself slave, the most beautiful ass in the world is coming for you! \" Robin laughed, savoring the moment. Little Luffy had nowhere to run, so he tried to stand his ground. Her soft pants covered cheeks landed on his raised arms, enveloping his hands, but using all his strength he managed to hold her up. Or that's what he thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job Luffy. Now let's see if you can take all my weight\" Robin said, lifting her feet off the ground, letting her fullweight fall on Luffy. The Strawhat's captain didn't last a single second. The moment her feet left the ground, his arms gave up, with her ass squashing Luffy on the chair. He was pinned facing up, getting crushed at both sides by her cheeks, her crack in front of him and his screams silenced by her ass, tickling her and sending ripples across her butt. \"Ouch! Well, that was disappointing    . You wanted to be the Pirate King but you can even hold up a small weight\" She laughed, while grinding her ass a bit to get comfy, smashing her slave even more. \"You know what, I'm kinda okey with you breaking my amulet. You'll be my new one! With some proper training, you'll be a top servant in no time\" She added, while taking a book from the table \"Let's start with something simple: Massage me while I finish reading\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmphhhh\" was all it could be heard under her, every inch of his body getting crushed. He started wriggling, trying to at least get some space to move, her tight pants not even bulging, but at least Robin felt it, and confused it with Luffy obeying her orders \"You are doing good Luffy, maybe if you keep up you can earn a promotion\" she said, thinking about all the possibilities she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy, on the other hand, was in pain from the crushing, screaming for her to stop, but with no success. Sometimes he tried to lift her up, other he tried to crawl out her crack also failing to do so. After 20 minutes of silent reading, occasionally  grinding her ass from side to side, Robin felt an itch on her right buttcheek \"Luffy, I'm gonna lift my ass so you can move a bit to your right so I can get rid of this itch. If you try to escape, I'll swallow you so you can experience my butt on the other side\" Cold shivers ran through his spine. The Devil Fruit let him survive her abuse, but it surely want save him from her stomach's acids. As her ass rose, he almost got blinded by the light, after being almost half an hour surrounded by complete darkness. Still, this relieve was short-lived, because as soon as he rolled to his right a few inches, Robin let her butt fall on him *SLAM* crushing him against the wooden surface. Even thought he was under her before, he was between her cheeks, under her crack, so he was squashed but could at least move a bit (enough to massage his mistress). Being under her buttcheek was even worse. He couldn't move a single muscle, the fabric of her pants pressing him from all sides.\"Mmm, still not enough\" He heard from above. Once again, her ass lifted a few inches, only to drop back down on him with furious force *SLAM*  *SLAM* *SLAM* Her butt pounded on him, repeatedly smashing him into the chair, flattening him even more with each bounce. *SLAM* *SLAM* *SLAM* Laughing above, Robin forgot about her book, focusing on bouncing as hard as she could *SLAM* *SLAM* *SLAM* Luffy was experimenting hell under her, every second feeling eternal, her laughter faintly heard in the distance as her butt kept crushing him mercilessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes of non stopping torture, the archaeologist finally stood up, her captain plastered on her right buttcheek \"Ohhh, little Luffy can't let my ass go? You know what?\" She said as she scrapped him off her butt and brought the small bug in front of her face \"You did quite for being your first task\" She smiled, her next idea already in her mind ...</div></span></div></div>",

While Robin was being playful, he was pretty sure that Nami was gonna be worse, as she could be much more harsh. Robin tight grip eased a bit, as she brought him above the canyon of her cleavage \"For being such a good slave I'm gonna give you a rest. Enjoy\" Robin said as she loosened her bra, so her breast made some space, and dropped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy landed between her enormous breast, sliding until only his head was visible. \"Oh, don't worry 'captain', I'll help you\" she smiled as she pushed him all the way in with her finger. Surrounded by her gigantic chest, Luffy tried to escape to no avail, as all the bouncing from before made Robin sweat a lot, so everytime he tried to climb he ended falling deeper.  Above him, he could see her smiling face through the small crevice that was left. \"Struggling to hold on? It looks like you could fall anytime, but we can fix this\" She reached her bra and tightened it. The giant mountains collided on him, surrounding his body and drenching him even more in her sweat. \"Now we are good to go\" Robin laughed as she exited her room to find Nami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on her room, Nami was holding back her anger to not break anything. Luffy had eaten while checking her new map, and now it was ruined because he grabbed it with his dirty fingers. She was going to scream his name just when she heard someone knocking on the door. \"If it is Luffy I'm gonna beat the shit out of him\" She fumed as she stomped her way to the door, only see a smiling Robin waiting on the other side \"Hello Navigator. Bad moment to come?\" she asked, worried as Nami's face was red from anger. \"Nothing, stupid Luffy doing stuff again. Come in\" Nami invited her \"What do you need?\" she asked. Robin smiled \"Just wanted to check how were you doing. You look like you need a break\" she pointed \"I'll get a break when I get my hands on Luffy. He ruined another of my maps\" she said, anger returning to her face. Between her breast, Robin could feel Luffy squirming nervously, since Nami could be so cruel when she was furious. Robin smirked as she felt him \"Don't be so mad. Come on, give me a hug\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of him, Luffy saw Nami chest coming at full speed, crushing his body further into Robin's breast as her already gigantic mammaries expanded even more, suffocating him and immobilizing him completely. He was almost unconscious when the pressure lowered, allowing him to breathe again \"Feeling any better?\" Robin asked \"Yeah, a bit. But I'm gonna punish Luffy anyways\" she answered \"What if i told you that you already did?\" Robin smiled at the confused look Nami gave her, as she reached between her tits to take Luffy out. The moment she took him out he gasped for breath, filling his lungs after all the squashing. He was frozen, however, when he looked at Nami. She was smiling, but it wasn't a friendly smile, it was a sadistic one, a smile full of revenge desires \"Hello... Luffy\" she said menacingly \"How did you get so small?\" she asked \"He broke my amulet, which had a shrinking powder, so he got shrunk\" she reminded, a scary look on her face. Robin was so distracted playing with him that she forgot why she even started. Now she remembered, and she was starting to get as mad as Nami. \"I guess he still has his rubber powers, or he would have been crushed between us\" Nami concluded. \"Indeed, I already used him as a cushion, and I have to say he was very good at his job. Much more that being a captain\" she laughed \"He is? I'm tempted to try\" Nami said. This was it, Luffy was not willing to be crushed again, it was already painful the first time, so he took drastic measures. He bit Robin finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOUCH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Strawhat landed on the ground on his feet, and looked at the door. It was open! He strechted his arms until he got hold of the door frame, ready to catapult himself out of this mess. He didn't saw the foot appearing below him, nor the shadow over his body \"GOMU GOMU NO ROC...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have time as Nami's foot came down, stomping him to pulp into Robin's foot \"Where do you think you are going?\" She asked devilishly. Robin had used her Hana Hana no Mi powers to make her foot appear on the ground, and had smashed him into Nami's descending sole, effectively crushing him between her feet. \"You think you can bite me and the leave Luffy?\" Robin asked angrily, twisting her foot to further squash him into the ball of Nami's foot \"I think we should punish him for good Robin, to teach him to respect us\" Nami said as she lifted her other foot, letting her fullweight fall on him \"Yes, we must. The question is. What is the proper punishment?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami smirked as she spoke...</span></div></div>",

Robin just smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s a wise choice Miss Navigator. He it\u2019s quite comfy\u201d she pointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami jumped off, and scrapped Luffy off Robin\u2019s foot, pinched his shirt and carried him to the chair in front of her drawing table. She brought Luffy in front of the destroyed map \u201cSee that Luffy? That\u2019s hours of work destroyed in mere seconds. Prepare for your punishment underneath my ass\u201d she sentenced, dropping him into the cushioned chair. Landing with a <i>*thud*</i>, Luffy just had time to flip onto his back before Nami\u2019s ass landed on him, making him sink into the soft surface, which absorbed much of the impact to his relieve. Unfortunately, Robin quickly noticed this and warned her \u201cHe would learn faster if he was on a harder place\u201d Nami got up, grabbed Luffy with one hand, and threw the cushion away with the other \u201cI knew I was doing something wrong, I could barely feel him\u201d she admitted, releasing her grip to let him fall to a familiar spot. She savored the moment this time, lowering her behind slowly, which gave Luffy a couple of seconds enough to prepare himself. With Robin between him and the door, he could only hope to push Nami away to gain some space to maneuver so he could evade Robin\u2019s Devil Fruit power. With no options left, he readied his legs, pumping his blood at incredible speed to enter in his gear form, before Nami\u2019s ass collided with him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGEAR SECOND<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami decided to close the final gap with a butt drop, so she kicked her feet up and let gravity do the rest, but this time the Strawhat captain was ready, as Luffy got hold of both cheeks, with his head barely rubbing her asscrack, but he stood his ground. The problem was that he underestimated Nami\u2019s weight, and while he could bear it, one slight movement of his feet would be enough to make him lose his balance. Nami, now getting a bit annoyed, tried to poke him with her finger, but his elasticity allowed him to dodge her attempts, and his upgraded strength allowed him to resist the pressure when she tried grabbing the chair sides and pulling herself down. Robin on the other side, was enjoying the show, but ... why watch it when she could participate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem to be having some problems\u201d she mockingly said, which only irritated Nami even more \u201cWell, help me! Just swipe his feet so I can pin him\u201d she ordered \u201cBut you would sit on my hand then! Don\u2019t worry, I have a better idea\u201d she said, walking in front of Nami, and leaning to sit on her lap. The red head, understanding her plan, smiled evilly, and wrapped her arms around Robin waist to pull her, accelerating the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Luffy\u2019s credit, he actually lasted longer, because instead of being squashed instantly, he endured the impact quite well thanks to his gear second, but there was nothing he could do against both women\u2019s combined weight, so, slowly, his arms started bending back as his technique's strength began fading away. He pressed his whole upper body against Nami\u2019s ass in a last ditch effort, but finally, he was overwhelmed, and crushed flat underneath her asscheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that\u2019s much better!\u201d Nami laughed as she felt her captains body flatten under her \u201cGeez Luffy, how could you beat Arlong being so weak?\u201d she teased, as both girls burst out laughing even harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy, on the other hand, was experiencing hell. He was disorientated by the pain, and so worn out by the gear second that he couldn\u2019t move at all, not even scream, just lay there, getting flatter each second. The asscheeks were also smothering him, occupying all the space with the pant\u2019s fabric cutting his airflow, so soon he found himself running out of air. But he couldn\u2019t yell at them, he just dazed into sleep, hearing the laughter from his tormentresses above\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, he woke up, but was still pinned, although the weight was much more forgiving. He squirmed by reflex, which prompted the asscheek above to grind him, mashing his already bruised body even more. \u201cFinally awake?\u201d he heard Nami\u2019s voice over him. \u201cMan, you need some proper training\u201d she teased \u201cBut don\u2019t worry captain, your loyal crew is always ready to help you, so Robin and I just thought on the perfect way to start your routine. Right Robin?\u201d she asked as she got up. \u201cSure thing Nami\u201d she continued, peeling Luffy\u2019s mangled body from the Navigator\u2019s ass \u201cWe thought we should start by improving your\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luffy was stunned, both by the sudden light blinding him after being so much time under them, and the pain. \u201cWe were thinking about different ways to make this more amusing so you didn\u2019t get bored\u201d Nami said, winking. \u201cFirst, we thought about stretching you into a necklace to wear\u201d she started, pointing the canyon formed by her colossal breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, I suggested using you as teeth floss, so you could have some of the meat you love so much\u201d Robin continued, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we both want to have fun, so we had to come up with something that involved us three\u201d Nami explained. \u201cYou maybe have noticed we are no longer wearing pants\u201d Luffy at last came back into his senses, and realized they were not lying. Nami was only wearing one skimpy orange thong matching her hair, and her cloud pattern colored bra, while Robin was wearing a black thong in addition to her yellow tank top. \u201cSo Robin had a wonderful idea. We are gonna play tug of war! \u201cshe happily announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy, had a bad feeling about this, mainly because it looked too soft for Nami to be so happy, but Robin\u2019s grip was strong enough to prevent him from doing anything. \u201cTo make it even more exciting, how about if the winner keeps him for the night? It\u2019s almost midnight\u201d Robin suggested \u201cSounds fair to me. Let\u2019s get started !\u201d Nami accepted.<br>\r\nNami grabbed Luffy and carried him around her waist. Luffy gulped, finally understanding why they needed to take their pants off, but before he could protest, Nami rammed him inside her asscrack until only his torso and head were out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou took the best part Robin\u201d she complained, clenching her ass enough to keep Luffy from falling. Luffy tried pushing himself off with no success, and didn\u2019t notice Robin\u2019s ass until it was right in front of him. She used her hands to part her gigantic asscheeks and backed until Luffy\u2019s face was mashed against her thong. He could feel her pulsating anus at the other side of the fabric. \u201cI was the one who had the idea\u201d Robin stated, letting letting her cheeks go. Luffy had spread his arms trying to keep them from crushing him, but it was no use, he was far too weakened, so they effortlessly slammed together. \u201cNow let\u2019s get some distance\u201d Nami commanded. Both girls tensed their asses even more, and took a couple of steps forward. By this point, Luffy\u2019s torso was extended like never before, to the point it already reached it\u2019s limits. \u201cOk, remember, we can\u2019t touch him with our hands. Ready?\u201d Nami asked \u201cReady\u201d Robin answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHREE\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTWO\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cONE\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGO\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth asses suddenly tensed, crushing poor Luffy even more, if possible. For two minutes, both girls pulled him relentlessly, determined to win no matter what. Luffy\u2019s torso was burning, he could barely feel his legs, and it seemed like his arms were going to fuse with his body at any second just by the sheer force of Robin\u2019s assckeeks. Back and forth, the girls used all their might to pull the other, but for another five minutes they were in equal conditions. Luffy\u2019s screams were silenced by one especially strong clench by Robin, who wanted no distractions. But her advantage was starting to show up, as Nami felt Luffy\u2019s legs sliding away bit. \u201cIt must be the sweat\u201d she though, as the physical effort, in addition to Luffy\u2019s already scorching body from the gear second he used before, has made her starting to sweat. She didn\u2019t know, however, that Robin was having the very same problems. She even felt Luffy coughing inside her crack \u201cIf you didn\u2019t scream you wouldn\u2019t swallow sweat you idiot\u201d she berated him, tensing her ass even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking fast, Nami pulled the chair they used before, turned to the side and slammed her ass down, crushing his pelvis under her left asscheek, yanking Robin. The archaeologist maintained her balance, but felt Luffy slipping \u201cThat\u2019s cheating !\u201d she groaned. \u201cI didn\u2019t use my hands\u201d Nami laughed, having the upper hand. She starting bouncing on the chair, to plaster the parts of Luffy\u2019s body (that were out of her crack) on her cheek, pulling Robin even more with each bounce<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResolved to win, Robin decided it was time to put her powers to good use. Inside her crack, Luffy felt his prison release him for a second\u2026 before being crushed back by hundreds of small feet that Robin had replicated on her asscheeks. She wasted no time, and while the majority of feet kept Luffy from being pulled out, she made two hands appear to pull her thong to a side. Before her captain could react, her feet stomped him mercilessly, moving him slowly further inside, until his head was again in front of her asshole, with no fabric in the way this time. With one final stomp to his head, she smashed it inside her puckering asshole. Feeling him inside, Robin\u2019s feet and hands disappeared, just to have her cheeks immediately close behind Luffy, squashing his already beaten and stretched chest, sealing him inside like in a tomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy wanted to pass out. His legs were being chewed by Nami\u2019s asscrack, while her gargantuan asscheek crushed his waist to paste. His stomach didn\u2019t look human anymore, it was thinner than his arms. That is, if his arms were in a normal state, and not crushed into oblivion alongside his upper body by the two monoliths that were Robin\u2019s asscheeks. His head, while in a tight space, could be the luckiest, if it weren\u2019t for the smell and sweat that coated Robin\u2019s asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin clenched her ass so hard even Luffy\u2019s head was pulverized by her butthole, and did a final pull to end the game.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whenever Robin felt Luffy\u2019s head moving out, she just summoned hundreds of feet to stomp him back inside. Combined with the advantage she already had, it just took a couple of minutes for her captain to finally get free from Nami\u2019s weight, retracting with so much speed that his legs slammed into Robin\u2019s buttcheeks. However, this took the archeologist by surprise, with Robin still pulling, so the moment Luffy got out she lost her balance and fell ass first to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Luffy just went from being crushed under one girl to another, now having his lower body plastered between Robin\u2019s ass and the floor. Both girls burst out laughing at his predicament, even Nami, knowing she lost, was enjoying the brutal beating he was taking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems like you won\u201d she admitted, wiping out the tears from her eyes \u201cbut it was close though\u201d Robin just smiled, got up, and finally pulled him out. Gasping, Luffy was about to try saying something before he noticed his hat was missing. Before he could do anything however, he saw Robin\u2019s hand going back into her asscrack, and taking it out. \u201cAre you looking for this Luffy\u201d she asked. But before she could handle it to him, Nami snatched it from her hands \u201cNot so fast. I\u2019m pretty sure you will try to escape again, so I\u2019m taking this as a warranty that you\u2019re not gonna do anything funny. If Robin\u2019s says you tried to escape, skip your training or simply that you aren\u2019t obeying her orders, I\u2019ll crush it into dust. Understood?\u201d she said taking the hat between her index and her thumb. \u201cVery clever, Miss Navigator\u201d Robin said, approving her crewmate conditions. Luffy lowered his head in defeat, as he was willing to take everything they threw at him, but he couldn\u2019t risk losing Shanks\u2019 hat. Robin deposited him on the ground, and gave her first order \u201cFollow me Luffy. The others must be sleeping by now, but you must hide should we encounter anyone\u201d she commanded, putting her pants back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he took a step, Nami STOMPED him flat \u201cRemember Luffy, if Robin complains about your behavior, you are gonna be really sorry\u201d she warned him, grinding him under the ball of her foot. After re inflating himself, he followed Robin out of Nami\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy walked right behind Robin, almost jogging to keep her pace. Before they were able to reach their destination however, they heard footsteps coming, but before Luffy was able to do anything, Robin took a step back, squashing him under her foot<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOi, Robin, have you seen Luffy\u201d Zoro asked from the other side of the corridor. Thinking fast, she answered \u201cLast time I saw him, Nami was having a little talk with him for ruining another of her maps\u201d. Zoro\u2019s face went pale \u201cDamn, that woman can be scary\u201d he thought. \u201cOk, I\u2019m off to sleep. If you see him, tell him we are reaching a new island tomorrow. Good night\u201d he said \u201cGood night, Mr. Swordsman\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Zoro was gone, Robin lifted her foot to see Luffy plastered to her sole. \u201cSorry Luffy, but I don\u2019t want to take any risk, so you are staying there\u201d she said, resuming her way. Step after step, Luffy was squashed under her, his head taking an special beating under her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she reached her room. Scrapping Luffy off her foot, she gave the last command of the day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While Luffy reformed, Robin took off all her clothes but her underwear, and tossed them away \u201cWith this warm climate I\u2019m not gonna wear a pajama, so I believe you will behave and stay with me all night, or your punishment will be severe\u201d she said, picking him off the ground. She laid down on the bed, pushing the Strawhat captain inside her butt, securing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her ass, Luffy groaned, as his clothes where drenched in his companion\u2019s sweat, and her cheeks pressed him on both sides, but he was terrified of what Nami would do if he disobeyed a direct order, so he braced himself for his duty. Suddenly, he had an idea: He could stretch his tongue to cover one cheek with just one lick! This was gonna be easy, and surely Robin would reward him for finishing his job so fast, maybe even convincing Nami to return him his hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning his back against her right cheek, he pushed the left one with his feet to gain some space, and readied himself. Luffy stretched his tongue to the maximum, barely covering half of her buttock, a miscalculation he deemed not important, and with one swift wipe, he licked it. The taste was revolting, if more considering he just had cleaned a surface several times his size with his tongue. However, before he could finish, both walls of flesh tightened, and given his position, he was crushed into a ball. They even grinded him for a while before Robin releaved the pressure \u201cThat\u2019s cheating, Luffy,\u201d she said \u201cThis is supposed to be a training for you, so you better do it right. If you don\u2019t\u2026\u201d she again used her powers to stomp and drag him until his face was pressed above her thong covered asshole \u201cyou\u2019ll stay there for 3 days. Now get to work\u201d she ended, annoyed, letting him go. If he was to wake her during her sleep, he would be sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned, Luffy recovered his shape and resumed his duty, filling his mouth with what felt like gallons and gallons of sweat. But he was trapped, so he kept swallowing for hours until his taste buds were numb, lapping the endless amount of meaty cheeks like his life depended on it. But fortune had abandoned him a long time ago, because when he was almost finished, he felt his surroundings move. Above him, Robin was having nightmares, recalling what happened in Ohara. First it started with a few shakes, lightly squishing him, but time passed and as the dreams became more intense, so did the thrashing. Soon, she started rolling around, and Luffy could only stare as one cheek crashed into another, beating him almost senseless. When she rolled on her back, her cheeks expanded to occupy her captain`s space, squashing him flat, and soon it became impossible to breath as her butt tightened around him, slowly suffocating. Luffy tried to wake her up, squirming pathetically to no avail, or so he thought, as when he was about to pass out, he managed to interrupt her slumber, which made her roll again, this time to her side, her left cheek slamming into him like a meteor. Sadly, all the motion had a side effect. Robin had started sweating again, so all his work was fruitless.Luffy started again, twice as fast, almost drowning in between her glutes, but he wasn`t able to finish before she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin wasn`t in a very good mood when she opened her eyes. She didn\u2019t sleep quite well, and the combination of heat and movement during the night didn\u2019t go unnoticed; she was soaked in sweat. At least her ass was clean, or that\u2019s what she thought until she slid her hand inside her crack\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy saw Robin\u2019s hand entering his prison, brushing her glutes to see if they were clean. He gulped hard when she started searching for him, and with reason, as when she felt him she crushed his head between her fingers, yanking him out and bringing him up to her face. Her neutral expression didn`t hide it, she was angry, he saw it, so before she said anything he tried to explain himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Robin, I finished my job, but you started thrashing around so there was nothing I could do. I tried to squirm to wake you up, but you then rolled over and over until you calmed down, barely one hour ago\u201d he said, waiting for her reaction<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo YOU were the one causing me nightmares!\u201d she accused, tightening her grip. Luffy tried to correct her, but it was impossible for him to say anything without air in his lungs. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in you, captain. Not only you are not taking your training seriously, but you don\u2019t care about your crewmates well-being, bothering me while I sleep, so, I, don\u2019t know, \u2026 could let you out? That\u2019s very selfish\u201d Luffy was in disbelief at how she manipulated the situation, as Robin let him fall on the ground. \u201cOi Robin, awake already?\u201d she heard Zoro calling her from the other side of her door. \u201cYes Mr. Swordsman, I\u2019m getting dressed\u201d she answered, startled, thinking quick in an excuse so Zoro didn\u2019t come in. \u201cWhatever, we arrived already. The island seems deserted, but I\u2019m going with the others to check just in case. Wake Nami up when you are done\u201d he ended, and she heard the sound of his footsteps move away. Focused on Zoro, she didn\u2019t notice Luffy had got up, and acted fast before he could scream for help \u201cZOOOO\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith lightning-fast reflexes, Robin smashed her feet on him. She listened for a moment to see that Zoro was really gone, and after a couple or seconds, she began twisting her foot, grinding Luffy\u2019s flattened body on the floor, slathering him in sweat as she lectured him \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m all sweaty because of your laziness, and instead of amending yourself, you try to escape\u201d she lifted her foot, letting him reform just to grasp his head with her toes, not crushing it, but with enough strength to make him squeal in pain. And the smell. God, her feet stank, and there was nothing Luffy could do against it. She hovered him over her high-heeled Mary Janes., her hands on her hips as she decided what to do \u201cI need a shower, but I can\u2019t trust you, so we will go to Nami\u2019s so she babysits you while I\u2019m in the bath\u201d with that, she let him fall. Landing with a thud, he was instantly overwhelmed by the smell, covering his nose to try to prevent the toxic air to reach his nostril to no avail. Above him, Robin gave him an annoying glare look after seeing his reaction. \u201cI\u2019m running on my heels all day, what did you expect?\u201d she asked, lifting her foot above him. Luffy, seeing his situation, tried to run, only to fall facefirst into the damp sole. Feeling something grabbing on his ankle, he spun around to see that Robin\u2019s arm had flourished from the sole, and her hand was preventing him from escaping. Within miliseconds, more arms appeared, grabbing every part of his body in their reach, effectively anchoring the Strawhat captain. While Robin would be typically shy about smelling bad next to someone, she felt this was necessary to teach him a lesson, so she inserted her foot into her shoe, pinning her captain underneath it with only his head sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his head between her first and second toes, Luffy retched as the smell increased tenfold, the stench being trapped now with no ventilation to refresh the precious air he so much needed. His body flattened as her foot settled in, but the worst was yet to come, as he felt a surprising relief from the crushing weight, realizing it could only mean one thing: Robin was walking. And to his dismay he was right, with the sole covering his body suddenly driving what felt as they weight of a building into his small frame. The fact that Robin didn\u2019t get a bath yet was obvious, with her sweat making its way into the toe section of her Mary Jeans and threatening to drown her tiny prisoner. Luffy gritted his teeth, trying to endure the pain, but every now and then he yelped in pain, just to swallow gallons of sweat and grime.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There at the throne of the arena itself was the famous pirate empress and Shichibukai Boa Hancock with a look of disinterest. But even more curious still was how near her on what looked to be a make shift stone table stood a small figure. The figure was a man who wore black clothes. Specifically a black suit similar to a tuxedo complete with a tie. The man had blonde hair and had a most love struck expression on his face aimed at the pirate empress. His eyes turned into hearts for this man was Sanji of the Straw Hat pirates. Unlike other men Sanji did not care to know why he was small, all that mattered to him was being in the presence of an alluring woman. This in and of itself presented a problem for the female Shichibukai. Men are not allowed on Amazon Lily and all trespassing men are to be executed, that much was simple law of the island. However...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe index finger of Hancock's hand tapped on the arm of her throne. She lifted her finger slightly and swiftly lowered it making a loud clacking sound as her nail collided with the throne's arm all the while the amazons of the island silently waited for Boa's judgment of the miniature trespasser. She repeated this action many times in succession and mixed with the silence of the arena all were able to hear. She would like to painfully punish the shrunken male that stood on the stone table in front of her, but there's one problem. \"<i>This is impossible...!</i>\" thought a tense Hancock. Glaring down at Sanji who has not abandoned his love struck look the pirate empress continued to think in frustration \"<i>This man that stands before me is a complete Yes-Men. Nothing I threatened him with works. No matter how abusive, or painful or what I say I will subject him to, he finds himself enjoying every single possible threat or mode of execution. Violence is out. Turned to stone? He wanted to pose showing how devoted he is to all women and I can't forget that little incident...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************************<br>\r\nSanji stood on the palm of Boa's hand who looked down on him as a lesser being. \"For setting foot on this forbidden island you will suffer and die. And above all you will forgive me doing this to you because--\" \"You're BEAUTIFUL!!!\" interrupted Sanji who yelled unusually loudly from the palm of Boa Hancock's hand. His words were loud enough that they even stunned Hancock herself stopping before she could complete her famous catch phrase. \"<i>He interrupted me and dared to state my line...!? This will not be tolerated. This man must pay the price!</i>\" thought Hancock. But little did she know at the time who she was dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then...\" said Boa as she stood tall and cast a shadow down on Sanji's small frame. \"Nothing I do seems to strike fear into you. Nothing causes you suffering. I threatened to rip off your head!\" said Boa Hancock. \"It would be an honor to bleed for you!\" replied Sanji. \"I threatened to feed you to my sisters in their snake forms!\" \"Nourishment for women is a good thing!\" \"I threatened to step on you!\" \"Anything to cushion you!\" declared Sanji. A drop of sweat dripped down Boa Hancock's brow as the tension was on and with an audience watching to make sure she upholds the law of the island. \"Is there something that you do not like about women!?\" asked Boa in pure irritation. \"I love everything about women!\" said the small-scale cook. This only served to make Boa Hancock groan and fall back on her throne. \"<i>Impossible...just impossible...wait a second!</i>\" thought Boa as she raised a hand to her chin. The gears in the snake princess' head started turning as she looked down at the tiny infatuated cook who soon would no longer be smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji waited on the stone table. He saw Boa talk to one of her sisters by whispering something in her ear. All the while the foolish young man thought that with his chivalry he's won over the pirate empress and maybe even the hearts of every single amazon on the island. Nothing could have prepared him for what came next. One of Boa Hancock's sisters arrived and most unusually she brought a large square block of stone. Once Boa's sister left the scene, Boa herself grasped the block and hovered it over Sanji. Under the shadow of the square stone Sanji thought this was another test of sorts to prove his devotion to women and as a result wasn't bothered. Rather he announced loudly \"Do what you must! I'll accept any punishment from a woman as delightful as you!\" This only served to make Boa Hancock smile slightly. \"I am glad you feel so accommodating about all this...\" said Boa right before delivering the punchline \"...because this stone used to be a man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas all that Sanji managed to say in a horrified tone of voice. For very soon Sanji felt nightmarish pressure on his skull as the stone block's surface began to crack the bones in Sanji's head. Fresh blood leaked from the crack in Sanji's skull dripping down into his eyes coloring his vision red. Not that his eyes would do him any good for within moments the stone continued to press down and finished shattering his cranium scattering even some brain matter mixed with the blood. Sanji's final thoughts consumed by the shock of being in some way suffering by the opposite of the object of his worship. The rest of his body gave way and was thoroughly crushed from the muscles, veins, and bones.  The pirate empress lifted the stone and was pleased to see that all that remained of Sanji was a bloody stain with remnants of his crushed innards. She found the chink in Sanji's armor. If he worshiped women so much, then it goes without saying that its likely he doesn't have a good opinion of his fellow man. His tone of voice during his final word only served to confirm Hancock's suspicion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar of cheering and applause followed as Boa Hancock finished upholding the law of Amazon Lily. The amazons seated around the arena were going wild with joy. The tiny trespasser was no more. Hancock raised her hands to get them to stop. Once they did, Boa only said one word:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone started to exit the arena including the snake princess herself. All that remained there were the crushed remains of the Straw Hat's chef. A fate like this perhaps could have been avoided if Sanji wasn't such a simpleton when it came to women. In the end, this is what he gets for abandoning his dream of finding All Blue and choosing to become an even bigger skirt chaser over time. Rest in peace.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aboard the Thousand Sunny, all was well. A bright and pure sun shone down upon the grand ship, it's occupants, the Strawhat Pirates, all were going about their daily business as they sailed on towards their next destination. One such member known as Tony Tony Chopper, their one and only doctor, was currently reclining in a swivel chair inside the Infirmary, his own mainstay room aboard the ship. The day had been slow, and the usual ruckus going on the upper decks seemed to have died down. Chopper let out a deep sigh, kicking his tiny hooves in the air as he spun in the chair. He was of a diminished stature, being the smallest member, but that didn't keep him from being just as able as any of the others. His soft brown fur rustled with his movement as he stopped the chair to gaze at a set of chemicals that sat opposite of him on another table. He had recently purchased it after Nami finally lent him some of her own coin, which had taken much begging and prying for the gold. He personally knew nothing about the sterile materials, as he had never encountered such supplies in his studies. Getting up out of the chair, he toddled over to the chemicals and picked up a beaker, the neon-green liquid inside smelling stark, forcing him to shove it away from his face and wrinkle his blue nose.\"This stuff reeks...\"He said to himself, but still, he felt compelled to take another light whiff of the fluid. This time, it smelled a tad better.\"Hmm....\"The doctor shrugged and once again, smelled the chemical. This time, even better than before. He giggled as he began to enter a state of light-headedness, breathing in the stench deeper and deeper. Soon, he was practically dizzy, swirling around on his feet and nigh toppling over, his laughter giddy and high pitched. Imminently, he fell on his back, the flask sent high into the air, only to land and shatter on Chopper's face, spraying the chemical onto his body and into his mouth. At first, he was alarmed, but the high of before had overtaken him, and he happily slurped the green off his fur.\"Tastes kind of like...cotton candy....\"He mumbled before passing out, the world around him dissapearing into a duet of bleak darkness and pounding sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke, a world of plum-color greeted him.\"Gaah?! Where am I?\"He shouted, struggling to move, as it seems the new world liked to cling to him. After climbing out through a hole of light he spotted overhead, the reindeer breathed a sigh of relief. Gathering his senses, he collected what he knew of where he was now.\" The ship had dissapeared, so had his crewmates, the ocean had been replaced by a sea of fabric fibers, and he was naked. It didn't bother him since he was an animal, but the rest of the news of the situation bothered him.\"This is....weird.\"He stated the obvious, looking around for at least a landmark or something to help him. Of the landscape, only a few blurry images in the distance made sense. There were walls, sheer walls that escalated higher than the clouds, which oddly looked like grainy pigments of dust. Next to one of these walls, a mountain the same color of the fabric, looked like a hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith none of this information helping, Chopper sighed and entered his full reindeer form, an attribute granted to him by his devil fruit. He entered into a sprint, dashing across the landscape as fast as he could in hope of finding a place of refuge, or civilization, or something to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere must have been giants living in the land, because after thirty minutes of running, earthquakes could be felt and booms could be heard, but in a rhythmic pattern, signaling that a large being was nearby.\"I hope they're friendly giants....\"Chopper said to himself, worried about his last encounter with a giant, Oars. He recieved his answer only moments later, as a towering figure drew near, retaining a femine form, the shadowy outline fully filled into an extreme hourglass shape.\"Chopper? You in here?\"The giantess called out a thunderous tone. It knew his name? The reindeer didn't recall if he had ever met a female giant before. The giantess came closer and closer, her feet large enough to crush the Thousand Sunny easily. She stopped right before him, bending down and looking curious. She was still too big for him to take in all the details and get an accurate view of what she looked like.\"What's his clothes doing here lying on the floor?\"She said, picking up the mountain, revealing that it was a hat, his hat.\"I...was never that big!\"Chopper stopped and reverted back to his human-deer form, his tiny stature gazing up in awe. With logic coming together, he finally realized what had happened, the chemical had shrunken him! And to an incredibly tiny size at that. But, who was this giantess towering so high above him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err....hello?\"Chopper called up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"The giantess knelt down and peered even closer, her moon-like eyes looking down at the shorts curiously.\"There's a tiny ant in these pants...but you couldn't possibly have spoken....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did! It's me, Chopper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shrunk myself with uh....a chemical...on accident.\"He answered, rubbing the back of his neck in shame. Returning his eyes back to look at the giantess, he finally realized who it was.</span></div></div>",

Robin then walked over to the table where Chopper did all of his research, and sat down. Chopper explained what he thought might be able to reverse the effects, and Robin got to work, already knowing a little about medical techniques and ingredients from some of the books she had read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour had passed, and Chopper started feeling very bored, as there wasn't much to do in Robins shirt pocket. \"Robin?\" He shouted up at her. \"Could you set me on the table so I can see whats going on?\" \"Are you sure that's a good idea, since you're so small?\" \"Don't worry, I'll be careful.\" Robin smiled and set him on the table, then got back to work, becoming very absorbed almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChopper started observing the equipment around the table. \"Wow, everything looks so strange from down here.\" He then walked over to the edge of the table, in front of Robin, and looks over the edge. And as he was doing so, Robin, still absorbed in her work, got up to get some ingredients on the other side of the room. When she did this, it knocked Chopper off balance, and he fell off of the table. As he was falling, the turned back into his reindeer form, as they had stronger legs. Chopper landed heavily, but still unharmed, on the chair. He turned back into his normal self, and fell over from shock and surprise. \"I thought that was it for me.\" Then he heard footsteps to his right, and when he looked up, he saw Robin walking back to the table. \"Oh good, Robin can help me get back up.\" But when she got close, she didn't slow down to pick him up from the chair, instead, she started to sit down. \"AHHHHHH! ROBIN! I'M ON THE CHAIR!\" But she didn't hear him, as she was to focused on making a cure. For him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChopper looked upward as Robin bent over to sit down, her skirt going up a enough to see the white panties underneath. \"I can still get away if I start running now\" Chopper said to himself as he started to sprint to the side of the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he get away in time?  </span></div></div>",

Robin was continuing her work on the cure had realized something was off, where was Chopper? She stood up to check the room. Once she stood up, Chopper took deep breaths. Chopper had never appreciated fresh air that much until this moment. After regathering his strength, Chopper stood up and saw Robin walking around the room. Chopper decided to stay in Heavy Point so Robin had a better chance of seeing him.

She started to pull, the smell was very strong, poor Nami nearly vomited with the first sock, and with the second, she had less strength. It was the time to massage...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not paying any mind to what she grabbed, Nami reached for the smallest statue, barely even noticeable it was so small. It had to be less than an inch in height and was clearly worthless to the Navigator's sharp eye. Sure it was hand-carved, but there were no gems, no shine to it. The wood wasn't even all that great and it had the kind of design you could find in any market. A carving of a woman praying, <i>real </i>rare, if the buyer was a complete idiot. She sighed as it became clear she had gone to such lengths for nothing. The events of the entire day seemed to play back to show how this moment came to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was any other day for the Straw Hat pirates on their ship. Luffy was laughing and playing with Chopper and Usopp. Zoro was asleep in his room. Brooke was in his room playing some soft music as Franky worked on whatever invention he was at the time. While Nami sat in a bikini tanning with Robin, also in a bikini, who was entranced in her book. The ship's chef Sanji was busy making all sorts of delicacies in record time to try and woo the two women, but they barely paid him more than a word of thanks with each gift; neither interested in the man, but more than happy to take his gifts. A typical day, then the crew landed on the next island on their charts and the routine continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrouble Island, an island known for (Go figure) causing Trouble. Though despite the name it appeared nice enough. What greeted the Straw Hats was a nice, large, clean white dock full of a number of ships. Each one a pirate vessel. The city that lay beyond a small grass field was full of pirates. Now it made sense where the island got its name. The Straw Hats docked at a free spot on the docks and began to get off the ship. Upon landing Robin quickly explained the basic formation of the island. The city itself was full of pirates and lawlessness, but rumors say that the Marines often operated in secret here. It was a prime information gathering place. In short, both Pirates and Marines were on this island. That was all that concerned the Straw Hats about this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways eager for an adventure, Luffy dragged a few members of the crew to try and find something fun to do. After being forced to swear not to do anything stupid, Luffy led them out onto the island. After donning a short-sleeve dark blue shirt and a pair of light blue short shorts, Nami initially left the ship with them to try and use them for shopping purposes, but a large ship on the other end of the dock caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a pirate town it was surely a pirate ship, but there were no sales to identify it. In fact, other than its sheer size, the ship had no noticeable features at all. It was just a plain old wooden ship, just very large. Nami instantly liked what she was seeing with it. A ship that size had to hold an enormous crew, and the bigger the crew, the bigger the riches. The cheap-looking ship was probably something of a cover. The kind of cunning Nami had come to expect from pirates on the Grand Line. After playing a bit of a stealthy thief, meaning Nami walked onto the ship ready to bash someone in the head with her Clima-tact, the Navigator saw the ship was empty, save for one treasure chest. No doubt loaded with the rarest and most valuable of jewels and gems imaginable. Without missing a beat, Nami quickly began to drag the chest off of the ship. This was normally the kind of thing she'd get Sanji or Zoro to do; but\u2026it was oddly light. She should have figured out what was wrong then. But no, the Navigator kept on dreaming of riches until she got off of the ship. There was still plenty of space left to drag the chest, but she couldn't resist taking a peek; so she opened it and, of course, inside were the three worthless wooden statues. One was about a foot tall, another was about half that, and the last one took a few minutes to notice it was so small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointment didn't even begin to describe how Nami felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost ready to cry the Navigator opened her eyes to end the nightmare that led up to such disappointment. All she had were a few worthless, hand-made\u2026Huh? Nami looked to her hand to see the small statue missing. <i>Damn, did I drop it? God I'm starting to act like Luffy!</i> Quickly the pirate knelt over to examine the ground for this lost statue, slowly getting frantic in her search for it. Moments later it clicked how foolish this was. <i>Wait, why am I looking for that piece of junk? She laughed, Let the poor punks who own this ship look all over for it. </i>Still, the red-head was stricken by a mild curiousity, Nami wanted to look back into the chest at the other statues. She stood back up to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd realized she'd completely missed what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Nami thought she had wandered around absentmindedly while thinking but no, the chest was still there in front of her. There was just one problem. She couldn't reach into the chest; because she was <i>smaller </i>than the chest. Indeed, currently the treasure chest rose above the red-headed beauty like a mountain. Hell the grass was bigger than her! Awe left even the intelligent Nami dumbstruck for a moment. How did this happen? It was obvious that she shrunk\u2026but when? When she was daydreaming over the day? That was the only possible time, but even though her eyes were closed\u2026She didn't hear anything. She didn't feel anything. Her clothes still fit nicely. So she shrunk without feeling even the slightest thing? Well odder things happened on the Grand Line she supposed. But that still left the question of How. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo possible answers came to mind. A Devil Fruit or the Statues. But Nami never heard of any shrinking Devil Fruits; then again she also didn't believe in them until she met Luffy. If it wasn't that it had to be the statue she picked up, which would explain why it was missing\u2026But there was no way it could've done that. The things were worthless! And Nami was never wrong about treasure, nope, never\u2026Okay maybe there was a slight chance\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no time to be casting blame! I gotta get someone to help me before I get stepped on!\" Nami screamed as her hands started to tug at her notable hair. Of course, easier said than done. There was no real way of telling how small Nami was, but if the grass was taller than her\u2026she had to be under an inch at the very least. Maybe half of one. And she was by no means fast\u2026or strong\u2026or resourceful in wild environments. And the Thousand Sunny was a good half a mile away on the other side of the docks. The crowded docks full of giant people who could crush her like a bug. Not even getting into the fact that half a mile to Nami had to be\u2026over a hundred times that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So\u2026walk and more than likely get crushed\u2026Or stay here and probably get eaten by a bug before the day is over\u2026Where's Luffy when you need him? Heck, where's <b>SOMEBODY </b>who can help me when I need it?! </i>Nami thought to herself, getting more and more frustrated with each passing moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was ironic though, because right at that time\u2026Someone had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught entirely off guard, Nami fell flat on her face as the entire ground seemed to quake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>BOOM!!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother quake, this one louder and stronger. Though this time Nami managed to avoid falling again and had started to rise. Weakly she got back on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>BOOOOOOOM!!!!!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even two feet away, the gigantic foot wear of some giant-sized (normal-sized) person landed right before Nami, creating a quake strong enough to knock the poor girl flat on the ground again; as well as throw a nice hurricane of dust into her eyes, blinding her and ruining her outfit. Whoever this giant was, they spoke with a voice that was clearly feminine, even with the amplified sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"What's this chest doing out here?\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly dizzy from just how loud this voice was, Nami looked up to try and identify the person who could help her. The sun seemed to hide behind their head, creating an outline and shading her face from view. This didn't help the fact that Nami could hardly see. But in no time at all any blur that Nami saw vanished as the woman's features cleared. Imagine her surprise when Nami realized she <i>knew</i> this woman! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami looked up to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cautiously taking steps forward, Robin approached the treasure chest before the boat. This was definitely what she was looking for. A shoddy old ship with a \"Cursed\" treasure chest, exactly as she had heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even 30 minutes ago she was exploring the town, but before walking into the town the beauty changed into the outfit she wore in Skypiea, a sleeveless yellow shirt that exposed a nice bit of cleavage, a pair of purple pants that reached to her calves, a pair of purple high-heeled sandals, and what was something of a trademark for her, a white cowboy hat. All dressed and ready to go, Robin headed into town for a few minutes to gather information. Some of the information was useful, a lot of it wasn't. But there was one rumor that she kept hearing, and it piqued her interest. Something of a talk amongst the townspeople, there was a ship that was docked at shore. No one knew who the Captain was, or where they were, but after enough time the predictable happened. The ship was on a pirate island, pirates raided it. That's where the story grew bizarre, as no one saw any of those pirates again. Many rumors started, but people were still stupid enough to keep heading to the ship. It was through these various excursions everything was worked out. The ship itself was fine; the treasure however\u2026Was not. Supposedly, inside were three statues, and anyone who touches a statue vanishes never to be seen again. No one knew how or why, but people began referring to the statues as cursed relics and warned anyone who came not to go near them. Anything relic-related instantly drew Robin's attention, so she kept asking about it. The story changed very little, but she did hear a couple of versions where people said that those who touched the statues didn't vanish, instead they were shrunken. Robin noted it but didn't take this alternated version seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow here she was, in front of the chest described to her. Though, she wasn't told it was in front of the ship, or open for that matter. It shouldn't have been open, no one other than Robin would've been foolish enough to go near the chest\u2026Well, save for her crew. But they wouldn't pay any mind to such a cruddy ship. The only reason Robin was even there was curiosity and the idea these artifacts may hold some clues on the Lost Century or maybe even something else. Carefully she peeked into the chest, inside were the statues she was told about, but there were only two of them. There was brief urge to touch the wooden statues but Robin knew better than to follow that urge. She took a step backwards; Hmm\u2026<i>Everyone said three statues\u2026Where could it be?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then something caught the brunette's eye, a small wooden statue in front of the chest, designed exactly like the others and about half of an inch tall. It didn't make it far from the chest, but it did make Robin realize something. Someone was here. Recently. But no one on the entire island was stupid enough to try and get these statues. Immediately Robin thought of her crew. Whenever something bad happened, or when a bad decision was made, it was their doing 100% of the time. Coincidence was possible she supposed, but Robin knew her crew well enough to know better than that. Besides, they were all with Luffy, who wouldn't pay any mind to the boat\u2026Suddenly Robin remembered, Nami wasn't with them. She started with them, but later did her own thing. It was very possible she was involved in this somehow. It made sense, or at least\u2026as much sense as anything in the Grand Line did. But that just left the question, if Nami really did come and grab the statue, where was Nami?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe she really did vanish like the rumors said. I hope she didn't go in agony. Robin thought morbidly</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami didn't vanish, but she certainly in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"ROBIN! PLEASE! GET OFF OF ME!!\"</b> Nami cried against the sole of Robin's sandal. But any sound she attempted to make was muffled by the footwear, Robin had no idea she was standing on Nami. She couldn't even feel the red-head suffering underfoot. It almost made the girl want to cry that she was so small and unnoticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere moments ago, Nami was standing; looking up at Robin, who was so tall she could've been a Goddess. No giant came near to her height, not even Oars. With Oars, Nami was about tall enough to be near his ankle. With Robin\u2026Her big toe was taller than her. So yeah, Robin was pretty damn big, but still a friend. So Nami started shouting for her attention. Not even a minute after she started, Robin took a step towards the chest, and on Nami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">BOOM!!</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrushed into the ground was Nami, sore but more or less alive. Logically speaking she should have been crushed, but it appeared she a bit more endurable than that. Good to know, though it still hurt quite a bit. Nami was just thankful immediately afterwards Robin's foot came off as she took another booming step to stand before the chest. She was inspecting it very carefully, almost like she knew what would happen if she touched anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She probably does knowing Robin\u2026</i>Nami thought to herself past the grumbles of pain. Her body was in incredible pain, but it wasn't the worst she'd ever felt. Slowly the Navigator worked her way back to her weak, albeit she didn't look to be standing too strongly. Taking in a big breath, Nami readied for another shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">BOOM!!!</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Only to be stepped on by Robin again. For whatever reason the giantess backed up and didn't move, leaving her foot on Nami. That was the current situation, little Nami was underneath Robin, in excruciating pain and failing to get any sort of attention from her. On the Brightside though, Nami didn't feel any bones cracking or anything like that. Apparently shrinking came with at least one perk, though if Robin stayed there for much longer, Nami would quickly learn to hate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on Robin, you're smart. If you know what these statues do you can help me.</i> Nami started pleading in her mind, wanting help before she seriously got hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin decided to work off the assumption Nami wasn't dead and gone forever. But that still begged the question, where was Nami now then? <i>It's possible she isn't here and never was\u2026Though for some reason I feel that's wrong\u2026But if she didn't vanish\u2026</i>As her mind racked itself to try and work things out, Robin recalled the aspect to this story she initially shrugged off. How the people didn't vanish, they were shrunken. If that was the case then Nami would most certainly be alive, but she'd be extremely small. Robin briefly looked at her surroundings. The boat was technically not at the dock, it was on the land beside the dock, which amounted to a grassy plain. Robin was standing in grass, which was all well in good, but if Nami was anything less than an inch tall she'd be completely invisible to her. The search would take hours\u2026If it were anyone else. But Robin had her own tricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes as she raised her hands to opposite sides of her face, \"Ojos Fleur\u2026\" Instantly, all over the entire grass field sprouted eyes, Robin's eyes, all looking for Nami in the midst of the grass. Robin had no proof that Nami was even shrunken, but she still felt as if she was on the right track. Her instincts tended to be right in situations like these. Though right now, no results. Still, she'd keep trying for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami had given up preventing tears and was just doing her best to let it out with eating a face-full of dirt. Robin was still on top of her, thinking as hard as she could about the situation. In fact, she was thinking so hard, she probably didn't realize her foot was tapping. Normally something totally unnoticeable, when you are under that foot though, it's a hell that belongs in Impel Down. The booms that come each time Robin's foot touches the ground was deafening. The pain from being smashed between ground and sandal was building up to a point beyond Nami's pain tolerance level, in other words she was now screaming in pain. To make it even better, Nami was so smashed against Robin's foot that when it rose back up, she was still stuck to the sole! So when it came time to touch the ground again, it hurt even more. And to help top it off, the screams led to her face ingesting whatever it slams into, which is dirt in this case.  After the first mouthful of dirt, Nami just started crying and felt herself giving up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There's no way Robin will find me\u2026I'm just a bug under her shoe right now\u2026</i>Nami had just about lost hope when she saw it, exactly thirty feet in front of her, Robin's eye! It was looking for her! Robin knew she was shrunken! There might be a chance yet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain seemed to go away at this revelation; it suddenly didn't matter as Nami began shouting at the top of her lungs for Robin to see her, forgetting that it was Robin's eye and not her ear. \"<b>Robin!! Robin!! Down here Robin!!!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nSeveral minutes passed, at least ten, and the cycle hadn't changed at all. Robin was still tapping her foot without realizing it, and stuck to the bottom of her sole was Nami, who was barely visible from where she was. Nami was still doing her best to shout, but enough footfalls had left her voice raspier and less loud than it was before, and Robin was beginning to feel that her search was proving futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, how could she hope to be found if she spends half the time getting crushed under Robin\u2019s feet? Robin was getting ready to retract her powers when it caught her glimpse, a small red speck on the bottom of her shoe. It appeared to be about the same size as the smallest statue but no other details could be determined. Robin removed the various eyes surveying the area as she lifted her foot. \u201cI probably crushed her without realizing it, poor thing.\u201d To Robin\u2019s surprise, the speck on her shoe was still very much alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I\u2019m still alive Robin!!\u201d Nami shouted, it was meant to be a bit of a snarky response but in light of being found the red-head sounded more relieved than upset. With a simple pluck of the fingers Nami was removed from her hell and gently placed on Robin\u2019s open palm. Nami instantly collapsed due to the unstable footing but was still too happy to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin offered a small smile of relief herself, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re alive Nami, you had me worried.\u201d As expected of the woman, she was quite considerate of Nami\u2019s size and was whispering accordingly. \u201cYou should no better than to take random treasure like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I never thought it would do <i>this</i> to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRegardless, you\u2019re usually smarter than that. I could\u2019ve crushed you like a bug and have never known.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami turned a bit green at the thought, \u201cPlease don\u2019t bring that up, I don\u2019t want to remember that ever again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin shrugged, \u201cI suppose now isn\u2019t the best time to talk anyway. We should focus on finding some means of reversing this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t agree more! Any ideas?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne, there was an elderly man in town who informed me about this chest. Perhaps he would know something about the actual shrinking process.\u201d Nami offered a nod then wordlessly Robin began to bring her hand towards her cleavage, Nami instantly flipped out. \u201cWoah woah woah! What\u2019re you doing Robin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to carry you in some way. This is the most efficient.\u201d Robin stated matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way! I am not hitching a ride between your boobs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami lowered her head, \u201cIt makes my chest feel small\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment even made Robin smile, \u201cRight now <i>all </i>of you is small. Besides, you aren\u2019t exactly in a position to argue.\u201d Once again Robin moved her hand towards her chest, casually sliding the shrunken Nami in there despite all her protests. The redhead was held tightly within the confines of Robin\u2019s cleavage with little room to move. \u201cSorry, but it\u2019s more than likely you\u2019d fall if I placed you anywhere else so this is simply the best option. Please just bear with it for a while.\u201d And with that, Robin turned and headed back to town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bounce of Robin\u2019s breasts with each step left Nami feeling a bit too woozy to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all it was not a long walk. The old man Robin encountered was at one of the first bars upon entering the town, and he didn\u2019t seem the type to leave the bar anytime soon. For Nami though, the short walk may as well have been an eternity. With each and every step Robin\u2019s chest bounced, it was relatively mild but to one the size of a bug it was enough to turn you green in a few seconds. In a few minutes Nami wanted to vomit, the entire time feeling a bit of a shot at her pride for being small enough to have to ride in the cleavage of another woman. Nami found it hard to adjust to the notion that the two breasts on either side of her were both large enough to crush ten of her under a single mammary. It certainly made the redhead\u2019s own voluptuous chest feel insignificant. Couple that with getting crushed under her friend\u2019s foot and it was a miracle Nami hadn\u2019t fainted yet. So it was only natural that once Robin took a seat across from the old man that Nami perked up, ready to hear it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man was as stereotypical as a pirate could get, he had messy hair, he didn\u2019t seem to have bathed, several dozen bottles of beer were on the table, and he just gave the aura that he was a pirate. His hair was graying and he had a beard, worn clothes, he resembled either a pirate or the town drunkard\u2026probably both. Despite all the liquor though he appeared completely tame. \u201cYou again eh Missy? Come to hear more of my \u201ccrazy\u201d stories?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin offered a polite smile, \u201cSort of. You mentioned with the chest earlier that you believed people shrank, not vanished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey do! I seen it with my own eyes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I believe you, but what do you know about after that? Is there any way to reverse the process?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man narrowed his eyes and took a sip of his drink, it seemed as if he understood instantly. \u201cWell in a nutshell, I dunno. All I know are the details of the shrinking. Happened to a greedy buddy of mine, and I was there every step of the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin\u2019s brow twitched when the man said he didn\u2019t know, and in her chest it was clear Nami was already shedding more hopeless tears. \u2018Well could you tell me everything you know about the shrinking process?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d He took another sip, \u201cSee, they start off as small as the statue they grabbed, and that lasts about\u2026a day or two. Then they get<i> smaller</i>\u2026and <i>smaller</i>\u2026until finally they just shrink into nothing. Whole thing takes about a month before they\u2019re completely out of sight, it\u2019s pretty slow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, and?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet another sip of his drink, \u201cWell you seem invincible once shrunken. My friend, his wife accidentally ate him and a few days later he-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to go that far, thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, anyway, they\u2019re invincible. And they\u2026well they get another problem. My friend\u2026changed. After a day or two he just seemed like\u2026Well like how all the fellas here seem to stare at you. He just seemed like he was turned on all the time, and nothing he did seemed to take it away. He started getting really desperate, and got crushed more than a few times because of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin\u2019s eyes narrowed, \u201cYou say he was just constantly full of lust?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly the man put his beer bottle down. \u201cYeah, got bad enough that in a day he was hitting on other guys. I told him to just do what all desperate guys do, but he told me that he tried- nothing. But it worked with his wife. So all I can figure is that he just couldn\u2019t get rid of it himself, he needed someone else to basically make his day. Heheheh\u2026Lucky punk\u2026His wife was <i>quite</i> the looker\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease focus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops, sorry. Like I was saying, his wife was able to help his problem a bit, but it came back in no time at all. He basically started needing constant attention until\u2026You know, he just shrank away to nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss, but thank you for telling me.\u201d Robin stood up and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold it, let me say one more thing. Now this is just a theory of mine, but whenever my pal seemed uh\u2026content, he didn\u2019t seem to shrink. So I guess with this friend of yours, if you can keep em happy they probably won\u2019t get much smaller.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re mistaken, I was just debating on touching it myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh\u2026\u201d The old man laughed, \u201cI won\u2019t pry too much, thanks for listening to my rambles a bit. Hope it all works out, you seem like a nice gal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin left wordlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside Robin found a nice spot alone and talked with Nami, now in her palm again. \u201cIt appears the situation is quite bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami, who\u2019d been increasingly upset over the entire discussion, now looked almost hopeless. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me. I won\u2019t only shrink into nothing, but I\u2019m going to be miserably horny the whole time? I\u2019m too pretty to go out like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder about that last part\u2026He had quite a bit to drink. It\u2019s possible that part was wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami shrugged, \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019ll still shrink to nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess offered a consoling pet of her finger, \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll figure out something. Later I\u2019ll ask Chopper to take a look at you. But that may be a while, the crew could be anywhere right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be danged if I go out like that\u2026None of those guys are my type. I\u2019d sooner die than let them do that to me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear Nami was obsessing on how she would be feeling during these final days. Either die hopelessly aroused, or lower her standards and essentially let someone please her. It was an impossible choice for someone as prideful as her. So Robin made the choice for her, \u201cIf that happens Nami I\u2019ll handle it personally.\u201d It was a very sweet thing to say, though what it implied was a bit head-turning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami raised her head, \u201cYou\u2019ll do what\u2026? No way, No way! Nu-uh! NO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled, \u201cI said the same thing when you came for me at Enies Lobby. Yet now I thank you for it. As you will eventually thank me for this. I still owe you for helping save me after all, think of it as me repaying the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami sighed, realizing it was probably her best bet, plus she was too tired to properly debate it. \u201cI just wanna sleep for now\u2026I\u2019m exhausted from all this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response Robin gently placed the woman back into her cleavage, \u201cYou can rest there. For now I still need to explore the area a bit. See if I can gather anymore information.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me\u2026\u201d Nami trailed off, slowly drifting to sleep. This time as Robin walked the bounces of her chest didn\u2019t seem quite as bad, or maybe the exhaustion Nami felt was simply that extreme. Either way, in moments she was out cold.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nami awoke several hours later. Coming to her senses she was contemplating what she had found out earlier. She and Robin had ventured into town to find what little information they could about her shrinking. As it turns out she would either shrink away to nothing or she would need to be fulfilled sexually in order to prevent herself from shrinking any further, and to make matters worse she would spend the entire time feeling hopelessly horny.  Neither option seemed that appealing to Nami, well the fulfilment part wouldn't be that bad but she didn't like the idea of it being completely out of her control but it would mean someone else having to do it for her, hell she could shrink down to microscopic size and still be horny! Snapping back into reality Nami found herself blinded by the bright light of the sun, she then attempted to stand up but failed to find her footing and fell down, she landed on a soft squishy terrain. Wait squishy? <b>\"Look who's finally awake, sleep well?\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami looked up to find the gigantic and beautiful face of her crewmate and close friend Nico Robin. That's when Nami realised where she had been sleeping, either side of her were Robin's huge breasts. Robin smiled down at her shrunken crewmate, she had it admit she was finding somewhat amusing seeing her friend struggle with something so simple as standing up, Robin then explained what had happened while Nami was asleep. Having found out all that they could they made their way back from the town to the Sunny, with the tiny navigator resting in her cleavage Robin made her way from town to the Sunny. Once there she met up with the rest of the crew, as luck would have it they had discovered that there was a rare treasure on the other side of the island, the crew was so excited that they were putting everything else on hold to go and find the treasure, they asked Robin along but she had told them that she was investigating a poneglyph lead and that Nami would be assisting her. She saw the crew off as they left on their treasure hunt ( she had made up a lie as to why Nami wasn't there to see them of as well) they were expected to be gone from anywhere from 3 weeks to 3 months which was music to Robin's ears, after bidding farewell she climbed aboard the Sunny. It happened to be a beautiful day so Robin decided she would get in a bit of sunbathing while she could. Changing out of her outfit and into a bikini (taking care not to wake the sleeping Nami) she pulled up a sun lounger and began tanning whilst simultaneously reading a book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her story Robin gazed down lovingly at the tiny navigator as she herself absorbed the information she was given. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok so at the very least we'll have some time until they're back and wondering where I disappeared to (hopefully not literally!) but there's one thing I have a problem with\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Hmmm and what's that?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY AM I STILL I YOUR BOOBS!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was taken back by her crewmates sudden outburst, but after a few seconds Robin began giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Hihihi sorry about that but you were sleeping so peacefully, I didn't want to wake you\"</b> Robin responded rather casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami could only look at her crewmate before sighing, of course Robin would be so nonchalant about this, after all she didn't care when she placed her there in the first place so why would she care now? It wasn't just that, Nami was very envious of Robin even thought she herself had breasts that were big and made any man swoon, but Robin's were always bigger and at her current size they were titanic to Nami! Which only fuelled her insecurity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I at least caught some sun so this wasn't a complete waste. And hey I didn't shrink any smaller so I guess that's a bonus\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Well Ms Navigator I may have a theory as to why that is.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami looked at her friend puzzlingly. \"Oh yeah, what's that then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you fell asleep in my cleavage and whilst we were walking you slipped further into my bra...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Go on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you were tossing in your sleep and then you began....sucking on my nipple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami turned bright red. \"I WHAT!?!?!? WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP ME!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Well as the old man from the bar said, unless you felt fulfilled you would continue shrinking so once I noticed you sucking on my nipple I thought that you must be feeling some kind of fulfilment so I let you\"</b> Robin stated almost matter of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami sunk down and held her knees in her arms, sweat was dripping from her forehead out of sheer embarrassment. On one hand she was glad she hadn't shrank any smaller, but on the other she was humiliated that it was from sucking on her friends nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the tiny navigator was a little flustered Robin petted her as gently as she could with her pinkie finger, which was like a redwood tree compared to Nami<b>. \"Hey don't be embarrassed, if it makes you feel any better it felt very nice when you were doing it\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami looked up at her crewmate who was smiling down at her encouragingly, Nami had mixed emotions but understood the gesture her friend had made and offered a weak smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that that's out of the way mind telling me what you were doing all this time besides sunbathing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Oh yes I almost forgot, while you were sleeping I read the entire devil fruit encyclopaedia. I figured there must be something in here that could help reverse the shrinking process. And whilst I found no devil fruit that specialises particularly in changing size I did discover that there are two devil fruits that under the right circumstances may be able to help you.\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami perked up in excitement. \"Oh my God really? That's awesome Robin! What are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Well I've narrowed it down to either the Hollow-Hollow fruit or the Love-Love fruit. The Hollow-Hollow fruit has the ability to change the size of the astral form they project so I'm hoping I can use that in some way. As for the Love-Love fruit I'm hoping its ability to prey on the lustful thoughts if others can be used to at least stop your shrinking all together. Now we can try either but the people who ate them are the problem. The Hollow-Hollow fruit eater is a girl named Perona who happens to be on the next island over from here, however she may not be very friendly considering we beat her former master Gecko Moria. As fro the Love-Love fruit eater that person happens to be one of the seven warlords of the sea, Boa Hancock. Now she may be friendly with Luffy but from my understanding she is very selfish and self centred. So with that in mind who would you like to try and see?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami sat still for a few moments before coming to her decision. She should try and seek help from...</span></div></div>",

As much as I would like to regain my height I'd rather not shrink away to nothing before I can even ask for help!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled, she was pleasantly surprised by her tiny crewmate's decision. She was using logic over desperation. As much as she wished to regain her height she would rather stop the shrinking. Plus it would be easier to ask Hancock as they didn't have a history with her as they did with Perona, also since she was friends with their captain it might work in their favour when asking for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"All right then Ms Navigator seems like you've made your decision, lucky for us I hear that the pirate empress is close by (how convenient) so it shouldn't take us long to reach her, we'll set sail immediately\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stood up from her sun lounger and prepared to pull up the anchor and set sail but she was interrupted by a shout from her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY ROBIN!!!!!!!!\" Nami yelled as loud as she could whilst waving her arms in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked down at the tiny navigator in her cleavage. <b>\"Hmm what is it Nami? Have you changed your mind?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not that, there's a small favour I'd like you to do for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Oh yeah and what's that Nami?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TAKE ME OUT OF YOUR BOOBS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more Nami's sudden outburst took Robin off guard for a few moments before she once again burst in laughter at her friends request. Carefully using her thumb and forefinger she plucked her crewmate out of her (to Nami) monstrous cleavage before placing her in the palm of her hand. Once the miniscule navigator was safely aboard Robin's hand she slowly and gently brought her up to her face. The view for Nami was staggering. Her friend's face was the size of the biggest billboard she had ever seen! It was really quite astounding and really nailed home just how small she actually was, hell she half an inch tall it was a miracle she had been discovered by Robin in the first place. At the same time it once again made Nami feel self conscious as at this size Robin's beauty was magnified tenfold, she might as well not even have boobs since Robin's were so big and perfect. And to think a few hours ago she had supposedly been sucking on her nipple! She had been essentially pleasuring herself by kissing and sucking the nipple of the biggest breast she had ever seen, and yet she didn't seem to mind it after all had Robin not allowed her to fulfil herself she may have ended up shrinking even smaller and become impossible to find! lost in the depth's of Robin's cleavage, what a way to spend a life...but not the worst way. Wait! What the hell was she thinking? She couldn't spend the rest of her life at a size barely any bigger than an insect, this must be the aftereffect's of the statue, she would spend her days shrinking and feeling hopelessly horny. That would explain her feelings for her crewmate, she needed to snap out of this she needed to focus on regaining her normal size not lusting after her big, beautiful and sexy crewm..  damn it there she goes again!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Ok Nami?\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami snapped back into reality and turned her attention back to her titanic friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you seem to dislike riding in my cleavage I guess the only suitable and efficient place to carry you is inside my ear, now it may be bumpy so be sure to hold on tight, plus with you there I want have to rely on my devil fruit to hear you\" (Robin had been using her devil fruit to produce a small ear near to Nami whenever she was speaking) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami not in the mood to object sighed before nodding. Smiling Robin gently raised her hand up to her ear and waited until the tiny navigator stepped into her ear, once she was secure Robin made her way to the helms room and raised the anchor before taking off. Nami managed to even fulfil her role as navigator whilst resting in Robin's ear instructing her friend on where to steer and what directions to avoid on their way to the island Hancock was staying on. Luckily for them she was only a day's voyage away. The Trip went smoothly and eventually Nami and Robin found themselves approaching the island they then...</span></div></div>",

However even though she hadn\u2019t lost any height she was still half an inch tall and every second she risked meeting her untimely end. With that said Nami was more determined that ever to stop her shrinking and find a way to return to her normal height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Meanwhile on Amazon Lily </u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pirate empress was enjoying another day as the ruler of the greatest female warrior race on the planet. Arguably the most beautiful woman in the world Boa Hancock was in her bed chambers fawning over her (self proclaimed fianc\u00e9) Luffy\u2019s wanted poster, his bounty had now risen up to 500 million beri\u2019s. He looked so handsome on his poster (so much in fact she had hung an enlarged copy of it from the tallest tower on the island) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh Luffy I know you\u2019re out there living your dream, but I have a dream too. I dream of the day you return to me so we can get married!\u201d </b> Hancock blushed as she said this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever her thoughts of Luffy would soon be interrupted by a knock at her door. Angered at being interrupted Hancock glared at the door before answering. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWho dares interrupt me when I\u2019m thinking of my beloved!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock taking care to ensure her back was covered approached her bed chamber door, stood there was one of her newest crew members and someone with whom she had slight history with, Marguerite. In no way was she as beautiful as the pirate empress but on her own merits Marguerite was a fairly attractive woman, roughly about 5\u201911,having short blond hair, tanned skin, ample breasts that were barely covered by an animal skin bra, long crisp legs that were barely covered at the top by an animal skin loincloth and a pair of heeled shoes, a fairly good looking and attractive woman. But she had unknowingly interrupted her empress and captain during one of her fantasies which was a major no-no, trembling slightly she answered her ruler. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cM...my apologies empress I just came to deliver a report that a ship has been sighted docking at the entrance to the island...\u201d  </b> Marguerite was barely able to get the words out as she avoided the gaze of Hancock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock however was not amused at having been interrupted for such a mundane affair, glaring down at her subject and crewmate she responded accordingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIs that all? You interrupt me in my private chambers for something as trivial as this? I should turn you to stone for such a thing!\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarguerite gulped as she heard this but stood her ground as she knew what she was about to say next would definitely improve her empresses mood. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cBut Empress the ship belongs to the Straw Hat pirates!\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarguerite stood there as she awaited Hancock\u2019s response, there was no telling what her mood would be at hearing this news but her Fears would soon melt away as in an instance Hancock\u2019s expression changed from blood thirsty and angry, and was replaced with a look of absolute joy as hearts literally shot out of the pirate empresses eyes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cStraw Hats! That must mean Luffy is here! My beloved has returned at last! Quickly have a massive feast prepared and brought to my chambers immediately! Oh and alert the warriors that all members of his crew are allowed on the island, and finally go and meet them and bring them to the pace so I may properly greet them.\u201d </b>Hancock swooned as she said this and shut her door before Marguerite even had a chance to respond. Not waiting Marguerite carried out her orders as she headed to the harbor to greet thorn visitors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Robin and her tiny crewmate had docked and landed on the island. Nami had been moved from Robins ear to the glasses she wore on her head, hiding underneath one of the lenses. Robin was intrigued by the all female warrior Island and was desperate to learn of its history and maybe even see if they had a poneglyph hidden away, but that would have to wait as she had to meet the pirate empress and see if she could do something about her shrunken crewmate. At that very moment Robin was approached by a group of women of various sizes, they were Marguerite, Aphelandra and the Boa sisters Sandersonia and Merrygold. Marguerite who was entrusted with bringing the straw hats or more specifically Luffy spoke first. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHello and welcome to Amazon Lily, I am Marguerite, this Here is Aphelandra and these are the  Boa sisters Sandersonia and Merrygold.

No incidentally where is Luffy and the rest of your crew?\u201d</b>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin answered honestly and after a few exchanges of dialogue was on her way to the place to meet the empress.

I don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold out not shrinking!\u201d Nami shrieked down the ear of her gargantuan friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin took note of the fear in Nami\u2019s voice and made an attempt at making her feel better. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I\u2019m sure the empress will see us soon and then we\u2019ll be able to stop you shrinking, but if you\u2019re that worried I can put you back into my cleavage and we can see where it goes from there?\u201d </b>Robin stated in a matter of fact way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami knew that robin meant that in the best way possible but she was still embarrassed at the prospect of sucking on her friends nipple again so she was a little bit annoyed at the notion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHELL NO IM NOT GOING BACK IN THERE AGAIN\u201d the tiny Nami shrieked at the top of her lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at her size Nami\u2019s voice was still incredibly loud and it caused Robin to flinch slightly, but once more she couldn\u2019t help but laugh at her tiny navigators outburst, soemthing that wouldn\u2019t go unnoticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cLaughing in the presence of an empress? My aren\u2019t you the bold one.\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stopped laughing and turned her attention to the stairwell. There stood one of the most beautiful women that any man hell any woman had ever seen, a tall slender figure that stood 6\u20193, looooong smooth legs that seemed to go on for miles, a thin tight waist, enormous breasts that would make even the huge breasts of Nami look small all this topped off with a beautiful face complete with long gorgeous black hair, it was fair to say that she might just be the most beautiful woman in the world. Even Robin had to admit that she looked incredibly good, Nami on the other hand gulped as she didn\u2019t think there could be a woman that beautiful other than her. After a few seconds of silence Hancock spoke again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAnd where is Luffy?\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake princess\u2019 expression had remained unchanged but you could just about make out a slight vein on the corner of her perfect forehead. Robin took note of this and proceeded cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid Luffy couldn\u2019t be here today, in fact himself and the rest of our crew are on an adventure on some treasure island. But in light of this I have request for you Snake princess.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin awaited Boa Hancock\u2019s response however it wasn\u2019t what she expected. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWHAT DO YOU MEAN LUFFY ISNT HERE!!!!! HAS HE SENT YOU TO BREAK UP WITH ME!!!? IS HE SEING ANOTHER WOMAN!!? IS IT YOU!?? IS THIS WHAT THEY CALL CHEATING!!!?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock was furious, her eyes were rabid her teeth were showing, she looked like she was about to rip Robin\u2019s head off! Robin however being her usual calm self used her superior intelligence to ease the pirate empress. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cOf course not Ms Hancock I would never do that to your beloved Luffy. In fact I\u2019m sure Luffy would be offended if he had heard you say that, he may not show it but Luffy loves you very much and would do anything for you as I\u2019m sure you would for him\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as those words left Robin\u2019s mouth Hancock\u2019s expression changed once more. She was now smiling and holding her hands up to her face as she fawned over the words She had just heard. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cOh Luffy! I knew you\u2019d never cheat on me, im all the woman you need!\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock continued her swooning for a few minutes until Robin cleared her throat.

Do you want more, for me to allow you to play with the feet of her majesty, maybe even put your commoner tongue between my toes?\" Vivi's hand tilts Nami's head up so she's looking the bluenette in the eye \"Well Nami?\" she asks directly, looking every bit the future queen she would be rather than simply another of her friend and nakama<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami swallows before weakly answering \"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes princess, I want your feet!\" Nami yells more frantically, possibly because a bored Vivi had managed to grab one of her fingers between her toes and was rubbing it from knuckle to fingertip<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivi grins widely \"Good, then I think we can have a lot of fun before we have to leave\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's in store for Nami under Vivi?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Vivi sits on her bed and has Nami crawl over and massage her feet, which the red head was happy to do, planting little kisses along her foot as she works<br>\r\n2) The princess decides it's been too long since her feet have been properly cleaned, so has Nami give them a thorough wash... with her tongue.

But maybe this was how it was meant to end, she had had a good life and had many wonderful memories, if this was the end she had at least led a life worth living. That\u2019s when she crashed into a soft,squishy yet firm terrain. \u201cOh thank God I didn\u2019t want to die!!!!!\u201d exclaimed an exasperated Nami. Slowly feeling around she found herself on a vast white plain that was soft yet firm, and was so incredibly smooth and smelled of the most magnificent roses, she truly was on something beautiful. That\u2019s when Nami noticed that the plain she was standing on was connected to something of a different colour. Touching it she felt the unmistakeable fabric of velvet, such a classy and lovely material. But then it clicked for Nami, slowly craning her neck upwards she saw the beautiful titanic face of Boa Hancock, her heart dropped. Nami was sitting on her right breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all this was happening on Boa Hancock\u2019s breasts the pirate empress and Nico Robin continued their conversation. Upon hearing what had happened to the Straw Hats navigator Hancock started laughing heavilly amused at her love rivals predicmiment, as she laughed her entire top half moved including her glorious breasts which Nami struggled to hold onto, clinging to the fabric of Hancock\u2019s dress Nami felt like she was riding on a rampaging bull or someone who had eaten the bison variety of the Ox-Ox fruit, she then lost her grip and slid into the depths of Hancock\u2019s cleavage. Luckily for Nami Hancock was wearing a dress that held her gigantic breasts firmly together meaning she had a little bit of space and somthing to hold onto either side of her. Far above Nami Hancock stopped laughing and spoke. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cSo let me get this straight Nico Robin, your foolish navigator somehow shrunk herself with some magical statue and now you wish for me to somehow use my powers to prevent her from getting any smaller, or even go as far as to help grow her back?\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin cool as a cucumber merely replied \u201c<b>Yes that is precisely what I just told you Pirate Empress\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</b> Hancock suddenly became angrier, her eyes turned sharp and black rings encircled her pupils as her forehead veins began to pop slightly, that\u2019s when she pointed her finger straight at Robin and bent swiftly backwards in her classic pose, as she did this the tiny Nami in her cleavage shot suddenly up from her cleavage and flew high in the air high above the two women as she did she noticed Hancock\u2019s weird pose, almost like she was looking down on Robin so much that she was looking up. This was short lived as she started to descend once more and almost like Deja vu she screamed before she shot directly back into Boa Hancock\u2019s enormous cleavage. As this happens Robin noticed Hancock\u2019s boobs jiggle slightly which was fairly odd as she hadn\u2019t moved since she took this pose, but her thoughts were intterupted as Hancock resumed her vertical stature and spoke once more. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHow dare you be so presumptuous Nico Robin! You expect me to help not one but two of rivals in this battle for Luffy\u2019s love!!!! I will never help another woman or women for that matter seduce my future husband! Now if you think there\u2019s any possible reason I would help you after this I dare you to speak it!!!!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock nearly out of breath began panting as she awaited her rivals answer, pleased with herself she was certain she would give up and leave her island giving her time to come up with a great romantic gesture for her beloved. However Hancock didn\u2019t know how cunning and convincing Nico Robin was and as such was not prepared for the answer she was about to receive.<b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do have one reason Snake Princess</b>, <i>Hancock perked up a little at Robin\u2019s change of addressing her. </i><b>And that reason is that Luffy asked me to ask you to do it. He had complete faith that his...future wife would be more than willing to help his navigator as she is vital to him becoming King of the Pirates. And by doing this it would be like you helped him become King of the Pirates. Now as good as Snake princess sounds I\u2019m sure Queen of the Pirates sounds even better No?\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin finshed her explanation and once again calmly awaited Hancock\u2019s answer. Hancock was awestruck at what she had just heard, slowly her expression changed her angry face settled into her usual blank and dismissive yet beautiful face, Then out of nowhere her cheeks turned red, her skin started glowing and a big smile appeared on her face as she wrapped her arms around herself as if holding on for support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was doing this the teeny tiny Nami in her cleavage was having an awful time, out of nowhere Hancock\u2019s beasts closed around her and smothered her from head to toe as she was caressed by the giant soft lucious orbs known as Hancock\u2019s emasculate breasts. This continued for a few minutes as Hancock continued to unknowingly squeeze her breasts more firmly together almost crushing the half inch tall woman between them, all while this was happening to Nami, Hancock swooned over her beloved. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cOh Luffy!!!! I knew you loved me so! I can\u2019t believe you have such faith in me! Of course I\u2019ll help you become King of the Pirates as one day I\u2019ll be your Queen!!!!!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled as knew she had Hancock right where she wanted her. After allowing Hancock several minutes of swooning Robin cleared her throat to gain her attention. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cSo Snake Princess, will you accommodate Luffy\u2019s wishes and help our tiny navigator?\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock stopped swooning immedietly and regained her usual composure. As this was happening Nami had had enough and began to climb slowly out of the beautiful empresses cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock then spoke once more, beginning with a sigh. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cI would never deny a request from my beloved Luffy. Even though I\u2019d rather not I shall use all of my power to help restore your tiny navigator back to a more reasonable size\u201d </b>Robin noticed her choice of words as the pirate empress continued speaking. <b>\u201cWell Nico Robin don\u2019t you suppose it\u2019s high time I see this tiny navigator of yours? At the very least it will be quite amusing to see her in this situation\u201d. </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nodded and brought her hand up to her ear indicating for Nami to jump on, but she never did. Curious Robin sprouted an eye on her hand and throughout her ear but there was no sign of Nami. Worrying slightly Robin began to think where her navigator could be. Was she on her her body? Did she fall to the floor? Is she tangled in her hair! Where is she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Robin continued looking discreetly for Nami, the navigator had climbed out of Hancock\u2019s cavernous breasts and was now looking over at Robin Waving her  hands in the air.

I hope you haven\u2019t been lying to me all this time, otherwise I shall get very angry and trust me. You do not want to make me angry\u201d</b> Hancock finshed with her trademark death start that would make even the most powerful of Yonko shudder in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin had to act quickly, thinking on her feet she did the only thing she knew would get Hancock\u2019s attention. Pointing out the window Robin suddenly said, <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWait was that Luffy?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds Hancock switched from angry to happy and spun around like a school girl with a crush, <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\u201cLUFFY! WHERE IS MY BELOVED!!!!!!!\u201d</i> Hancock shrieked with hearts in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her chance Robin quickly spouted a small arm next to Hancock\u2019s breasts and grabbed the confused Nami and flung her through the air, Nami screamed at the top of her lungs as she flew from Hancock\u2019s cleavage and through the air until she crashed into the soft squishy flotation devices that were Robin\u2019s boobs before bouncing off the, and landing into the massive palm of Robin\u2019s hand whonthne brough her up to her face and spoke to her. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cAre you Ok Nami?\u201d</b> Robin asked whilst sprouting a tiny ear next to Nami. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami simply lay on her back out of breath before simpy uttering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate boobs!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin just smiled as she heard her navigators response but regained her composure as Hancock turned around slightly ticked off. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t Luffy that was a bird you stupid woman!!!!\u201d </b>Hancock said through clenched teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin as usual with her calm and cool attitude smiled before apologizing. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cMy apologies great pirate empress but on another note I present to you the navigator of the straw hat Pirates, Nami.\u201d</b> Robin finshed her sentence by holding out her hand with Nami in it, who sat there on her friends palm terrified at what might happen to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued Hancock walked over to Robin and looked down at the diminutive tiny woman in her hand, Nami shuddered as she looked into the eyes of titanic Hancock who looked like she wanted to eat her alive, Hancock looked down at Nami fascinated that there actually was a tiny shrunken person in Robin\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cSo it is true. My my this is certainly an interesting development\u201d </b>Hancock spoke with curiosity never once taking her eyes off of Nami. Robin then spoke once more stop their case. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cYes pirate Empress and it is in ours Andy Luffy\u2019s best interest if you could possibly help out Nami in her time of need!\u201d </b>Robin ended hernia sentence making sure to put emphasis on Luffy\u2019s name, Hancock then turned to Robin and begin to speak. However in Robin\u2019s hand the tiny Nami wasn\u2019t even listening, she was mesmerized by the two giantesses discussing her case high above her. Nami couldn\u2019t help but feel Horne watching them talk, whilst Robin was very beautiful she was plain compared to the beauty of the pirate empress who was drop dead gorgeous and quite possibly the most beautiful woman Nami had ever seen and that might even include herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women looked So good and they were actually quite similar as Robin was 6\u201d2 whereas Hancock was 6\u201d3, and whilst Robin had massive boobs Hancock was just one size up from her. The two women were simply mesmerized and Nami began next to get moist at the thought of what the two women could do to her, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the two titanic beauties were finishing their talk. \u201cSo Ms Hancock will you helpmus in our time of need?\u201d Robin pleaded calmly with the empress. After a few seconds Hancock had her answer.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The room was eerily quiet. Robin had finshed explaining was had happened to Nami and had asked the empress if she could use the power of her devil fruit to stop her shrinking experience. Nami Meanwhile was sat on the middle of Robin\u2019s hand as she fawned over the beauty of both her crewmate and the warlord, both were so perfect, their faces were gorgeous, their breasts were the stuff of legend! Both women had incredibly loooooong and sexy legs with asses that would turn even the most devoted of women. She knew it was mostly because of the statue\u2019s curse that she lusted after the two women but she couldn\u2019t help but feel incredibly horny at the thought of being with either woman, hell being held in Robin\u2019s hand alone was an incredible rush, but the sight of the two ginormous women made her almost explode in pure ecstasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nami was busy fawning the two regular sized beauties were still stood in silence...for all of 7 seconds because Boa Hancock had finally decided whether or not she would help Nami\u2019s size predicament. With her usual scowl on her face that she had gained from being classed as the most beautiful woman in the world, Hancock answered Robin\u2019s and by extension Luffy\u2019s request. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cOk Nico Robin I have thought throughly about your request and decided in my devine wisdom that I will grant it.\u201d </b>Hancock finshed her sentence as Robin perked up in happiness that her crewmate would soon stop shrinking and maybe even restore her regular size. However Hancock wasn\u2019t finished. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cBut in exchange for my help I would like for your tiny navigator to serve me for a few days, her tiny size amuses me and I wouldn\u2019t mind a tiny slave for a...short time hihihi\u201d </b>Hancock laughed at her own joke as she eyed the tiny Nami enviously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin contemplated her decision, on one had if Hancock helped Nami in anyway then it was worth the price of servitude for s few days, on the other hand Hancock had already demonstrated that she considered the two women love rivals and would do anything to \u201cget rid of\u201d the competition. Robin then looked down at the tiny Nami in her hand and noticed she was almost in a trance like state, but he also noticed how incredibly tiny she was, she had no chance of fulfilling hers not anyone\u2019s dream at that size, so logically there was only one choice to make. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cOk Ms Hancock we agree to your terms, but I would like you to try and lift Nami\u2019s shrinking curse first. Otherwise we have no deal\u201d </b>Robin made sure to drill home her extra condition so that Hancock knew that this was her only way to gain a servant. Hancock looked at Robin with almost sheer anger before she smiled at the cunning archeologist. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHihihi my my Nico Robin, you sure are a devious ones very well I agree to your terms, I shall do my upmost best to prevent your tiny Navigator from getting any smaller\u201d. </b>With that said Hancock motioned for Robin to place Nami on a nearby table, which Robin did so immediately. Nami was surprised by her sudden change in environment as she went from the smooth plain of Robin\u2019s hand to the hard slab of land that was a table. Hating the view she now had Nami began to protest but stopped once she noticed the beautiful incredible sight that was Hancock\u2019s tits placed right in front of her. The Pirate empress noticed ho she was glued to her gigantic tits and smiled knowing she had her right where she wanted her. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cLike what you see little red head? Well I don\u2019t blame you, they are the most marvelous tits in the entire world, you should be thankful that you get to be in their presence as no one else bar Luffy has ever been this close to their magnificence\u201d </b>Nami couldn\u2019t answer, she just stood there drooling over Hancock\u2019s glorious breasts as Hancock simply smiled in delight. Cupping her hands on her classic love heart pose Hancock prepared to fire her beam. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cOk now just stay right there and look into my eyes\u201d </b>Nami nodded and stared into the love,y eyes of Hancock as she stood there with literal hearts in her eyes. Hancock then proceeded with her move. \u201c<b>Love-Love Obey!!!\u201d </b> a heart shaped beam shot out of Hancock\u2019s hands and enveloped Nami, for the next 2 minutes Nami would obey her every command and if obeyed would remain with her even after the beam wore off. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cOk little one I Boa Hancock forbid you from shrinking any more\u201d </b> Hancock issued her command and within seconds Nami nodded furiously as blood shot out of her nose. Satisfied with her answer Hancock turned to Robin and spoke once more. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cThere you go Nico Robin I have granted your request, she will never get any smaller than she is now\u201d </b>Robin acknowledged Hancock\u2019s actions but decided that she should push her luck a llittle further. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cThank you Pirate empress but do you think there\u2019s any way you could make her grow bigger?\u201d </b> Hancock looked at Robin and smiled at how cunning and devious she was before answering. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cAll in due time Nico Robin. Corn the next day or two at least I would like this little woman to serve me, so I shall now be taking her off your hands. You are free to stay on the island whilst she is with me. So goodbye for the time being Nico Robin\u201d </b>with that said Hancock gave her hair a sexy flick and proceeded to pick up Nami who didn\u2019t even resist and walked off towards her Royal bed chambers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were alone Hancock have her servant her first job. \u201c<b>Now Little one I wish fo you to.</b>..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hancock was alone in her bed chambers, well almost alone it was just the pirate empress and her new servant (albeit temporary) the navigator of her beloved Luffy\u2019s pirate crew, Nami. And whilst she had managed to use her Love-Love devil fruit powers to stop her from shrinking any smaller, there was still the fact that Nami was only half an inch tall. But that didn\u2019t detour Hancock, she had made a deal with Nico Robin that in return for stopping the navigator\u2019s shrinking she would receive the tiny navigator as her servant for the next few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hancock expected her Love-Love powers had affected Nami to the degree that when she was taken by Hancock she had gone willingly as opposed to her usual manner of refusing to even consider going with someone as scary and intimidating as Hancock. Since they were alone now Hancock decided she was going to have her new servant fulfill her first task. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cSo little one I have decided on what you will do for me, as an empress and a warlord I spend a lot of time on my feet, and even though I am absolutely perfect in every way my feet still ache slightly after all I go through on a daily basis. So little one your first task shall be to rub my emaculate feet.\u201d</b> with her first order issued Hancock leaned against the backboard of her bed and let her incredibly long legs stretch towards the part of the bed where Nami was stood. She then kicked off her heels and let them land with thud at the foot of her bed. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cOk little one you may begin rubbing my feet now\u201d </b>Hancock then smiled as she waited for the tiny Nami to give her a foot rub. Nami stood ther mesmerized by the sheer size of the foot in front of her, there was nothing but an endless wall of flesh that stretched upwards to towards the sky. It was from the perspective that Nami realised how truly insignificant she had become, but she was given an order by her master so she would have to get on with it.  Nami then walked forward preparing to rub the sole of Hancock\u2019s the best she could. Even though she was only half an inch tall and was minsucle in comparison to Hancock\u2019s massive feet she was certain she could do a good job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami began to think to herself<b> \u201cOk all I got to do is rub the Snake princesses feet and she will be pleased with me! I can di this after all she is the most beautiful woman in the...wait a minute. NO ONES MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ME!!!!!!\u201d </b> Nami snapped back into reality, what Hancock hadn\u2019t realised was that by using her devil fruit on her to negate the statues shrinking curse, she had also negated its ability to make her incredibly horny at a moments notice. She was back to her normal self...well almost she was still extremely small and in the lair of a warlord but she wasn\u2019t gonna take orders from someone and she certainly wasn\u2019t going to be anyone\u2019s slave! Hancock looked down at her feet puzzlingly, She hadn\u2019t felt the slightest movement on her feet, looking down she saw that Nami hadn\u2019t moved from the same spot she had left her. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cIs something the matter little one, I belive I gave you an order. Now rub my feet.\u201d </b>Hancock was beginning to get impatient but she was sure that Nami would rub her feet soon, for that reason she was not prepared for what Nami said next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking straight at Hancock Nami screamed at the  top of her lungs. \u201c <b>I AM NOT YOUR SLAVE AND I AM NOT GOING TO RUB YOUR FEET!!!!!!!!\u201d </b> even at her tiny size the sheer force of her voice echoed throughout the entire room causing even the normally reserved Hancock to stare in awe. But this omen soon turned to anger, how dare this insignificant bug talk to her an empress like that? Who did she think she was? Just as Hancock was thinking about raising her foot up and squashing Nami like the big she was, she soon remembered that she was a Luffy\u2019s navigator and as such she was tough as nails and defiant as Luffy, calming down Hancock smiled to herself and decided that she wouldn\u2019t crush Nami. But no one refused a request of hers, so she\u2019s came up with a different strategy to get what she wanted. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cOf course you\u2019re not a slave little one. But my feet still need attending to. How about this. You massage my feet and in return I promise to grow you, but only if you do a good job. Sound good tiny hihi\u201d </b>Hancock ended her sentence with a wink that made Nami blush slightly. Nami then swallowed her pride, she knew she didn\u2019t want to rub Hancock\u2019s feet but if she wanted to get bigger that\u2019s just what she had to do. She looked Hancock right in the eyes and nodded. Satisfied that she had what she wanted Hancock resumed her position against the backboard of her bed and waited for a nami to come and rub her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami approached the towering mountains that were Hancock\u2019s feet and approached them, upon reaching them Nami noticed how good they actually smelled, was this woman incapable of even emitting sweat or odors? Either way Nami decided she should get to it, using all her strength she started to masssge the base of Hancock\u2019s softy delicate and enormous feet as far above Hancock lay back in satisfaction form her touch. Nami rubbed her foot for some time before Hancock lowered her foot onto its side so Nami could work on the rest of her foot. This went on for some time before Hancock motioned for Nami to repeat the process on her other foot which Nami did so in half the time. After an adequate amount of time had passed Hancock sat up and pulled her feet away from Nami who then collapsed onto her knees out of sheer exhaustion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nami rested Hancock inspected her feet, after a couple of minutes Hancock deemed the job satisfactory and smiled. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWell little one seems you have done a good job on my feet, I must say I\u2019m impressed someone so little could hands them such a big job\u201d </b> Hancock then stood up and off her bed as Nami looked up at the titanic beauty known as Hancock as she aimed heart shaped hands at Nami. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWell a deals a deal.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A pink heart shaped beam shot out of Hancock\u2019s hands as the light off the heart engulfed Nami\u2019s entire half inch frame entirely. Nami could feel the overwhelming surge of love enveloping her entire body as she began to moan in pleasure as th exams affects took place. Nami looked down, she was slowly edging upwards away from the ground and towards the sky, she was growing!!!! Nami looked as her legs got longer, her ass got thicker and most importsnlty of all her boobs got bigger!!!! Nami stood there and enjoyed the feeling knowing that soon she would be restored to her regular height, the after a few minutes the feeling of love stopped and with it the pleasures. \u201cOh Well\u201d Nami thought to herself \u201cat least I\u2019ve grown back to norm...\u201d. Nami stopped mid sentence, she had expected to be looking directly into the eyes of Hancock but instead she found herself looking right at a titanic hour glass figure that looked awfully familiar. Craning her neck towards the sky Nami saw a sight that Kadence her shudder, the gigantic face of Boa Hancock smiling devilishly down at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT THE HELL!!!!!!! YOU SAID YOU WOULD GROW ME BACK TO NORMAL IF I MASSAGED YOUR BIG ASS FEET!!!! WHY THE HELL AM I STILL THIS SMALL!!!!!\u201d Nami yelled at Athe pirate empress at the top of her lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the obvious size difference Hancock was still able to hear the tiny navigators outburst (anime logic) in a heartbeat Hancock\u2019s expression changed from devilish to angry. Without saying a word Hancock raised her gigantic foot up towards the sky and brought it crashing down right where Nami was standing. Nami couldn\u2019t even move all she could do was scream as the soft pink Mountain of flesh came flying down from the heavens above. Hancock\u2019s foot hit th bed with such force that anything so unfortunate to be standing there would surely be nothing more than a stain on the empresses foot. But luckily for the tiny navigator Hancock wasn\u2019t aiming to crush her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami cowered on her knees whilst using her hands to shield herself from the gigantic threat from above. Even though it wouldn\u2019t help her in any way it was the only thing she could do. She heard a huge earth shattering crash that made Nami scream even louder.  After several seconds Nami slowly opened her eyes. To her relief Hancock had missed crushing her as due to her tiny size she landed directly Inbetween Hancock\u2019s Big and second toe. Nami then looked upwards towards the sky\u2019s where she saw Hancock once again resuming a familiar pose. With her arm and hand pointing down at Nami with her back bent backwards and her head facing the ceiling Hancock was once again looking down at Nami so much that she was looking upwards. Nami looked at Hancock  with a tired expression, that is until the empress looked down at her again with an angry expression once more and spoke. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cSILENCE YOU LITTLE INSECT, HOW DARE SOMEONE SO LOWLY TALK TO ME LIKE THAT!!!! I AM THE MOSY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD AND I SHALL BE TREATED AS SUCH. IS THAT CLEAR YOU TINY INSIGNIFICANT BUG!?!\u201d </b> Hancock yelled with such ferocity it left a nami scraped and speechless. All she could do was nervously nod her head in agreement. Satisfied with her slaves answer Hancock explain herself. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better my little slave, you should count yourself lucky that I was so generous as to avoid smashing you under the bottom of my foot like the little insect you are\u201d </b>at this Nami gulped as Hancock continued. <b>\u201cNow as for your outburst I kept my end of the bargain, I never said I would grow you back to normal, I only said I would grow you if you served me, and as you can see I made you bigger, in fact.\u201d  </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock walked over to her dressing table and opened one of the draw, from it she pulled out a ruler and then approached the bed once more where Nami stood petrified of what this giant waomna would do to her next. Hancock looked over Nami and smiled. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cNow do as I command and stand up nice and tall for me, I want to see how much bigger you got\u201d </b> Hancock ordered and without waiting a second Nami begrudgingly obliged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering her ruler Hancock placed it right next Nami and began to emasurenthe tiny navigator. After a few seconds Hancock laughed and addressed Nami.<b> \u201cMy my seems you are now 1 inch tall. That means I doubled your height, you should be quite happy you are now twice the height you were previously. Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d </b> Nami upon hearing this merely smiled and thanked the Gigantic beauty known as Hancock who smiled in return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock then lowered her huge hand down onto the bed and without saying a word Nami knew she would have to climb onto it which she did Immedietly. Picking up the small red head Hancock brought her up to her billboard sized face and spoke. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWell I think that\u2019s enough fun for one day.

Unlike you little one she knows how to treat the most beautiful woman in the world with the respect she deserves, besides if I were to keep you overnight there would be no guarantee that you would make it to tomorrow unscathed hihi\u201d </b> Hancock stated this almost matter of factly which made the inch tall Nami gulped nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonethelsss Hancock called one of her servants into her room and ordered that Robin be brought to her immediately. As they waited for the archeologist to arrive Hancock decided to amuse herself with Nami one more time before they parted ways for the night. Holding out her palm flat with nami standing in the center Hancock lowered two fingers at the edge of her hand, with the standing straight up almost like they were the legs of a person. Nami quietly awaited what Hancock would do, the answer would come soon enough as Hancock\u2019s fingers began walking towards her, closer and closer they got as nami began to see every fine detail of Hancock\u2019s perfectly manicured hands with each finger easilly being at least 3 maybe even 4 times her height, Amazon\u2019s were truly amazing! Hancock noticed Nami wasn\u2019t moving from her approaching fingers so decided she would tease her a little to get her moving. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHmmm you ought to be more cautious of my fingers little one, you never know they might mistake you for a bug and either try to crush you or...or flick you away hihi\u201d </b> and with that Hancock moved her fingers a little faster and began to playfully stop her palm which finally made Nami get moving. Only problem was Hancock\u2019s hand was only so long and after a few steps she\u2019s found herself at the edge of her hand right on her fingers. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cMy my little it seems you\u2019ve reached the end of the line. Now looks like you have a choice, either jump and hope you land on something soft or try and fight my fingers. Either way I\u2019d say you\u2019re not gonna stay on my hand  for much longer hihihi\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami couldn\u2019t belive whya she was hearing, was this crazy woman actually trying to kill her!!! Either way she wasn\u2019t gonna go down without a fight so the moment that Hancock\u2019s fingers got close enough Nami punched and kicked them with all her might. This deeply amused Hancock who couldn\u2019t help but smile at the tiny owmans futile efforts. Even though though there was no chance of winning she still tried to taker her enormous appendages on. But Hancock said she would be falling off her hand either way and the Empress always keeps her word. She simply flicked her fingers shd that was enough to send Nami flying back and off the edge of her fingers as she plummeted to the ground below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what seemed like the millionth time today Nami screamed at the top of her lungs as she\u2019s fell through the air into the unknown, Luckilly for her she landed on something soft immedietly. Slowly getting to her feet she realised she was on Boa Hancock\u2019s soft and toned leg standing just a few inches away from her kneecap. Hancock had raised her leg up at the last second almost like she was posing and upon seeing the startled navigator she let out a laugh. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHihi oh silly me, I always pick the worst times to show off my figure. Oh who am I kidding its always the time to show off my curvaceous figure. Now little one worry not I won\u2019t hurt you\u201d </b>Hancock said this as she once again pinched Nami off of her body and once again onto her open palm as Nami tried to gather her thoughts of how crazy this woman is, she changed her mood in a heart beat! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock then sat and after a few minutes we servant with Nico Robi; in tow enetered the room. Hancock deposited Nami onto Robin\u2019s outstretched hand. <b>\u201cNow I expect you back at 10am tomorrow morning. Is that clear?\u201d </b>Robin nodded in agreement and Hancock bid them farewell but not before shooting Nami a wink as they left which made Nami swoon inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin and nami then arrived at their guest room in the royal palace and once inside Robin placed Nami onto a nearby desk as Nami almost collapsed onto it exhausted from the days she had had. Noticing this Robin offered a consoling pet of her finger. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cMy you look so tired Nami, I can\u2019t imagine how hard it was to spend the day with the the snake princess. But rest sssured I\u2019ll make sure your nights are at the very less than stress free\u201d</b> Nami looked up at he huge beautiful friend and smiled, she was lucky to have but someone as caring as her for a friend. \u201cThanks Robin, all I have to do is endure more days as the empresses slave and then she\u2019ll grow me back to normal. But I have no idea how long that\u2019ll take.\u201d Nami groaned as she knew that Hancock had all the power but she forgot that her crewmate was a massive bookworm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell Nami we may be able to speed up the process a little bit, see I was reading over some of  the Amazons ancient texts and found a few passages about how and why the Amazon\u2019s grow at a must larger rate than normal humans, although it does very from Amazon to Amazon. I believe that after a few more days of research I will have figured out of there is any way to harness this growth and maybe use it to grow you back to normal. </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami jumped up in joy at what her friend had just told her and ran forward and hugged Robin\u2019s finger, which made Robin giggle at how cute she looked doing it. After a few minutes of hugging Robin suggested what they should do for the rest of the night. The could either ________ or ___________</span></div></div>",

Happy with her friends response Robin carefully scooped up Nami and brought her over to her bed. Sitting on it with her head against the backboard and her legs raised up so her knees were almost eye level Robin lowered the 1 inch Nami onto her knee, something Nami wasn\u2019t exactly comfortable with but it was Robin I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be fine right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell it seems that at the very least my theories were correct, the Snake Princess can indeed use her power of Love to overpower even the most powerful of curses, but I never thought she\u2019d be able to actually grow you in size dear Nami\u201d </b> Robin said this whilst oddly playing with her hair, something which Nami ya never seen before! But like before she let it go and answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it surprised me too, she seemed a bit surprised herself though, almost as if she wasn\u2019t testing it on me for the first ti......THAT BITCH I WAS HER GUINEA PIG!!!!!!!!!\u201d Nami yelled at the top her lungs startling Robin who had leaned in closer to be able to hear the tiny navigator. But after a few seconds Robin began laughing which in turn calmed Nami down and made her laugh. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHihihi, well in any case it worked so we should be quite pleased that you\u2019ll be able to regain your normal height eventually. Perhaps there\u2019s no need for me to research their ancient texts if she can simply grow you back with her devil fruit power\u201d </b>Robin pondered this with her face Reston on her hand whilst looking off in another direction. Nami however didn\u2019t like the sound of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO WAY YOU HAVE TO READ THEM ROBIN! IF THIS BITCH DORSNT KEEP HER WORD I COULD BE STUCK A SHRIMP FOR THE REST IF MY LIFE!!!!!!!\u201d Once more Robin was briefly startled but saw the funny side and began laughing again. Nami too began laughing again and her worries desolved. Then without warning Nami felt herself rising into the air as she looked and saw tha Robin had sprouted an arm on her knee and was lifting Nami into the sky before carefully lowering her onto the bedside cabinet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami jumped off the hand and looked up at her crewmate confused. \u201cHey why did you move me?\u201d The tiny navigator asked, Robin then leaned over and brought her titanicnfsce closer to the 1 inch Nami who couldn\u2019t help but be blown away from how beutiful she looked at this size. Robin looked over the tiny redhead and smiled once more before answering. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cI need to change silly, it\u2019s getting late and I\u2019d rather not sleep in my dirty clothes tonight hihi\u201d </b> Understsnding Nami gave her a thumbs up and sat down expecting her friend to go to the bathroom, except that wasn\u2019t happening, right in front of her Robin had started unbuttoning her blouse!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWOAH ROBIN WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU\u2019RE DOING!!!!!!!!\u201d Nami shouted. Robin stopped unbuttoning her blouse and looked down confusingly at Nami. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHave you forgotten already Ms Navigator I told you I was changing out of these dirty clothes\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but why are you changing in front of me??? There\u2019s a bathroom right there!\u201d Nami had started turning red something which Robin even at her size could notice. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about Nami, we\u2019re both adults here we\u2019ve seen each other naked many times when we bathe or hit the beach. Why are you so shy all of a sudden?\u201d </b> Robin already knew the answer it wasn\u2019t because the side effects of the curse were kicking in. Even though Hancock had stopped her from shrinking any smaller and had made her bigger, she hadn\u2019t removed the part where Nami would feel incredibly horny every now and then, something which Robin wanted to exploit a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami was still blushing bright red and couldn't even answer her gigantic friend, but that\u2019s when she felt the familiar feeling of something rubbing on her her head, looking up she saw that Robin was once again stroking her with her finger, something which soothed the tiny navigator. Seeing that she was calm Robin continued unbuttoning her blouse. Nami just had to sit back and watch as her gigantic friend undressed before her very eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin first undidnher blouse and slowly took it off revealing her ginormous boobs they were barely being held by a sexy looking black bra. Nami was awestruck, Robins tits were huge!!!! No calling them huge was an understatement they were collossal!!!! Robin saw Nami essentially gawking at the sight of her lustrous orbs and smiled before speaking. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cCareful now Ms Navigator if you keep staring like that you\u2019ll go blind hihi\u201d</b> Robin teases her tiny friend even more by winking at the end of her sentence which made the tiny Nami blush beyond red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin continued undressing, she took off her shoes, her bracelets and necklaces before she finally got to the main event. Slowly and incredibly seductively she began taking off her pants. Her long silky smooth legs were stuff of dream and then there wan her huge perfectly toned ass that was being partially hidden by a sexy little black pair of underwear that matched her bra. Nami could feel herself getting more turned on by the second, the sight of her titanic Archeologist was the vision of absolute perfection!!!! Then without saying a word Robin plucked Nami from the table and carried her over to the bed where Robin decided to get a little more concortable and laid on her back with her head resting slightly on her pillow. Robin then looked at the tiny navigator who was looking up at her with both lust and fear at what she was feeling. Robin seeing this decided she would put her friends mind at ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNow now Nami there\u2019s no need to be shy, we both know this is only because of the statues curse. I just felt that since you had such a rough day you needed to unwind a little. Don\u2019t worry this\u2019ll just be our little secret Ok? Hihi\u201d </b> Nami not even caring now it\u2019s looked decided to throw caution to the wind and nodded at Robin who simply smiled in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s see...where should we start...Oh I know!\u201d Robin exclaimed in excitement <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then lowered her hand and placed the diminutive redhead between her collossal tits. Upon being placed her Nami shrieked out of pure happiness. She didn\u2019t even care if she was showing how she felt, she had had a very stressful day and she needed to let lose. Nami simply began hugging and kissing the soft pal flesh of Robin\u2019s massive breasts. Each boob was easilly the size of a small Hill to Nami and she loved that she could feel them with her whole body!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin seeing how much Nami was enjoying herself decided to get on on the fun too and made a small suggestion to Nami. <b>\u201cSeems like you\u2019re having a good time Nami. If I recall there was somewhere on my breast that you preferred over anywhere else. But I can\u2019t put finger on it hmmm\u201d</b> Robin then began tapping on her boob, right where her nipple was. Getting the message immedietly Nami lit up and began climbing the tit hill as Robin slowly took her boob out of her bra cup and exposed it for the tiny Nami to see. Without even thinking Nami latched herself onto to Robin\u2019s nipple and began sucking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was taken aback at how good it felt to have such a tiny woman sucking on her nipple. Nami was double the size she was before and as a result she wasn\u2019t able to such much much more th a Shenzhen had previously, in fact with her new size Robin could actually feel and enjoy every second of Nami\u2019s sucking. Whilst Nami was focusing on her right nipple Robin used her devil fruit powers to sprout another arm that ripped off her bra, finally free from her restraints Robin began rubbing her left nipple making sure that her entire breast knocked into her other which made it harder for Nami to keep a hold of her other nipple. But Nami was strong and she wouldn\u2019t let something like that stop her from pleasuring Robin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Robin lowered her free hand down towards her womanhood and within seconds Robin was furiously pleasuring herself with her fingers pumping in and out of her Pussy as she began to moan in pleasure. Seeing how much enjoyment her friend was getting Nami decided to up the pleasure. Ripping off her underwear but keeping her skirt on Nami rubbed her exposed pussy onto the tip of Robin\u2019s huge nipple which in return made Nami begin to moan in pleasure and ecstasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes both women reached their climax and stomped as their pussies dripped in the juices of a job well done. Panting and out of breath both women looked at each other with pure satisfaction. After a few more minutes Robin lifted Nami from between her massive breasts. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWow I have to say Nami I didn\u2019t know you were capable of such things. I\u2019m impressed little one hihi\u201d </b>Robin smiled as Nami hugged her friends finger. The two then..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the first rays of sunshine shone through the curtains of the bedroom, the light creeped onto the bed of the grand palace guest room, there laid a beautiful raven haired beauty whose gorgeous lucious body was only half covered by the bedsheets. As the warm glow continued to travel up the bed it made its way all the way onto the pretty pale face of the Straw Hat Pirates Archeologist Nico Robin. Slowly stirring she opened her eyes and took in the sunshine, that\u2019s when she noticed something else stirring, looking down to inbetween her enormous breasts she remembered she had a passenger, nestled Inbetween her bountiful cleavage was her fellow crewmate the equally stunning and currently 1 inch tall red head Nami. Robin smiled as she saw her begin to wake whilst rolling from side to side accidentally feeling up each of her breasts, after a few seconds Nami woke up and stretched her arms out as she yawned, it was then that she noticed the smiling form of her towering friend smiling down on her, Nami smiled back but after a few seconds she realised where she was and what her and Robin had done the previous night...as a result Nami began blushing bright red in pure embarrassment. Robin noticed this and laughed as she lowered her tree trunk sized finger to stroke Nami\u2019s Head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Soooooo last night happened...\u201d </b> Robin innocently mused. Even though she was fine with everything she did understand the awkwardness of the situation and was doing her best to make Nami feel better about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami coyly looked up at Robin with her cheeks still bright red, upon seeing her gigantic friend smiling down on her and stroking her head she slowly started losing the red that was spread on her face. Nami was embarrassed but st the same time she knew she had had a great time with Robin, both of them knew it was only because of the statues curse that Nami had acted that way, but still the fact that Robin took it upon herself to do that for her really meant a lot especially after the day she had had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Yeah...last night definitely happened...thanks for...tending to my needs I guess...\u201d</b> Nami once again blushed bright red as she though back to the exact details of their night together. Robin once again smiled as she quickly chimed in to ease her tiny navigators mind. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Nami, What happened last night was purely to exonerate the ill side effects of your curse. Plus with the days you are set to endure as the Snake Princesses servant you\u2019ll need a way to unwind at the end of the day, so that\u2019s where I come In. I\u2019ll take care of yours and by proxy my sexual needs and no one will be none the wiser Ok hihi\u201d </b>Nami paused for a second almost as if she was trying to come up with an argument for Robin\u2019s statement but was unable to find one and simply sighed as she fell backwards into her fleshy mamary pillow.  \u201cWell as long as on one else knows I guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt\u201d. What Nami and Robin would never know was that the guard who was placed at their door all night had heard everything and was half confused and half aroused by what she had heard in the room. Marguerite simply had to stand stone faced until she was relieved of duty as she herself thought about her own sexual needs, but that\u2019s a story for another time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami then realised that she was still in Robin\u2019s ginormous cleavage and more so was still a little moist and sticky downstairs. As a result she had Robin take them to the bathroom so that both could shower and rinse off last nights love juices. After their shower the two got changed (Nami was glad her clothes had grown with her) and Robin placed her into her cleavage once more as they left for the Snake empresses room so that Nami could go back to serving the Boa Hancock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking on her door Robin took Nami out of her cleavage and within seconds was depositing her onto the open palm of Boa Hancock\u2019s hand who swiftly closed her bedroom door. Nami then got set for another day of torture. Hancock decided that she would </span></div></div>",

But Nami was willing to endure anything that this empress threw at her, she was determined to regain her original height and right now the only thing that could help her do that was serving this amazon. Hancock then sat down on her throne with Nami still in her hand and began tapping on her chin with her free hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNow What will I have you do today little one...I could have you rub my feet again, that was quite pleasant. I could have you feed me that would definitely at the very least be entertaining. Hmmmm what will I have to do?\u201d  </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami stood anxiously awaiting what this gargantuan woman would have her do. If it was anything like yesterday she was in for a rough day, but at the very least it would mean she gets to unwind with Robin again tonight! Nami blushed as these sexual thoughts entered her head but it was short lived as she was interrupted by her titanic owner. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cOooh I know! Now as empress even though I have an abundance of servants who would do anything for me, it does mean that I do not reward those who have proven themselves worthy to me. So today you shall not only be serving me but also one of my devoted subjects and crewmate\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock then placed the 1 inch Nami down onto the armrest of her throne as she stood up to her full intimidating height and cleared her throat. <b>\u201cMarguerite! Come in at once!\u201d</b> Hancock belllowed. Within seconds the throne room doors burst open and in came a pretty blonde amazon by the name of Marguerite. She approached Hancock nervously and kneeled before her once she was close enough. With butterflies in her stomach the smaller amazon began speaking nervously. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cY-y-you Called my empress?\u201d </b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Yes. In light of recent events I have come to realise that besides my sisters you are in fact the finest warrior on my pirate crew\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarguerite blushed as she heard these words, almost being unable to fully grasp the compliment she had received. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cOh no you are too kind my beautiful Empress, to even be on tourney crew is an honor in itself thank you!\u201d </b><br>\r\nHancock smiled, she appreciated the genuine love and respect her subject had for her, yes she was indeed worthy of a reward. Albeit it (she looks over at Nami) a small one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell regardless I believe you are in for a reward so today I shall allow you the honor of sharing my tiny slave with me\u201d </b> with that said Hancock reached down and plucked Nami from the armrest who didn\u2019t even flinch as she was used to being picked up without consent, Hancock then held out her hand and showed her to Marguerite who stood up flabbergasted at what she was seeing, her empress had a tiny woman in her hand! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami just sighed as she looked up at the billboard sized face of the blond amazon whose eyes were shining as if she was looking at diamonds. Hancock noticed her subjects intrigued and decided it was time to start the servitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cNow my sweet little Marguerite today you will get to experience the services that this tiny woman can provide and I shall be_________\u201d </b></span></div></div>",

It was bad enough that she was an inch tall and serving a gigantic love sick empress, but now she had to serve both her and her sexually curious subordinate. But if this is what it took to regain her regular size then she would put up with it, who knows maybe she would have an easier time with a different amazon. Or it could be twice as worse since Handock was still here so she wasn\u2019t exactly going to get her hopes up. She was however getting more and more agitated by Marguerite staring at her like she was fine jewelry, and after several more seconds she finally snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWILL YOU STOP STARING AT ME YOU BLOND BIMBO!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami\u2019s outburst took Marguerite my surprise, she didn\u2019t expect the tiny woman in her hand to have such a loud voice. However even though Marguerite was shocked and a little bit frightened of what she had said there was still the warlord who had dealt with these outbursts before. Without saying a word Hancock simply took her fingers a flicked Nami right off of Marguerite\u2019s hand and sent her flying through the air til she luckily landed softly on Hancock\u2019s bed. Hancock meanwhile turned and addressed her shocked subordinate. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cNow Marguerite if the little shrimp ever gives you lip again then you simply need to remind her of her place. She is a small insignificant little bug that is lucky to be in our presence, and we will not hesitate to hurt her or even get rid of her shood she not learn her lesson. Ok?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarguerite nodded as her empress essentially laid down the law. Meanwhile on the bed Nami was recovering from her painful flight, even though the landing didn\u2019t hurt the impact of Hancock\u2019s fingers striking her definitely did, so as Nami laid there clutching her body and reevaluating all of her life choices she began to think back to the wonderful night she had spent with Robin and how all she had to do was get through today and then she would be reunited with her friend later tonight. At this thought Nami blushed and tried to get them out of her head, to her relief Hancock and Marguerite soon descended upon her and gave her her first task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOk little one your first task shall be to paint both mine and sweet little Marguerite\u2019s toes. Given your size I should say that you should be able handle it, now you may not be able to hold a brush but I\u2019m sure your little hands will be able to rub a sufficient layer of nail polish in each toe. Now given I am the empress you shall start on my glorious toes, so Marguerite please fetch the polish whilst I get our little servant ready for her job\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock then used her tree trunk like fingers to pluck Nami off of her bed and place her in her open palm, she then walked over to her throne like chair and sat down before she placed Nami at her feet. Flicking off her high heels Hancock flexed her enormous toes in front of Nami who gulped at how big they were. Nami had to be roughly the same size as Hancock\u2019s biggest toe nail if not a bit smaller. Marguerite soon arrived with a red bottle of nail polish and being the kinder amazon she even opened it and poured the contents onto a small dish, she then took her position on the stool next to Hancock\u2019s throne and watched as Nami started her tedious chore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami looked at the massive foot in front of her, even though it had been exposed to a high heel all day it smelled like perfection and had a hint of roses. But it was still an enormous foot that was easilly bigger than Nami\u2019s own feet when she was normal size, sighing she covered her hands with nail polish and got to work starting with Hancock\u2019s big toe. Nail rubbed and rubbed the nail polish on Hancock\u2019s toe for what felt like hours, to her misery it had only been ten minutes and she had only done one toe. She then moved onto the rest of Hancock\u2019s toes as the Snake princess commended on her work form above. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it little one keep going, if you keep up this pace you might be done with my feet by lunch time. And worry not Marguerite you\u2019ll have your turn soon enough so just relax and enjoy the show.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock then wiggled her toes which made Nami lose balance and slip causing her to get covered in the red toe polish. Hancock saw this and began laughing ecstatically as Marguerite smiled and even let out a giggle. Nami was infuriated and was seconds away from yelling at Hancock before she remembered the pain she was still in from her last outburst. Biting her tongue she resumed her tedious work and finshed uo on Hancock\u2019s foot beofre she switched over to her other foot. The work on this one went just as smoothly with Hancock still playing her games and a nami ending up covered with more red nail polish. Finally after what seemed like an enternity Nami finished painting Hancock\u2019s toes and collapsed onto her back panting and out of breath. However her break was short lived as Hancock interrupted her. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHmmm Well little bug I\u2019d say you did an adequate job. But I expect much better for my sweet little Marguerite here so get to work NOW.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock then looked down evilly at Nami who shot back up instantly and dragging the dish of nail polish with her (in an amazing feat of strength nonetheless) and made her way to Marguerite\u2019s feet. Marguerite quickly removed her sandals and moved her feet closer to Nami. Hancock saw how timid she was being and addressed her subordinate. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cNow now Sweet little Marguerite no need to be so shy. This is your time so enjoy it, don\u2019t worry about over working that little bug just treat her like I\u2019ve done and you\u2019ll be fine. Isn't that right Shrimp?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami nervously nodded as she made her way onto Marguerite\u2019s toes and began her work. Now Marguerite\u2019s feet were much smaller than Hancock\u2019s and this was good work load wise but on the other hand they didn\u2019t smell nearly as nice as Hancock\u2019s. Nami then spread more red nail polish onto her toes and as she did so Marguerite decided to indulge in Hancock\u2019s games and started wiggling her toes in order to make Nami\u2019s that much harder for her. But Nami persevered and finshed painting the blond Amazon\u2019s toes. Exhausted but victorious Nami collapsed once more as Hancock and Marguerite expected her handiwork. To her surprise both were sufficiently impressed Marguerite being more pleased than her empress. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cOh wow this you so much!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mixed feelings arose as Nami recognized her shipmate and near friend Nico Robin to be the giantess. On one hand, it was wonderful that it was not only a friend, but one who was both perfectly reasonable and kind. On the other\u2026well she didn't exactly know Nami was where she was. A slight misstep and the brunette would crush the shrunken woman like a bug beneath her boot. And Nami was so small she probably wouldn't even feel the crack of her bones shattering\u2026It made her shudder just to think about it. There was no time to waste; she needed to get Robin's attention before something bad happens, which, as she learned from being in this crew, wasn't going to take long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin! Down here! It's me Nami!\" The red-head shouted at the top of her lungs and jumped to and fro. This end of the dock was near empty so there were no other sounds other than the ocean\u2026but that was pretty much it. The ocean was loud enough to blot out anything Nami could've ever hoped to shout, though that didn't stop her from trying. Robin was observant. She'd notice something\u2026she hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"ROBIN!!!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot so far away, the beauty that was Nico Robin casually strode towards the chest she had found in front of the ship she'd heard of in town. Like Nami, she too switched out of her bikini she was wearing on the Thousand Sunny and donned a more appropriate attire. This outfit was the same one she wore when she was in Enies Lobby, a leather one-piece outfit with some white frills on a the edges, that had a skirt that barely covered her hips and exposed a wide array of cleavage, matched by a pair of thigh-high black boots. A smile came upon her face as she found what she was looking for. Word back in the town was that this ship was carrying ancient artifacts from the Lost Century; which, if that were true, may hold clues towards the Poneglyphs. It wasn't particularly hard to find the ship without sails, nor was it hard to find the chest. It sat right in front of the ship after all. It was already open so Robin expected it to be empty, but as she got closer it became clear that inside were a couple of small statues, carved out of what had to be some ancient wood. Wiping her brow of some sweat before hand, the archaeologist knelt down to investigate, when something in front of the chest caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What's that?\" She reached down to pick up this small object in front of the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami'd been screaming for Robin's attention almost a straight three minutes now, and the giantess still showed no signs of having heard even the slightest of sounds. She seemed too focused on her thoughts and the chest's contents to really notice anything. But then Robin wiped some sweat from her forehead and began to bend over. This was great! Up close she had to be able to hear the shrunken pleas of her friend. Finding some inner strength at this, Nami raised her voice even higher and continued her shouts. And it might have worked. If not for something she didn't count on\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SPLASH</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge bead of water the size of a bathtub suddenly landed on Nami, knocking the girl flat on her face again as its salty taste worked its way into her eyes and mouth. It was one of those things where you realize right away what had happened, and Nami hit herself for the lack of foresight. Robin wiped some sweat from her brow\u2026obviously that sweat had to go somewhere. The water-soaked Nami realized that now. She stuck out her tongue and rubbed it to try and get the salty taste of Robin's sweat out of there, not even trying to think about the disgusting aspects of it. Unfortunately, this also doubled as a means of shutting Nami up. Her cries had stopped as she tried to work out this unexpected situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as this clicked in Nami's head her ears were once again deafened by the giant sounds Robin made. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"Hmm? What's that?\" </font>Rubbing more sweat from her eyes, Nami began to cheer as she saw Robin reaching for\u2026.something else in front of the chest\u2026Dammit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What's a girl got to do to get noticed around here?! </i>She stomped her foot as she began to fume. The red-head prepared to start shouting again\u2026when she noticed what Robin had grabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the same statue Nami grabbed, apparently dropped on the ground when she shrank. The statue that may have made her half of an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin! No!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late; Robin already had her hands wrapped around the object as she brought it up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of any impending danger, Robin carefully brought the small statue to her face to study it, using extra caution not to damage such a small carving. It was fascinating. It had nothing to do with Poneglyphs. But it was fascinating. Such a small piece of ancient art\u2026half an inch tall\u2026yet carved so well. The carving techniques resembled some of the techniques used in ancient Skypiean artifacts\u2026though the wood was more akin to what could be found on the ground\u2026It was reminiscent of the trees used in Amazon Lily. This could indicate the possibility the two had some sort of connection at some point, or that maybe they had a common link in their pasts. There were so many possibilities. But it was too early to say anything, this was all speculation based on how it looked. There'd need to be analysis on various things before anything conclusive could be done. If the chest was already outside the owners likely didn't want the statues anyway. After investigating the ship and any artifacts there, Robin would take the statues back and do some research with them later when she had free time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch was the plan, until the woman realized the statue the size of her fingernail was now the size of her finger. Her face hid any emotion but Robin was indeed surprised. Her eyes shifted to the chest, which originally came at knee level, but now sat right at Robin's stomach. The answer was very simple to come to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm shrinking.\" It was stated as fact, with no tone behind it at all. But Robin was indeed alarmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process was happening so fast that in another couple seconds the statue became big enough to match Robin's hand, and it continued to seem to get bigger until finally Robin just placed it on the ground. No need for the artifact to suffer damage after all. She looked around for anyone who may have been able to help. No one in sight (Not that people in a pirate town would've helped anyway) But at the very least it made things simple to process. She was shrinking; there was no use to throw a fit about it. All Robin could do was wait until the whole process was done with and she could act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm\u2026What if I shrink into nothing though?</i> She thought morbidly. The chest was now as big as Robin was tall, and growing bigger with each millisecond. The final moments of the shrinking seemed to finish the process in one big burst. Robin was a foot tall now, but it seemed the moment she blinked, she was half that, and the next moment, half an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as the process stopped, she was grabbed from behind. Instinctively Robin readied to attack. She turned her head to see her attacker, instead only seeing the nearly tearing eyes of her friend Nami. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shrunk too?\" A moment later everything began to click, \"\u2026You were stealing the chest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami nodded to both, \"Yeah, I thought there was treasure. But instead I ended up like this! It's all that stupid statue's fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. I wonder how it did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares?!\" Nami cried, \"I just want to go back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. But how should we do so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami released her friend, \"Well, I hate to say it\u2026But I think we need to find the guys for some help. It's either that or wait until someone comes and finds us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nodded, \"I agree. Without anyone normal-sized we're quite helpless. Someone could step on us and mistake us for ants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mere thought was enough to make Nami depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still have my Hana Hana No Mi powers though. That will surely prove useful. What about your weapon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami started laughing nervously, \"I uh\u2026left it on the ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too big to use then. Regardless, we need a plan of action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't agree more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of discussion, Robin and Nami decide to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Robin began walking towards their ship with Nami tailing not far behind. Nami looked at the ground, she was able to make out cracks, holes, and crumbs of things that people normally couldn't see. It was like a whole new world that she stepped into, almost nothing was recognizable when she had walked down these docks earlier.<br>\r\n\"Robin, what do we do if someone decides to walk in our general area, like, what do we do?\" She asked tilting her head at the calm headed woman.<br>\r\n\"We run, hide, move out of the way. Those seem like pretty good ideas.\" She replied without so much as even glancing at her. Nami sighed, that wasn't very reassuring to the girl.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess. So do yo think we'll ever get back to normal?\" Nami asked trying to make the walk seem not as long and boring.<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Robin replied again in the same manner she had answered the other question. Nami frowned in disapproval.<br>\r\n\"How are you calm about this? We're smaller than... alot of things! We could be crushed by the most insignificant object and you are still calm? If someone wanted to, they could crush us with thier pinky toe, with room to spare! Also a bird could pick us up, an insect could east us, a foot can-\"<br>\r\n\"Step on us.\" Robin said stopping and looking up into the sky.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, exactly, now you get i-\" Nami was cut mid sentence and was pulled by her bra strap, then two seconds later, a gigantic purple heel had stepped where Nami would have been standing. Nami was in awe of the monolicthic giant, that happened to be someone's footwear. She looked back at her savior, Robin smiled at Nami, knowing she was in her debt. Nami scuffed it off and looked away. \"You didn't have to pull my strap so hard...\" Nami mumbled, which was followed by a folding of her arms.<br>\r\n\"Your welcome Nami...\" Robin said with a slight grin.<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"> What is my chest doing out here?</font>\" A booming, godlike, but still feminine, voice asked no one in particular. Robin and Nami looked up, but that was much use, there was a set of planetary sized breats blocking the view of the woman. <br>\r\n\"I wonder who that can be?\" Robin asked Nami rubbing her chin in curiousity. Nami shrugged.<br>\r\n\"It sounds like who ever it is, owns the chest...\" <br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">Great, now I got speck sized idiot running around, and they had to grab the smallest one!</font>\" The monolithic being began to bend over and extend it's arm. Soon Robin and Nami were engulfed in an immense shadow that was the woman's hand. The hand gently plucked the small wooden statue up from the dock floors and dropped it carelessly back into the chest, which she then sealed shut with her other hand. <br>\r\nThe shrunken duo now had a perfect view of the woman's face, and both had mixed opinions about the woman.<br>\r\n\"Great, someone who could help us.\" Robin said with a smile on her face, Nami however wasn't so relieved. <br>\r\n\"It's the love sick, I'm so pretty, amazon queen\" She said with an annoyed tone. Robin looked towards her sternly.<br>\r\n\"Wether you like it or not, she's our only hope.\" Nami stuck her tounge out at the black haired beauty.<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't trust this love blinded idiot, even if she is the only one. She would probably hold us for ransom only to give us back for Luffy's hand in marrige. I don't trust the bitch queen!\"<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">Well that wasn't very kind of you speck girl...</font>\" The two looked back up at Hancock to see that she had crouched down and had listened to thier whole conversation.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was one face neither Robin or Nami ever expected to see again, especially so far in the Grand Line. Miss Valentine, still dressed in her bright yellow dress, yellow cap, yellow earrings in white heels while carrying a yellow umbrella, all of it save for the shoes and umbrella, decorated with various lemon themes. She didn't look any different than the last time Nami and Robin saw her, she still resembled a giant lemon. Except, this giant lemon was their enemy. A sadistic, giant, snobby, enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami was essentially screaming her head off as Robin calmly eyed the coming giantess with slight nervous sweat. \"What is she doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares?! This chick hates us and now she's big enough to crush us like bugs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think ants would be more appropriate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Not</b> the point!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good several miles away (To the shrunken duo) Miss Valentine stepped before the chest in front of the ship she was using. The chest wasn't where she left it\u2026And it was open. The blonde frowned as she smelled a thief. But she knew one thing about those statues the thief sure didn't. A small smile formed on her face as she imagined how frantic they'd be after shrinking. Taking a few steps forward Miss Valentine casually peered into the chest, inside were the two bigger statues. Which meant the thief must've picked up the smallest one first. The grin the woman had grew even bigger. The smallest statue was exactly a half of an inch tall, with shrinking effects ranging from half an inch to a quarter of an inch. At that size, the thief couldn't have gotten too far.<i> Looks like I'll get to handle them personally.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a couple of steps back, Miss Valentine looked to the ground before the chest. Right beside it was the small statue that was almost stolen, and about a foot away from that\u2026two shrunken people. The woman grinned as she raised a foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back and forth between Nami and Robin went on as Miss Valentine approached, mainly consisting of Nami screaming and panicking and Robin trying to figure out what to do. Neither of them had a proper plan of action as the white heels of the giantess loomed overhead. Nami's cries came to a screeching halt as a foot as big as a building was directly over her head, and coming down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was first to react, instinctively using her Hana Hana no mi powers to create several arms off of her main two, giving herself enough strength to fling just far enough away to be considered safe. Unfortunately, right as Robin landed she remembered Nami, and turned to see the girl too stunned to move. Miss Valentine's foot was less than ten feet away from her and seemed almost fifty feet wide, nothing could be done. All she could do was shout. \"Nami!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami, staring at the dirt and grime of Miss Valentine's shoe, seemed transfixed. Was she really about to die like the dirt under her foot? Would this be it? Robin's shout disrupted these thoughts as the red-head returned to reality. Nami turned to her friend just in time for Miss Valentine's foot to make contact with the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>BOOM!!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had enough force to crush Nami in an instant, but it seemed she had luck on her side. Miss Valentine's heel's sole touched the ground, as did the heel itself, but the space in between was completely empty, and in that space, was Nami. The casual footstep of the giantess made a hurricane of dirt and dust that further messed up the treasure hunter's appearance. The next second the smoke cleared, and out of it came Nami, running into Robin's relieved grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had me worried there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe happy moment was short-lived as the duo looked back to Miss Valentine, who was now peering into the treasure chest. Just peering, not picking up anything. Almost like she knew what would happen if she did\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Robin\u2026\" Nami began, \"What do you think are the odds this ship and chest belong to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin thought for a moment, \"Considering she hasn't made the same mistake we made, I'd say rather high.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as Robin said this; Miss Valentine backtracked three steps and looked to the ground. At that moment it was very obvious she knew. The next instant, her eyes locked onto the two girls and her right foot rose high into the air as she smiled maliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what I do to little Ants that try to take my stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than a second she stomped the two as hard as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Valentine laughed out her signature laugh as she twisted her heel into the dirt to grind the thieves as best she could. \"Kyahahahaha! How's that feel you little pests?\" She removed her foot from the ground to look at them. Both were still alive. With her Kilo Kilo no Mi abilities Miss Valentine reduced her weight to a mere 10 Kilograms. It was a weight perfect for stomping shrunken people, because it still hurt like hell, but it didn't kill them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet you're surprised to be alive huh? You can thank the Kilo Kilo no Mi for that. Though by the time I'm done, I doubt you'll be thankful.\" The evil smile the blonde had only grew worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I start though I want to see what you two look like. From up here I can't see anything but two dots.\" Slowly the woman bent over to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt as if someone like Luffy punched both Nami and Robin. It carried almost superhuman force, but it wasn't enough to kill the two in a single shot. Granted, a few bones were likely cracked, and both of them were embedded into the dirt, deep enough in it they couldn't move and were helpless. From the ground they grunted and moaned in pain and slowly opened their eyes to the looming form of Miss Valentine, who was honestly too tall to fully comprehend. She looked almost\u2026three times bigger than Oars at least. With legs tall enough to be considered mountains and a chest that made Nami feel so inadequate. Hers were bigger, but at the moment, not anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"Bet you're surprised to be alive huh? You can thank the Kilo Kilo no Mi for that. Though by the time I'm done, I doubt you'll be thankful. Before I start though I want to see what you two look like. From up here I can't see anything but two dots.\" </font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Valentine knelt down so that her head was more visible. Up close recognition shined in her giant eyes as she saw the two familiar forms that were Nami and Robin. At first she looked surprised, but that look changed almost instantly to another grin, one much scarier than the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was too perfect. Nami, member of the Straw Hats who humiliated Miss Valentine and took down Baroque Works, and Nico Robin, traitor to Baroque Works. The two women Miss Valentine couldn't stand the most, and now they were a quarter of an inch tall. At her mercy. \"Well well well, What do you know? Funny running into you here little ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the ground it was clear Nami was getting increasingly fearful, Robin however, remained stoic. Though she also had to be nervous. \"I bet you two are wondering why I'm here too. So far out in the Grandline. Do you want to know why?\" The smile turned to a frown instantly, \"<b>Because of you bastards</b>!!\" Her voice carried enough wind to blow a gust into the duo's faces. Miss Valentine's expression returned to normal after a quick breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the whole thing at Alabasta Baroque Works went down, and with it, my money; so guess what I had to do? Face the real world as an outlaw. For what? We were told we were making a better world. I had to do a lot of sneaking around and after a while, I thought I managed to get my dream job as a Chocolate Lady. But guess how that lasted? It <i>didn't!\" </i>In about a month the Marines came knocking on our doors, and I had to take off running again! Now look at me, I'm doing whatever I can to earn some money. Like, for example, delivering dangerous artifacts in a cruddy boat.\" Miss Valentine shuffled her foot so that it was hovering over the shrunken duo embedded in the dirt. \"I've hit rock bottom, and it's all because of you and your stupid crew!\" With the foot she had over them Miss Valentine stomped them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the dirt came Nami's voice shouting a question. \"What did we do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Valentine frowned, \"Yeah, Baroque Works turned out to be a pretty bad organization. Sure, Crocodile lied and used all of us. But guess what? It was a hell of a job and it paid well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crocodile was only using you!\" This time it was Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Valentine responded with another stomp, \"Like I care. Listen, the world could rot for all I care. So long as I have my own little life of luxury I couldn't care less what happens to anyone else.\" A moment passed and Miss Valentine went on, \"You took away my luxurious life so you two are going to do your best to give me one to make up for it. You got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Nami or Robin replied, largely because they didn't know exactly what they could say. The giant fingers of Miss Valentine plucked them from the ground and held them in front of her face. \"From now on, you two are my personal little <i>slaves! </i><b>Kyahahaha</b>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow shall Miss Valentine introduce her two slaves to their lives?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't take long for Miss Valentine to make use of the two Straw Hat women. Currently they are stuck hanging on to Miss Valentine's lemon shaped earrings. Robin and Nami were on separate earrings holding on to dear life as Miss Valentine made herself light as a feather to glide through the air and head towards her boat that acts as her home. A boat that has served her well since her Chocolate Lady business was busted by the Marines. Swiftly Miss Valentine increased her weight and started to fall. The cold wind passing through the shrunken frames of Nami and Robin was such that they closed their eyes as Miss Valentine was speedily descending. They didn't even notice Miss Valentine enter her boat home and only opened their eyes when they both felt Miss Valentine's hands pluck them from her earrings and placing them on a white surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female duo looked around and saw that they were on a kitchen counter. Next to them was a bowl of chocolate pudding that shone with the light above and looking delicious. But rather than focusing on the dessert Nami and Robin continued to look around and saw that for all intents and purposes they were in a normal kitchen with a refrigerator, a kitchen sink, oven etc. Their attention was drawn yet again to the woman that held them hostage who proceeded to announce:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my humble abode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, as soon as Miss Valentine said this she took a step to the side to be in front of the bowl of chocolate pudding she had prepared prior to finding the two shrunken women. That delectable piece of goodness that she made reminded her of her dream. The dream that seemed like it was coming true, but was shot down thanks to misfortune. Miss Valentine had her hopes ruined and turning to the side so that Nami and Robin don't see it she shut her eyes and put on a pained expression, though she dared not to cry as she's not the type to show weakness. \"<i>I'm going to make them pay...!</i>\" thought the former employee of Baroque Works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid Miss Valentine as she faced Nami and Robin. \"Its time for you to start paying me back for costing me everything including my dream. I'm going to work you two like dogs!\" said Miss Valentine \"How about we start with-\" \"Never!\" shouted the hot headed red head. Nami had no patience for nonsense and there's no way she's going to be reduced to being someone else's slave. Nami has always been a bit on the proud side. Robin on the other hand knew first hand just how sadistic Miss Valentine was due to them working in the same organization in the past. \"Nami hush...!\" Robin tried to say, but Nami didn't stop. The short tempered navigator opened her mouth to say \"I don't care about what you want or your failed dream! I'd rather perish than be subjected to your whims!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing such offensive words aimed at her failed dream was the straw the broke the camel's back. Forming a fist Miss Valentine slammed it with intense ferocity on the kitchen counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BAM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCame the loud sound with a shaking side effect after the impact. Both Nami and Robin lost their footing and fell to their knees. \"How dare you...\" came a notably bitter Miss Valentine. Robin immediately stood and understanding just how grave the situation was pleaded \"She doesn't mean it! Give her another--\" \"Quiet!\" ordered Miss Valentine. If looks could kill, then anyone who came into Miss Valentine's sights would be nothing more than a corpse for nothing compared to the look of pure concentrated vitriol that she had at the moment. This rebellious young woman has overstepped her boundaries and now she's going to be judged harshly for it. On the other hand if Nami lost her life, Miss Valentine would be short one slave and she'd be taking the easy way out, what will the sadistic lemon themed woman do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her dream being insulted was an offense far too emotionally hurtful to bear. Concentrating her gaze on Nami Ms. Valentine pulled a surprise move when she shot her gloved hand towards Robin. Once Robin was engulfed in Ms. Valentine's hand, the sadistic blonde giantess lowered Robin to the floor of her home. \"<i>I need to restrain the one that has a Devil Fruit.</i>\" thought the sadistic woman. Once placed face up on the floor Robin felt a shadow above her. Before she could react she felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Boom!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sole of the white heel fell on Robin. It covered most of her body except from her chest all the way to her head. Her arms were unfortunately pinned and being crushed painfully under the sole of Ms Valentine's high heel. \"<i>She targeted me knowing I'd be the one who can put up the most resistan--</i>\" \"AHH!\" gasped Robin as she felt Ms. Valentine send a wave of pain by firmly planting her heel on her tiny form. \"Robin!\" exclaimed a worried Nami. Before she could make another move she found herself painfully grasped and squeezed into Ms Valentine's gloved hand. \"Agh!\" coughed Nami struggling to breathe and unable to struggle as Ms. Valentine wasn't going to allow her to do a single thing. Nami could feel her very own breasts painfully pressing inward into her lungs. No doubt they will be sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow Nami heard a scraping sound. Struggling to turn her neck she saw the bowl of chocolate pudding. Getting a rough idea of what Ms. Valentine planned to do Nami was struck by a twinge of fear for her own life. \"<i>No!..No!</i>\" thought the desperate young woman who opened her mouth to scream \"N-\" only to have her words be muffled as her shirt covered her mouth and was in the process of being removed. Taking advantage of the shock Nami received Ms. Valentine eased her grip ever so slightly to allow her free hand to start removing Nami's shirt. It was over in an instant for Nami was left with her breasts exposed. As Nami suspected earlier being squeezed with such intensity did leave her breasts with purple marks and sore spots. A slight chill overtook her body, but Ms. Valentine was far from done as she used excessive force on Nami's pants and within moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami's pants were ripped directly from her. Ms Valentine immediately dropped Nami's clothes to the ground where Robin managed to see. Not wanting to imagine what Ms. Valentine had planned for Nami, Robin closes her eyes as the heel's sole continued to keep her firmly in place on the floor. \"Please stop!\" begged Nami who was now hanging by her strained arm that was being held between the cruel giantess' thumb and index finger. Ignoring her pleas Ms. Valentine smiled with glee and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take my job as a Chocolate Lady very seriously. After all it was my passion, but what am I saying? You be the judge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami was mercilessly dunked into the chocolate pudding as soon as Ms. Valentine finished talking. She was fully submerged into the gooey substance that was sticking to her naked body. The layers of chocolate pudding were warm and soft. Even though her life was in danger, Nami couldn't help but wonder if this chocolate dish was freshly made. Nami felt herself rising and was soon enough pulled out of the bowl. Once out Nami gasped and coughed trying her best to get some fresh air, but all she could get was air that was scented with the smell of chocolate due to how her body is covered in the stuff. Soon, Nami heard Ms. Valentine say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How disappointing, you were holding your breath. Well don't you dare worry, that can be fixed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before re-inserting Nami into the bowl. This time Ms.Valentine made sure to tease Nami's very lungs by leaving her eyes above the surface of the chocolate pudding while her nose and mouth were without a doubt completely enveloped in chocolate. Nami tried just as before to hold her breath, but with Ms. Valentine now fully aware of her tactic, there was no fooling her. It didn't take long for Nami's lungs to start aching and her head to start to feel lightheaded. She needed air! But with no way to breathe fresh air Nami gave up and opened her mouth only to be filled with the chocolate substance that surrounded her. The ecstatic taste of cocoa beans invaded her nostrils and assaulted Nami's shrunken taste buds. Even she had to admit that Ms. Valentine produced quality chocolate dishes, but taste aside she seriously needed to draw breath before she suffocates. So she started to shake her head in an agitated manner. Luck was on her side as she was raised up high in front of Ms. Valentine's sharp eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Valentine studied her handiwork and saw the poor young woman she submerged into the chocolate pudding. Nami was convulsing wildly as she hung from her strained arm, desperately trying to get some air into her lungs. Ms. Valentine's free hand came near Nami's face. Her free hand's index and thumb pinched her cheeks forcing Nami to open her mouth. With that Ms. Valentine took a look inside Nami's mouth. Even though she was a shrunk, Ms. Valentine could see the inside of Nami's cheeks and just as planned they were filled with chocolate pudding. \"<i>No doubt, she has tasted my work...</i>\" thought the giantess. Retracting her fingers from Nami's mouth and putting a bit of distance between herself and the hand that held Nami in front of her, Ms. Valentine asked in a stern tone of voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how would you rate that chocolate pudding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami's throat was full of chocolate that she was desperately trying to cough out. Swallowing some and coughing out the rest, Nami was finally able to breathe normally. Never in her worst nightmares did she expect to put through something like this. She heard Ms. Valentine the first time and not wanting to risk angering her, Nami opened her mouth and said what she felt when her taste buds collided with the dessert \"The chocolate dish you made...it was good. No. It was very good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot detecting any tone of a lie, Ms. Valentine showed a dominant smile. She knew that she's gotten through to Nami on some level. However, new thoughts have begun to enter the lemon dressed woman's mind. This short tempered red head has given her some trouble. And she is covered in delicious chocolate pudding, enough so to be bite sized snack. \"<i>Should I forgive her? Or should I dispose of her?</i>\" thought Ms. Valentine...</span></div></div>",

Not only has she gotten her ego stroked by her enemy, but her new intentions have made her mouth smile in such a way that she shows off her teeth to the shrunken woman. Once Nami caught sight of Ms. Valentine's teeth she had to admit that at her size she felt a tad intimidated, but what started as a little intimidation started to grow into outright fear as she saw Ms. Valentine slowly hovering Nami towards her mouth which was simultaneously opening  directly in front of the Straw Hat's navigator. \"W-What are you doing!? Please stop!\" yelled Nami as she tried to swing back and forth from her strained arm which has grown numb from the long periods of holding Nami's weight. Ms. Valentine momentarily closed her mouth and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because you praised my work doesn't mean I ever had any intention of sparing you, kyahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Valentine ended her statement with her famous laugh. The breath and intensity of her voice was overwhelming for Nami given how close she was to Ms. Valentine's mouth. She felt both the warmth and deafening sound coming out of the giantess' mouth, but that was the least of her worries. \"<i>She wants to eat me!</i>\" thought Nami. Before she knew it she had a very clear view of Ms. Valentine's mouth. The fangs, the molars, the frontal teeth, the tongue, the saliva, the uvula, and of course the pit where Ms. Valentine intended to pass her through to fall into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Valentine stuck out her tongue and aimed it at Nami's chocolate pudding covered stomach. The tip of Ms. Valentine's tongue hit Nami's stomach. The cooling saliva created a slightly ticklish sensation for the poor red head. From there Ms. Valentine started to clean Nami's front by licking upwards \"Hahahaha!\" escaped Nami's lips against her will for she fully realizes her current dilemma and the dangers that it entails. \"<i>Quit laughing! You're on the verge of being devoured!</i>\" was all that Nami managed to think to console herself. After Miss Valentine finished her licking motion, the front of Nami's body from her stomach all the way to her face was clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard Ms. Valentine say as she began to position Nami into entering her mouth head first into a horizontal position. She did her best to keep Nami's body straight so that she couldn't move even though the shrunken woman tried as hard as she could to squirm her way out of her predicament. \"<i>I'd rather fall to my death than act as nourishment to this piece of garbage of a lowlife!</i>\" But all her struggling came to a halt when she saw her head inside the dark cavern that was Ms. Valentine's mouth. \"Why is it so dark?\" asked Nami only to spot that Ms. Valentine has lowered the upper row of her teeth and now that Nami's head was inside the true horror began when she felt an unspeakably painful sensation cut into her spine just below her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAHHHH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami let out a blood-curdling scream. Her body however failed to respond and unfortunately for Nami she quickly figured out why that is. Ms. Valentine used the upper row of her frontal teeth and brought them down directly on Nami's neck. With the damage done to her spine, Ms. Valentine has effectively left Nami paralyzed from the neck down. Nami couldn't feel it and her eyes were getting heavy, but she knew she was probably bleeding. Not that Ms. Valentine would let Nami die of blood loss. No, that evil bitch wanted her to die within her. It wasn't enough for her to be shrunk, she wanted to really inflict terror into Nami and being eaten while paralyzed is without a doubt a frightening fate. \"<i>Crocodile...knew...how to pick them...</i>\" those were Nami's last thoughts before she decided it was better to give up than struggle to stay conscious but paralyzed inside the villainess' stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blood that came from Nami's deadly wound dripped down to the floor where Robin was. Hearing the sound of the drops made Robin open her eyes. Looking upward she saw more drops falling but what scarred her was the sight she saw. The image of Ms. Valentine inserting Nami's bloodied body covered in chocolate into her mouth and loudly swallowing will stay with her til the end of her days. Robin's eyes started to burn and soon enough they grew moist. She started to sob and her nose started to feel wet. It didn't take long for Robin to uncontrollably cry for her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGULP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCame the sound from Ms. Valentine's throat. Nami was no more. Needless to say what Robin just saw served as a warning. If she ever gives Ms. Valentine any reason to kill her, Ms. Valentine will not hesitate. Robin never saw her friends the other Straw Hat pirates again who wondered where their two female companions disappeared to. Poor Robin was left being an eternal slave to this malevolent giantess.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slowly the light began to dim around the giantess, revealing her. Nami's eyes traced up starting with a pair of towering purple heels that led up to flawlessly sculpted bare legs that tied into a purple dress cut at the hips. Further up were a pair of enormous breasts that blocked a majority of the woman's face. From what little she saw of the face, Nami saw a pair of beautiful, yet extremely angry eyes and long, flowing black hair. Even with her new perceptions of the world the navigator was aware she was looking at a goddess of beauty, and there was only one woman this beautiful in all of the sea. The luscious and temperamental Boa Hancock. Nami had always heard stories of the woman's beauty and even saw a few pictures. But they undersold Hancock's divine presence. Even Nami, who almost never felt inferior to someone in terms of looks, felt like a mere bug before her. It didn't help Hancock was so massive by comparison she literally cast a shadow for miles from Nami's perspective, the redhead's beauty was quite literally overshadowed by the mere presence of the giant woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nami felt her self-views crumble away, Hancock meanwhile investigated the contents of the abandoned chest. This raggedy ship nearby was the result of the latest attack by the Kuja pirates. Not even a day ago it was full to the brim with treasures and crew members. Then the Kuja came and attacked and plundered. Though ironically the plunder was too much, and after leaving the male scum of the crew behind at sea they were forced to take the ship to the nearest island to try and unload some of the goods. Hancock didn't like the idea of having to deal with more of the annoyances around her but there was little choice. It was a solid job though so the Pirate Empress allowed her crew to spend the night having their fun, meanwhile Hancock took an interest in what the crew considered their greatest treasure. At a mere glance they were three small wooden statues, but in reality they were an experiment done by the scientist Vegapunk. Blessing the objects with the powers of a Devil Fruit. She didn't know the name of the fruit, but it's power was to shrink anyone. As a result, any who came in contact with the statues would shrink to roughly the same height as them. It was an unexpected find for a group of rabble pirates, especially considering how informed they were of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was all a moot point now, they now belonged to Hancock. And she took a special interest in them. The statues were a perfect way to handle anyone who annoyed her. Plus on top of that, they could be used as servants after that. After all, if anyone deserved shrunken servants it would be her would it not? Only the most beautiful get the best things. Therefore Hancock deserved it. Unfortunately her crew didn't seem to get that and left the chest in the ruddy ship they decided to abandon. After chewing her idiots of a crew out Hancock was forced to retrieve it. But that begged the question; Why was this chest out in the open?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So help me if anyone stole them I will-\" Hancock stopped as she spotted a small figure in the dirt. It was the smallest of the statues, which meant...Hancock bent over and looked around. And there it was, right beside her feet- a shrunken person. The woman couldn't suppress her smile as she plucked the person from her feet and held her in her palm. \"Why hello there little one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami shrieked when the gigantic hand of Hancock reached for her. It was unlike anything she'd ever encountered, each finger was bigger than the Thousand Sunny! But she didn't fight it, not that she could, and soon she was lifted hundreds upon hundreds of feet into the air. Honestly, Nami swore her ears popped several times in the span of a single second. Before she knew it the fingers deposited Nami onto a massive palm and she stared into the looming beauty that was Boa Hancock's face. Nami felt insignificant before the giantess. When she was greeted Nami cautiously waved a hand, \"Hi Misses Hancock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock seemed to find the formalities amusing, \"Ah, so you know who I am? Hard not to I suppose. I take it you touched my statues?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Nami was nervous before she was downright scared now. She tried to steal from the moodiest woman in the sea...This didn't bode well. She quickly bowed to Hancock's face, \"I'm so sorry I had no idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to know that you realize your situation. Very rarely does someone cross me and live you know. However I am feeling a bit merciful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little woman raised her head with a relieved smile, \"Really?! Oh thank you! Thank y-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-After all, you will make an excellent servant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nervous chuckle escaped the navigator's lips, \"I'm sorry, I must have misheard you. Servant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock's smile turned to a frown, \"You didn't mishear me. Because you tried to steal my belongings you shall henceforth become my shrunken slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence!\" Hancock yelled, \"You should be honored to be my slave, after all...I am beautiful!\" The amazon queen winked at her slave and Nami had to admit, she felt herself briefly swoon. But the dire situation made her stop quick. \"But I'm a pirate, I have a crew and everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore. From now on you're my property like these statues. If you have a problem with that...\" Hancock's fist clenched tightly and Nami felt pressure from all possible directions, \"I am sure I can figure out something else for you.\" Her hand opened again, \"Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami had been in situations where she had to bow her head and say yes before, but for whatever reason she did something else. \"Luffy will save me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nami said that Hancock's expression changed, \"Luffy? You know Luffy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden mood swing was jarring, but Nami suddenly remembered. Luffy met Hancock before! He mentioned it when they reunited at the Sabaody Archipelago. Maybe her statement just saved her life. \"Yeah, I'm his navigator. The name's Nami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock's eyes changed, clearly recognizing the name. \"Nami...?\" The redhead nodded, \"Nami...\" Hancock's tone seemed to change, \"Nami!!!\" Suddenly her fist clenched again, crushing the redhead in her grasp, \"You're one of those worthless women trying to steal my husband then?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Steal? Husband? What?</i> None of what Hancock was saying made sense to the Navigator. But it was clear things didn't go quite as she wanted. Hancock gritted her teeth and clenched her hand as hard as she could for several minutes before finally beginning to calm down. Her hand opened to reveal Nami, gasping for air and red all over. \"I should just kill you for getting between me and my love. But since you're small anyway I think I'll just stick to keeping you as a slave. But more on that later, I've wasted enough time as is.\" Before Nami could respond Hancock pulled her dress back and shoved the little redhead into her cleavage before sealing her dress back. Hancock's cheeks tinged with red, <i>One of my rivals in love is now my slave. And I know you're nearby now Luffy...</i>The thoughts began to trigger a number of fantasies. But the sight of the chest quickly reminded Hancock, \"Oh yeah...\" Using her dress to cover her hand Hancock lifted the statue in the dirt and placed it back in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't going to drag this big, mostly empty chest back to her ship. She was too beautiful for that. So instead she went for the next best thing. That's why without warning Hancock kicked the chest in the direction she knew her ship to be. Offhand she knew the distance and direction and with the proper amount of power she used it probably landed on her ship by the time she started walking, back to having fantasies about her husband-to-be.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nefertari Vivi, princess of Alabasta and heir to the throne, smiled as she gazed out of a tower window overlooking the fair capitol city of Alubarna, the desert landscape shifting so easily in the winds. The climate was fairly mild today for some reason, the heat not as exhausting or bearing down as it usually was. Even a gentle breeze flowed through her long blue hair, making her sigh in contentment at the cool wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did have duties right now as a princess, but for now she had decided to escape to a far off tower in the castle, the highest peak, allowing a grand view of the country and all of its citizens and sand. She smiled, looking down. From here, they all almost looked like bugs scurrying about, and she chuckled, wondering what it'd be like to be this big and see the world as such. Vivi did allow herself such silly thoughts every now and again. She did travel with the strangest pirate crew and a rubber captain for a few months, so zany and insane things were pretty much a given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her daydream, she got up and intended to walk back to the main castle body, only to bump into a bookshelf quite roughly, sending a few items falling. \"Oh!\" The princess exclaimed, snapping out of her daze, wincing as books and heirlooms clattered to the floor. She sighed and knelt down, beginning to pick them all up and restore them to their proper places on the shelves, until her hand traced along a small medallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a blue-diamond scarab piece with a golden chain linking it altogether, giving it a fair, but simple elegance. Vivi held it in her palm, appreciating the necklace and the beauty of it. Her family had many treasures in store in a great vault, but this seemed to have been misplaced amongst dusty old books and scrolls. \"What are you doing up here friend?\" She chuckled, unclasping the necklace and putting it around her neck, the scarab falling snugly into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and once again began walking to the exit of the tower, only taking a few steps before pausing. She could hear the sound of rock cracking and shifting ever so slightly. With her ears attuned to the sound, it seemed to be coming from right underneath her feet. After a minute or so of listening, the blue-haired beauty shrugged, thinking it was just the ancient tower groaning as it usually did with such an old age as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivi began to walk once more, but stopped just before reaching the exit. Her eyes were now level with the top of the doorframe. \"That...that can't be right.\" She said to herself, taking a step back, hearing the shifting of rocks once more. When she had come into the room, the top of the doorframe was easily above her head, and large enough to allow a tall figure such as her father or Inagram to pass through. Now, she would have to duck and crouch just to get through the passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her eyes opened wide at the sight before her as the passageway's doorframe seem to lessen before her, now the top of it only chest height to her, her head almost touching the ceiling, blue strands of hair just brushing it. \"What is going o-\" Just as she took a step back, her foot went right through the floor, making her yelp a bit in panic. The desert princess looked down to see cracks running along the floor where she had stepped, her weight having caused enough damage to go right through solid stone with that last step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should get on more solid ground...\" She murmured to herself, trying to take gentle, tiptoeing baby steps, but only succeeded in making more cracks and bumping her head against the ceiling as she grew slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all so...\" She sighed in exasperation, rubbing the spot where her head had hit the ceiling. \"....Normal, I have to admit.\" Vivi shrugged. Adventures with the strawhat pirates had given her quite a taste for the strange. \"Now, just need to figure out why I grew...\" She muttered to herself, rubbing her chin thought. She would tap her foot, but didn't want to create anymore holes than need be in the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fiddling hands eventually went to the scarab necklace, fingers gracefully rolling the piece around. Before her quizzical mind could go over it all, she winced a bit, her back now pressing up against the ceiling, forcing her to crouch just to keep from busting through the top of the tower. \"Now this is just getting uncomfy...and impossible to get out of.\" Vivi sighed. She wouldn't even fit through the frame now without breaking anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the seconds crawled by, more and more of her back pressed up against the ceiling, forcing her onto her hands and knees to get into a position low enough just to fit in the room. Her fine, elegant clothing was beginning to tear, and her feet were beginning to press up against the walls, making cracks form all over the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...alright. Maybe if I just stay still...nothing bad will happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe groaning sound of the tower straining against her weight and continuous size said otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...have to get out of here before this entire tower topples over.\" Vivi realized, mentally facepalming. She would physically facepalm, but that would send a shoot of cracks that would most definitely make the floor beneath her cave in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivi took in a deep breath before kicking back with her right foot, easily smashing straight through the wall behind her. She repeated the process with her left leg, hopefully creating a hole big enough for her to fit through. Fortunately, the tower remained standing through the process of wall-demolishment. \"Here I go...\" Vivi said nervously to herself, beginning to crawl backwards, fitting her rear end through the hole. With a final push and a shove, she went flying out of the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had forgotten that there was nearly a three-hundred foot drop to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivi screamed on the way down, unknown to the fact that she was beginning to grow once more.</span></div></div>",

All she felt was a light thud as she made contact with the sands below, the familiar terrain shifting ever so slightly underneath her weight. She opened her eyes slowly, glad to see that she seemed completely fine. No broken bones, no bruises, though her rear end did feel a little sore after the fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I'm alright!\" She smiled, only to immediately cover her mouth. Her voice seemed much more...louder than she had initially anticipated, almost in a booming sense perhaps, like when her adventures returning back to Alabasta had her encounter the giants Dorry and Brogy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked slightly, taking in the sight around her. Sitting down, even her head was higher than most of the buildings around her, and the people scurrying below in fear at the sight of a giant princess appeared nothing more than toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" She sighed once more, standing up slowly, feeling debris and fall fall off of her elgs and posterior. \"Sorry!\" She looked down, seeing an imprint of herself in the ground, a crushed stall and some carts underneath. Luckily the attendants to the cart were out of the now, looking at their destroyed property, then back up to the looming giantess above, looking down at them nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again, sorry! On behalf of the Nefertari family, I'll be sure to recompense you all with a new stall, cart, and supplies.\" She tried to calm them down. Sighing, she looked back up at the tower, something she could easily ascend now if she wished, and up at the hole she had created at a much smaller size. \"Well...wonder how I'll get out of this.\" Vivi muttered to herself. No pirates or adventurers to help her now, she only had her own actions and thoughts on this one. </span></div></div>",

She could hear panicked shouts and screams from below, making her wince. \"Now now, don't be afraid...\" She tried to act as a proper princess should and condone her subjects. Vivi looked down, gasping slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScurrying around and even under her legs were tiny little bugs, well, people that could be mistaken for bugs, and now she knew the reason for their fright. A massive woman just doesn't appear out of the blue for no reason and not send an upset throughout the area. Currently, Vivi was resting against the castle, the tallest tower now roughly halfway up her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Right now ,she was slightly amazed at just how quickly she had grown, now at a vantage point where it was even better than the tower's sight, giving her a full view of the whole kingdom from this high up. If she wanted to, she could even stretch out her legs and have her feet rested over the city gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, she just wanted to move out of harms way before she did any more damage. No doubt the castle's structure took quite some damage from the impact of her fall, as did the surrounding buildings and villa. After a deep breath, Vivi began to stand, hoping to place her feet in the most open of spaces so she didn't knock anything else over. As she stood, the people below could only watch and stare as her size nearly doubled at her full height, making her all the more towering, chunks of buildings and sand falling from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Princess Vivi, you can do this. Remember, poise, elegance, gentleness.\" She muttered to herself, remembering walking tips as a princess should. She raised her foot, more and more sand falling from her soft sole down onto the city below, and she brought it down onto an empty street, making the whole area shake. She repeated the process step by step, aiming for more open areas. She did accidentally knock over an upper portion of a taller building with her swinging foot, making her cringe a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few more earth-shaking steps, she was over the city walls, giving the guards positioned there a good view up her looming form as she strided over them into the empty desert area outside of the main city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, much better. Nobody to step on or break out here.\" Vivi said quite proudly to herself, hands on hips as she dug her bare feet and toes into the warm Alabasta sands.</span></div></div>",

What would be scorching hot to a normal-sized person was refreshingly warm to her giant soles. In fact, the climate overall was preferable. It was still warm to be sure but compared to a desert's heat Vivi felt more of a summer beach sort of heat. \"Hmm...the ocean isn't too far away...Especially like this. Maybe I could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Highness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess looked to where the voice came from. Near her feet were a trio of men but aside from that they weren't particularly recognizable. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're members of the guard your Highness. Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long as everyone in Alabasta is fine then I'm okay.\" She smiled strongly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Vivi still very much alive and well made the guards notably at ease. \"Thank goodness. What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not entirely sure. I was in the tower by the castle and then...I fell and...Oh! I just realized. Maybe this has something to do with it.\" She gestured to the scarab necklace around her neck. \"After I put this on I started to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard's nodded, \"We'll send someone into town to look into this.\" The man turned his head and quickly gave an order Vivi didn't catch. Without hesitation one of the two soldiers turned and hurried into town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can all be dismissed.\" Vivi laughed nervously, \"I doubt anyone's going to hurt me like I am now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be so your Highness but it's our job as guards to protect you with our lives!\" Stubbornly the two remaining guard's positioned themselves on either end of Vivi's enormous feet. She stifled a chuckle looking at the two muscular men guarding her toes with their lives. Their dedication was a bit overprotective, but admirable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow...They're barely the size of my toes.</i> Vivi realized. If she lingered in Alabasta any longer who knew how many would've been crushed by her steps? She made the right choice. Her father would be proud. She nodded approvingly, reflecting on the last few minutes. Any minute now a guard would come hurrying with a means of returning her to normal. She just needed to be patient...If only her pride and enthusiasm lasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes. Twenty minutes passed in glum silence as Vivi and her protectors awaited someone to come update them on the situation. She tried several times to initiate a conversation or two but once the guards went back to work they entered their habitual silence. After yet another failed attempt Vivi sighed, \"I understand you guys are just doing your jobs but really, you don't need to watch over me! I'm not a little girl anymore! Literally!\" The guards were too tired of this argument to respond. They knew she was right but that wasn't the point. Vivi hugged her knees and looked at her feet with a bored look. Alabasta was on a strict lock-down to avoid the danger of her crushing anyone and her only two companions were about as sociable as rocks. She hated doing nothing, especially when it meant inconveniencing someone else. Her toes drummed in a desperate attempt to vent some mild frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me your Highness.\" A guard spoke up moments after she started this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean no disrespect but...could you please stop doing that?\" He looked to Vivi's toes nervously. \"It's a little unnerving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help it. Vivi laughed. \"Seriously? I need protection but your scared of my toes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not scared! It's just hard to concentrate when they're all bouncing on the ground like that.\" The second guard snickered alongside Vivi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! I bet a big, strong guard like you can handle my foot!\" Vivi propped a foot upright. \"You're almost a fifth as tall. You can do it.\" A mischievous idea came to mind. Vivi giggled as her devious side toyed with the idea before settling on a course of action. \"...And for your sake I hope you do.\" Much to the guard's surprise Vivi's foot began to lower onto him. Caught off guard he wasn't able to do much more than reach up and try to hold off the giantess's foot with his bare hands. Vivi's foot stopped its descent and fought to lower itself to the floor. The guard gritted his teeth and pushed as hard as he could to fend off the gigantic foot. He was already sweating bullets meanwhile Vivi was barely even trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you can do? I'm not even trying to lower my foot you know!\" She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Highness please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I really have been hanging around Nami too much. </i>\"If you insist!\" Vivi increased her foot's pressure slightly, smirking as she felt the man beneath it buckle down to his knees and struggle. His strength vanished in moments and with a last little push Vivi had him trapped beneath her sole. \"My hero.\" She said in the most princess-y voice she could. Muffled cries came from beneath Vivi's foot, begging to be freed. The giantess gleefully ignored them. \"I thought I needed protecting? Are you trying to say you, a big guard, can't even get out from under my foot?\" She re-positioned herself slightly so that the man was beneath her big toe. \"Or maybe even just a toe? Is that too much for you?\" Despite all his struggle's Vivi's foot was going nowhere. In fact it felt kind of nice...like a little massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile as this all happened the second guard watched from the other end of Vivi's feet and was in hysterical laughter. \"She's got you there mate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you then tough guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard turned blue when he saw Vivi eyeing him next. Smirking, she reached down for him. He seemed smarter than his friend. Instead of trying to out muscle Vivi he quickly turned to run. However he was nowhere near as fast as her. Effortlessly Vivi plucked him from the ground and balanced him in her palm.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Your Highness p-please be reasonable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought so.\" She giggled, gently blowing into her palm and knocking the man off his feet. \"Look out! Here come's my finger!\" Vivi's index finger bent inwards and poked into the tiny guard. He tried to hold it off but unlike before Vivi didn't hold back much. He was instantly trapped. \"Come on, you didn't even put up a fight! At least your friend is still struggling under my foot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man what's the point?\" The guard sighed, \"Have your fun Princess. It's our job to as a you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Even if I were to say....be hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes even if-Oh my God!\" The guard cut himself short as Vivi opened her mouth and began to bring him closer in. He fought with all his might against her finger, still not budging in the slightest. Her tongue poked gently from between her lips and rested on her finger's knuckle. The guard saw it loomed high above him, slowly tracing her finger down to his tiny frame. Despite all his efforts he wasn't able to move away by the time Vivi's tongue licked his entire body. The guard felt his entire body get assaulted and soaked by the slimy appendage for a full minute before it went away. What he heard next was not reassuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat finally did it. With all his strength, plus being slicked up by Vivi's saliva, the guard managed to free himself and take off running. His only concern was avoiding the finger that already hunted for him again. He kept an eye over his shoulder to make sure it wasn't gaining on him, running full speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result he wasn't watching where he was running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard felt his foot hit air and immediately realized he ran right off Vivi's hand. He tried to turn around and catch himself but it was too late. He plummeted to what had to have been certain death. Only...it wasn't. His landing was surprisingly soft...Was it the soft embrace of heaven? Thunderous laughter from above him begged to differ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just playing with you! I wasn't going to eat you!\" Vivi was in tears, and the guard realized why. He fell right into Vivi's cleavage. His fatal flaw was cushioned by the two building-sized breasts on either end of him. In a way he really did die and go to heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivi calmed herself down to a giggle, \"Since I scared you so much you can rest there for a minute okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, it really was heaven.</span></div></div>",

Some could make out a sky of skin, some nothing but soft fabric filling their vision. In the end, it was all the same as the sky literally crashed down onto them, sending a powerful reverberating quake throughout the whole planet, cracks forming for miles underseas and creating rocking waves to crash into other nearby landmasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Vivi pretty much sitting down on her whole country was catastrophic. Of course, she didn't know this yet. To her, she was still falling, eyes closed shut and whimper in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut slowly she opened them to a clear blue sky and an empty area of nothing but a puddle that appeared to be everywhere, occasional dots of rock and earth and moss here and there in varying shapes and sizes.\"What...what happened? Where am I?\" She asked herself, her words normal to her, but thunderous, booming, and echoing over the whole world for all to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Vivi....you can figure this out.\" She said to herself, crossing her arms over her chest. \"The last thing that happened was that you grew, then you began to fall. I honestly expected to painfully hit sand or maybe fall into a fruit stand or something, but that didn't happen. You're...somewhere strange....and pretty empty.\" She looked around to emphasize the emptiness of the area to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder her full rump, she felt a little itch, and wiggled it a bit, demolishing whatever had survived the initial impact of the meteor of her rear crashing down onto a whole country-isle, sending a rumble through the whole area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...somebody with teleporting devil fruit powers kidnapped me?\" She mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or...maybe I'm dreaming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or....the crash killed me and this is the afterlife. Pretty boring if you ask me...\" The blue-haired princess sighed to herself, beginning to dip her fingers into the nearby water, playing it it, unknowingly crushing smaller islands with either her fingers or the vast, towering waves created from just her splashing around.</span></div></div>",

At her full height she made out more of the area around her. \"I must be in some kind of marsh or something.\" As far as her eyes could see there were only little chunks of land with large puddles of water between them. At a glance the deepest parts of the water seemed just about knee-level. Really that was about it. None of the bits of dry land Vivi could see were much bigger than her feet. Maybe at a couple were as big as her full body but those seemed rather scarce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I hope I find someone somewhere close.\" Aside from herself Vivi saw no one else. Sighing the woman took her first step into the thin waters and set off in a random direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivi simply couldn't comprehend those marshes she was wading through was in fact the Grand Line. The tiny bits of land she spotted were some of the largest islands in the sea. Most however were unnoticable specks before the giantess. Not a single person in the ocean was unable to see her. All throughout the Grand Line news spread to the rest of the globe of the towering titaness and her unaware rampage across the seas. Warnings were spread, precautions made, forces sent out. With every step she took Vivi ended countless lives, not even aware she was doing it. The average island was hardly noticeable beneath her feet. One by one entire island nations were crushed under foot. Each step Vivi took either destroyed something or created a tidal wave ready to destroy something. Whether or not she realized it she was quickly destroying the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to be stopped. That was why the Marines stepped in. Not that Vivi could tell. From her perspective she was merely wading through a large puddle. She didn't notice the armies of specks in those seas gunning for her. As many officers as the Marines could muster were sent out en masse with all the weaponry and tricks they had available. They barraged Vivi with everything they had. Cannons, Devil Fruit Powers, Sea Kings, Giants, Androids, Swords, if it was able to be used as a weapon it was used on Vivi. The attack focused on a single ankle. If they could knock the giantess off her balance they could then go for her throat and end her rampage. They only had a few seconds between steps to make their last stand, it had to count. It all was unleashed in seconds. For a moment Vivi stopped walking. The smoke blocked all view of her ankles to the Marines on the waters. Did it work? Did they make her mad? Or did Vivi finally realize what was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later it was all too clear. With a single lazy motion Vivi's other foot moved and waved away the smoke with its immense force whereupon it then scratched the back of her ankle before she carried on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything the Marine's had, concentrated into a surefire instant strike, made Vivi's ankle itch. Once her foot rose out of the ocean all in the attack saw a tidal wave engulf them whilst another island met its end beneath Vivi's sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how big I am?\" The blue-haired mega giantess wondered aloud. She recalled growing briefly before ending up where ever she was. She shut her eyes while growing so it was hard to say. \"What if I'm something absurd like fifty feet tall?\" She laughed, imagining it. \"I'd have to be very careful with where I walk. I could accidentally crush something.\" Another nation found itself smushed beneath Vivi's toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be fun though...\" She continued to muse aloud, \"Maybe I could help Luffy and the others on their journey. I bet the Marines couldn't handle a giantess...Well I suppose they have giants too don't they?\" She sighed, \"Even in my fantasies I'm not that strong.\" Ironically the next land she unknowingly crushed was a specialized military island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could do a lot of good as a giant though. I can speed up construction and deliveries for my people immensely. Maybe I should look into that when I return.\" The giantess wiped some dirt off her butt, unknowingly sending the last remnants of her homeland to the depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Vivi stopped in her tracks. Before her was the biggest landmass yet. It was a red wall about half Vivi's height that seemed to go on forever in either direction. \"That kind of reminds me of...\" Vivi's eyes widened, \"...The Red line...\" The continent that marked the halfway point of the Grand Line. An immense wall that rose up for miles from the bottom of sea level and went across the entire planet as a giant dividing wall. That was what was in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" Vivi realized just how big she actually was.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After splashing her fingers around in the water a bit, Vivi grew bored and wiped some debris from her fingers, sending tons of earth that once was inhabited islands, now nothing but annoying dirt specks that had the misfortune of getting stuck to the pads of her fingers. \"Well, guess I'm really the only person actually around.\" She sighed to herself, leaning back and planting her hands once again into the 'puddle', feeling the earth give way a bit beneath her weight, sending a shoot of cracks through tectonic plates in the area, generating more and more damaging earthquakes, but obviously not even felt by the overgrown princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be...on a small island somewhere. Can't be that big, the landscape doesn't seem to stretch that much.\" She continued to speak to herself, humming a tuneless song to herself, sending echoes and booms heard all over the globe. Marine forces had already been dispatched to 'deal' with her, if you could even deal with a giant big enough to crush an entire country beneath her, World Government leaders were already discussing what to do with the enlarged princess, and pirates were already raring for an adventure on this newly formed landmass, joking about visiting her mountains and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Vivi knew nothing of any of this. To her, she was still her normal sized self and not the biggest living thing on the planet, giving even the greatest giants and monsters of legend a run for their money in sheer size and power she now possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had thought about getting up and exploring, our just sit tight and wait out. She might've slipped into one of those strange oasis's one occasionally finds in the desert, and she's still in Alabasta somewhere. Perhaps some guards will come and fetch her in no time flat. Maybe even the whole scene of her growing was just a fever dream, it was rather hot in that tower, and there was dangers of not keeping properly hydrated and cooled in such a hot climate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another annoyed sigh at all of this, Vivi decided to stay put. Besides, the ground neath her was actually pretty comfy, forming perfectly round her soft butt. While she sat and waited, her long and elegant fingers went back up to fiddling with the scarab necklace she had found while in the tower. The gem flashed briefly, but not enough for Vivi to take notice as she longingly gazed into the distance, mind wandering off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivi didn't even notice as she began to grow, just by the slightest of inches to her, but hundreds of feet to those who were smaller, her size drastically changing by the second. Reports were sent out to nearby islands of the growing goddess, people actually having a chance to be prepared this time and possibly avoid being crushed by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntire islands and cities were being evacuated, fleeing from the expanding form of Vivi on the horizon, who seemed to not even care or notice as her body grew more and more, taking up miles of the ocean as her long legs only loomed further over the area, her rear crashing into the earth and creating more cracks, and her upper body looming so high up she disappeared into a blur, making the cloud layer seem all too pitiful as it tried to keep up with her ever-increasing height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually her growth hit a kickstart as she only continued to play with the scarab piece, whatever causing her to grow touch-based as her fingers played with the jewel insect. From inches to her did her growth shoot up to feet, and Vivi did take notice now, making her wide eyes blink a bit as she took it all in. \"Oh...guess it was real then. I'm growing...again!\" She exclaimed, long leaving behind her tiny form of crushing Alabasta underneath. Now she grew onwards for miles and miles, crushing the smaller landmasses underneath and against her bulldozing form easily. Vivi didn't even take notice of them, thinking they were bits of dirt or rocks that simply laid about in the puddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until her head was high up in the atmosphere did...things begin to settle in with her. The area around her seemed to lessen only more and more, the usual amount of land diminishing greatly. The sky before her no longer seemed blue, but greyish, then finally, black like the night sky littered with stars. Far below, she could make out the area like a map, literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world was becoming like a map before her, and she gasped in realization just at how colossal she truly was now, and still growing all the same.</span></div></div>",

The seas around the island were unusually calm, and not just because said island was situated in the line of ocean known as The Calm Belt. The inhabitants heard nary a peek, whisper or Neptunian decimating a whale's carcass when they awoke in their beds, placing all of the people on the island into a mindset akin to snuggling into a warm bed on a cool, winter's night. <br>\r\nAll, except one particularly loud denizen of the Royal Palace.<br>\r\n\"<i>Luffy!</i>\" came the shrilled voice echoing throughout the massive structure. The loud screech blasted Sandersonia and Marigold out of their respective beds and into a panic. <br>\r\n\"That sounded like Hancock!\" hissed Sandersonia, picking herself off of the ground in a huff. Marigold stayed face down on the palace floor.<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever it is, I'm sure our sister can handle it.\" <br>\r\nSandersonia placed her hands on her hips. \"You're just saying that so you can go back to sleep.\" <br>\r\nMarigold stared as fiercely as she could at her sister from her low perch. \"What? No. I have complete trust in Hancock's ability to sort out her own issues.\" <br>\r\nAnother yell and another burst of Conqueror's Haki flew into their room, cracking several windows and shattering a nearby mirror. Both sisters exchanged a worried glance before racing towards the source of the noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandersonia and Marigold approached Hancock's bedroom quietly, taking note of what appeared to sound like scuffling from behind the door. Each sister placed their backs on either side of the door and mouthed each other orders.<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" 'said' Marigold. \"Let's catch 'em by surprise.\" The orange-haired woman reared her arm back, and with a burst of Armament Haki, sent the double doors flying off their hinges.<br>\r\n\"We've got you...now...?\" <br>\r\nInside the bedroom lay Hancock, hands underneath her sheets, squirming like a fish caught on a hook. Contrary to what her screams indicated, her face was contorted in a state of bliss - her eyes were closed tight.<br>\r\n\"Er,\" murmured Sandersonia to her equally dumbfounded sister, \"I think she's...dreaming.\" A low moan escaped from Hancock's lips, accompanied by a serious of sounds that somewhat resembled the name of a familiar straw hatted pirate. \"About Luffy, it seems.\" <br>\r\nMarigold crossed her arms over chest. \"S-should we wake her up?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, but slowly. I think sis would have a fit if we woke her up from this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of coercion, the sisters managed to pull the euphoric Pirate Empress form her perfect world. Despite their efforts, Hancock was still quite annoyed with her siblings.<br>\r\n\"You needn't wake me, I was perfectly fine.\"  One gesture from her sisters opened Hancock's eyes to the squalor that was now her bedroom. Half of her sheets were strewn across the room, glass was peppered along the tiles, curtain rails hung on for dear life, leaving their curtain partners in a mess on the ground. Her eyes widened. \"Perhaps I got a bit excited...\"<br>\r\n\"A bit?\" snorted Marigold. \"Sis, your Haki was growing out of control. Maybe your love for Luffy is...\" She stopped dead once she received a frosty glare from the raven-haired Empress. \"...never mind.\"<br>\r\nSandersonia leaned against a bed post. \"Mari does have a point though. I can easily see this winding up in some sort of disaster. What if we weren't here? You could have brought the whole island down based on what we heard.\" <br>\r\nHancock gripped her bed sheets tightly. \"B-but I love him... So much...\" <br>\r\n\"We know sis, but at least try to keep a handle on it for-\" <br>\r\n\"<i>Shut up!</i>\" Several pillows were flung across the room in Sandersonia and Marigold's direction. \"Don't tell me how to live my life! Get out!\"<br>\r\n\"But sis-\"<br>\r\n\"Out!\"<br>\r\nBoth sisters looked at each other glumly before giving their infuriated sister one last glance as they exited the messy bedroom. Hancock flew onto her back, huffing loudly. She snatched the only pillow that wasn't ejected off her bed and smushed it into her face - her angry, muffled screams could be heard outside her bedroom door, much to the chagrin of her concerned siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours of angered mumbling and pacing Hancock finally gained the resolve to think about what her sisters had tried to say. <br>\r\n<i>Perhaps they're right. Maybe I should try to keep my love for Luffy in,</i> she thought to herself. <i>But how will I show Luffy I would turn the world upside down for him if he doesn't see it?</i> Hancock looked down at her body, noting that she would had to have someone fix several buttons that had burst off of her pajama top. <i>I mean, he barely notices me as it is.</i><br>\r\nBoa Hancock could be described as nothing short of breathtakingly beautiful. She stood at a statuesque height of 6'3, with perfectly aligned facial features, sparkling eyes and curves that would make an hourglass hang it's head in shame. Her enormous breasts jutted out from her chest, each one roughly the size of her head, in complete contrast to her slender figure. Any man in the world would kill to just stand in front of her, as she had proven innumerable times throughout her life. <br>\r\nAll except one, however. And as if fate itself were laughing at her, he was the only man that she loved in her entire life. Still loves, as a matter of fact.<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" She through a dramatic hand to her forehead. \"I just don't know what to do. Maybe I could give this 'bottling up' thing a try?\" </span></div></div>",

She had worked out, in her opinion, a fairly logical way to keep her mind off of him.<br>\r\nGet pissed at everyone else. <br>\r\nNever did Hancock think that she would ever succumb to waiting outside of a public bathhouse, just to flash people her chest as they walked past. As her mammoth mammies bounced out in front of the poor (or lucky) passerby, Hancock would utilise her Love-Love powers and petrify them on the spot, claiming that they had dared seek the eye of the Gorgon on her back. It was only after her hundredth or so victim did the citizens of Amazon Lily start to grow suspicious of their Snake Empress. Hancock, after solidifying anyone who questioned her motives, relocated back to The Royal Palace just as the dinner feast had begun. She told her staff about what she had done that day, resulting in many gasps and just as many silences. However, the problem was easily fixed once the raven-haired woman lay on them her puppy-dog eyes for the umpteenth-trillionth time. It was only when her sisters dragged Hancock aside did she undo her handy work, complaining the entire time.<br>\r\nAnd not once had she thought about Luffy, not once the entire day, not once the entire night so far. That is, until she was caught alone in her bedroom with her own thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock had been busy hanging one of her numerous pet kittens upside down by it's hindlegs, when she spotted her self-titled diary: '<i>The Super Secret Lovey Dovey Empress Album of Luffy's Shenanigans and Hijinks</i>' on her desk (right next to her other self-titled book called: '<i>Nami and Robin: A Chronicle of Two Sluts.</i>') Instantly, Hancock's hands went to her heart, clutching it as her thoughts began to form the image of-<br>\r\nShe slapped her self mentally and physically. \"I won't think about him. I won't think about him,\" she chanted to herself. She threw herself onto her bed, kicking away a kitten (who had just got its bearings after it had been dropped on its head) on her way there, and tried to force her mind onto something else.<br>\r\nAfter squirming and struggling for hours on end, Hancock finally fell asleep due to exhaustion, successfully not thinking about Luffy the entire day. In her sleep, however, her subconscious betrayed her brain, sending countless, virtual situations of Luffy and her marrying each other. As she begin to giggle and drool in her sleep, something else was happening to Hancock's body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like soft dough rising in a pan, Hancock's body began to slowly inch upward and outward. Her arms grew thicker in the sleeves of her pajama top, causing the shape of her biceps to push through the fabric. Her wide hips and thick thighs began to fill up the space in her pajama pants as she squirmed and smiled, still lost in her endless dream. Hancock's feet slid slowly towards the edge of her large bed, her body lengthening and lengthening slowly but surely. She had only gained a little more than an inch in height, but already her body was becoming too thick for her burgeoning clothes. <br>\r\nParticularly in the chest region. <br>\r\nHancock's expansive bosom was already slightly too big for her pajama top, the increasing strain placed on the already stretched fabric caused it to break first. The buttons of her purple shirt valiantly tried to hold the straining fabric together, but to no avail. The widening gap between fabric and button simply became too vast - her her middle most button popped off with a slight crack., presenting an appealing view of her fair skin. But as Hancock's body inflated further, the other buttons followed suit, each pop revealing more and more cleavage to the world. The fabric began to smush her enormous assets together, causing them to creep closer and closer to her chin. <br>\r\nShe had gained about 5 inches in total, and her pajamas were ready to give up the ghost, when suddenly the one of the buttons on her pants popped off as her already wide hips pushed out wider, catapulting itself into the air landing soundly on Hancock's blissful, facial demeanour. Her growth halted as her eyes fluttered open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Hancock felt an intense pressure all over her body, like someone had placed her in a vice and was slowly cranking the handle. She glanced around her, but the first thing to catch her eye was a spectacular view of her breasts, half an inch away from her face. <br>\r\n\"What the-\" she began to say as she attempted to sit up.<br>\r\n<i>Shrrrip!</i><br>\r\nAs if someone had removed every stitch from her clothing, Hancock's attire slipped off of her, leaving her bare, white skin exposed to the night. The Pirate Empress feared the worst and immediately ran to her wardrobe, hoping someone had not tried to see what she was hiding on her back. Or rather she would have, had she not slammed her foot into the tiled floor and fallen on her face. <br>\r\n<i>Huh? How did that happen? It was almost as if my bed was lower to the ground,</i> she thought, quickly scrambling to her feet and promptly smacking her head head against the top of the door frame of her walk-in wardrobe. Once again on the floor, Hancock writhed (more in annoyance than in pain) and muttered expletives under her breath, before finally crawling, with as much fervour as she could muster, into her wardrobe and slamming the door shut.<br>\r\nInside, she turned on some personal lighting and quickly threw on a coat, readying herself for whoever or whatever was in her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo-one. <br>\r\nMuch to Hancock's surprise, a search of her bedroom revealed no trace of an intruder, or any other disturbance other than her clothing. And much more to her surprise, she found that her bed was the same distance to the floor that it always was. <br>\r\n\"What in the world is going on here?\" muttered Hancock, perplexed. Her attention then found itself drawn to the door frame she had collided with earlier. She was eye-level with it. Her eyes widened as she came to the inevitable conclusion. \"T-that's...\"<br>\r\nA single glance downwards confirmed her suspicions. Her panties, wrapped all-too-snugly around her wide hips, told her everything. She barely had to pop her hip out to snap the overworked fabric.<br>\r\n\"I've grown...bigger.\"<br>\r\nHancock stood dumbfounded for what seemed like eternity, before her brain decided to tell her to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarigold and Sandersonia thundered down the hallway towards Hancock's room, Half-Zoan forms at the ready. They smashed the poor doors off of their handles for a second time in two days.<br>\r\n\"Hancock! What's happened?\" they yelled in unison. They spotted their barely covered sibling, panting heavily and pointing towards her wardrobe. The flew to her side, bracing themselves for whatever fiendish thing awaited them. <br>\r\nAfter staring at her closet for a good minute, Sandersonia asked the question that was plaguing her mind: \"Didn't you get over this when you were like, five?\" <br>\r\nHancock flipped her head around towards the owner of her voice. \"What on Earth are you talking about?\" she breathed. <br>\r\nBoth sisters returned to their full human forms and crossed their respective arms. Marigold spoke. \"You know, being scared of monsters in your closet.\" The two of them broke into laughter. <br>\r\nHancock stared at them in disbelief. Her eyes flew upwards towards the top of the door frame. \"That's not it! Can't you idiots see that I'm-\" <br>\r\n<i>Wait. Upwards?</i><br>\r\nThrowing any sort of backwards logic Hancock had gained in the past five minutes out of the window, she discovered that she was back at her original size of 6'3. If her eyes could've widened any further, Eneru would have mistaken them for two more moons. \"How is this possible? Maybe I was just dreaming?\" <br>\r\nShe spoke to no-one, as her sisters had just chuckled themselves back to bed, leaving Hancock alone again with her thoughts <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, the raven-haired beauty crept back into bed with a new set of pajamas on. However, before she could clamber on in, she noticed the shredded remains of her previous attire.<br>\r\n<i>I knew it! It wasn't just a dream!</i> she thought. <i>Wait a second, a dream.</i> Hancock recalled what she was thinking about before she had awoken. Her heart fluttered. \"Oh, Luffy. If you saw me like this, would we still be together?\" She mentally slapped herself. Again. \"I can't think about him. But it's so weird, I've never had to stop myself before.\" <br>\r\nA lightbulb went off in her head.<br>\r\n\"Maybe because I kept my feelings of love inside me, it built up somehow? And when I released them it all in that dream, I grew? I know it's called the Love-Love fruit, but...\" As much as she wanted to waive that thought, she decided that a simple test would suffice. <br>\r\nIf she dreamed about Luffy again (in which she was pretty much guaranteed) and didn't grow, she would try the same thing in two night's time. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hancock awoke the next morning with her usual happy buzz of 'Luffyness.' She stretched her arms up high above and behind her head with a groan, causing her large bust to pull the buttons of her pajama shirt taut.<br>\r\n<i>Ah, I guess I didn't grow again after all. I guess we'll have to see what happens tomorrow night.</i> The Pirate Empress then remembered that she actually had to go through with restraining herself for two days straight, without dreaming about him or thinking about him, for her test to work. She gave a defeated, audible huff and threw her arms onto her bed sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Two days, one sleepless night, and many, many petrified people later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to explode. She was ready to combust, she felt like she had to pee but in every cell of her body. But still, Hancock held on strong, albeit with a creepy, clenched facial expression throughout the entirety of the dinner feast, drawing some concerned looks from servants and siblings alike. She needn't have worried about kicking any kittens, puppies or baby seals out of her path as every animal in Amazon Lily thought she resembled the aftermath of poorly crafted cocai-- I mean, dance powder. Needless to say, they stayed well away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, with many offers to chat declined, Hancock closed her bedroom door and sighed. Then, a tingly sensation flooded her body in anticipation as to what was going to happen next. Hancock's cheeks flushed red and her breathing started to grow erratic as she made her way to her bed, still garbed in the purple outfit she wore at the Paramount War.<br>\r\nWhether or not she grew, she was going to make this worth the wait. She plopped back on the mattress and moaned.<br>\r\n\"L-Luffy! Take me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock's hands immediately flew between her legs, massaging her sensitive spot. She bit her lip as waves of pleasure coursed throughout her body. She needed this, she really did. It was such a long-earned release from her mental battle.<br>\r\nSuddenly, Hancock felt entire body quiver uncontrollably as a massive wash of euphoria encompassed her being. She had never felt anything like it - it was the greatest thing she had ever experienced. <br>\r\nIt was at this point that Hancock noticed that her expansive assets were pushing through the space in the side of her dress, having already stretched the fabric as far forward as it would go. She felt the end of the dress sliding up her curvaceous legs and pulling tight around her waist. The Pirate Empress was growing again.<br>\r\nAnd she wanted more.<br>\r\n\"I-I'm growing bigger! But I-\" A sudden wave of pleasure caused her to moan. \"I... Didn't expect it to feel...so good!\" Her arms flew to her enormous breasts, cradling them as they strained her dress further. Hancock had already grown 5 inches, but her inflating body showed no signs of slowing down. She gasped as another wave of pleasure was released into her body, pushing her body to grow larger. There was a tearing sound as the side of her dress begin to rip up towards her bust. At the same time, the buttons holding her dress together exploded and flew across the room, leaving her heaving body open to the dwindling space of her bedroom. Sweat peppered her skin as she lay writhing on the bed, her body lengthening still. <br>\r\nAt this point, Hancock's dress was in tatters, the last of which clung desperately around her thickening waist. She had grown over a foot taller and was still expanding. Her long, curvy legs were starting to tangle off of the edge of the bed, slowly closing the gap between them and the floor. Hancock's hips began to thrust in circular motion, along with her hands that had found their way back between her legs. Her mouth was forever open at this point, eliciting moan after moan as her body grew larger and larger. <br>\r\nEventually, Hancock's head pushed into the wall behind her mattress, just as her feet landed on the ground at the end of her bed. At 8'2\" and still growing, Hancock's libido was beginning to hit its peak. Just as she thought she couldn't transcend this level of pleasure, her sensual growth proved otherwise. An absolutely immense shot of euphoria shook every bone in her body, causing her burgeoning body to push out even further. Somehow, Hancock felt her feet sliding across the floor as well the groaning and creaking of the bed underneath her increasing weight. The thought of expanding even larger than what she already was sent her libido into overdrive.<br>\r\n<i>More of me for Luffy to love. There's no way he'll be able to resist me now!</i> This thought kept playing in her head as her body surged past nine and half feet tall. <br>\r\nSuddenly, a final wave of intense pleasure rippled throughout her body. Hancock jammed one hand as far she could into her nether regions while the other squeezed her huge, heaving bosom. She threw her head back as her entire body tensed up, stretching bigger and bigger as she moaned continuously.<br>\r\nFinally, the pleasure surged into its climax, rendering Hancock unable to speak as she inflated one last time in all directions. After the pleasure began to seep out of her, the Pirate Empress allowed herself to relax every muscle in her body, which had topped out at eleven feet in height. She lay there for ages, drinking in the leftover buzz of euphoria that still seemed to linger in the air. Eventually, she sat herself up, her head nearly grazing the ceiling. <br>\r\n\"Oh...my...\" she breathed. \"I guess I better start cleaning this up...\" She attempted to shift her position in the cramped room, but the aftershocks of her spiel rendered her limbs inadequate to perform any other task besides sleeping. She lay back, somewhat enjoying the creaks that emanated from her bed.<br>\r\n<i>Will I shrink by tomorrow?</i> was her last thought before dozing off. Then: <i>Luffy...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pirate Empress awoke the next morning with a splitting headache. It felt as if someone was pressing their knuckles into her temples; she winced at the pain as she sat up. The next thing the raven-haired beauty noticed was that she was stark naked, with goosebumps running all over her white skin. The last thing she took note of (and in retrospect, was probably the first thing she should've taken note of,) was the fact that her body took up about a quarter of her large bedroom. <br>\r\nHancock placed a shaky hand on her forehead in an attempt to recall the events of the night prior. Almost immediately, she remembered her body's rapid expansion, and the intense feelings of love that had ravaged her being. Then, she remembered how <i>good</i> the sensation of growing bigger felt. Feeling her own power increasing, as well as her ability to dominate others increase - it made Hancock squirm just thinking about it. Her bed creaked loudly in response to her movement, breaking the Pirate Empress out of her lustful stupor.<br>\r\nIt was at this point that Hancock heard some light, tapping footsteps, growing louder and louder as they approached her. She put a hand to her mouth. She hadn't thought about the mark on her back. It would be easy for anyone to see it if she was eleven feet tall.<br>\r\n<i>Calm down! </i> she thought to herself hastily. <i>It could be Sonia or Mari on the other side of that door.</i><br>\r\n\"Empress?\" <br>\r\n<i>Crap.</i><br>\r\nHancock was about to order the servant to leave her alone, but stopped herself. <i>If I were to talk right now, the volume of my voice would give me away completely! What do I do?</i> The giant woman racked her brain for a solution (including for an instant, the thought of how no-one had her euphoric sounds from the previous night [which she later on put down to dumb luck]) when she remembered something from the first time she had grown.<br>\r\n<i>I can shrink! But how, how did I do it?</i><br>\r\nThe servant rapped on the door and called out again. Hancock entered panic mode as she watched the door starting to slowly budge open. <br>\r\nShe was done, her secret was out. She and her sisters would have to leave Amazon Lily forever. Hancock squeezed her eyes shut, trying to not scream. This was it.<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Pirate Empress felt as if she had released an enormous breath of air. She opened her eyes quickly to catch the world seeming to grow around her, or rather, her body dwindling in size. Wasting no time, Hancock flew underneath her bed covers the second the servant stepped inside the room.<br>\r\n\"Empress...? Are you ready for breakfast?\" <br>\r\nThe servant was nearly blasted out of the room by the sound of her master's voice. \"Peasant! How dare you make me follow my own schedule! I eat whenever I wish! Now leave!\" <br>\r\nHancock nearly cried with relief when the befuddled servant left her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I think I can now confirm that fear and panic make me shrink, whereas love and lust makes me grow,</i> thought the Snake Empress as she made her way towards the Amazon Lily market place. <i>Perhaps it is a Ying and Yang sort of thing? Well, it doesn't matter as long as I know how it works.</i> The raven-haired beauty smiled to herself. <i>Now all I have to do is learn how to control it.</i><br>\r\nThis was the precise reason that Hancock found herself in a less-regal context than she was accustomed to. She was on the prowl for a pawn to test her newfound power on, and see if it affected others in some way. It didn't take long for her eyes to trace across the perfect test-subject.<br>\r\n\"Ah, honest Marguerite.\" With full intention to startle the slender Amazon, Hancock almost purred out her words, knowing full well of the deep admiration that the blonde felt towards her Empress. It worked a charm, dropping Marguerite out of her shopping routine metaphorically and physically (as evidenced by the suddenly scattered food items.) <br>\r\n\"O-oh, Empress, I didn't expect to see you here.\" She bowed her head in a profuse manner, using the opportunity to gather up her dropped groceries. \" I-is there a problem?\" <br>\r\nHancock made a big show of lavishly flicking her long, shimmering, black hair back as she made direct eye contact with the short-haired woman. \"I ask for your presence in private immediately.\" She turned her back to her. \"I trust that this is agreeable?\" Marguerite dropped her bags again in response, stunned and blushing scarlet.<br>\r\n\"Good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock lead the still blushing blonde away from the market place, and towards a private bath house near the palace. As the statuesque Empress strode onwards, the shorter woman stopped to ask a question. <br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Empress. But... How long has this been here?\" <br>\r\nHancock didn't bother halting to answer. \"Since the palace was built, as far as I know. What's important is that it is secret to the public. It was built for guests of the Royal Palace only.\" <br>\r\nWondering for a second what her idol meant, Marguerite jogged lightly to catch up to the Empress, who at this point was opening the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was relatively large inside, with a reasonably sized, steamy bathing area and several cubicles whose wooden walls connected with the floor and the high ceiling. The short haired blonde barely had a chance to glance around before she noticed Hancock enter one of the cubicles.<br>\r\n<i>Oh, she must be taking her clothes off,</i> thought Marguerite absentmindedly, before promptly erupting into several shades of red. <i>T-taking...off her...c-clothes?! I must be dreaming!</i> Marguerite's school boy reaction was nothing compared to how she reacted when she saw the cubicle door open ajar and heard the following: <br>\r\n\"I need you in here, now.\" <br>\r\nAs the short-haired blonde attempted to stay conscious, she moved her feet slowly towards the beckoning voice. What awaited her inside would have bled every nose of every non-rubbery man on the planet,<br>\r\nHancock, back pressed firmly against the back wall of the small cubicle, with one slender arm barely holding up her huge bust and one other slender arm placed over the space between her wide hips. Her clothes were dumped messily on the the damp floor, exposing every centimetre of her perfect skin. She smiled at the speechless blonde.<br>\r\n\"I need your help with something.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hancock smiled at the incredibly flustered Marguerite, who looked as if she was trying to make up her mind about either running for her life or to continue gawking at the taller woman's body. Her front, in any case. The Snake Empress made sure to have her back placed against the wall at all times.<br>\r\n<i>It should be fine, I don't think she'll see it, even if I get huge. </i> Hancock licked her lips. <i>Speaking of which...</i><br>\r\nShe had been anticipating her growth for most of the day, hoping that it would feel just as euphoric as before. There was only one way to find out. Utilising her bottomless love for the Straw Hat captain as a catalyst, Hancock allowed her feelings of love to bottle up inside. She started to flush red and lose her breath, the sudden change in her demeanour startling the shorter blonde still standing dumbstruck in front of her. <br>\r\n\"E-empress... Are you-\" She was interrupted by a forceful moan from the raven-haired woman, who had just released her stored feelings, causing the statuesque beauty to lengthen in height. It was only half an inch, but it resulted in enough lustful energy for Hancock to latch onto in order to continue her ascent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, yes,\" she cooed. \"This feels just as good as I remembered.\" Her lustful eyes traced Marguerite's form as she continued to grow. She already stood quite tall over the blonde, but their difference in height only continued to increase as Hancock's head inched higher and higher. Her hands had already started to massage her sensitive areas, increasing her lust and growth. <br>\r\nMarguerite, who usually came up to the Empress' collarbone, found her eyes level with her heaving, inflating bosom. Words couldn't describe how she felt at that moment - she had long concluded that she was dreaming. <br>\r\n\"Empress, I-\" Again, she was interrupted, by what sounded like a cross between a laugh and a moan. She stared up at her idol's face. It was contorted in blissful ecstasy, eyes shut and still inching further away from her. Marguerite calculated that her idol had grown about foot in height already, and showed no signs of slowing down. She could only watch as Hancock continued to expand, her hips pushing out wider, her bust surging out further, and all the while groaning in pleasure. Two feet higher now, and Marguerite was left staring at the Empress' taut stomach, which was thickening like a tree trunk. A mixture of sweat and steam had caused the growing woman's perfect skin to glisten. Accompanied by her idol's sensual movements, Marguerite was beginning to feel a lot more than just dumbstruck. <br>\r\n\"Empress...\" she moaned. \"Something is happening to me... I... It's like... Something is emitting from your body...\" <br>\r\nHancock lessened her growth for two seconds so she could think straight. <i>I've never had that reaction before. This must be it! </i> The growing woman looked down at Marguerite and smirked. <i>Ooh, I could get used to this perspective.</i> She closed her eyes and cooed as a sudden wave of pleasure washed over her. The sight of the blonde so small kicked her libido up a notch. She immediately lengthened a few inches, bringing her height to nine feet even.<br>\r\n\"Emitting?\" smiled Hancock between moans. \"In what way?\" Much to Hancock's surprise, Marguerite moaned back at her.<br>\r\n\"My body feels...tingly and nice...\" The blonde's hands traveled the length of her tight figure. \"It's like standing in the sun's rays...only much, much...\" She couldn't finish her sentence due to how lost she was in the intense pleasure coursing throughout her body.<br>\r\nThen it clicked in Hancock's head. She stared down at the blonde's shrinking figure. <br>\r\n\"Honest, l-little...\" Her body tensed up, growing a few more inches in height. \"God, I love that word right now... Marguerite. Look into my eyes.\" <br>\r\nMarguerite's irises had trouble connecting with her idol's, mainly due to Hancock's gigantic breasts blocking any sight of the warlord's face. The Snake Empress pushed her heavy assets aside and locked gazes with the short-haired blonde. Almost like clockwork, Hancock heard herself utter:<br>\r\n\"Love-Love Transfer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Marguerite felt her body inflate, like heaving a massive gulp of air, but without any limit in sight. <br>\r\n\"What's happening to- Aah!\" Her outfit begin to cling to her like a second skin, stretching as best as it could with the owner's expanding form. She felt her bikini bottom slide up into her crack, unable to contain the rapid swelling of her curvaceous butt cheeks. A tearing sound was heard as her top pushed out as far as it would go, leaving her respectable bust to expand around and under the fabric. Marguerite had already surpassed six feet and continued to swell rapidly. Her boots exploded as her thick legs thickened even more, followed by her bikini bottom, snapping under the strength and size of her hips, and her top as well, flung into the legs of the  ever-growing Hancock, who had just reached her record size of eleven feet. <br>\r\nMarguerite's arms had stayed stiff by her side, palms out and fingers outstretched, as her rapidly increasing height crossed the seven-foot mark. She could hardly speak, on account of moaning throughout the ordeal.<br>\r\n\"I-I'm getting... B-bigger?\" She found her self face to face with her idol's moist sex, the temptation to shove her face into it was getting all-too-real for the panting blonde. <br>\r\nSaid idol smiled. \"That you are, honest, little,\" she pushed up a few more inches, \"Marguerite. But you are expanding so quickly. Where does your love and lust come from?\" <br>\r\nThe short-haired blonde moaned loudly as she gripped Hancock's expanding hips. \"You! My Empress!\" <br>\r\nShe smashed her head forward and regretted nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock was not prepared for the sudden eruption of movement in her nether regions, followed by an almighty explosion of euphoria that served to render her speechless. She surged outward in all directions, her hands pushing against the walls of the now cramped cubicle. Hancock's head was quickly approaching the ceiling as her body continued its rapid inflation, her arms having to bend more and more as her giant body grew thicker and thicker in the dwindling space. <br>\r\nMarguerite's growth continued unabated, in fact it seemed to increase when she heard the Pirate Empress moan in ecstasy. Her own expanding body surpassed ten feet, causing her to have to bend down to continue her ministrations towards the space between her idol's legs. She stopped when she heard the inevitable thump of Hancock's head against the twenty-foot ceiling.<br>\r\nThe raven-haired beauty raised her arms and placed the palms of her hands on the roof, moaning as her growth continued without falter. She knew it was fruitless. The bath house was built into the side of a mountain; there was nothing but solid earth above the growing women. <br>\r\nShe left her hands there, however, as she shifted onto her knees in the increasingly smaller space. <i>I need more room! I'm not done growing yet!</i> She was so big, yet she wanted more. More. <br>\r\nShe got her wish. Marguerite seized another opportunity to pleasure her Empress by suckling on her enormous breasts. Hancock howled in ecstasy and thrust her chest forward, almost pinning the blonde to the opposite wall. The string of pleasure emanating from her bosom only pushed the giant woman larger, taking up more and more of the small amount of space left in the room. <br>\r\nThis triggered a thought in the smaller woman. The thought that her Empress was growing so vast, so beautiful, and could only grow more so, cranked Marguerite's libido up to eleven. She swelled so rapidly that her head slammed against the ceiling, breaking Hancock out of her bliss for a moment.<br>\r\nThe raven-haired woman watched as her loyal follower squeaked and squirmed, her size quickly matching the Empress'. Contrary to how she thought she'd react to someone trying to steal her thunder, Hancock allowed a sultry smile to adorn her features. She removed her hands from the ceiling and placed them on the opposite wall, either side of the swelling blonde.<br>\r\n\"Honest, little, Marguerite, I must thank you for being a wonderful test subject, and for going out of your way to please your Empress.\" Marguerite could only blush in response. \"Here is your reward.\" And with that, Hancock mashed her lips against the squealing, blonde-haired woman.<br>\r\nTheir wet, heaving bodies slowly began to push into each other, stomach against stomach, bust against bust, their limbs becoming entangled with each other's. Every movement of their lips caused the women to grow bigger and bigger - each of them nearing their climax. Their passionate growth pushed their colossal hips into the walls of the creaking cubicle, soon followed by their shoulders as their heads pushed against the ceiling. Their muffled moans grew in volume and desperation as their burgeoning bodies filled in every empty space left inside their cage. Hancock's huge breasts were pushing into her and Marguerite's chins, which only spurred the blonde on to increase the ferocity of her kisses. <br>\r\nA low creaking and groaning sound was heard as the walls began to buckle in an attempt to contain the ever-inflating women. Their growth went undeterred as their thickening bodies pressed harder and harder against each other - their screams of ecstasy growing louder in response. Eventually, the two women were unable to budge an inch due to their swelling selves becoming too vast for the rupturing cubicle. The feeling of being so close to other drove both women into their long-awaited climaxes.<br>\r\nTheir bodies surged outward one last time, causing the cubicle to finally bow in defeat and splinter in every direction, sending a thirty-five foot Marguerite tumbling backwards and splashing into the bathing area. Likewise, the thirty-five foot Hancock rested on all fours, heaving a deep breath of air - both women weren't able to breathe during the last part of their exchange.<br>\r\nAfter about a five minutes of heavy breathing, Hancock spoke up first.<br>\r\n\"Excellent work, Marguerite. It's time to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The world of One Piece had certainly changed over the last few years. New threats emerged, new pirates were introduced and most importantly of all, new powers made themselves known. Now in a world where devil fruits were as common as a sunny day there were some powers that were more unusual than others. There were fruits that turned people into animals, ones that let people control candle wax, there were even fruits that could make a person stretch! But on occasion there were devil fruit abilities so strange and with limitless possibilities that would make the world tremble. This was the case for a certain individual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was the New World and the location was Totto Land, and here was where we found one of the most wanted pirates in all of One Piece. She was a member of the Yonko Big Mom\u2019s pirate crew as well as her 14th daughter, one of her most powerful crew mates and one of the three Sweet commanders Charlotte Smoothie. Now as the daughter of one of the most powerful and feared pirates on the entire planet Smoothie was incredibly strong an was even notorious in her own right with a bounty of 932 million Belli. What made Smoothie stand out amongst the rest of the sweet commanders aside from being the only female was the fact that she was half human and half long leg, this meant that she was quite the statuesque woman at an incredible 15\u20192 with her legs easilly towering over most people, it was quite easy to say that with incredibly long legs, large full breasts and a thicc ass and thighs that she was one of the most attractive women in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But this wasn\u2019t what made her unusual, no that was her devil fruit power which gave her the ability to literally juice her opponents (fitting as she is the minister of juice) she can wring anyone and anything out and drain the liquid from their body creating a unique tasting juice. What was more was that this wasnt  all she could do with her abilities, she could also absorb liquids to make herself and other objects larger! Hell if she wanted to she could grow to tremendous sizes and terrorize the entire world! But she didn\u2019t dare do this as her mamma hated all giants in the world and would most likely kill her if she became to big! But being able to grow was just one ability of her fruit, there was sure to be another ability this fruit had that would be revealed real soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte Smoothie sat abord her ship in her private room. This had been a particularly bad week for Totto Land, they had been invaded by the Straw Hats, her fellow Sweet commanders had all been defeated and worst of all their enemy\u2019s had done significant damage to their home. As for now Smoothie was secretly pursuing the Straw Hats who has escaped recently and presumed they had lost all of the big Mom pirates, little did they know that Smoothie and her subordinates were hot on their trail. Whilst she had something time to herself Smoothie thought back to when she used her ability to grow in order to unsuccessfully subdue the Straw Hats, now even though she failed there was one thing she remembered and that was how great it felt to be bigger than everyone else! Now granted normally due to her immense height Smoothie towered over 90% of people but when she was a giant she towered over everyone and she loved every second of it, but she knew that she couldn\u2019t stay giant forever as her mamma would become angry and hate her if she did so, and no one makes mamma angry and lives to talk brag about it. But since the incident she had been experimenting with a new power, if she was able to absorb liquids to make herself and objects bigger than maybe the reverse was possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoothie had been feeling strange since the battle with the straw hats and as a result her devil fruit abilities had been a little erratic, but over the last few days they had been returning to normal and with added effects! Whilst she was lying on her bed with her incredibly long legs being barely able to fit on it she lay back while looking at something in her oversized hands, in it was a tiny chair. Smoothie had picked it up earlier with the intention of juicing it for a drink but when she squeezed it instead of juicing and expelling the liquid it absorbed into her body and as it did this the chair continued to get smaller and smaller until it was the tiny size it was now. This had been quite surprising to Smoothie as she had thought she knew every aspect of her devil fruit power, but out of nowhere here was this new ability and what was great about it was that it could fulfil Smoothies desire to be bigger than eveyone without angering Big Mom! Smiling she knew that this was the key to her achieving her fantasy and she began to ger excited over the prospect of towering over everyone, however she thought to herself that she needed to test her power some more before trying to fulfill her fantasies and maybe even test it on a person as well. That\u2019s when there was a knock at Smoothies door, rising to her full intimidating height Smoothie called over for the person to enter. It was... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A knock on her cabin door had interrupted Smoothies thoughts, hastily stashing the chair in her bedside cabinet she stood up and called for whoever was at the door to enter. The door swung open and in came one of her subordinates, now to say it was a person was a bit of a stretch as it was actually one of Big Mom\u2019s many homies made from her soul, the homie had the appearence of a normal man but with a sunflower surrounding the outside of his head essential like he was wearing a sunflower as a hat. As he was called on her nervously informed Smoothie that they were making headway on catching up to the Straw Hats. He then bowed his head an made to leave, but what he had said annoyed Smoothie as he had essentially wasted her time by giving her such a mundane update, that\u2019s when she realised that this was th perfect opportunity to test out her newly gained power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne moment you come here now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe subordinate frozenin his tracks and turned to face the towering Smoothie who was looking down on him menacingly. Scared he cautiously approached the sweet commander and enquired as to what she required. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell as one of the Big Mom pirates strongest members I have to keep on my toes as far as my strength an powers go. Now I have discovered a new ability that I need to test a bit more and I thought to myself that I should test it on you. I assume you\u2019re ok with this?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe subordinate shuddered at what he had heard and began spluttering and slurring his speech, this made Smoothie a little more agitated so she thnnwlakwd over to her subordinate and low redness herself down so she was level with him and out her arm around his shoulder as she spoke. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.onepiecebrasil.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/One-Piece-Episodio-820-5-Charlotte-Smoothie.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.onepiecebrasil.com.br/wp-cont...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow there isn\u2019t a problem correct? You\u2019re more then happy to help your commander right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe subordinate was completely intimidated by what Smoothie had said and simply began nodding his head frantically in response. Satisfied with his response Smoothie smiled and then picked up the subordinate so he was Inbetween her massive hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow just stay nice and still whilst I do this, it\u2019ll all be over in a moment\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoothie then began gently squeezing the subordinate who felt a strange sensation throughout his body, then it happened.  Out of nowhere his body began expelling liquids that were slowly being absorbed by Smoothie and as it happened he began to notice something strange, Smoothies hand were getting bigger. Little did he know that she want getting bigger but he was getting smaller! Panicking the subordinate began squirming trying to get out of the clutch, but Smoothie simply increased the strength of the hold and absorbed the liquids faster making the homie shrink even faster! This continued until the subordinate shrank to 1 inch tall, he looked like a small bug in the palm of Smoothies titanic hand, he looked up at his huge captor who was laughing at his predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha My seems like my powers are working just fine then. Well thank you for being so helpful but this is where we must say goodbye\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoothie then dropped the tiny homie from her hand and watched as he fell to the ground. Luckily for him as a homie he was must stronger than the average person and managed to survive the fall, unluckily for him though was that the massive Smoothie had raised her foot and was getting ready to lower it. That\u2019s when Smoothie...</span></div></div>",

Would be nice to have the narrative to go a different way than what I\u2019m thinking.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the homie was about to meet his end at the hands or should I say foot of a Smoothie she was interrupted by yet another knock at her door. Smoothie stopped dead in her tracks with her foot hovering inches above the homie who couldn\u2019t believe his luck that he hadn\u2019t ended up a stain under the Sweet commanders foot, but Smoothie had other plans as she smiled devilishly at her shrunken prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like we have company. Sure would be a shame if they accidentally crushed a bug or two\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe homies heart dropped as Smoothie addressed the person at her door inviting them in. The door opened and in walked another member of Smoothies division, except this person ranked far higher than any homie as the person was none other than Smoothies younger sister Charlotte Cinnamon. Just like her older sister she too was half long leg and as such she was incredibly tall but not nearly as tall as Smoothie as she stood about a foot or two shorter than her, this still made her an impressive 13-14ft tall. The one defining difference from Smoothie however was that  Cinnamon looked like was she a member of the Kuja tribe, there was definitely an Amazonian feel from her but it st the very least made her stand out from her long leg look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinnamon then made her way across the room to speak to her sister. As she walked Smoothie watched to see if the homie would be smart enough to try and run, to her delight he did and started to make his move far away from the two gigantic women. However asmpothie wasn\u2019t going to let him off that easy and strategically asked her sister to grab something from her desk which was directly in the path of the tiny homie. The homie screamed as he tried to get away from the booming tremorous footsteps that Cinnamon was creating, but it was all for nought because the superior size of the giantess was too much and all the homie could do was scream and try to protect himself as the enormous foot lowered and crushed him like a bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoothie was elated at what she just saw, just like that someone who was normal size a few minutes ago was now a red stain on the bottom of her sisters foot. This made Smoothie feel even more powerful that she didn\u2019t even need to dispose of others herself, once she cut them all down to size they could be wiped out by anyone and anything bigger than them and she absolutely loved it. Her thoughts were eventually interrupted by her sister informing her of why she was there. It took Smoothie a few seconds to start listening to what her Sister was saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo yeah we should be caught up to the straw hats within the hour. That\u2019s great news right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm? Oh yes very good news, it\u2019ll be so delightful to catch those straw hands with my own hands. I can\u2019t wait\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...yeah can\u2019t wait sis, oh yeah did you get the update from the sunflower homie we sent here? Because no ones been able to find him since\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah I got his report all right and don\u2019t worry I\u2019m sure he\u2019s around here somewhere haha\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoothie couldn\u2019t help but let out a laugh at the joke she made, her sister really had no idea that her subordinate was plastered all over the sole of her shoe. Cinnamon then made to leave but Smoothie wasn\u2019t sure whether or not to test her powers out on her sister, she still didn\u2019t know whether or not she could reverse the effects if her shrinking power or if th person she shrinks is stuck thst way. That\u2019s why she was torn on if she should do it or not, after a few seconds of contemplation she decided to...</span></div></div>",

They know it's a woman due to her large chest and feminine body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who...Is...That...?\" Usopp nearly gone silent after what just happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...She's gigantic...Maybe her panties is gigantic sized too, yohohoho.\" Brook said, thinking about panties but was interrupted by Usopp as he slapped him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute!

Somehow he found his way to Zoro, getting into his face. \"Where are they Moss Head?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro shrugged, barely paying him mind. \"Why do you think I know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji gritted his teeth and readied a loud insult for Zoro when thunderous booms shook everything around them, forcing the pirates to cover their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like they woke up Robin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no mistaking those voices, even though they were louder than anyone had ever heard them before. Those were the voices of Nami and Robin, their missing crew mates. But where were they? The Strawhats looked all around them but it was still the same brown fields in every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-G-G-GUYS!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked to Chopper. The reindeer was pale as a ghost, staring at the sky above them with a horrified look. Curious, the rest of the crew did the same thing; and in an instant they all have the same look Chopper did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"sky\" so to speak, was blocked out by two immense, familiar faces. Looming in the heavens Nami and Robin smiled down at them, larger than anything they had ever seen before. The two were giantesses who made even Oar's look like an ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow guys. You're so big!\" Luffy immediately screamed the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin giggled, \"Told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami looked to the other girl with a smile, \"You were right. He said it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other giantess looked back to their crew, \"We aren't big Captain. You all are small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean we shrank?!\" Usopp leapt back, holding Chopper tightly for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhm.\" Nami nodded. \"To make a long story short me and Robin were a little bored so we came up with this idea to have a bit of fun with you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow I doubt you both came up with it.\" Zoro stared suspiciously at Nami who smiled innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the heck did you guys shrink us?\" Franky was quick to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not important. Just know we shrank you guys down. And now, time for our fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun?\" The shrunken crew all asked together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantesses exchanged a smirk with one another before backing away from what was merely a table. But to their crew it was the endless field of brown. Both women leaned back in their seats and lazily propped their feet up onto the table, placing them close to their shrunken crew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put simply...\" Robin began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to worship us!\" Nami finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell we are!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you my lovely Goddesses!!!\" Sanji swooned, more than happy to worship either of his lovely crew mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone gets the idea.\" Robin giggled. \"If you don't mind, I wouldn't mind a foot massage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it Goddess Robin!\" Sanji saluted the giantess and took off running to her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that leaves the rest of you with me.\" Nami grinned down at the others. \"What should I do with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you guys doing this? Not that I mind Yohohoho.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami shrugged, \"Does a girl need a reason to have a good time? Now you little ants. You should...\" She paused to think about what to do.</span></div></div>",

It was written by Spiral-And-Twist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/portfolio/view/spiralwriter\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/portfolio/vi...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's having computer issues but asked me to post this nonetheless.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky was a calm blue, but it's peaceful visage did not match the seas that laid below. The Thousand Sunny, a grand ship inhabitated by the infamous Straw Hat Pirates, was in utter turmoil as it was tossed about by the broiling waves of the ocean. The captain of the vessel was merrily laughing through the storm, calmly resting on the bow of the deck. The rest of the crew scattered about the ship, all having their own personal reaction to the destructive waters around them. One swordsman simply sat crosslegged in the saturation that bore down on them, remaining as calm as his captain Luffy. A navigator tried to set out a map and keep it dry, trying to figure out what their coordinates were at the moment. She had never seen waters like this on any of her maps before. A cook pretended to be attending to his ingredients, bringing them all down safely to the kitchen, but in reality he was simply swooning at glances of the lovely navigator Nami. Two others, their marksman and doctor, were either crying or screaming as they held onto one another, shouting that their deaths were going to be soon. Another, their shipwright of sorts, was repairing damages to the Thousand Sunny as quickly as it was attacked by the ocean. Just one crewmate was missing however...where was their acheaologist?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luffy!\"Nami cupped her hands around her mouth to call out to the cheery, naive man.\"Have you seen Robin anywhere? Nobody can find her below or above deck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and shrugged.\"Nope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Nope?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you've seen her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just said 'yep' though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was for the nope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her face as stern and annoyed as it could be, Nami walked across the deck and pulled him off the bow, Luffy retorting like a scolded child, his arms stretching an amazing length as he tried to hold onto the bow, Nami dragging the rest of him away. With a sigh she released him, only to send him like a slingshot right back to the front of the ship, almost cleanly knocking him off into the dangerous seas surrounding them. As Luffy looked over the side, he took in a big whiff of air, expecting the usual salty smell, but instead, another curious scent.\"Nami....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What is it now...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does the ocean smell like clean soap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I supposed to know?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged, continuing to watch the strange new sea, giggling as bubbles the size of mountains and larger began to pop out of the ocean. The rest were as flabbergasted as they watched this sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin half giggled, half sighed as she submerged herself neck deep into a bathtub filled with sudsy soap and calming, warm water. As she slowly opened her eyes, she calmly looked down at the pitifully minute speck floating in the water around the area where her naval rested below. At first glance, others might simply mistake it for dirt or something else so meaninglessly tiny, but not Robin. She knew it was her shrunken crewmates. She giggled as she raised a hand and slowly churned the water near the ship-speck, wondering what confusion and chaos it was causing below to them. How it came to this, she knew not. It was some odd weather phenomenon the night before, and she was lucky enough to witness it. The ship had docked at a small island for the night, the local antives not minding pirates like themselves. Robin had stepped off the ship to gather a few supplies with some berries lended by Nami. As she returned to the ship, she stopped to gaze at the night sky, an odd occurance happening overhead. First, dark clouds gathered over the island, as if a storm was approaching. Then, the rain, nothing too odd. As she neared closer and closer to the docks, the hairs on the back of her neck shot straight up, warning her not to enter the ship. An instance later, a bolt of violent green lightning shot out of a cloud overhead, striking the Thousand Sunny. This strange weather continued on for several more minutes, and Robin simply watched in quiet fascination. Just as quickly as it came, it dissapeared. The storm had dissipated, leaving the night calm and serene once again, only inkiness outlined by a shining moon and twinkling dots of stars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing that the danger was over, Robin continued walking back towards the ship, but once again stopped. Did the ship seem smaller? As if a magic trick was being played before her eyes, the entire ship and everything on it seemed to reduce drastically by the second. In a matter of minutes, it was only as large as a child's toy, and still diminishing. How no one could notice this, Robin did not know. Her crewmates were known for being heavy sleepers. As she knelt down and scooped the shrinking vessel out of the water, she gazed at it curiously. She would have to continue her investigation later, as the ship needed a safer place to lay than just in her hand. With the remaining berries, she rented a room at a local inn for the night, and here she was now, watching the nigh microscopic ship float in bathtub water as she cleaned herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How odd.....I hope everyone is okay....\"Robin mused to herself, rising slowly out of the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.Is.THAT.\"Usopp screeched as he, along with everyone else, watched as the godlike leviathan rose out of the water. Larger than anything they had ever seen, it was like a living continent before them, casting a shadow for countless miles across them as it continued to stand.\"Whatever it is...it's...beautiful!\"Sanji proclaimed with hearts in his eyes, recognizing the feminine form even when it was a million times larger.\"We should try to talk to her! Maybe she could tell us where we are.\"Luffy offered up the option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! She'd probably crush us for entering her waters! Something that big must have a temper!\"Ussop countered, knees shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't just stay here. Gotta do something.\"Zoro muttered, still half asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, as Robin gazed back down, the speck was heading towards her. Maybe her friends finally recognized their situation? She giggled and sat back down in the water, only to her chest though, the water pulling in and out of the sudded up, sopping wet orbs.\"Hello all.\"Robin greeted them as they neared her right nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ship slowed to a stop, all they could do was be.....amazed at the sheer size of this being. Before them, a monument of fleshy pink rose out of the water, easily large enough to be a mountain, and that didn't even count the miles of soft flesh it was attatched to. Sanji tried everything he could to keep himself from nosebleeding out all of his vitals. When the goddess spoke, it was like a hundred thunderstorms and quakes rolled into one.\"Hello!!\"Luffy shouted at the top of his lungs.\"What's your name, Miss Giantess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are we supposed t-t-to? You d-dont have a reputation f-for being mean, r-right?\"Ussop asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess chuckled. Her next response was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Really?!\"Luffy exclaimed in reply, jumping up and down in excitement, his usual antics whenever facing something new or interesting such as this, a cosmic deity was before them. The Strawhats had faced so called 'Gods' before, whether in sheer power alone or a farce, but this seemed to be the real deal. The giantess was large enough to end any war or begin a catastrophe of apocalyptic proportions herself, and seemed to be invulnerable to any conventional means of attack. They were truly speaking with a goddess that had helped shape their world, or so it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\"Robin continued, but with a slight giggle. Why not have a little fun in the meantime while her friends were at this size? She wasn't harming anyone, and she could find a way to revert them to normal eventually.\"Everything you see blue before you,\"She waved her hand out at the small body of water in the tub, the entire sky above the miniscule pirate ship filled with flesh tone from her palm.\"I created to separate civilizations and for all sealife to dwell within.\"She giggled once more, it felt almost ridiculous to sport such an amazing act of god, but she had to keep up the image since she said those words.\"I can control the very currents that guide your ship...\"She dipped a finger into the soapy water besides the speck, twirling it lightly, but creating a vast whirlpool that threatened to suck the unknowingly shrunken Strawhats into the depths below.\"I can drown out an entire country if I so wish to do so....\"She raised her hand again and made a small splash at a bar of soap floating nearby, the soap sinking underwater, the splash a tsunami and the soap a far-off continent to the pirates. They were in awe at what had just happened, so mundane an action was divine to them, they had just 'witnessed' a god wiping out an entire country.\"I...\"Robin began to stand up, raising herself to her full height, the water only coming up halfway to her thighs, revealing her naked glory, her body a titanic immovable monument that reached higher than the sky could contend with, the Strawhats so far below couldn't even see past her waist, the rest of her upper body a far off blur.\"...Am the Goddess of the Sea!\"She proclaimed, enunciating on the last word with a loud clap of her hands, a sonic boom that nearly shattered the eardrums of the tinies below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Wow.\"Was what the entire crew stated simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin knelt down and gently picked the ship up with the nail of her index finger, bringing it up to her eye for a better look at the speck.\"Now,\"She thundered, making her voice as deep and godlike as it could be, which only doubled the depth and loudness of it for the Strawhats.\"What are you microbes doing in my territory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got lost, I think...\"Luffy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had docked at this small island last night, and the next thing we know, we wake up floating in an ocean with a goddess taking a bubble bath in it.\"Nami added on, stepping forward from the group to speak with the deity.\"Do you know how we got here...err...your goddess-ness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do, I....brought you all here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your...exploits and adventures have caught my eye, and I wished to meet the little pirates that have been causing so much chaos in my ocean.\"Robin replied, barely able to stifle the laughter building up beneath her words.\"Defying the world government, racking up quite a collective bounty on all of your heads, and even saving entire countries! Your deeds even reached the ears of the gods above you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"Nami piqued, tilting her hand in curiosity.\"Does that mean we get a reward?\"A cat-like grin began to spread across her face, her eyes turning into beri signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, it does.\"Robin began to search for a reward he could give to such microscopic beings.\"You all.....\"She paused to consider in her mind what to say to her friends.</span></div></div>",

The redhead stood forward \u201cUh\u2026Goddess? What happens if we refuse this <i>gift</i>?\u201d The giantess was silent as she placed the Thousand Sunny back on the sudsy waters, though she stood to her full height, casting a shadow over all of the water and her herself becoming a figure in the light. It might have been their imagination, but something about this Goddess looked familiar, and was she smiling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly something rose from the water. It was big, dripping with water drops that could destroy the Sunny should they land on it. It was Robin\u2019s foot, and she hovered it over the speck-sized ship. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cShould you cross the Sea Goddess I will have no choice but to punish you.\u201d </font>Mentally Robin giggled at her makeshift game, it was surprisingly enjoyable to be so large and in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe threat of being crushed was enough to make Nami back down with an apology, but Zoro and Luffy took a step forward, with a look in their eyes that said Challenge Accepted. The rest of the crew knew better though and proceeded to hit them on the heads for their stubbornness, especially Nami who practically beat them unconscious. \u201cI am <i>not</i> going to die because you two are idiots!\u201d Up above Robin chuckled, \u201c<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">You\u2019d best listen to her mortals. That woman understands your situation.\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m going to be Pirate King!\u201d Luffy roared back, springing back to life like the rubber he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u2018And I\u2019m the Sea Goddess. As such I outrank you future Pirate King.\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah\u2026That makes sense.\u201d Luffy mumbled as he sat back down. The rest of his crew looked to him with the universal shout, \u201c<b>Huh?!\u201d </b>Luffy just grinned as if that answered any arguments to his logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke stepped forward, tipping his hat to the giantess. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure Goddess, yohohoho! If I might be so bold\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami turned her head to the skeleton, \u201cDon\u2019t do it\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight I see your panties?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>BAM! </b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Brooke asked his signature question Nami wheeled around and hit the skeleton hard enough to kill him (If he wasn\u2019t already dead).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cThank you.\u201d </font>Robin smiled as she began to lower herself back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything to please you Sea Goddess.\u201d Nami laughed nervously, the rest of the crew were silent; but they had the feeling if they said anything Nami would be quick to hit them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cThank you Nami, you are such a wonder little servant. But as I said, what I desire is worship.\u201d</font> Nami cringed at the word servant but she bit her tongue as Sanji rose back into the scene. \u201cAnything you want my dear Goddess. I\u2019ll kiss the very ground you walk on should you ask!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sea Goddess smiled,<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"> \u201cThat\u2019s good, especially for what I have in mind for you.\u201d</font> A familiar structure rose from the ocean, causing a wave that nearly capsized the Sunny. Robin\u2019s foot was now partially out of the water, about halfway. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cSince you\u2019re so eager I\u2019ll allow you the pleasure of kissing my feet.\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to see Sanji\u2019s rebuttal, but he was gone. Shouts came from the water and they turned to see the cook jumping along the air to the exposed soles of the giantess. He landed right in the gap between two wrinkles of her foot and ran straight up it like a wall. Given his intense leg strength in no time Sanji reached the crevice between Robin\u2019s big and second toes where he immediately got on all fours and began to kiss the massive foot. Surprisingly he did so with the suaveness he was known for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, I guess when a woman is so big and beautiful it really doesn\u2019t matter to Sanji what they want.\u201d Chopper noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Brooke stared at the scene with respect, \u201cOne must treat a woman very kindly yohohoho! Even with the most unusual of requests.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but\u2026this is kind of embarrassing.\u201d Name face palmed as Sanji let out exclamations of joy from his location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cAnd as for you two.\u201d </font>Robin continued, pointing a massive finger at Luffy and Zoro. \u201c<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">For being so disobedient I ask that you massage my feet. <i>All</i> of them.</font> The two strongest Straw Hats stared at the looming foot that rose countless miles into the air. A second one rose up to match it, both being so large it was insane. They looked as if they were about to protest but a look from Nami silenced them. Even so, they didn\u2019t move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cTell you what, I am a kind Goddess. I respect your tenacity so, if you do this task for me I will personally prepare for you a feast grand enough even one of my size couldn\u2019t finish it all.\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment food got involved Luffy had already slingshotted himself across the Sunny towards the massive looming sole. \u201cI want lots of meat!\u201d He cried as he collided against Robin\u2019s foot and began to appease the massive appendages with a barrage of soft punches. Normally it would be the worst method of massaging possible, but given the size difference it was actually rather enjoyable, and Luffy\u2019s Gomu Gomu no Mi powers were rather useful for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro however, stood firm. \u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsopp stepped near him, \u201cThink of it as training. Look at Luffy, I bet he\u2019s going to have the workout of his life. It\u2019s the ultimate test of endurance and strength.\u201d The liar gestured to the unmassaged foot as if it was beckoning Zoro. His expression shifted slightly but nothing else. Usopp looked to his crew mates for help, where Franky shouted out to Luffy. \u201cNice going Luffy! At this rate you\u2019ll finish <i>way </i>before Zoro ever does. He doesn\u2019t have a chance! You\u2019re doing <b>SUPER!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did the trick, \u201cDoesn\u2019t have a chance? Like hell!\u201d In a burst of speed Zoro sprinted off the Thousand Sunny and swam his way to Robin\u2019s remaining foot, where he began to pound it with his fists much like Luffy was doing. \u201cI am <i>not </i>going to lose to him!\u201d He roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the crew stared with wonder at Luffy and Zoro, unsure of what to think of it. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cGood, now for you Franky\u2026\u201d</font>Robin extended a massive finger towards the Sunny, <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cClimb on, you too Brooke.\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does she know our names?\u201d Brooke asked aloud as he and Franky climbed into the ridges of the gigantic appendage.<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"> \u201cBecause I\u2019m the Sea Goddess.\u201d </font>Robin answered plainly. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cYou two shall entertain me, Brooke I understand you are a talented musician. As such I\u2019ll place you in my ear where you can play me songs.\u201d </font>Robin brought her finger towards her right ear, where the skeleton hopped off. Brooke pulled a violin from seemingly out of nowhere and began to casually strum along it, \u201cI know just the song for a lovely Goddess such as yourself yohohoho\u2026But it is kind of messy in here.\u201d Brooke looked to the thick earwax before him. The giantess smiled as she heard soft music in her ear, <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cFranky, I\u2019ve heard you are quite the talented dancer. So if you please, would you be willing to dance for me? There is an entire stage for you.\u201d </font>With a nod of her head Robin gestured to her open palm. Franky looked back to it and grinned, \u201cIs that all? Lets do this!\u201d The blue-haired cyborg ran his way to the endless expanse of hand where he instantly started his dancing. In seconds it stopped feeling like a chore and Franky felt as if he was at a party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that remained on the Sunny were Nami, Chopper, and Usopp, all of whom were scared for their tasks. With her free hand Robin scooped the ship from beneath the water and placed it in her cleavage, where a small pool of water was trapped by her breasts. Even so, the water was enough to be a large lake to the Straw Hats. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cNami,\u201d </font>Robin began as she brought her free hand\u2019s index finger towards the ship, \u201c<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">As you were the quickest to accept me as your Goddess I shall reward you.\u201d</font> Nami imagined immense hordes of money and treasure so she hopped on without hesitation. Her disappointment was obvious when instead, Robin placed Nami on her right breast. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cYou may massage when you are ready.\u201d</font> The redhead grumbled, but she understood that they had no choice and fell to her knees and began to rub the squishy flesh she rested on. \u201cI used to have the biggest boobs around you know\u2026\u201d She cried to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin turned her attention to the remaining two Straw Hats.<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"> \u201cUsopp, Chopper\u2026\u201d </font>The two cowardly pirates embraced each other as they awaited their sentence. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201c\u2026You shall have the easiest tasks. All I ask is that you sit there, and worship me as a Goddess.\u201d </font>The fear the two had quickly dissipated and was replaced by a fervent bowing motion in the direction of the looming Goddess. Under his breath Usopp muttered random words of praise about the \u201cMerciful Goddess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each Straw Hat now worshipping her in their own way Robin smiled as she let out a content chuckle. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cThis pleases me.\u201d </font></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was all still a game, but the giantess was happy she did it. Always she was serious, almost showing no emotion. This was a rare time when she just let herself go and enjoy things with something harmless and meaningless. It was making light of a dark situation. Plus if it happened to make her feel great that was just a bonus. Down at her feet she felt years of stress accumulated being slowly melted away, and Sanji\u2019s devoted affection towards her toes had her look at her feet with a slight admiration, noticing how beautiful they actually were. In her ears Robin heard the loveliest of melodies from Brooke, who got so into it he sang. On her palm Franky was dancing with his best moves; moves so scandalous Robin struggled to suppress laughter at how ridiculous they were. A small pleasurable feeling from her breast thanks to Nami had Robin feeling good too. And to top it off her two friends Chopper and Usopp were bowing to her as if she was truly a Goddess. Eight little speck-sized people, all worshipping her. Robin wasn\u2019t one to let things go to her head, but there was no denying the treatment she was getting was giving her a rush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps most surprising of it though was the fact that many of the Straw Hats were actually enjoying themselves. Sanji was able to express his unrequited love for the Goddess-sized Robin, albeit in an unusual manner. Luffy and Zoro quickly forgot they were doing a chore and it evolved into a friendly competition they were enjoying. Brooke and Franky were doing what they loved. Even Chopper and Usopp smiled a bit as they realized that their Sea Goddess wasn\u2019t going to do any harm. The only one who was hating life was Nami, who felt inadequate as a female compared to the flawless giantess she was pleasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever in the two years she spent training did Robin ever imagine that their adventures in the New World would have something like this in them. Anything could happen in the New World, but even this was just impossible. As nice as it was though, it couldn\u2019t last forever. Robin had to find a way to reverse the shrinking process. Perhaps tomorrow she could ask around the island. If it was a weather phenomenon there may be someone who knows something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that would be later, for now Robin allowed herself to just once, relax. The warm bath water continued to relieve her muscles and her friends were all pleasuring her. Though Robin found it somewhat humorous that they didn\u2019t recognize her. Sure they were small, but were they that small? It was actually somewhat interesting to think about. What does the world look like from their eyes? Could they not recognize Robin because they couldn\u2019t see that far? Did it blur out? Giggling Robin realized she was asking questions that only giants ask. Compared to her friends she was the biggest giant of them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever all good things must come to an end. An hour passed and the water turned cold long ago. Robin felt her skin begin to shrivel and each Straw Hat was nearing their limit in stamina. Except for Luffy, Sanji and Zoro, but they were animals anyway. With a sigh Robin told them to stop. \u201cYou may now stop, you\u2019ve worshipped me long enough. For such a good job I have one more reward for you\u2026\u201d Carefully Robin collected each Straw Hat and balanced them on the tip of her finger. Carefully she brought the crew to her lips, where she planted her dearest friends with one loving, eternally grateful, kiss. To them the never-ending stretch of pink enveloped them in a soft cushion of appreciation for their efforts; it was almost like a massage of their own. When Robin pulled her finger back she placed them all back on the Thousand Sunny, still safely nestled in her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">\u201cThis has been most enjoyable Straw Hats, but it\u2019s time.\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime?\u201d Nami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy grinned and erupted into cheers, \u201cTime for that feast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled as she carefully removed the Sunny from her cleavage and equally carefully left the bathtub. To the Straw Hats it was as if she stepped from the water to some outer realm countless miles away, beyond the white borders of what they assumed was the Goddess\u2019 realm, but was in fact her bathtub. Once outside Robin grabbed a towel and casually began to dry herself, unafraid of what her friends may see. \u201c<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Yes, I should prepare that feast. And perhaps later on you all could worship me again.\u201d</font> As she became more and more dry Robin slid on some clothes. At first a black bra and panties, then over top of it a pink skirt that covered most of her legs and a blue blouse that barely covered her breasts at all. With one final motion she flipped her hair back over her head and looked as she usually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that saw clothed and her hair styled like it usually was, the Straw Hats saw the familiarity in the Goddess now. \u201cHey she looks really familiar\u2026\u201d Zoro mumbled. Given the size-scale though the massive giantess was still too large to fully grasp details. The giantess turned towards the bathtub and casually scooped her friends from it, her other hand pulling the plug for the water. For a brief moment Robin considered what to do. She could confess to her friends the truth and end the game, maybe having some fun with her friends as Robin and not as Goddess of the Sea. On the other hand she enjoyed playing the part, and doing it for a little while longer wouldn\u2019t be too bad\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The thought crossed her mind to simply ease them back into her bountiful cleavage, but that would risk a chance of them seeing the others as normal human beings and hearing her ordering food. She was fine with play-acting with them, but putting up a role as a Goddess to another human being would risk looking quite ridiculous. Finally, her gaze fell upon a pair of sandals she had worn in, casually tossed aside.<i>Perfect...</i>She thought to herself, pulling them over with her free hand. and lowering the hand with her tiny occupants towards the footwear, extending a finger out till it touched the sole where they could step off.\"This is...another realm that I own. You can stay here until I have retrieved the food for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one they stepped onto the sandal, each with a mixture of disgust and weariness.\"Eww...smells like feet in here.\"Nami exclaimed, crossing her arms over her chest and staring up at the titanic goddess that blurred beyond the heavens in her stature.\"I'm terribly sorry about that...demons haunt this place, so it's not the friendliest of abodes...\"She giggled to herself as the shrieks of terror erupted from Ussopp and Chopper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DEMONS?! WE'RE GOING TO DIE!\"The Marksman screamed as he and the tiny reindeer ran around each other in circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry.\"Robin dismissed their fears with a wave of her hand.\"I'm very sure they will not harm you. You are the bravest warriors I have ever met, and I'm confident that they steer clear of you before I return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and began walking towards the door of her room, her footsteps rocking their world and sending them a good few feet into the air with every punctuating stomp.\"I will be back soon!\"She called out as she closed the door, almost to the point of laughing at the sight. Her microscopic friends thought her sandal was a whole other world, and in hindsight, it really was to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Strawhats gazed about at their newest landscape, the air acrid with feet and the ground feeling strangely like leather, stretching out in all directions for miles, and a curious massive architectural arch overhead.\"So, what do we do now?\"Franky asked, plopping his mechanical body down with a heavy thud.\"Sit tight, I suppose.\"Sanji replied, sitting down as well.\"I'm very sure our lovely Goddess will return with food fit for the gods themselves...\"Sanji went into an almost day-dream like state, relishing the thoughts of the beautiful woman and partly for the food that he one day dreamed of cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Anyone else hear that?\"Luffy said absentmindedly, piquing the interest of his crewmates. A scritching, scratchy sound could be heard right underneath their feet.\"It sounds like....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his sentence could even finish, he rolled back just as a massive form burrowed through the ground and landed before him, instinct and reactions saving the Captain.\"What...is that?\"He cried a she gazed up at a massive monster that screeched at them in an air-shattering roar.\"D-d-demon.....\"Ussopp cried as he and Chopper took cover behind the largest of their crew, Franky, each of the Strawhats arming themselves for a conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Robin ordered the food, oblivious to the fact that her friends were fighting off a shoe weevil.</span></div></div>",

For the past twenty minutes, the entirety of the Strawhats Crew, minus their archaeologist, had been fending off this beast, their attacks harmlessly bouncing off of it, they were simply too small to do any real physical harm.\"Where's that goddamned goddess?!\"Zoro shouted as he attempted to stab one of his blades into one of the monster's many legs, only for it scrape against the shell with no puncture marks. Luffy, Sanji, Franky, and Chopper(in his heavy form) were assaulting the 'demon' with physical strikes, the only result in dazing the monster and keeping it from doing and real damage to them. Brooks and Zoro's blades would only leave small scratches, and Nami's Clima-Tact generated weather attacks that it only found annoying. Overall, they were screwed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin walked in carrying a plate of meat, some exotic fruit, vegetables, a glass of grog, and a glass of water for herself. She set it down on a nearby table.\"Now, let's see how they're doing...\"She chuckled to herself, walking over to the sandals where she had left the microscopic crew, surprised to see a tiny bug being assault by the group of dust mites she called friends.\"Oh my...\"She held a hand to her mouth to stifle a laugh. It was almost...entertaining to see them struggle like that. The tiniest of insects proved to be a fierce challenge for them. It made her realize just how insignificant and helpless they really were. Their entire world and lives were in her hand and whims. She was their goddess, in a sense. Shaking her head, Robin pushed those thoughts to the back of her head. Despite their pathetically tiny size, they were still her friends, and she would have to help return them to their proper size eventually. But for now, she had a role to continue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down and with just her thumb, pressed it against the sandal's flat, squishing the bug effortlessly.\"Is everyone alright?\"She whispered, wiping the remains of the squashed terror from her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you came along! We almost died!\"Ussopp wailed, tears literally streaming down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch. We almost had it too.\"Zoro sheathed his three katanas, only to get a good whack in the back of the head from Nami.\"What our swordsman hear meant was...thank you, Goddess.\"She added, not wishing to anger such a giant being for her aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin allowed a laugh to pass.\"I'm betting you all want that food now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! FOOD!\"Luffy cried out in victory as Robin lowered her finger, a wall of skin, and in a minute's time the shrunken pirates had climbed onto the pad of skin. Robin lifted them up and set them down on the nearby table, and once they were all safely off of her finger, she sat herself down at the table as well, plucking off a piece of the meat and dumping it in front of the specks, along with a crumb of fruit and vegetables and well. As with everything they had been the past few hours, they were in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach crumb was a mountain to them in it's own right, towering to the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...a mountain of food....\"Luffy's mouth stretched wide up, a river of saliva rushing out of his jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, go ahead, don't be shy. Dig in!\"Robin said as she took a knife and cut off a square of meat for herself from the rest of the steak. With glee the specks each went to the three mountains, digging in joyously.\"Oh, almost forgot...\"Robin went on. She dipped a finger into the bottle of grog, and with a little droplet dangling from her nail, set it down next to the speck she thought was Zoro.\"I heard you rather liked your alcohol, so this is for you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T...thank you!\"Zoro replied, shocked as the ocean of golden-brown liquid before him.

Sure, it wasn't exactly culinary genius, but it had a hint of refined, old-timey flavor you would only find on a small island that they were on. It pleased the 'goddess' greatly.\"Now, my little worshipers,\"She continued as she took a small bite of the meat.\"Once our meal is done, I am to rest. You may all safely reside upon me if you wish.\"She allowed a small grin to creep onto her lips. The idea of having the microscopic crew cared for by a single body part gave her a pleasing sense of power. But, she had to be careful. They were her friends after all, and she could only take the game so far. maybe in the morning she would reveal that she was no divine deity, only truly massive to the pitifully minute pirates. Then they would laugh, and she would find a way to return them to their normal stature. All she had to do was keep a close on them all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy only ignored her thunderous words, the only though in his mind was to shove more and more of the mountainous chunk of meat before him into her bottomless stomach. His rubbery skin would expand as he took bigger and bigger bites, but despite his efforts, there was barely even a dent shown in the crumb. Still, he was utterly happy. This was his paradise, a nearly-infinite amount of meat to consume. As he shoved the handfuls of the delicacy down his gullet, the naive captain took to looking around and examine how his crew was faring. Nami was daintily having her fill of the fruit, while Ussopp and Chopper had taken to running around the massive food like a game was in play. He would have to join them later. Brook didn't seem to be eating, and Franky was gorging himself on the food as much as the captain was. The massive metal man required subsistence as well. Sanji seemed to be poking at his own food, as it weren't palatable. He was always picky if the food was not prepared by him. Lastly, Luffy could only make out Zoro swimming in the ocean of grog, switching between gulping in the alcohol and going to the surface to take in gasps of air. He would definitely be drunk for the remainder of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attention eventually came to the woman who towered overhead into a massive blur. If he was at a distance far, far away, he'd be able to fully make her out, but being so close to the gargantuan being only gave him glimpses of what she truly looked like. Oddly, even in her blurry state, the Sea Goddess kinda reminded him of his missing crewmate Robin. But that couldn't be right. With a sigh and another gulp of meat, Luffy contemplatively worried for her. Where could their archaeologist be? Surely she didn't fall off the boat? A sense of worry came upon him. She was a devil-fruit user just like him, and she'd sink like a rock if she ever came in contact with the sea's salty grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh....Miss Sea Goddess?\"Luffy shouted up, the massive woman's head tilting in his direction at the small whisper of his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Captain?\"She asked in a musingly playful tone, leaning against the table with her elbow and bringing her face closer to hear him, her beautiful features becoming his entire sky. A massive eye that replaced the sun gazed down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you're the goddess of the sea...and everything...did our friend Robin fall into your water? I'm really worried about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin quickly searched for a reply. She thought she wouldn't have to explain the case of the missing archaeologist to the specks she called friends. Another quick lie would have to be made.\"No, dear Luffy, she hasn't. But if she did, I promise that I would not have allowed her to drown. She is a precious member of your notorious crew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Sea Goddess! I was really worried about her for a moment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and felt touched for the concern for her. It left a warm feeling inside as they all continued their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Robin, however, Luffy had shot himself like a slingshot towards her plate, his mite-sized self invisible to her unfocused eyes as he switched landscapes from a wooden table to a ceramic plate, even larger continents of food shooting up around him. He had hoped to speak with her more, but it seemed she couldn't exactly hear him unless he was shouting at the top of his lungs and she was focusing dead on him. The size difference was truly uncanny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sea Goddess!\"He shouted once more, only for her to mind her own business and continue eating the world around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeeey! I'm down here!\"He begin hopping up and down, waving his arms as well to get the desired effect of being noticed. Still no dice, and even her giant fork came only inches away from him, the massive metal object crashing into the ground and picking up a country-sized piece of food in it's leaving.\"Hey! You almost hit me!\"Luffy shouted, getting a tad irritated now.\"C'mon, you could hear me earlier!\"He took in a deep breath and shouted even louder, not even gaining a bit of the giantess's attention. Unfortunately for him, her fork came down much faster than he could anticipate, giving the object was so large. It crashed directly overhead, the tinges of the fork massive overhanging arches that shook the very world he stood up, and bringing it up as well. Luffy stumbled to the ground as it along with him was raised higher and higher, their destination the gaping hole that was the sea goddess's mouth. Luffy tried stretching his arms and slingshot himself away as before, but the size difference was much too vast. He only few a couple miles, which to Robin was barely a centimeter of length. Past her full lips he went into the darkness of her mouth, the dank and humid air filling his lungs and the stench of her breath overpowering his senses. In a flash his entire view became a wild and rampant roller-coaster that wouldn't stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smacked in between chunks of food, his rubber body sending him richocheting around like a pinball, occasionally smacking into her gumline or far into her mountainous taste buds below. The worst fate came when he saw a sky of white coming down upon him like a meteor, and Luffy found himself being painfully ground up in her molars, Robin chewing away without a thought to the tiny pirate in her mouth, munching his body like bubblegum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"Luffy moaned as waves of pain cam upon him.\"Oh...oh shit!\"His reactions saved him from another mashing as he narrowly rolled off of her bottom molar into the pink below, resting himself at the very base of her mouth. He could make out the opening of her jaw, a precious source of light so far away, but manageable for one such as the future king of the pirates. He bent at his knees and placed his fist on the ground, taking in a deep breath before exclaiming \"Gear....Second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis skin took on a pinkish tone as steam rose off of his body rapidly. All that food he just ate would greatly come in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off like a blur, his body moving at hyper-fast speeds, avoiding globules of saliva and massive pieces of various foods. In less than three minutes time Luffy shot out of her mouth, falling through empty air now. He looked up to see not a sea goddess, but Robin's towering face quickly falling and becoming higher and higher. Inverting himself in mid-air, Luffy could see that he was quickly falling towards...</span></div></div>",

Even Luffy could recognize those shapes for what they were. He was falling right between Robin's breasts. Adrenaline quickly started pumping in the Captain's rubber veins as he gained a large grin. The realization this Sea Goddess was in fact his friend Robin removed any possible danger from the situation. She would never let her friends get hurt. Knowing this, Luffy let out a hearty laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!!!! Can't wait to tell everyone that Robin's a Goddess!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Luffy's rubber hand reached as far as it could to grab his friend's bosom to stop his fall. His fingers pushed roughly against her supple skin but the fingers couldn't get a hold of anything. It was too soft and squishy for Luffy to grab, especially at his size. Quickly realizing the futility of it Luffy pulled his hands back and looked to where he was falling. To him it was a canyon at least a mile or two wide with two sensual mountains on either side, but in reality Robin's cleavage was barely half an inch wide. Though still far more than enough for the rubber man to fall deep into the abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy would have fallen past Robin's chest and even further down if not for his luck. Just within his reach was his friend's bra strap. It gave just the means for the Captain to stop his descent and swing himself onto it. He stood atop the thin wire between his friend's breasts, looking up. He could no longer see Robin's face. All there was this dark chasm formed by her chest. It was like staring directly into an ominous cave in the sky. \"Sounds like fun!\" Luffy grinned at the thought. \"Gomu Gomu....\" Luffy wrapped his hands around the strap and pulled himself back, \"Rocket!\" Releasing so he could fling himself upwards like a slingshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm\" Robin licked away the final crumbs of her meal. \"That was delectable.\" Her eyes turned to her crew, all of whom seemed more than satisfied. At least as far as she could tell. She couldn't be certain given their sizes. \"You all enjoy your meal Mortals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Came the reply in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where Luffy went though.\" Usopp looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I didn't accidentally eat him.\" Robin smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't joke like that...\" Usopp shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said I was joking?\" Robin's eyes grew mischievous as she lowered her face, \"I rather think you all would make an excellent desert for this meal. In fact...\" Robin poked her tongue against the table before her friends, mere inches away though notably farther to them. \"I would suggest you run.\" Those were her last words before her tongue began to gently roll along the table towards her friends, barely moving, but going leagues faster than anything any of the Straw Hat's could hope to beat. In mere seconds her tongue would completely overtake them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew we couldn't trust her!!\" Usopp's shrill voice was filled with the familiar terror she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm too pretty to die!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...But I can't swim!!! I'm all bone no muscle Yohohoho!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no time for jokes!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terror the Straw Hat's had as they ran just gave Robin incentive to go faster. She wouldn't hurt them. She'd just...rough em up a little. If she just happened to enjoy it then oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I really am enjoying this too much. </i> The Goddess mused to herself. One by one she felt them, minuscule specks barely registering on her tongue but she felt each of them succumb to the appendage. In the end even the almighty Straw Hats were nothing against Robin's tongue. Stifling a soft chuckle Robin rolled her tongue back into her mouth, gently swaying her shrunken friends inside. She was being as nice as she could but no doubt to them it was one of the most grueling and fierce experiences they ever had. Even Robin's breathing blew them aside like the bugs they were. Her breathing alone dominated their fates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor safety's sake though Robin quickly spat out everyone onto her empty plate. \"Pardon the rough housing but being a Goddess can get boring sometimes. So I often feel the need for excitement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think for one second that we will buy that then you have another thi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course my darling Goddess! Anything for you my dear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled, \"Thank you Sanji. I think I'll take you on that...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robin smiled, eyeing the more than minute specks down on her plate, no doubt gazing up to her titanically towering frame. As a little teasing joke, she hefted her breasts up to rest on the table, pressing against the plate the small Strawhats stood on. To the microscopic pirates, every action of the 'Sea Goddess' created earth-quaking rumbles and explosive booms that no doubt would cause hearing damage. Her monumental breasts appeared simply as a neverending wall before them, Sanji already nosebleeding and worshiping at the sight of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe archaeologist giggled to herself, leaning against the table, chest pressing closer towards the plate, pushing a bit of cleavage out of the top of the thin fabric. She was just...having too much fun being a goddess right now. Perhaps she would postpone telling them the truth. Truly, what was the harm in it? As long as she kept an eye on them all, and didn't have 'too much' fun, she could always revert them back to normal size somehow. There was always something out that could fix there problem, whether it be some mystical artifact, a power that be, or even another devil fruit user.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf not, well...Robin paused to think of what would happen if she could not return her tiny friends to their former statures. What would become of their voyage? No doubt Luffy could become Pirate King if a speck of dust was bigger than him, as well for the others. She supposed she could simply continue the farce as Sea Goddess for as long as she could, maybe get a droplet of water in her cleavage and let the Thousand Sunny float around in it as a false ocean, or possibly come clean to them and keep them all as tiny companions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled at the thought of all of them as little pets, used for her to call them cute and to toy with for her amusement. She'd most certainly take care of them to the best of her abilities, how hard could it be? A crumb food was a whole mountain to them, a droplet of water an ocean. They even had their ship to lay their heads down in every night, so sleeping and shelter would be no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Goddess?\" Nami called up as loudly as she could, interrupting her thoughts. Robin blinked a bit, looking down. It seemed she had gotten lost in thought, and was gazing ahead at the wall in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....what is it, speck?\" She asked, coughing to deepen her voice and taken on her 'goddess' tone once again, no doubt lowering it sending ear-splitting thunder booms with every syllable of her words and a windstorm with every inhale and exhale of her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just....sat there for a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking.\" The black-haired beauty replied quickly. \"Of what to do, that is. You all did agree to lighten my mood and entertain me for a while.\" She giggled lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd do anything for you! Myself especially.\" The chef called up so giddily, most of his fellow crewmates simply too tired with his actions to knock him over the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Robin tapped her chin thoughtfully. \"Start running again.\" She said in a tone that obviously meant her words as a command not to be denied. At once the strawhats took off in the opposite direction from her godlike visage, dashing across the landscape of the ceramic plate. Sanji and Zoro took the lead with their much more advanced stamina and speed, Chopper quickly behind in his jumping point self, Ussopp not too far behind as well, a coward's fear and speed helping him in a panic. Nami and Brook were somewhere in between speeds, and Franky lumbered behind due to his mechanical form, but keeping a pretty steady pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, to Robin above, it looked like they weren't even moving at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stifled a chuckle. \"Really? Are you all even trying?\" She asked, raising her hand over the plate and hovering a finger like a sign of doom over the near-microscopic pirates trying their hardest to run. \"Or are you mortals so tiny to me that not even the greatest of speeds could outmatch my size?\" Nico Robin giggled, slowly lowering her finger, the sky above simply flesh etched with the canyons of her fingerprint lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Robin merely rolled her eyes and finally slammed her finger down onto the plate, her nail making a light scratch noise against it. Fortunately, the small strawhats had made just enough distance to avoid ending up neath the appendage, though the boom and shattering earthquake generated from Robin just tapping the plate knocked them all off their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, perhaps we need something more...challenging to you Strawhats.\" The false goddess mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could be more challenging than avoiding a finger as big as a continent?!\" Ussopp cried up between his panting breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avoiding a breast the size of a continent.\" Robin said, rearing her upper torso upwards so that her right breast was positioned just so over the plate, casting a dark shadow for countless miles. \"I believe you all know what to do.\" She said quite happily, though a bit of menace in her tone. Robin mentally smiled to herself. She wouldn't actually lower her breast all the way down, that would no doubt end her friends. She'd just...tease them. Perhaps later she could hover her pinky toe over them, or even allow them a chance to explore her like a world itself? She smirked, imagining giving Nami an order to start mapping her body. She could just see them exploring the inside of her ear, while cleaning out ear wax, or them trekking across the soft fields of one of her butt cheeks, or the vast jungle of a few strands of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd definitely be keeping up this little game for a while.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slowly, ever so slowly, every actions of hers no matter how minute, was vast and powerful to the tiny micros below, so Robin lowered her breast at an agonizingly slow pace to relish every moment. She chuckled at the thought, just the simple action of her mammary mushing into the plate powerful enough to easily reduce them to microscopic paste at a whim's notice. But she wouldn't do that, no, she'd hover it and slowly bring it down for a minute or two, then bring it back up to continue whatever game she could think of next. This all was so entertaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverhead, the sky of Robin's chest seemed to loom ominously, growing closer and closer by the second, and no matter how fast they could run, the Strawhats knew that they couldn't outrun something and powerful as a goddess's tit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all doomed! We're gonna be crushed!\" Ussopp screeched in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself! I'm gonna love going out like this!\" Sanji cackled so happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up loverboy...\" Nami sighed, she would love to hit him right about now if he wasn't so far ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yohohohoho! I would much rather end my life in her panties!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Strawhats merely shouted in fear or jokingly at one another as Robin's boob only descended more and more towards them, now close enough that some parts of the soft flesh was meeting the plate landscape, making powerful booms in the distance that only gave them more incentive to run faster, but even these endurance monsters had their limits, and it seemed they all would be reaching an end soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, instead of just a massive, sky-filling blur, her ever-increasing breast began to take definite form above. The tinies could actually make out the roundness of it, the swell, the sheer size and softness, even the fabric thread lines of her clothing. At this, their local green-haired swordsman paused, getting an idea. \"Oi! Everyone follow me!\" He shouted, readying himself as the breast seemed to come crashing down around them, so close to crushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! I'm not gonna follow you!\" Sanji retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and actually listen to me for a moment!\" Zoro said back through gritted teeth. He definitely did not want to argue right about now. He looked at his fellow crewmates and pointed up to a nearby loose strand of fabric, one that was hanging off of the Sea Goddess's top close enough for them to grab onto, and hopefully even avoid getting boob-crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of their eyes lit up in realization at this, and at once began to ready themselves to head for it. Zoro, Sanji, and Chopper were the first to leap up the great distance and latch onto it, Franky giving Ussopp, Nami, and Brook a good toss up there for them to grab on. The cyborg himself, well, let's just say it involve cola bubbles and his inflating ass to shoot up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were all safely onboard the fabric strand, they all seemed to sigh in relief. Zoro raised an eyebrow at Sanji, frowning. \"I thought you wanted to get crushed by the Sea Goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Sanji dismissed the swordsman casually with a puff of smoke from his near-constant cigarette. \"This way, I can worship her more.\" The cook chuckled, pointing upwards. High above, their sky was still pretty much boob, but in a different way. Through strands of clothing fabric, all so big and the distance between them unreal, a sky of soft pink greeted them, Robin's vast country-sized nipple poking past the shirt and bra fabric. \"Ahh, so beautiful.\" Sanji sighed in admiration, flicking away his used cigarette and allowing one last stream of smoke to escape his lips along with his happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Whatever.\" Zoro sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, least we're safe now.\" Nami sighed, sitting down onto the large fabric strand, it being thick enough to easily house a platoon of ships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but fer how long?\" Franky asked the real question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin had gotten lost in thought once again, smiling to herself, breast fully pressing down onto the plate dreamily. She was thinking of letting the tiny microbes cleaning food from in-between the white mountains of her teeth, massaging with all their might just a fraction of her sole, even exploring the vast, vast cavern of her womanhood. She cooed in delight, but blinked and quickly realized what was going up. In a panic she reared back up, looking down at the plate, eyes scanning intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't find anything, so sign or sight of her microscopic mates. \"Ohh...\" She grimaced, wondering if she had actually crushed her friends in her daydream. In her search, her eyes roved frantically over the plate, and even her own chest. Finally, she saw some tiny, tiny movement right near the edge of where her nipple was. On further inspection, she found it to be the micro-pirates. The raven-haired woman sighed in great relief, using her nail to retrieve them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You...survived my test. Congratulations!\" She said, trying to hold back her tone of worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We almost got crushed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you all will receive a reward...\"</span></div></div>",

She could now continue her fun little games, and the Sea Goddess was not done yet toying with these pitiful mortals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This little reward is quite a...large one.\" Robin giggled a bit, sending a volley of powerful breaths their way, nearly blowing them right off the edge of her nail. \"As a goddess, I own many a realms, ranging from the sea itself to many others. Myself is a realm included.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, indeed, for one so godlike and vast, I am an uncharted realm all my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say...uncharted?\" Nami piqued curiously, her navigator senses tingling a bit. Her hand itched, and she knew she would have a chance at drawing new maps soon to places nobody else has been before. Sure, it wasn't a god's fortune in gold and jewels, but it was the next best thing for her, literally a 'god' as a wolrd, unexplored and unconquered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like where this is going...\" Ussopp whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do!\" Sanji cackled happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nami has a strange look in her eye.\" Chopper observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first, allow me to help you retrieve some supplies.\" Robin stated, walking back over to the pair of sandals she had placed the Strawhats on before when she went to go retrieve some good. Just as were, the infinitesimal speck of the Thousand Sunny was still there, resting on the bed of her footwear. She smiled, lowering her nail slowly and as gently as possible, setting them all down near the small ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gather as much as you want. I will return in a few minutes so that you may begin your trek...across me. It's sure to be a grand adventure.\" She smirked with a light chuckle, standing back up to her full height, looming so high above even the word 'big' could hardly describe her titanic stature, putting anything else considered a large size to shame. She then walked off, every earth-shattering step sending the tiny pirates a few inches into the air, until she disappeared, no doubt into another realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all climbed aboard their ship, glad to be in familiar surroundings, each of them heading to their respective rooms for at least a moment's reprieve of rest. Nami smiled, browsing through her own private collection of empty maps and drawing tools, hefting them all together into a satchel that Sanji would be carrying for her. She briefly looked over the empty room, one she shared with Robin, and still worried of just where their archaeologist, as well as their captain, had disappeared to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were all ready, stowed up with supplies in backpacks for the possible long road ahead, they all waited on the deck of the ship for the Sea Goddess to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Robin smiled in the bathroom, slipping off her clothing piece by piece until she was fully in the nude once more. She thought that to keep an eye on her tiny little crewmates, she would need to be bare so see them, and clothes would simply get in the way. Plus, she laughed a bit at this thought, what need did a goddess have for clothes? With a sway of her hips, she strutted her divine form back towards her sandals lying on the ground, their tiny occupants awaiting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I return, specks.\" Robin announced, slamming down her bare feet powerfully in front of the sandals, smiling and wondering just how near-cataclysmic those earthquakes to them below. \"Now, are you ready for your adventure?\" She asked, kneeling down and holding out her nail towards the ship, the small specks soon atop the edge of her manicured nail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" She stood back up, bringing her nail up to her eye to examine them. \"Where would you like to go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anywhere you desire, uh, my goddess.\" Nami replied, still eager to get on the Sea Goddess's good side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Toe Mountains</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seven minute specks all walked along a desert landscape of flesh, the air humid however, and smelling of a combination of feet, sweat, but just a hint of lotion and oil. They were somewhere atop of Robin's big toe, avoiding falling into her toeprint lines that were almost like vast and deep canyons, occasionally running into the dirt speck or piece of lint, which they promptly removed due to the orders of the titanic goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...not much to map here. Pretty much a barren land, hard to climb too.\" Nami noted, drawing more and more detailed notes on her map of the appendage, looking in the distance. Beyond the landscape of the toe, she could make out blurs in the distance wiggling, awaiting their mapping as well. The redhead sighed, pulling out four more maps for the 'Toe Mountains' as she had dubbed, despite the fact that they were larger and so much more vast than any mountain could ever be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps Toe Country instead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nippleton</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would somebody please calm him down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh let him be, Yohoho! He seems to be enjoying himself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji's whole body was pressed into the soft pink landscape, furiously kissing it and groping about. Booming moans above from Robin only gave him more incentive to continue his exploits to the sensitive nipple, which was rumbling quite powerfully as it slowly became erect. Nami merely shrugged and rolled her eyes, sketching out various landmarks, like bumps in the skin and how the nipple seemed to create more of a landscape when it was erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Glutesberg</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just...neverending. In every direction, all the eye could see was soft flesh one could worship eternally, which Sanji was at once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You're such an ass-kisser.\" Zoro muttered to the blonde chef, rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the point.\" Robin's thundering voice giggled in the distance, sending a wiggle to her rear as she laid on her stomach, nearly sending the pirates flying off or into the abyss of between her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I dub this place, Glutesberg.\" Nami stated, finishing up another map. Most of them were actually empty besides a few notes. Everywhere they went it was just....so big, so vast, impossible to map unless she had years and years to do so, and Nami did not want to be spending her golden years into old age walking over this sea goddess. She was getting kind of tired of all of this.</span></div></div>",

With her friends safely onboard her nail and not squished by her vast chest, she had contemplated returning them to their normal sizes as quickly as possible now, negating any thoughts earlier of continuing to toy with them. Being so small, literally any part of her could crush them, and even the smallest of objects could pose as something deadly to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You uh...seemed to drift off a bit there.\" Nami replied cautiously. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am quite fine.\" She dismissed Nami with a good boom of words. \"I just...recalled that I have another realm to be in right now. Other gods to converse with, other mortals to speak to.

If you leave it, I shall be....most disappointed. Am I understood?\" She said in as cold as a tone as possible to make herself threatening. It wasn't even needed, her ear-splitting volume was all they heard. Once she was certain they all agreed, Robin nodded down to them. \"Good.\" She stated simply, setting them down on her sandal bed near the Thousand Sunny, waiting until the specks were on the slightly bigger speck ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Robin was off to try and see what she could find out about any local legends or lore about shrinking storms. She made sure to lock the door behind her so no one else could get into her inn room, her key nestled safely in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stepped out of the small inn she was currently residing in, the sky clear and the day sunny from the rain last night. A few of the villagers were out, and Robin nodded to herself. The historian and mythologist inside her buzzed, eager to see what she could pull up about the island. She first tried the marketplace, but nothing there that could help. Next, a bookshop, some local myths and legends were heard, but nothing on a storm that could shrink people down to microscopic heights.</span></div></div>",

Their colorful demeanor and lovely smell did nothing to improve her mood over the fact that she had failed as a researcher, something she prided herself in when it dealt with strange myths. Even the local library had no such thing in its records. To be fair though, the library was very small, and the island itself was tiny, not even on any current map. It was just by happenstance that the Strawhats had decided to dock at this unknown port town for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think...\" Robin muttered aloud to herself, leaning with her elbows propped up on her legs and her chin resting in the palm of her hand, using her pointer finger to tap her cheek in thought. No thought came to mind from the vast and many thoughts she had on various ancient topics of lore. Some did have many myths and legends about size-changing, but most were about giants becoming human sized or vice versa through a devil fruit, nothing on weather phenomena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps...there was no true way to return her friends and crewmates to their normal statures. They could be fated to spend the rest of their days as microscopic mites, never again be able to do as what a normal-sized being could do. How would  she break it to them? That their dreams could never happen? That they all would have to rely on her for nearly everything, from traveling and protection. She could only imagine how much a bruise to her more powerful crewmates egos it would be, that not even some of their strongest attacks could even tickle a child's country-sized pinkie toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeatedly she buried her face in her hands, long black hair draping over her in a cloak of shame. Robin felt terrible, as if the whole situation was her fault alone, despite the fact she could have easily been on the ship when it shrank as well. How would that have gone if she became small too? They would have just endlessly floated in the docking port's waters...occasionally hearing a distant boom, fighting off tiny crustaceans and fish, until eventually something so much vaster crushed them. What a terrible existence it would've been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" She looked up, trying to get away from the horrid and depressing thoughts, eyes open again to the lovely, sunny day before her. She almost envied the townsfolk around her, wandering blissfully about their small village. Children played, bakers baked, fishers fished, mothers cared, and elders sat stoically, overlooking it all with old yet keen eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made Robin perk up. The village elders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly stood up and walked across the village's length to them all sitting on a porch in rickety chairs, three of them in total, all looking at her curiously as she approached. They were what one would expect from elders: frail-looking, hunched over, bearded and wizened. Perfect. Perhaps they would know something to aid in the re-enlargement of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon.\" Robin greeted with a small bow, placing a gentle smile on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello young lady, what brings you to speak with old geezers like ourselves?\" One chuckled dryly, having a coughing fit afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...have some questions if you don't mind answering them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" Another shook his head. \"It's our job to share knowledge. What ponders ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...does this island get any strange weather?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Define strange, young lady. We live in a strange, strange world indeed.\" The third one grinned a toothless, gummy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...would thunder and lightning...and possibly rain...shrink something around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three grinned knowingly. \"Why yes, it would dear. The Shrink Storms are very rare, and happen roughly two or three times a year, all in quick succession of one another. Why, just the other day we had one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. It shrank my friends and our ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing you weren't in it! Glad your nakama have you to take care of them, though they might have to get used to looking up and up and up...and up to you from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there no way to reverse it?\" She asked, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elders shared a glance between themselves. \"Not that we know of dear. In all of our old times, we have never encountered anything that would reverse the effects of the storm. What's shrunken, stays shrunken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't believe that.\" Robin shook her head, refusing to come to grips with the situation. She and her crew had faced impossible odds before where it seemed there was no other way, and she would not stop now. That indomitable willpower of Luffy's had rubbed off on all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to say, but you have to-\" One of the elders paused to see that another one of them raised his hand to quiet him. This one coughed before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...you could always head more inland, to the other side of the island where the storms come from. Maybe the town on the other side can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Robin nodded. \"Where is it exactly on the island? Is there a path I can take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you won't find it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And why's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's shrunken. Legend says they dabbled in terrible arts, angering the gods, so the shrink storm was there curse, reducing their own residence smaller than the eye could see, forever lost amongst towering blades of grass and insects as lumbering mountains, but the storm still originates from where the reduced lay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thank you for your help.\" Robin nodded, giving another bow before heading off in the opposite direction. She knew just what she had to do, find the shrunken village and see if any of them could help. She chuckled again, thinking of how small it would be, barely big enough to cover a fraction of her fingertip, then remembered...what if it had been crushed long ago? She hoped it still remained somewhere unharmed. It was really the only lead she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stopped by the local marketplace to purchase supplies, namely a magnifying glass and some food, Robin was unaware of a tiny, tiny red speck climbing into her ear canal after a long trek there, Monkey D. Luffy exhaustedly collapsing into a pile of yellow ear wax, not even caring how gross it was.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After gathering her supply's Robin headed out. If what the village elders said was true then there was at least a chance of restoring her friends back to normal size. With that said Robin began her search, luckily for her the island they were on was fairly small, besides the port and small town the rest of the island was mainly plains and small forests. But there in lied the problem, the island was small, the forest was small and the plains were small, but the shrunken village had to be near micro sized. If the Sunny was small enough to dock in a droplet of liquid then the village wouldn't even take up her entire finger tip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus Robin began her looooooong search for something that might not even exist. She spent hours trekking along the plains and examining every blade of grass in the plain, luckily with her devil fruit power and her many magnifying glasses she was able to make much quicker work of what would take a normal person days, she accomplished it in a few hours. From the plain she moved onto the forest which was smaller than the plain but there were far more places to search. Taking a moment to herself Robin allowed her thoughts to wander from the task at hand to think about her crew. She had left them in her sandal by the foot of her bed, luckily before leaving Robin had made sure to send one of her flower-flower clones to the room to let them know that their \"Sea- Goddess\" would be away for a while and they were to wait patiently for her to return. Robin having been worried about another bug attack had placed the sandels on top of a box with insect repellent sprayed all around the area, she had also left them a few crumbs of food and a droplet of water and grogg so at the very least they should be confortable and safe til she returns. As much fun as being a sea goddess was Robin knew she had to return her friends to normal size, they would never survive in this world at their micro-size, hell they had almost been killed several times today, including by Robin herself! Robin had been relieved she hadn't crushed them with her breast but it was at that point she knew she could no longer have her friends suffer at such a diminiutive stature. Snapping back into reality Robin continued her search, creating hundreds of eyes and hands to search every inch of the forest with magnifying glasses Robin began her long search, Meanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Robin she was carrying a teeny-tiny passenger with her. A very special passenger, her captain Luffy. Luffy had managed to survive Robin's valley like cleavage and had begun his accent towards the beautiful goddess' ear, hoping he can get her attention somehow. Trying to climb whilst an extremely Titanic being is moving is one of the hardest things Luffy has ever had to do, every step, every slight movement, he'll every heart best from his gigantic crewmate made the journey more difficult. But Luffy was a resilient one, he relished the challenge and kept climbing Robin. He accented from her valley like cleavage and trekked up her enormous country like breasts, Sanji would be jealous at what Luffy was doing had he any knowledge, but to Luffy this was all one extremely big adventure! Hours passed and eventually Luffy reached Halfway between Robins ear and her shoulder with himself hanging onto her hair and trying to cling on whilst also positioning himself to try and reach the summit of his climb, Robin's ear. \"Man this has been longest journey ever! I can't wait to tell Robin all about it when it get up there!!!\" Luffy proclaimed happy as can be. With one final action he switched to gear second and launched himself from Robins hair all the way to her hair, he must have travellled a fair few miles as the journey took several minutes before he landed in the canal on Robins ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Robin sat down on a tree stump exhausted from her day of searching for the village. She began thinking to herself that all this had bene a waste of time and that the village if it had even existed was long gone, crushed by a falling twig or eaten by a hungry bird. She would have to make a decision, whether she should tell her fiends or their predicament or simply continue the ruse as their sea Goddess and let them continue their journey with her pulling all the strings and fabricating reality. Robin actually felt sad at this notion, her friends would never fulfill their goals an Robin would never fulfill hers, they neeeded each other and they needed to all be normal sized. With one final sigh of despair Robin stood back up and prepared to Head back to the village and make a tough decision, Luffy meanwhile prepared to shout as loud as he could to get his friends attention but just before he could he was interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those who search for the truth, approach now and have all your questions answered\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stopped dead in her tracks and turned around. There was no one there. \"Did I imagine that? Or did someone call out to me?\" thought Robin.  Once again the voice rang out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those who search the Truth, approach now and have all your questions answered.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Robin knew she had heard it. \"Hello? Is anyone there? I wish to know the truth!\" Robin had no idea who or what it was but she had to try, maybe there was someone out there who could help them. After a few seconds silence Robin heard the voice speak again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, you may approach\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stood there confused. \"Approach?\" She said as she looked in every  direction, only to see the forest, \"what do they me...\" Robin trailed off as just to the left of her beside the tree stump she had been sitting, shone a bright blue light that  was almost blinding. In her ear Luffy was also blinded by the light and panicked as Robin began moving again. He was tossed about in her ear banging odd the sides before landing a patch of ear wax. \"Yuck, If I make it through this I'm gonna let Robin know about this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several moments the light stopped and Robin approached the source. Crouching down she would just about make out a small speck under a small leaf, taking out her magnifying glass she lowered herself down even further to the point her face was almost touching the ground, she let out a small gasp. There under her magnifying glass was a tiny village with lights, houses and people who were staring up at her. This was it she had found the shrunken village that had caused the shrinking in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luffy let out a massive sigh of relief as he slammed himself face first into a a coat of yellow ear wax, breathing heavily and not even minding how gross the situation was. The trip up to Robin's ear had been in the very best a microscopic escapade for the shrunken captain. Being so small, everything was escalated to the highest of dangers and actions for him, and trying to climb a moving 'goddess' while being smaller than a mite of dust was quite the task, but nobody could say Luffy hadn't accomplished the impossible before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis rubber body, incredible durability, strength, speed, and indomitable willpower had been factors that had aided him in his little adventure across Robin's titanic form. He had found himself lost in the fabric threads of her clothing for a while, fallen right back down into her bountiful cleavage and struggled to free himself from the soft fleshy grip of her two luscious orbs, somehow ended up inside one of her nostrils, and eventually ended up dangling from the very bottom of her ear lobe. Not wanting to risk another massively multi-mile plummet once again, he ricocheted himself up like a slingshot with his elastic limbs, occasionally having to grab another patch of skin and send himself flying upwards again. Eventually, he had reached the bottom edge of the ear canal, which is where he now found himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute's break, Luffy lifted himself back up to his feet, stretching to work out a few kinks in his muscles. Every so often he could hear a distant boom echoing far away, a combination of Robin walking, breathing, and simply moving. Her speech alone acted as a magnified thunderstorm, but she had gone quiet now. The Strawhat had been there with her conversation, so at least he knew what was going on. Very simple plan, get Robin's attention, find the micro village and restore his crew back to fighting size. Easy and simple in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gazed out into the vast, vast cavern of the insides of his archaeologist's ear. It was dark for sure, barely illuminated from the light filtering in from the opening, and nearly every last inch was covered in varying layers of thickness of wax. To a normal sized person, all of this was barely even noticeable, but to one the stature of Luffy, even the most miniscule of details was noticeable and enlarged greatly. \"Yuck.\" Luffy gagged, sticking out his tongue and spitting out a large chunk of yellow goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yosh! Let's see if I can get Robin to hear me.\" He said to himself, cupping his hands around his mouth and began shouting. \"Oi! Robin! It's me, Luffy!\" He yelled, but no reply came from the giga giantess. He repeated shouting that a couple times before he began shouting louder and louder by the second, screaming nearly. He was none for being a loudmouth at times. Finally, the puny pirate had had enough and was impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph.\" Luffy huffed, taking a deep breath in and sucking in air quickly. His entire torso began to swell and expand with the large intake of air, his rubber form ballooning out in a ridiculously cartoony way. When he was satisfied with how much he had breathed in, now roughly three times his original size and looking quite silly, Luffy let it out. \"ROBIN! IT'S ME, LUFFY! I'M INSIDE YOUR EAAAAAARRRRRRRRR!\" He let loose his voice, echoing inside the massive cave of her ear canal, expelling out every bit of air and shouting at the top of his lungs. The question is though, did Robin hear her tiny captain?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A small rocking motion awoke the captain of the Strawhat Pirates. Now, it was expected for a pirate ship to rock to and fro while on the open seas, but this one was much more violent and forced than the gentle waves that carried them on through the night. A possible storm was coming up, sending the waves into a choppy motion. Monkey D. Luffy jumped up and snatched his signature strawhat from around his neck, positioning it on his head. He grinned as he stepped on deck, expecting pouring rain to greet him. He always loved storms. The violent swaying of the ship, the thrill of standing in hurricanes and typhoons whilst his crew scurried about to procure the safety of the ship. It gave him joy like no other. Expect maybe meat, meat was good. Really good. It was one of the best things ever to him. But instead of black skies and a writhing ocean, all he saw was a blurry outlined world with a big, peach-colored mountain in front of them. Somehow, the Thousand Sunny had ended up on solid ground in front of a mountain. Now, odder things had happened to them before, but this was definitely up there in the strange factor. An entire ocean just doesn't get up and dissapear. At least, not without reason in this zany world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one the remainder of the crew left their quarters and stood around Luffy, each one grumbling in a different manner to their interrupted sleep. All except one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi! What was that racket earlier?!\"Zoro grunted out, rubbing his green hair back into it's spikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno.\"Luffy shrugged with his usual grin.\"But there's a mountain here now.\"He pointed behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does a mountain just pop up right in the middle of an ocean?\"Sanji questioned, already lighting a cigarette and taking slow, smooth puffs of it, clouds of grey slowly rising with his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there is no ocean now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the mountain drained it all away? Like...it fell out of the sky and made a big hole that sucked up all the water!\"The juvenile captain allowed his imagination to play on this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's highly unlikely...\"Robin pertained to the conversation, looking over the side of the ship, finding that Luffy's words rang true. Nothing but a dry terrain that appeared to be a consistency of wood greeted her.\"...He's right. How very...odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All ashore that's going ashore!\"Luffy exclaimed as he jumped overboard, landing on the ground with a light <i>tick</i> of his sandals. The rest followed, Sanji and Zoro landing lightly next to Luffy, Ussop and Chopper bumbling out, Robin daintily using her devil fruit power to create a stairway of hands to descend down upon, Brooks tumbling to the ground in a heap of clattering bones, and Franky to come down a heavy metallic crash. They all looked out towards the only recognizable landmark for miles, that mountain. It was big, as all mountains were, but it seemed to be part of a mountain range, a series of smaller mountains beside it in a set of five, each one an odd skin color and giving off a peculiar odor that wafted heavily through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Wanna go explore it?\"Luffy asked, only to dash off without getting any real answer from his crew. He knew they'd follow anyway. In only a minute's time they were all running towards the mountain, not knowing what they were to expect when they reached it. They've run into many a curious things across their travels, ranging from men trapped in treasure chests to warring giants to cities in the skies, so anything that lived on this mountain was bound to be eccentric, or at least helpful to them for getting their ship back onto the ocean and find their missing mapmaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they approached it thirty minutes later, the strength of the smell that permeated the air only intensified, giving off a scent of sweat and feet.\"Man...this stinks.\"Luffy said through a pinched nose.\"I thought that this would be another fun adventure...not one that smelled bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this mountain does seem....toelike? I want to say it's toelike...\"Robin replied, approaching the base of the mountain and placing a hand against it, surprised to find that the surface was incredibly soft, and upon further inspection, gave off the texture of a print that skin would hold. As curious as her, each of the strawhats placed their palm against the colossal object, stroking it and rubbing their hands up and down to try and figure out whatever this mountain was made of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...?\"Luffy looked around, expecting one of his nakama to be the source of the satisfied sound, but each one was too busy with examining the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels nice...a little massage...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, but this time more thunderous, as if coming from above. Luffy gazed up past the summit of the mountain to see if he could make out whatever laid beyond it, and was surprised to find an eye staring back down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're touching a giant.\"He pointed up to the eye, and immediately they all jumped away from the mountain, now obviously a giant's toe. But they had never seen such a massive being, one that even dwarfed the mighty Oars with such stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\"Luffy called up, obviously unfazed by the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Luffy.\"The giant called down, the voice sounding awfully feminine. They were dealing with a giantess instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda obvious, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound of wind and movement, and the giantess leaned down closer, filling the sky with her face. A mile-wide grin from Nami greeted them, and they all were in shock.\"Nami?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\"She giggled, a roar to the smaller pirates.\"Isn't it neat! The shrinking worked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you shrank us?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first I thought that it wouldn't work...y'know how unreliable merchants can be, but that gem I bought the other day,\"She pulled it out, a very bland stone in appearance, but apparently with magical properties.\"It actually shrank you guys! And you're all so cute too.\"The orange-headed woman chuckled. Indeed they were small. She gauged they were all about a fraction of an inch tall, and the Thousand Sunny was simply a small toy she could cup in the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you uh....make us bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddaya mean, 'NOPE'?!\"Zoro shouted, obvious anger in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Nami-swan, I don't care if I'm big or small, you're still a beautiful sight to behold.\"Sanji swooned over the gigantic woman with hearts in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can it, lover-boy!\"Zoro threatened the chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why won't you return us to our normal heights, Nami?\"Robin asked, ever the logical voice amidst a troupe of clowns she called friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking we could play a bit, y'know...\"She giggled, only her tone didn't sound playful at all.</span></div></div>",

Of all his companions he was the only one so eager though, except perhaps Brooke who seemed at a loss for words..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Play...?\" Chopper repeated hopefully, eyeing the other Straw Hats for guidance. His gaze fell upon Usopp who reacted promptly by sweating his outfit wet and nervously stammering out, \"At your size the slightest little move can crush us Nami, don't do this. I have Do-Not-Want-To-Be-Crushed Syndrome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun!\" Came a shout followed by their captain's hearty laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say Mr. Rubber Man! If you get crushed you'll just get flattened and puff back out like a balloon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually wouldn't mind seeing that. It could be a fascinating test of his powers.\" Robin calmly chirped in, completely confident Nami wouldn't hurt them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs each of the minute specks between her toes kept playing off each other Nami only continued to look at them with her grin.To them she was the giant of giants, bigger than anything else in the sea. To her they just looked like an array of dirt specks between her toes, less than ants. What she was about to do felt almost natural given the differences in their stature. With a soft couple taps of her toes she rumbled her sandals enough all her companions fell on their bottoms. <i>Ha! Even my toes make them tremble!</i> She thought playfully, next came the fun part. While everyone was flat on their backs and eyes up above them a familiar shadow engulfed any light for miles. Nami's big toe was now directly over all of her friends, and it didn't take a genius to figure out what came next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's gonna crush us!!!!!!\" The shrill shriek of Usopp was predictable, as was him fumbling to his feet and running for it. <i>Run as fast as you want you will never leave my big toe in time.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nami what are you doing?!\" That one sounded high-pitched enough to be Chopper but Nami couldn't be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just taking care of a few bugs.\" The giantess smiled smugly as her toe lowered itself onto the group, crushing all of them beneath it's massive form. Small as they were nothing ever felt as satisfying as seeing everyone struggle against the lowest part of Nami's body and fail miserably. She could see Usopp, Chopper, and Brooke all run for their lives. She spotted the others all try to fight off her toe in a single, unified attack. None of it made a difference. It didn't even tickle. The Straw Hat's were bested by the big toe of a redhead not even trying. Funny enough the most feeling Nami got out of the few seconds it took was the final squish of feeling all their bodies against her toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now to check...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami raised her toe again to find nothing where it once was. None of her friends nor any blood or signs there were injured. \"There's no way...\" She said with half a laugh. The gigantess tilted her foot slightly to examine the bottom of her toe. Sure enough, everyone was their, trapped in the ridges of her toe print like bits of dirt. It was just too much, Nami burst out into hysterical laughter at the sight. It took a minute for her to calm down enough to gently scrape all of the bodies from her toe back to their spots between them. They were all a bit battered and disgruntled but otherwise the Straw Hats were all fine; as the Navigator knew they would be. She gave them all a moment to regain themselves, half tempted to squeeze her toes together to re-live the fun she had mere moments ago. But she kept herself in check and held in the urge...for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT FOR?!?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat angry roar could only belong to Zoro, not surprising he would be the first to get upset. \"Just a bit of fun.\" Nami shrugged nonchalantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could've killed us!\" Shrill and terrified, definitely Usopp again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't.\" Nami winked, \"The same guy who gave me this also told me anything I shrank would be fine. People and objects once shrunken can't be crushed. \" She toyed with her gem between her fingers while explaining it all. \"Once I found out it actually shrank you guys I figured the rest was true too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if it wasn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence that the giantess responded with wasn't very encouraging. \"But you guys lived just fine so it's all good right?!\" She perked up immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell! I got some of your damn foot caught in my mouth. When was the last time you washed?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yohohoho...I have to say Nami as lovely as you are at this size. I'd rather not go through that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was kind of fun!\" Nami saw the speck-sized Zoro smack their Captain over the head for that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys might wanna take some of Luffy's enthusiasm. I'm just getting started.\" Nami's eyes caught that scary gleam she only had when there was profit in it for her. \"After all, I got a bunch more toes.\" It was mainly a coy, playful little threat but she fully intended to follow through should one of her friends upset her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this Nami?\" Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large-brown eyes shifted to the only shrunken woman in the group, \"No real reason though I guess if I had to have one...it would probably be because I'm the weakest in the crew. I mean, even Usopp could beat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I could...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-So just once I want to know what it's like to be the ridiculously strong here one. Strong enough with the slightest whim I can dominate you in every way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can dominate me all day Nami!!!\" Sanji briefly calmed down when things got serious but now that he knew it was safe he was back to his perverted self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it!\" Nami responded by stomping her toe again with a dark grin. When her toe raised she saw the specks fall back to her sandal's sole. \"I'm bored of talking. From now on it'll just be what I want. And the first rule of Queen Nami is no more bugs talking to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen Nami? What are you dru-\" Another toe stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami relished in the devious role she cast herself in. \"I can do this all day. But I have other things planned for you all...\"</span></div></div>",

The gem's power it gave her was so amazing, she felt invincible, and to the tiny Strawhats, she was. Just with a thought and a flash, she could shrink anything she desired, from a person to a whole island. She would definitely have to play with the gem's powers later on, but for now she had tinies to deal with and plenty of collected cash to spend in a marketplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted up her toe more slowly this time, smirking as she saw the specks all flattened onto the bed of her sandal. She shifted her foot slightly so that they were once again positioned tween her toes. \"Now, listen up.\" She boomed in a stern, waggling a finger down at them. \"Queen Nami is going to go out shopping.\" The navigator proclaimed in a most mock-regal tone. She once again giggled to herself. <i>Queen Nami! Goddess Nami!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And while I'm out and about, I expect you specks to be doing some work down there for me.\" The redhead went on, hearing squeaks and disgruntled voices from the smaller specks below. She figured it was either Zoro or Franky complaining, but she ignored them for now. Really couldn't hear their tiny voices anyway unless she focused on them and listened intently. Now they were just a minor nuisance compared to her no doubt booming and godlike voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kinda work?\" The green-haired swordsman asked upwards to Nami's looming form cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Nami-swan, I'd do any kind of work for you.\" Sanji called up joyously with hearts in his eyes, no doubt the only one who was truly enjoying the entire situation at the moment. He had always treated Nami as a goddess, and here she was like one before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be keeping you all on my foot for safety.\" She smirked, knowing that was one of the most unsafe places for a walking giantess such as herself to them. \"You'll all be safely snuggled under my toe while I'm out at the market. And while you're under it, I expect the works from my servants. Massages, kisses, praise, Queen-Goddess Nami demands it!\" She boomed, deciding to combine the two titles for her own pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now wait just a moment-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know who defied her word, only that it was silenced when her more than mountainous toe was raised overhead once and lowered, smushing them all into submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up the tiny Thousand Sunny that laid on the edge of her sandal bed and smirked, depositing it into her cleavage alongside the size-changing gem and stood up, stretching happily. The redhead wiggled her toes giddily and smushed her feet down harder than she normally needed to, strutting out of the inn she was currently staying at and heading into town. Oh, she knew today would be a good day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mfffmmmfffm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luffy, move your face a bit. You're stuck under a ridge of skin that sticks out a bit more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain gasped for air as he jerked his head to the side, making a rubbery snap with the movement. \"What the hell is up with Nami?!\" He shouted, struggling to free himself, but the massive sky of toeflesh held them all down with it's immeasurable weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally their whole world would lift up, and they felt entirely weightless, only for the toe to slam back down on them, an act of Nami walking so devastating and powerful, generating earthquakes and ear-splitting booms for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but I'm loving it!\" Sanji shouted in reply, hands working against the soft skin and peppering the titanic appendage with kisses. Every member of the pirate crew only sighed and waited, bracing themselves for every impact of the goddess's steps.</span></div></div>",

All the others were on the boat, enjoying their day, doing usual stuff. But suddenly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha\", said a feminine voice. \"With the help of the fruit of size, I will destroy the Strawhat crew and get the reward!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was a beautiful woman, with the body and the size of Nami (Note: We are on the 2 years later arc), except she had a long blue air and blue eyes. She then focused her power in the direction of the Thousand Sunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go! Mini mini ray!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fired a pink ray who enveloped the whole ship. Then, before the eyes of the woman, the boat shrinks, and shrinks, and then get the size of a bath toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha! Now, all I have to do is going get the reward! Their boat will not surivive on this sea, even if the sea is peaceful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she disappeared in the jungle. On the boat, all were suprising to see the little sea waves being now a real tsunami. The Thousand Sunny was tough, but it wouldn't resist last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Franky!\" said Luffy, \"Do a Coup de Burst!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" said the cyborg, \"COUP DE BURST!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship then shot out the usual air canon, and fly in direction of the island. They keep flying, and quit the sea. They were now flying above the sand. They began to lose altitude, and they were hanging on the ship, prepared for the rough landing. But when they landed, the landing was not so rough. There was a good explication: They landed on the body of the Bikini Nami, who had no see them, sleeping peacefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Giant Nami-swan!\" said Sanji, while having a massive nosebledd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nami! We are here!\" said Usopp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the crew was now yelling the name of Nami, and Nami began to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmh... Can't they do less noise? That idiots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wakes up, and see the now little ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" said Nami \"A little Thousand Sunny? This Franky never stop suprising me. (She grabs it, shaking the shruken crew) Look at those details. It's the perfect copy of the real one. And he even built small figures of the crew. Who can move. And talk. And yelling my name... Wait a minute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks where the ship used to be, only finding the ship missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, is this means... Guys?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Nami, we are here\" said Chopper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you became that small?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as I see from my lookout, a woman was on the beach. She fired a strange pink ray on our direction, and we shrunk at this size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A ray?\" said Nami \"This is obviousely a devil fruit ability\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how are we going to do for found this woman now?\" asked Zoro<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'm the only person who has not been shrunk, so I'm going to find her and teach her a lesson she is not going to forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" said Luffy, \"Go, Mega Nami!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami began to searching the mysterious woman through the jungle, the Thousand Sunny and the crew now resting in her backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenely...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things were oddly tense one day at Amazon Lily. It was usually an active island, full of a large assortment of women: large and small, thin and fat, beautiful and ugly, all of them living in harmony doing what it took to keep their lifestyle. But that wasn\u2019t the case today. Not a single one of the women were to be seen throughout the entirety of the island. The usual hectic life of women trading, hunting, and casually working wasn\u2019t there. The animals were as lost as the people that didn\u2019t seem to be present. None of them had even the slightest idea what could\u2019ve happened. But there was a tense feeling in the air that prevented any of them from so much as approaching the village. The empty buildings seemed to radiate bad omens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026Where am I?\u201d Sandersonia, an Amazon resembling a snake mumbled to herself. She was stirring awake from slumber but she didn\u2019t remember every going to sleep. Behind her came a familiar grumble that sounded like her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSandersonia\u2026? Is that you? Where are we?\u201d The bulkier Amazon slowly rose to her feet and shook her head. \u201cLast thing I remember was Boa throwing a tantrum.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s all I remember too. Luffy turned her down again and it got her in a big rage. She was screaming at everyone.\u201d Sandersonia began to turn to face her sister. Though the moment she did she gasped, her snake-like tongue sliding out in sheer shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarigold raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s wro-\u201c She turned around and saw exactly what her sister saw. An entire horde of people, the entire population of Amazon Lily, were all collapsed on the ground much like Sandersonia and Marigold were. Over a hundred trained warriors, all laying on the floor like they were nothing. Relief came quickly though as many of them began to slowly stir themselves awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s okay.\u201d Sandersonia smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what happened?\u201d Marigold queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Amazons, Marguerite, approached the two, \u201cNo idea. The last thing I remember was Hebihime screaming at everyone and-\u201c At the mention of Hancock they all froze. The entire population of Amazon Lily realized it at once, \u201cWhere is Hebihime?!\u201d Sure enough, nowhere in the group was Hancock to be found. The Amazons all showed signs of panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey took her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow dare they?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilar statements arose en masse but the two sisters Sandersonia and Marigold slowly riled them down. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Sandersonia assured, \u201cThis is our leader, the Shichibukai we\u2019re talking about here. She\u2019s fine. What we should focus on is figuring out where we are and what to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that the Amazons looked to their surroundings analytically. The land they were in\u2026looked odd. The ground was hard as rock and the sky seemed almost golden in color. Enormous structures arose almost everywhere, going on for what seemed like hundreds of miles. In fact the field they seemed to have found themselves on went on for what seemed like forever. As far as the eye could see. Several miles ahead of them sat another structure, this one not gold, but purple. It arose many miles itself but was significantly smaller than the enormous pillars in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s some sort of giant island.\u201d  Marigold scratched her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike Eblaf?\u201d Marguerite asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot Eblaf.\u201d Sandersonia frowned, \u201cI\u2019ve been to Eblaf, it was nowhere near this big\u2026Nor this familiar\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got that feeling too? I feel like I should know this place.\u201d Marigold looked around some more. That\u2019s when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you microbes done wasting time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice, louder than any physical comprehension, echoed across the land. The vibrations of which alone was enough to move several small hairs on the Amazons heads. It seemed to come from heaven itself and carried the tone of power that made many cringe at the mere sound of it. But the people of Amazon Lily heard that voice before; they practically worshipped its owner. Even magnified to the extent it was impossible to recognize, they somehow recognized it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHebihime!\u201d All the Amazons cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilence!\u201d Hancock\u2019s immeasurably loud voice shouted. She was clearly still mad. \u201cDo you know where you are?\u201d Chatter began amidst the Amazons; no one was brave enough to answer in the negative. Hancock sighed, though at the magnitude it sounded more like a hurricane. \u201cMaybe this will make it more obvious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe endless wall of purple that laid several miles ahead shifted, it moved and seemed to break apart into two separate walls of purple. The second wall, resembling a pillar, landed on the hard ground with a seismic boom that knocked several Amazons off balance. The only difference was now there was the unmistakable pale-ish coloring of skin between some of the purple. It started fairly high up, at least a few miles and continued along even higher than the purple wall, in fact the purple wall almost covered it like a curtain. Between the two purple pillars there it was, completely unmistakable. Boa Hancock\u2019s face, gigantic beyond scale, looming over them. She had to have been hundreds of miles high at least, but there was no mistaking that beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all clicked at once. The Amazons looked to their surroundings and realized it. The ground was the hard-tiled floor, the \u201cgolden sky\u201d was the palace and the endless pillars were the pillars that supported the building as well as all the small decorations. Before them was the purple, Hancock\u2019s heels that rose up many miles before showing her bare leg, surrounded by the purple dress she was wearing. They couldn\u2019t see any of her skin before because her legs were crossed, but when she uncrossed them they could see her skin. Past her legs they could see more of the \u201cpillars\u201d that supported the throne she sat on. Boa Hancock was, to them, a giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer realization of it all made many of the Amazons collapse, \u201cWe-We\u2026Shrank?\u201d Marguerite looked up to their Queen overhead with clear confusion. Even Marigold and Sandersonia, who knew Hancock better than anyone, were astounded by this turn of events. What could have possibly happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock pulled herself back into a regal position on her throne, \u201cI need not explain what happened to a bunch of microbes such as you. All you need to know if that I will slowly grow you back if you do everything I say. If not then I\u2019ll continue to shrink you, if not crush you altogether. Do I make myself clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a bunch of gaps that needed to be filled. Not even the blind followers of Amazon Lily could follow such a command without uttering the simple question, \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they asked, Hancock\u2019s brow twitched in annoyance. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to say \u201cYes Hebihime.\u201d And never ask questions. Or have you all forgotten your place?\u201d Hancock hovered a hand between her legs, over the shrunken population of Amazons. \u201cIt seems I need to remind you all who is in charge.\u201d An eerie light escaped the giantess\u2019 palm and enveloped all of the Amazons in its pink glow. It felt similar to Hancock\u2019s Mero Mero no Mi powers, but since they weren\u2019t turning to stone it was clearly something different. The details weren\u2019t that important such much as what happened. Every single Amazon gasped as the wall of Hancock\u2019s heels that rose op several miles into the air rose even higher. They continued to rise until they seemed to be as tall as Hancock prior to the shrinking; the woman herself now appeared planetary in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that I\u2019ve made my point I hope you all understand now. After all, to cross someone of my beauty is a crime of the highest offense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time everyone was ready to agree, \u201cYes Hebihime!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had learned, but Hancock still frowned. \u201cI changed my mind, since you\u2019re all less than microbes to me now Hebihime is much too informal. From now on address me as Goddess Hancock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Goddess Hancock!\u201d To try and appease their new Goddess all the Amazons bowed to her, not that she could see from her perch on the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, I like the sound of that.\u201d Hancock softly smiled. \u201cNow your Goddess wants you to kiss her heels. Do it now before I get impatient!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden order had every Amazon pushing to try and appease their leader. They all took off full speed for Hancock\u2019s heels dozens of miles away. But that was the problem, the distance was several miles and even to the Kuja Amazons this would take at least ten minutes. In a surprisingly considerate moment though, Hancock didn\u2019t seem to criticize them for this shortcoming. She just patiently awaited the submission of all her people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering what they had all experienced, the story was slowly piecing itself together in the Amazons minds. After having been rejected by Luffy Hancock used this new ability of hers to take her frustration out on all those around her, the village of Amazon Lily. She could obviously hear them so they could vocally worship her too. Now they had to appease her or else they\u2019d be crushed. It was taking the power she had to a whole new level, but not a single Amazon dared to question it. In fact, few of them even thought of it as wrong. After all, she was beautiful. And her beauty meant that she could get anything she wanted. If she wanted to be a Goddess, who were they to stop her? It was the mindset of the Kuja tribe since Hancock took her place as Queen; the only difference was now she was literally big enough to crush them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Many of them actually relished being able to touch their beautiful leader like they were. It was a privilege to be able to worship Hancock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever after mere minutes Hancock\u2019s heels rose into the air, where she kicked them off a countless distance away. Each heel landed with a boom that made giants sound like ants. Her feet now bare, Hancock lowered them back her people. She didn\u2019t check to see if she was accidentally going to crush any of them so when her foot came back down there was actually a thin strip of Amazons between it and the floor. Most of them were able to get away just fine. But one, young Amazon, was petrified as she looked up to Hancock\u2019s flawless foot. She was unable to move and when it finally came, she was crushing beneath the ball of Hancock\u2019s left foot. The splatter of her blood and organs was horrible to watch. It served to further send the message of how much power Hancock had over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was much too small for Hancock to feel their insignificant struggles beneath her soles, and she honestly didn\u2019t care. \u201cI realize you microbes are worthless but do try to let me feel your worship of my feet.\u201d Silently the Amazons went back to kissing their Goddess\u2019 feet, only a couple of them taking the time out to pay respects to their departed friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo them, Hancock was flawless in every way. Even in rage she resembled a deity of beauty. Her feet exemplified that. They were flawless. Dirt seemed nonexistent even by their microscopic sights. Every single print was perfectly curved and in no way damaged. It was just the right length balancing long and wide with toes that had the same balance. Her toenails were not painted but the natural nails themselves looked perfect enough to have been painted. And lastly, no odor. Hancock\u2019s feet smelled beautifully, like roses. Even with each toe rising an even hundred-miles in the air at least, the women of Amazon Lily would gladly submit to these toes. Hancock was just that beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worship of Hancock\u2019s feet went on for at least half an hour, almost every Amazon massaging in some way on top of kissing. The Goddess made no signs she felt their worship, but that just served to push them even harder. Time lost all meaning until finally, their Goddess was satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may stop now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Amazons stopped and stepped away from the looming feet before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, thank your Goddess for allowing you this honor to worship her beauty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately each Amazon bent on their knees and fervently bowed to give praise to Goddess Hancock. \u201cThank you Goddess!\u201d Hancock crossed her legs with a smug smirk as they thanked her for their humiliation. Their devotion to her was almost completely blind. Anyone who dared to cross her refused to for fear of being crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s the most beautiful Goddess in existence?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou Goddess Hancock!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock chuckled, \u201cVery good. I think my lovely little slaves are in need of a rewards\u2026\u201d She paused for a moment, \u201cWould you like to shrink further and bask in more of my glory?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question made the Amazons stop and look at one another, unsure of how to respond. Deny what Hancock is offering or take it? Either way odds were they were going to shrink. With that in mind everyone began to cheer in the affirmative. Better make Hancock happy than mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess smiled, \u201cI\u2019d be happy to oblige.\u201d With another wave of her hand Hancock enveloped everyone in the pink energy again. The Amazons looked up in awe as once again, Hancock become bigger to their eyes. Her big toe alone matched the moon in size, and Hancock herself seemed almost as big as an entire universe. They couldn\u2019t even see past half of her big toe now she was so big. Several Amazons began to wonder if Hancock would ever actually make them bigger again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her perspective, Hancock looked down by her feet and suppressed laughter. She looked as hard as she could, but the entire population of Amazon Lily, over two hundred people, weren\u2019t even visible by her feet. They were nothing in comparison to her. The only reason she knew where they were was because of the ability she used to shrink them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow. It is time for your next duty to your Goddess\u2026\u201d Hancock smirked.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a brief pause before Hancock continued, \u201cThus far you all have been more than obedient. For that I will make this next task simple enough.\u201d Once more the titaness paused, this time to briefly raise her big toe and drop it back to the ground. A simple motion often done without realizing it, but to the shrunken Amazons it demonstrated how frail and weak they were to their Goddess. Hancock\u2019s toe rose into the air and even that created a breeze that blew back the Amazon\u2019s hair. Once it came back down it created a boom loud enough to force most of the Kuja to cover their ears, not mentioning the tremendous quake it created that knocked the women off their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny struggles by her slightest movements went completely unnoticed by Hancock. She could communicate with them and was aware of where they were, but that was all. She couldn\u2019t see how much even a movement of her toe affected them. \u201cWhile you are all down there I want you to appease my toe. Since you just finished kissing my feet I can only think of one alternative. To clean them. However I will not allow the rags you germs call clothes to touch my beautiful skin, so you must use your tongues.\u201d There was a brief pause where Hancock drummed her toes, once more causing quakes and winds that terrorized her shrunken slaves. \u201cI\u2019m not cruel though. At your size I know my entire foot is impossible, so just focus on a single toe for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock didn\u2019t have to repeat herself, the Amazons all rushed to lick Hancock\u2019s big toe. The taste of their Goddess seeped into their taste buds, a taste of beauty and a hint of vanilla lotion. It was sublime, if not mildly humiliating to anyone who didn\u2019t worship the ground Hancock walked on. They just hoped their worship would be enough to make her happy; after all to clean the entire toe was impossible. In light of their recent size downgrade the Amazons were much more fervent in their attempts to worship Hancock. Even if she sounded relatively kind they knew she expected the same sensation as if they hadn\u2019t shrunken at all. They had to work harder to make up for the size difference. Even with each insult Hancock tossed at them, microbe, germ, slave, they took it and worshipped her for it. Not just because she was beautiful (Though that was a large reason), not because they were used to appeasing their impossible-to-please leader (Again, a big reason), but because if they ever wanted to be normal again they would have to do every single thing Hancock asked without remorse. That was the dedication the Kuja were known for. Hancock was a cruel goddess would had already taken one of their lives beneath her feet. But she was their leader and they would do whatever she said. Self-preservation was secondary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtop her throne Hancock allowed a soft smile to form. It was barely noticeable but her big toe definitely felt good. She could feel each and every one of her slaves paying her the tribute she deserved. It slowly chipped at the anger the Hebihime was known for. Perhaps her pets were due for a slight reward afterwards; an actual reward, not the reward that was more of a punishment. The Goddess looked to her hand briefly contemplating it. It was during the two-years after Whitebeard War Hancock had learned of a secondary power to the Mero Mero no Mi. On top of turning people to stone if combined with the proper degree of Haki it carried a size-changing attribute. It took a year to fully develop, but now Hancock could use it at will. She had yet to show anyone else the technique; that is, until today. If the feeling of her toe was any indication Hancock wondered why she waited so long to use it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes shifted to her big toe. As far as the eye could see there was nothing there at all, but she knew that the entirety of the Kuja were there. But to not even see a single speck? <i>Perhaps I overdid it a touch</i>. The Kuja Empress thought to herself. Her people were devoted to her but to remain so devoted even in this situation, it actually impressed even Hancock. Only one Amazon ever dared to cross her and that was the previous leader, Elder Nyon. Who, conveniently, Hancock didn\u2019t shrink to avoid any annoyances. On occasion other Amazons have displayed a slight disobedience, such as Marguerite to save Luffy. But there wasn\u2019t a single sign of resistance. In retrospect Hancock could admit her anger towards her fellow Amazons regarding Luffy may have been <i>slightly</i> misplaced. Her beauty meant she could do whatever she wanted but perhaps her villagers didn\u2019t need to be shrunken <i>that</i> small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock eventually broke her thoughts to turn her attention back to the worshippers at her feet, \u201cYou may now stop.\u201d The feeling on her toe stopped and she could sense that the Amazons had backed away. \u201cConsidering how well you have all been following my orders I think a reward is in order.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess hovered her hand over the general area around her foot again. The shrunken Amazons braced themselves, unsure if they would be shrunken further again or not. To their pleasant surprise, once the pink energy of the Mero Mero no mi enveloped them the world was actually growing smaller. The hundred-mile high toe that belonged to Hancock grew drastically smaller. By the end of their growth, the Kuja Tribe now saw the wall of flesh as only a single mile tall. They still had to be smaller than an inch, in fact probably a lot less, but compared to their previous size they felt like giants. They were now visible even to Hancock, admittedly a large array of specks to her, but visible specks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess raised the foot she had worshipped and crossed it over her leg. She didn\u2019t say anything but her shrunken slaves seemed to understand. Each speck got on their knees, \u201cThank you Goddess Hancock.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust realize the bigger you are the more I expect from each of you.\u201d Hancock smiled. \u201cBut let\u2019s just say continue what you\u2019re doing.\u201d And there it was. Hancock\u2019s bitter rage was melting away and in its place she resembled their typical ruler. Still by all means mean, but nice enough unless crossed. So long as they didn't upset her they could be normal again soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock thought to herself for a moment, \u201cThus far I\u2019ve done nothing but have you all at my feet. It\u2019s grown boring, so I think for this next task I\u2019ll be asking for something different.\u201d The giantess continued to think, unsure of what to do next. Meanwhile by her feet the Kuja took the chance for some much needed rest. Pampering the gigantic Hebihime was quickly taking its toll on them. If they wanted to keep growing they had to take every chance to rest that they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was after several minutes Hancock finally spoke up again, \u201cI have no particular needs for now but I have grown bored. So you all shall entertain me.\u201d A single fluid motion Hancock bent over from her throne and placed her hand along the ground. To the Amazons it was an incredibly high wall but at least one that was scalable. They wasted no time in beginning to climb to her open palm. It took less than a minute for the talented warriors; good considering how impatient their Goddess was known to be. Hancock rose back to her position on her throne and deposited the Kuja all along the edge of her armrest. Up close she could actually make them out much better, even make out specific people. Hancock rested her hand along her chin and stared at the shrunken women. \u201cAs I said you shall entertain me.\u201d The shrunken Kuja awaited what Hancock would ask of them, almost nervously.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the giantess trailed off she removed her hand from her chin and placed it back on the armrest. It was just long enough to leave room for both her arm and the shrunken Kuja, though Hancock\u2019s fingers did come dangerously close. The miles of finger each casually drummed along the throne armrest with loud taps that screeched beyond belief to the shrunken ones. Each digit rose far above the Amazons even rested on the ground. In fact should she choose it Hancock could literally crush all of the amazons with a single press of her finger. That wasn\u2019t her intention of course, but it wasn\u2019t too far off. Hancock raised her index finger and nudged her hand forward slightly. \u201cThe game is simple. I will press against you all with my finger. All you have to do is keep my finger at bay through whatever means necessary. The game ends either when I win or when my finger gets tired. Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally each shrunken Amazon answered in the affirmative just to agree with their Goddess. How hard could it be? Hancock would undoubtedly take it easy so she wouldn\u2019t crush each of them; plus the Kuja were some of the strongest pirates in the Grand Line. With over two hundred they definitely had the power to hold their own. But their opponent was Hancock, their leader. She was the strongest of them for a reason. At the very least she had the most stamina. Would it be as easy as they thought? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time for doubts as Hancock began to slowly bring her finger forward. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d She spoke with an impatient tone of authority. All of the Kuja braced themselves as a gigantic finger several miles-long loomed overhead. Each print had room to fit several houses within and still have plenty to spare. Up close it was clear they were right to brace themselves. As the digit began to lower all of the Amazon\u2019s raised their hands to try and hold off the massive appendage. Each one of them utilized their own personal skills effectively in an instinctive strategic manner. Marigold and Sandersonia shifted to their snake forms courtesy of their Devil Fruits and took places as the main pillars in their defense. Around them was a line of the strongest Amazons in Amazon Lily, those capable of Haki, notable faces among them included Marguerite, Aphelandra, and Kikyo. These women utilized their Haki to provide an extra boost of strength. Aside from them the other members of the Kuja huddled together in groups, using numbers to make up for their individual failings compared to their best. Each and every Amazon positioned them where Hancock\u2019s prints would be so they wouldn\u2019t simply be caught between them. The only exceptions were Marigold and Sandersonia, who were big enough they could still help from within there. Most amazing of all was how quick it all happened. It was instantaneous. Showing why they were renowned for their fighting. The only question was; would it be enough to stop one as gigantic as their goddess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it would turn out, it was. Their efforts were successful and Hancock\u2019s finger stopped moving. All of the Amazon\u2019s allowed a smile, they had a chance after all! It was just a matter of outlasting Hancock til either she got tired or bored. That meant they could be there for a while. Sweat started to show on several women\u2019s brows from holding off the immense form above them, but no one faltered. Not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock smirked as she felt each of her servants struggle to fend off her finger. They had been grown big enough she could actually feel each of them, all of their little hands holding up her finger. It was entertaining if not just to see them struggle against her. But they had no idea of one crucial fact. Hancock was not actually pushing. All this weight they were holding off, it was just her finger. Once she had it above them Hancock stopped holding it above them. It fell naturally. The only factor in play was gravity. All of these tiny women were going above and beyond just to lift a single finger. Not fight against it, lift it. At any moment the gigantic Amazon could add the slightest pressure and they would all fall in seconds. It had only been a couple minutes but it was clear each of the women beneath her were struggling just to make it to the next second. The power she had over them made Hancock smile slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as nice as power over hundreds of people was, she was also slightly disappointed. When she came up with this game Hancock expected\u2026well she expected more. She actually thought she\u2019d have to use a slight amount of pressure. But none at all? It was almost disgracefully weak and more importantly, it was making the game dull very fast. <i>Maybe I should make it more interesting</i>. The Goddess smiled to herself. With careful concentration she slowly slid the absolute smallest amount of energy into her finger and gently channeled more of her shrinking technique over each of the Amazons. It was a minimal level of exposure, weak enough to make any size difference as gradual as it could be. If she wasn\u2019t even going to try she was going to make it fun one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Hancock\u2019s trick went unnoticed; all of the Kuja kept their positions like they had been for several minutes. But after roughly another minute it was clear something had changed. The massive form they had held at bay was suddenly pushing harder. Several women fell to their knees, still weakly holding off Hancock\u2019s finger. The closer it got the bigger it seemed to get. In fact it looked almost a third bigger than when they had started, and it only seemed to get bigger. One by one Amazons fell to their knees, unable to hold up the finger anymore. The vast army of warriors dwindled down to a group of four who could stand. Marigold, Sandersonia, Marguerite, and Alphelandra. These were the only Amazons who still stood to fend off Hancock\u2019s expanding finger. All others had collapsed and were barely even on their knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir efforts were admirable, but it didn\u2019t change the fact that the next second Hancock\u2019s finger fully fell and overcame the Amazons.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nBOOM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI win.\u201d Hancock chuckled. The woman removed her finger from her throne, beneath it laid the horde of women all flat on their backs, toppled by a mere finger. As she pulled it away Hancock noted that her technique shrank them to roughly half of what they started at. It was actually rather impressive they held on for so long with such a handicap. Feeling their desperation towards the end really improved things; Hancock couldn\u2019t deny she enjoyed herself. One by one the Amazons began to stand back up and turn to face their Goddess. They seemed to be getting the hang of things as most of them entered a bowing position. Hancock smirked, \u201cYou did admirably. But against a beautiful goddess you were doomed from the start. But for bugs, it was impressive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you lost so I am afraid I won\u2019t grow you anymore for that. Though for your valor I think I know what to do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hancock pulled her hand back to give some room to her servants, \u201cSandersonia, Marigold, Marguerite, and Aphelandra step forward.\u201d Amidst the exhausted shrunken amazons the four who were named looked to one another with mild confusion. A shrugging Sandersonia took the first step and soon all four of them walked until they were a decent distance away from the others. They didn\u2019t know what to expect but there was a definite sense of optimism since they did the best in their Goddess\u2019 little game. These feelings only got stronger when the gigantic hand of said Goddess loomed overhead, casting a now familiar beam over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround them the world seemed to shrink drastically. The hand that seemed a dozen miles away now seemed only a strong jump away. The giantess who loomed over them was actually recognizable, there was no more blur after so much distance. Her appearance seemed clear and her size actually came off as almost under whelming after being so small before. With this growth the four women smiled and allowed some joy. With this next growth they were closer to being returned to normal. Marigold and Sandersonia gave each other a soft look that seemed to communicate for them. Aphelandra began to jump up and down in a child-like way and Marguerite just smile softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute the growth ended, leaving the four Amazons standing at least a couple inches high. Compared to their micro stature before it was heavenly. Hancock lowered her hand back down, revealing they actually stood about twice the height of her fingers as they laid flat. Being Amazons the actual size between the four varied. Marguerite was the size of a notably tall woman, but nothing special. Marigold and Sandersonia were about twice Marguerite\u2019s height. And towering over all of them was Aphelandra, standing at three times the standard height. This was always the case and didn\u2019t matter to them at all. Though to the remaining untouched Amazons this size difference was startling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious about how her friends would look like this, Marguerite casually walked over to her fellow Kuja. To them each of the blonde\u2019s steps was a small boom that created gentle quakes. When her foot stopped in front of them they saw that they were the size of her toes. The new perspective made Marguerite let out a small amazed gasp, which her fellow Amazons all shared. Aphelandra soon joined her, standing beside Marguerite. The child-like woman towered over all her friends like they were bugs. If they matched Marguerite\u2019s toes in size then compared to Aphelandra they were a third their size. Back near Hancock\u2019s hand Marigold and Sandersonia also towered, their heights somewhere in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou all look so cute!\u201d Aphelandra knelt over and gently poked one of the Kuja, knocking the woman over by accident. \u201cOh! I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d She began to bow her head repeatedly in apology, making her enormous breasts bounce in a way that drew everyone\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful you two.\u201d Sandersonia stepped forward with her sister. \u201cWe may be small but to them we\u2019re like giants. If we aren\u2019t careful we could crush someone under our feet.\u201d Marguerite and Aphelandra nodded, the latter slowly backing away to be safe. Before anything else could happen the booming voice of their Goddess echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you done yet? This is my gift to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four Amazon\u2019s knelt towards Hancock, their smaller friends doing likewise. \u201cThank you Goddess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock proceeded without even acknowledging them, \u201cI\u2019m tired of having to do everything myself so from this point onward you four are to be my Emissaries. Essentially all you have to do is handle those beneath you and make sure I am properly worshipped. Instead of me having to constantly give out orders you will take care of it.\u201d A massive finger pointed to them, \u201cI have many needs that you must do on a daily basis, should you fail I <i>will </i>shrink you smaller than ever before. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Goddess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock leaned her head back and smiled, \u201cGood, now allow me to list your duties. For now I shall handle my own eating arrangement since you\u2019re still so small but I still expect entertainment. I expect proper care of my feet, licking them clean, appeasing them with kisses, and simply bowing to their greatness. Likewise with my heels, I expect them cleaned regularly, as well as the floor. Along with that I want my neck massaged once a day. And if I need something you will bring it to me. Anything else and I\u2019ll simply order it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the Amazons repeated, \u201cYes Goddess.\u201d Though their tone said they weren\u2019t sure if they could handle all the chores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd most importantly of all\u2026\u201d Hancock proceeded, \u201cIf any of you disrespect your Goddess I want one of my Emissaries to execute them on the spot. Do I make myself clear?\u201d The rhythmic chant of agreement came as always. This rule wasn\u2019t new; Hancock always used her powers to essentially turn any who doubted her to stone. Nine times out of ten it was an execution sentence. \u201cGood, now perhaps I can offer some motivation. For each day you successfully do as I ask to completion I will restore some of your size. I realize I\u2019ve been changing it a lot recently but that won\u2019t always be the case.\u201d The giantess seemed to pause, almost as if the next thought amused her. \u201cAlso, each of my Emissaries are to be worshipped as well. The exact means is up to them but from what I\u2019ve seen they are something to be aspired to. Until you reach their level they are better than you. And of course I reign over all of you as your Goddess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last part threw many off, but the universal chant came all the same. \u201cYes Goddess!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock smiled, \u201cExcellent. Now welcome my new Emissaries.\u201d Sandersonia, Marigold, Marguerite, and Aphelandra all gasped as their fellow Amazons, all their friends, bowed to them as if <i>they</i> were the goddesses. It gave them a feeling of empowerment. They had the authority to boss these people around any way they wanted. The thought crossed each of their minds but none of them had anything like the cruelty Hancock often showed in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can kinda get used to this.\u201d Marguerite smiled, sliding a hand on her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt definitely feels nice.\u201d Agreed Sandersonia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re all so little! I bet we\u2019ll have lots of fun together!\u201d Aphelandra giggled like a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut they\u2019re still people. Don\u2019t forget that.\u201d Marigold muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarguerite gently brought her foot before some Kuja, \u201cI know I know, but while we have the chance we might as well try it out right?\u201d She wiggled her toes eagerly, \u201cKiss my foot.\u201d Like the obedient warriors they were, several Kuja Amazons stepped forward and began to plant their lips along Marguerite\u2019s toes. Now whether it was because of her order, or Hancock\u2019s, wasn\u2019t clear. But either way the pleasant feeling made the blonde Amazon sigh, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to enjoy this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too!\u201d Aphelandra piped in. Marguerite turned to see her gigantic friend playfully squeezing a couple Amazons in her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey practically have to worship five girls now.\u201d Sandersonia laughed alongside her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut don\u2019t forget who\u2019s the Goddess!\u201d Over all of them Hancock leered with a powerful expression.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yes it was a beautiful day indeed as the Thousand Sunny sailed peacefully through the gentle waters, the crew upon the ship known as the Straw Hat pirates were enjoying a rare day of clarity where they weren\u2019t battling Warlords or escaping Yonko territory, no today was a relaxation day and everyone was taking advantage of it. The captain Luffy was sat on his favorite seat atop the ships Lion Figure Head, Zoro was exercising relentlessly in the weights room, Nami was on deck drawing up a few charts whilst taking in The Sun. Usopp was concocting his latest invention whilst Chopper was say nearby creating rumble balls, Franky was busying himself with minor ship repairs as the Robin sat on a sun lounger reading a book whilst Brook sat on the railing of the ship playing his guitar for all his crew to hear. It was a beautiful day but unbeknownst to the the straw hats that was all about to change as they had just crossed over into the Mystical Sea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs The Sun set on this glorious day it was getting rather late and one by one the Straw Hats all began to nod off. Robin and Nami headed off to their room to sleep in the comforts of their warm beds whereas the men decided they wanted to sleep under the stars tonight. Brook was given lookout duty for the night and took his place in the birdsnest upon the mast whilst the rest of the crew fell sound asleep on deck, eventually even Brook fell asleep as the Mystical began to show off its wonders. Out of nowhere a pinkish sparkling thin fog covered the Sunny and one by one the fog enveloped every member of the Straw Hats and seeped into their skin. Then as quickly as it came the fog disappeared from sight almost as if it was never there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Next Morning</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sun rose high into the sky and is it did the sound of seagulls cooed loudly in the air awakening our hero\u2019s aboard the ship. As always the first to awaken were the more active members of the crew such as Sanji, Usopp and Franky who had a few chores to attend to immediately such as Breakfast and checking in the ship, however something was slightly off. The crew had awoken on deck were they had fallen asleep except now the deck was the size of an extemely large field and spread far and wide for them to see. It dawned on them instantly. They had Shrunk. Almost on cue Usopp began screaming and panicking at their predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHHHHH WHATS GOING ON GUYS WHY IS EVRYTHING SO BIG!!!!!!!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down Usopp geze we\u2019re never gonna solve anything by running and screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn right Sanji we\u2019ve got a SUPPPPPERRRRRR big problem right now\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two calmed Usopp down his yells had woken up the remaining Straw Hats on the deck as Luffy, Zoro and Chopper rose from their slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you guys telling about so early in the morning. Some of us are trying to sleep\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Zoro began speaking but then recognized the situation they were in...everything was huge and they were not. Unfortunately Luffy and Chopper noticed too and had different reactions than Zoro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome this is so cool! Look how big everything is! Did we accidentally end up on a giants ship or something???\u201d Luffy blurted out with stars in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHATTTTT!!!!! A giants ship!!!!! That\u2019s awful we could get killed by their giant footsteps oh what are we gonna do what are we gonna do?!?!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChopper began acting just like Usopp as he was running around panicking as Sanji and Franky tried to calm them down as Luffy continued cooing over his giant surroundings. Zoro however was the first to state whatbhad really happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Luffy I don\u2019t think we\u2019re on a giants ship, look up their that\u2019s out jolly Rodger on the flag pole.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys all craned their necks skyward as they squinted to seenthatbwhat the swordsman has said was true and that this really was their ship just bigger, Luffy suddenly got serious and spoke accordingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys. I think I know what happened...The Ship Grew.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmedietly Luffy was struck over the head by everyone as they scolded him for this stupid summary. No what had happened was that the crew had shrank but the question remains was how? Beofre the men could think it through they were interrupted by some booming sounds approaching from the distance. Louder and louder the booms got until the opening of a door could be heard. At once all the Straw Hats shuddered as put came both Nami and Robin as beautiful as ever except the size of giants!!!! They were so huge in fact that the crew must only be about an inch tall compared to the two! As everyone else looked at their two gigantic crew mates the worst happened. They started walking towards them. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nBOOM! BOOM!BOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach footstep they room was louder and stronger than the one before it and soon their steps caused minor earthquakes for the tiny men and soon they turned to major tremors that knocked them all of their feet. All of them tried shouting up at the two titanic ladies but it was to no avail as thy couldn\u2019t hear the at their tiny size. As everyone made to get out of their path so as not to be crushed under their soles, Sanji stood with hearts in his eyes and a assivd nosebleed as he stared in awe at the towering beauties approaching him, closer and closer they got until Nami raised her foot directly over Sanjinand brought it down over the tiny chef who stood not even attempting to move out of the way, he would have been crushed had it not been for the timely arrivals of Luffy\u2019s arm stretching and grabbing him out of the way as Nami narrowly avoided stepping on him. While they regaind their senses the gigantic women began conversing amongst themselves. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHmmm I wonder where the boys are they weren\u2019t in their room?\u201d </b> Nami wondered slightly concerned, <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps they all fell overboard and drowned as we were sleeping\u201d</b> Robin mused casually. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cROBIN!!!!! Don\u2019t joke like that!\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two giantesses talked the rest of the crew sans Brook had hidden out of sight under a chair and began to work out a plan to get the two women's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk so it\u2019s settled? Usopp will fire off a flare and when their attention we\u2019ll scream and shout as loud as we can can got it?\u201d Zoro asked sternly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it\u201d erroneously answered accordingly...except for one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem guys I\u2019ll have their attention in no time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT!!!!\u201d The rest of them shouted as Luffy ran off before grabbing onto the leg of the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGum-Gum....Rocket!!!!!!!\u201d Luffy shot through the air and towards the two women but all of a sudden the wind picked up and knocked Luffy of course! He was sent plummeting towards the beautiful casemous depths of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These were the collective thoughts of the rest of the shrunken crew who all had slapped their foreheads in both disgust and shame as they watched their captain take off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on Luffy! We had a plan you moron!\u201d Zoro bellowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you\u2019re gonna get yourself killed you rubber idiot\u201d Usopp retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why we\u2019re surprised it is Luffy after all\u201d Sanji chimed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the guys could do nothing but watch as Luffy flew further and further away, unfortunately for Luffy being only an inch tall had its disadvantages as he was about to find out. Out of nowhere a slight breeze that would normally only brush against ones hair suddenly struck Luffy and as such it cussed the tiny rubber man to twist and turn through the air as he lost control and began plummeting towards something below. Unbeknownst to Luffy he was heading for a rather soft and pleasant landing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami and Robin meanwhile had sat down at one of the tables in the middle of the deck, tapping her finger nails on the table Nami began thinking out loud. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cThis is weird. There\u2019s no sign of the guys at all. I wonder where they could be?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Maybe they...\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cDON\u2019T SAY IT ROBIN!!!!!!!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Nami and Robin began laughing defusing the situation for the moment. As they were laughing however Luffy began the closing stages of his descent and it became more and more apparent that he was heading for the gigantic and perfect mountains that were Nico Robins breasts. Luffy with his eyes closed and hanging onto his hat kept screaming in excitement as his free fall came to and end, he crashed right in between the luscious orbs that were Robin breasts and found himself buried deep within the fleshy mounds. Robin however was too busy laughing to even notice that when Luffy landed within her cleavage he caused them to jiggle slightly, but what went unnoticed by the archaeologistsas certainly noticed by the red headed navigator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Say Robin is it just me or did your boobs just jiggle?\u201d </b><br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cMy boobs Nami?\u201d</b> Robin answered nonchalantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah I coulda sworn they jiggled just now\u201d</b> Nami continued. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWhy were you looking at my boobs Nami?\u201d</b> Robin asked blankly. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWell they\u2019re not exactly hard to miss I mean look at th size of those things!\u201d </b>Nami replied slightly flustered. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWell thank you for noticing Nami I didn\u2019t know you were that fond of them hihi!\u201d </b> Robin giggled knowing she was embarrassing her friend. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWHAT! NO! I NEVER! I MEAN I...SHUT UP ROBIN STOP CHANGING THE SUBJECT!!!!\u201d</b> Nami yelled as her face became as bright as her hair with embarrassment. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHihi I\u2019m only kidding Nami, just having a little fun at your expense\u201d</b> Robin answered as she tried to hold back even more laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst the two women were doing this the rest of the shrunken crew sans Brook were hawking at Luffy\u2019s landing place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the idiot survived at least\u201d Zoro mused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but it wasn\u2019t exactly the most graceful of Suuuuuper landings\u201d Franky retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee I hope he can get their attention I\u2019m scared being this small, we need Nami and Robin\u2019s help!\u201d Chopper said whilst fighting back tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Sanji and Usopp were crying in the corner whilst hugging each other which drew the attention and ire of Zoro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what are you two baby\u2019s crying about?!\u201d Zoro asked angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat lucky Bastard Luffy...he gets to be all warm and snug in between Robin\u2019s massive boobs!!!!\u201d Usopp blurted out with tears rolling down his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s living my dreams damnit!!!!!! Why couldn\u2019t it be me!\u201d Sanji cried out as both tears and blookd pur\u00e9e from his eyes and nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Nami hadn\u2019t given in as she was still tryin to tell Robin that her boobs did indeed jiggle a few moments ago. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you Robin your boobs jiggled a few seconds ago, I\u2019m not some pervert like Usopp or Sanji I saw what I saw!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying you are Nami but I think I would\u2019ve noticed if my own boobs jiggled\u201d</b> Robin replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a few minutes until Robin finally gave in and decided to inspect her cleavage. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cOk Nami I\u2019ll humor you. One moment whilst I check\u201d</b> Robin sighed in defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin then pulled her top slightly and took a peek down it Inbetween her collossal breasts where Luffy was currently stuck.

Robin proceeded to pull back her top slightly and peered inside to see if there was anything to see, to her surprise right there tucked Inbetween her enormous breasts was something Robin had never expected to see, her captain now 1 inch tall and wedged firmly between her boobs. Luffy had noticed a shadow enveloping his body an looked upwards to see his collossal Archeologists beautiful face looking down at him, instinctively Luffy reacted as only Luffy could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiya Robin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving whilst having a big grin on his face was something that only Luffy would do, Robin meanwhile simply stared blank faced at her captain as if she was trying to comprehend exactly what she was seeing. After a few seconds Robin turned to Nami and spoke. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cSeems I owe you an apology Nami, turns out there was something that caused my boobs to jiggle.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHA! Told ya! So what was it that caused the jiggling?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cIt was our captain.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silent for a few seconds until Nami spoke once more.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201c...Come again? What do ya mean our captain?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cLike this Nami\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin then reached into her cleavage and plucked out Luffy, she then placed him in her hand and held him out for Nami to see. Upon seeing his navigator Luffy once more smiled a big cheesy smile and waved at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiya Nami!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami reacted the exact same way Robin did...for about two seconds she then reacted in typical anime fashion. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWHAT THE HELL!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU LUFFY?! WHY ARE YOU SO SMALL!!!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing. Her captain was an inch tall and standing in the palm of their archeologist! Luffy didn\u2019t know how to answer her however and simply shrugged his shoulders as he began to play on Robins hand. Robin couldn\u2019t help but laugh as she watched her tiny  captain amuse himself as if nothing was wrong. Nami however was smart enough to add two and two together and asked Luffy about the whereabouts of the rest of the crew. Luffy however wasn\u2019t listening as he was having too much fun on Robin\u2019s hand, Nami eventually lost her patience and grabbed Luffy from Robin\u2019s hand as she held up her miniature captain to her face and proceeded to yell at him.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cPay attention you idiot!!!! I asked you where the rest of the crew is!!!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back into reality Luffy answered his navigator and explained that they were over by the side of the deck hiding out of sight of the two collossal women. Robin who was listening used her devil fruit powers to sprout her upper body over where Luffy had said and immedietly found the rest of the crew sans Brook, when she had appeared out of thin air she had inadvertently scared Usopp and Chopper who grabbed eachother for support as they screamed, Zoro and Franky where much more composed and simply nodded at Robin, then there was Sanji who\u2019s eyes were replaced with hearts as she swooned over the titanic figure of Robin\u2019s clone. Upon discovering the crew Robin addressed Nami. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve found them Nami and it appears that they are also shrunken. Hold on a second I\u2019ll bring them to us.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin then used her powers to sprout arms that she used to grab ahold of the tiny crew, she then sprouted several more arms that passed the crew from arm to arm until they ended up at the feet of Robin. Smiling Robin then bent down and took the other 5 into her hands. Luffy then swung over to join his fellow shrunken crewmates, the second her got there Zoro and Franky struck Luffy as payback for abandoning their plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami and Robin then addressed the boys asking them if they knew how they ended up Shrunk.

So far the crew had failed to offer up a feasible explanation as to how they ended uo this way, but beofre the two women could press the issue any further something interrupted them. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cSay Nami can you hear something?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What do you mean I don\u2019t hear anything.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? I\u2019m sure I can hear a very faint almost squeaky like voice...and it\u2019s getting closer.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cReally? Are you sure you haven\u2019t been out in the sun too long?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two gigantic women started debating/arguing again the shrunken straw hats in Robin\u2019s hand started debating themselves. Usopp was the first to speak up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay guys am I crazy or is there something coming down from the sky?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others guys merely shrugged but Usopp whonhad the best eyesight of them all wasn\u2019t convinced and remained focused on the potential incoming projectile. After a few seconds the object became clear, there was something coming down from the sky and it seemed oddly familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Closer and closer the object got and as it came nearer it became louder and more clear. The object as it turned out to be was in fact the straw hats musician and now 1 inch tall Brook! The skeleton was screaming as he got closer and closer to the ground! As luck would have it though he wouldn\u2019t land on the ground, in fact it would be a rather soft and pleasant landing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was free falling the two gigantic women were still discussing the so called \u201csound\u201d from above them. Robin was sure she heard it and Nami was less than convinced. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cLook Robin it\u2019s a really hot day and we\u2019ve been out here for a while now, it wouldn\u2019t be unusual for you to be imaging things due to the heat.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine Nami now if you would just listen for a moment instead of talking you might be a Kenyan to hear the sound\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Nami was getting ready to retort the unexpected happened, from the sky Brook landed right in between her magnificent massive boobs causing them to jiggle furiously for a second. Almost on cue the women stopped arguing as Nami felt her boobs jiggled from out of nowhere. Robin noticed this as well and looks right at Nami\u2019s chest before addressing the red headed navigator. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cNami, I think your boobs just jiggled\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cI KNOW THEY DID ROBIN!!!!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamis sudden outburst was so loud I caused the tiny crew in Robin\u2019s hand to fall back comically in both shock and fear as their titanic navigator yelled at their equally titanic archeologist. The crew however were curious as well as to what caused the momentum shift in Nami\u2019s bra, something that made sanji blush in perversion. Nami however fearing the worst as the exact same thing happened to Robin nervously pulled back her top and looked down it. To her shame and disgust there he was tucked tightly between her huge mountainous breasts, their musician Brook. As with Luffy, Brook answered the only way he knew how. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy hello Nami fancy seeing you here. Now as much as I like where I currently am I would much prefer it if you could show me your panties Yohohohohoho!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word Nami firmly plucked Brook from her cleavage and set him on her open plan. No sooner had the skeleton gotten to his feet again Nami violently slammed down her fist on top of him. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cNO WAY!!!!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Nami\u2019s outburst shocked and terrified the tiny straw hats as they had to hang onto Robin\u2019s hand for dear life as they weren\u2019t almost knocked for a loop. Robin however was her usual calm and collected self as she she addressed Brook. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cAh there you are Brook I was wondering where you had gotten to. Well now that we\u2019ve found everyone we should discuss what it is we cannot should do to help them.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami however was still sour over the circumstance of how they had found Brook and wanted a little more payback. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cNow hold on a minute Robin. Whilst I agree that we should help them find a way back to normal size I feel like we\u2019d be missing out on a major opportunity if we did so immedietly.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami said this as she dropped a comically flattened Brook onto Robin\u2019s open palm as the other Straw Hats minus Sanji attended to him. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying Nami? That we should take advantage of our crew whist their this size?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying Robin! I mean it\u2019s the least these guys could do for us after all we do for them right? And I\u2019m sure one or two of them might actually enjoy it haha\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this Sanji began dancing and swooning over the chance to serve Nami and Robin whale the other Straw Hats voiced their disapproval. Beofre they could even say a word the lights went out as Robin simply placed her other hand over the top of the Straw Hats enveloping them in darkness as the gigantic women discussed their fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of discussion the two women came to an agreement and so they decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After an eventful morning Nami and Robin had successfully managed to locate the rest of the crew, unfortunately they were all incredibly small at only an inch tall each. Nonetheless the pair had found them and they now currently resides in Robin\u2019s hands shrouded in darkness as she held one hand over the other trapping the Straw Hats in darkness whilst the gigantic duo discussed their fate. Nami who was quite sour over discovering the tiny Brook in her cleavage had suggested the two take advantage of this rare opportunity and have the shrunken crew serve them for a while. Now Robin who was usually the rational and reasonable one was actually considering Nami\u2019s proposition, something which terrified the guys as they awaited their fate. Luckily or perhaps unluckillly depending on how you look at it, something was about to happen that would change everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere and completely unbeknownst to the crew a rather familiar fog was creeping in. Yes this mysterious pinkish thin fog began enveloping the entire Thousand Sunny. The two women were completely oblivious to this occurrence as they were still discussing whether or not to make their shrunken crew mates temporary servants. It would be a few minutes before they would notice the fog. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHmm why this is a rather interiguing idea indeed Nami. I guess I can see the fun side of our friends unfortunate possibly irreversible situation\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing Robin say irreversible the tiny crew in her hands began shouting in anger that Robin would make such a joke whilst they were in such a predicament, however Robin simply squeezed her ands together causing the crew to stop yelling for the time being. Nami seeing this couldn\u2019t help but snicker and get a few ideas about what to do with the guys. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cHihihi you see how easy that was Robin? Face it the guys are powerless right now and when we eventually find a way to get them back to normal size I\u2019m sure that they wouldn\u2019t do a thing to us anyway. So let\u2019s have some fun dammit and show these boys whose boss!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Nami finshed her proclamation herself and Robin finally noticed their surroundings and saw the fog blanketing the sunny with ease. Immedietly Nami became serious as did Robin as the two gigantic women sprung into action. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on? We have an unidentified fog, quick Robin let\u2019s head inside it may be toxic!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cRight Nami just let me put our crew somewhere safe.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked over her insanely hot and sexy body and came to a conclusion as to where to put the crew. Opening her hand she looked down at them with her usual emotionless face and addressed them. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to put you boys somewhere safe for the time being and freaky this is the only solution so stay put and don\u2019t squirm too much.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said Robin simply lowered her hand and deposited the crew right in the depths of her enormous cleavage. The tiny crew found themselves buried deep Inbetween Robin\u2019s two titanic orbs, rather uncomfortably as they were all stacked on top of each other near enough, as everyone was shouting and trying to rearrange their positions (minus Sanji who was in heaven) Robin began to walk briskly towards the inside of the ship causing her breasts to sway and jiggle giving the straw Hats a rather bouncy ride (Again Sanji was in heaven) as she made her way inside the sunny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering Nami gave an update of the fog explaining how it was something she had never seen beofre Andy that she had no idea what it could or would do to them, however after a few minutes the fog started to light up and eventually shone so bright it distorted the gigantic women\u2019s view casingnthem to shield their eyes the best they could as the straw hats in Robin Cleavage did the same albeit by burying their faces deep into Robin\u2019s fleshy mounds (at this Sanji had a massive no bleed rivaling that of the one on Fishman Island) to in order to block out the light. After a few more minutes the light began to vanish and eventually Nami and Robin were able to open their eyes.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWell that certainly was strange and unexpected. Are you ok Nami?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cOuch! Yeah yeah I\u2019m fine, man that light was bright what the hell was that?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the weather expert ms Navigator so I was hoping you could tell me.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cObviously I have no clue other wise I wouldn\u2019t be asking! But forget that are Luffy and guys ok?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know allow me to check.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami who had not seen where Robin had put the crew blushed bright red when she saw Robin pulll back her top slightly and gaze once more inbetween her magnificent breasts. From there Robin could see that the crew despite being extremely cramped and dizzy from the journey were relatively fine, except possibly Sanji but he\u2019ll be fine...probably. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cYes Nami it appears they are alive.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cI swear you\u2019re unbelievable sometimes Robin, I can\u2019t believe you actually let those perverts in there.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201cWell it was the most logical place to put them at the time and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s no big deal their only breasts. But enough about my chest...where are we Nami?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami spun around and looked out of the window and saw that the ship was no longer in the sea it was previously, this was completely unexpected but with all the things that had happened today it may have been the least unusual, as it turns out the fog had transported the Thousand Sunny to...</span></div></div>",

Where am I!?</i> Taking in his surroundings, he quickly figured out that he was on a ship, based on the familiar smell of the ocean, but what didn't make sense was that it looked like the entire ship had been made for giants! Then a massive sandaled foot crashed down right next to him knocking him of his feet! Looking up, he saw an orange-haired woman walking towards the helm of the ship. \"Luffy! I'm going to take the ship to port at that island town, Take down our flag so we don't scare anyone!\" Garrods heart was racing, he was on the Thousand Sunny, The ship of the Straw Hat Pirates! \"<i>Why!? Why am I tiny and on the Straw Hats ship!?</i>\" He saw Monkey D. Luffy stretch his arms and wrapped them around the mast and launched himself towards it.... faceplanting onto the main mast. Garrod then looked back at the orange-haired woman, (which he presumed to be Cat Burglar Nami) who was face-palming at her captains failure to climb up the mast. \"<i>Man,</i> Garrod thought to himself <i>for a pirate captain with a bounty of 500,000,000 berris, he's not too smart.</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were getting ready to dock Garrod realized that the only way he could've ended up at this size was by Vice Admiral Tiffa's devil fruit! \"<i>But why would she do that? And how did I end up here?</i>\"<br>\r\nThese questions would have to wait until later, you needed to find a place to hide and fast. The Straw Hats had gathered around in the middle area of the ship. \"Alright you guys, it's my turn to watch the ship while we restock on supplies, here's a list of things we'll need.\" The Cat-Burglar gave everyone a long list of supplies. \"Make sure that you're disguised so that we don't start anything while we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone left the ship except Nami and a tall woman with black hair that you recognized as the Devil Child Nico Robin. \"I'll stay here with you Nami.\" Robin said. \"Sure Robin, I noticed a lot of Marine ships in the area, I'd feel safer if someone else was here with me.\" Garrod knew that leaving the ship would be a bad idea as he could easily be trampled under the feet of the towns folk if he wandered into town. He hated the idea but he knew that his only option was to try and contact one the women on board the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question was, which one? </span></div></div>",

Just as he was about to exit the grass and run across the wooden boards to her. He suddenly realized something. He was still dressed in his marine outfit.

Her sandals were off and she was tapping her foot as she read. When Garrod got to her feet he started to think on ways to get her attention. He decided to just start hitting her soles until she noticed him. Eventually she lowered her foot onto Garrod, not crushing him but instead pinning him to her sandal. He was right under her toes, and she was feeling him with them. Robin giggled to herself, she liked the strange creature that was underneath her toes. She tapped her toes onto it and clenched them together, playing with it.<br>\r\n\"What a strange bug, I wonder what it is?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrod wasn't sure what to think of Robins feet. They oddly smelt like flowers and coconuts. She was beating him with her toes but it was kind of like a massage, and the constant rubbing from her feet gave him a tent in his pants.\"<i>Great, I'm getting an erection from a wanted pirates feet.</i>\" Eventually she stopped playing with the \"bug\" and used her Devil Fruit to create an eye in her foot, staring right at Garrod. Then she sprouted arms on the ground and moved Garrod right in front of her face. \"Well well, it appears that this \"bug\" is actually a marine!\" She then made smaller arms and grabbed each of Garrods limbs and started examining him. \"It would seem that you are just a chore boy, am I right?\" She looked more curious than angry, so Garrod didn't feel the need to hide anything. she had sprouted an ear on a smaller arm and moved it in front of his face like a microphone. \"Yes I'm a chore boy. Can you please help me? I don't know how I got here or why I'm so small.\" Robin believed your story, fortunately, but she didn't let you down just yet. \"Well either you're the worst spy in the world or you're telling the truth. Either way, you're stuck with me for the time being.\" Robin's eyes went towards the tent in his pants, making him nervous at how she would react. \"I guess you liked my feet huh?\" Robin gave him a sly look, clearly planning something. She then dropped him into her cleavage and went back to reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just keep you there for now.\" Garrod was blushing hard as Robin kept him in her massive cleavage.<br>\r\n\"W-why did you--\" He was cut off by an arm Robin sprouted on her breasts covering his mouth, \"I'm trying to read you know, it's rude to interrupt.\" Robin said that and pushed her breasts together, making Garrod realize just how insignificant he was to her. \"By just pressing my breasts together a little more I could turn you into nothing but a red stain. You wouldn't want that now, would you?\" Garrod was starting to regret his decision to contact this pirate, but at least he wasn't dead... yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobins cleavage was tight, Garrod barely had enough room to wiggle, much less move around. Every now and then Robin would giggle when he struggled. The worst part about all of this was that he still had the tent in his pants, being in between these massive breasts was making him harder. Robin felt this and giggled even more, \"Looks like I found a perverted bug too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin got up from her chair and started cleaning up her area.\"Now the only question is... should I show you to Nami? Or should I keep you for myself?\"</span></div></div>",

The basic rules are pretty simple<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Try to keep the people in character if possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Try to avoid killing someone unless they're either a bad guy or it's the end of a storyline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The only thing I'll really restrict is toilet material. Anything else will be accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Try to keep it realistic to the OP Universe. IE: Don't introduce someone like Naruto or someone in real life. OC's however, will be allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Only girls can be the giant ones. Giant guys can be used in minor roles, but the main point of the interactive is to interact with giant females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with those basic rules also keep in mind that you will be allowed to create your own Devil Fruits to give so-and-so powers. But keep in mind to not repeat any already-made fruits and the fact that the character could no longer swim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny sizes are allowed, so a girl could stop at ten feet tall, or become too big for measurement. Similar to a shrunken guy, he can be two feet tall, or be too small to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that being said, enjoy! Rewards will be given to those who add.
