The documenting of her dreams had become quite elaborate in the last five months. She used her insights from the dream interpretations to map out her near-future choices. A diagnosis of brain cancer at the very beginning of the year had crushed a small fistful of dreams before her, so she had become all the more willing to note what her subconscious brought forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay 19, 2008<br>\r\nI have been piloting a small, ancient brig on calm open waters. On the ship I have no personal life. Yet, there is a feeling that I am somehow connected to a person on shore. I endure pain at the very crown of my head when I try to acknowledge this connection. Suddenly a storm fills the sky and sea around me. All colors fade into the shadows of the blue-grey horizon. I have the instinct to turn the bow of my ship into the very force of the growing waves. I am aware of the real possibility of any moment crashing and dying upon sharp rocks near a choppy harbor even if everything is done \"right.\" The connection remains despite my fears and the sense of being off-course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a reassuring voice, booming with the wind, \"There is only where I am, and the way to me cannot be lost. You may simply be keeping yourself out of view.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, so this is my fault now, huh? Will a mutiny at the core of my own heart defeat my desire to keep going? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must be treasure-hunting; looking for a miracle. There is a metamorphosis possible when I simply hold my hand out.  It is more than an invitation - it is a fearful pleading when the monster is creeping ever closer. What happens when I cannot see either it, or you approach to pull me to safety? If I do not have confidence in the voice which is leading me, and whether we are communicating on the most basic level, so how can I be anything but already across the threshold of Death?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than once I have drowned in a dream , and I wonder if this will be how I ultimately leave my body behind. And I tremble that the thought of experiencing a different body\u2019s lasting hug around my soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dream, but live my life with honor in not moving on the desire to try having control our such details. </span></div></div>",

It might have read something like this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie Letren smoothed the bangs on Varja's sweat-streaked forehead. She thought to herself, <i>this position isn't going to last  the month I'd hoped it would.</i> Maggie was brought in for Varja's hospice just four days earlier. Most of those days, Varja was happy to have the company and talk. A few other times, Varja's state was close to comatose. It was plain that Varja was actively dying, but there was some stubborn hanging on to be found in the writing that she continued to do in this journal. Varja directly asked Maggie's opinion just the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a very interesting story, I will give you that. Except, Varja dear, it's just a little hard to follow because {I hate to admit it} of the words you used. I don't understand them. I think if you made the writing easier or gave some more insight into the Varja I didn't know a week ago. That's the life you're really trying to \"document,\" as you say. Then, for those that will be left behind when you are gone...it would be easier for them to add some meaning onto it. I mean, why you'd be spending you time and energy doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She has her clear moments. Still writing out things for me to read, for when the fever takes her out. Is that sane?.</i> </span></div></div>",

You should see my new niece!  She's so adorable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have pictures?\" the third girl whose chestnut-color hair was done in two ponytails (one on each side of her head) asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!  She was just born!  My mom took some pictures--this IS her first grandchild--but it will take several days for the roll to be developed, once she gets it to the photo store.  Hey!  You want to go to the hospital during visiting hours and get a look at her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two girls replied in excited affirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that going to see The Osmond Brothers and getting to meet them after the show was the most exciting thing that could ever happen to me, but being an aunt is ten times more exciting than that--and that's pretty exciting, as I would love to marry Donny when I grow up.  He has to marry somebody, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather marry Michael Jackson!\" the curly-haired girl said.  \"Do you know that we have the same birthday?  I mean, the same year and everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, we know,\" the girl with the ponytails replied with a giggle.  \"This is about the millionth time you told us this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't marry Michael Jackson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who invited you and why not?\" the curly-haired girl addressed the freckle-faced boy who seemed to have appeared out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's the wrong color for you!  What would people say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'd say we made an adorable couple--so there!  The world is changing, Randy.  I bet we'll even have a Black President in our lifetime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you're weird, Maggie!  I think you need to see one of those psychiatrists!\"  Randy turned to a couple of near-by boys.  \"Baby Elephant thinks that Michael Jackson is going to be the first Black President. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well!  You said something like that.  Anyway, you're not gonna marry Michael Jackson, and it will be at least 100 more years before we have anybody but White men even running for President.  This country's almost 200 years old, and it hasn't happened yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, just ignore those guys!  They don't know what they're talking about. . .\" the girl who had just become an aunt said.  \"Anyway, my new niece's name is Varja Suzanne Wayne. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia picked up her book and looked at the name of the main character:  Varja Wayne<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hospice care worker's name was Maggie--just like the girl who was dreaming of marrying Michael Jackson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this a dream or what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only had she been transported back in time to around what. . .1970?. . .but she was also living inside of a book that was supposed to be fiction.  Or was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at who had written the book and realized that--though it was written as a story--it was actually real, as the author of it was Maggie Letren, the hospice worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the dedication and had to smile, as it was dedicated to her husband and best friend, Randy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia wasn't sure if she would still find her job waiting for her when she returned from wherever this was she had been sent, but she wasn't going to worry about that.  She was just going to enjoy this experience for as long as it lasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that there was only one hospital in town, so that's where the girls would be going to later that evening.  She decided to sit on a bench in the park across from the hospital and read more of the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would only read it so far, though, because she didn't want to know if Varja ended up dying or if some miracle happened and she survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just wanted to share in the joy and excitement that these girls were feeling at the moment.</span></div></div>",
