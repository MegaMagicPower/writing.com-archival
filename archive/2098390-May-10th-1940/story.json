Your family, which includes your father, Sam, your mother, Mary, and your sister, Abigail, are sitting at the dining table, with fear on their faces. <br>\r\n\"What will we do, what will we do\", your father murmurs over and over again, clenching his fists, and furrowing his brow.<br>\r\n\"We must not give up, Sam! Remember how the Germans were defeated in the first war? We will do it again!\", says your mother, hope rising up in her voice.<br>\r\n\"There is nothing we can do. Nothing. All of our resources have been exhausted. The Germans are just unstoppable this time.\", your father replies, with a dark tone in his voice.<br>\r\n\"Kids, leave the table.

However, when you wake up, something doesn't seem right. The fighting which was far away last night is now ahead of your street! You quickly realize that that means the Germans have already made it past your block, and are quickly approaching the city center! You quickly get dressed and rush out to the family room, where your parents are already there in fierce discussion.<br>\r\n\"The plan can't be carried out anymore\", your mother tells you both, shaking her head.<br>\r\n \"We must find another plan now, I will write a letter to my friend\", she then exclaims, whilst walking back to her room.<br>\r\n\"We must be ready for anything now, we don't know what is coming!\", says your father, sighing directly after.<br>\r\nAfter what seems like an eternity, with the gunfire slowly making it further and further away from you, your mother finally rushes out in panic, with the letter in hand. <br>\r\n\"We must deliver it now\", says your mother, \"before it is too late!\"  She rushes out of the room, and out of the building. Retreating back to your room, you see her carefully crossing the street, and making it to another building across the way. Soon, you see her come back again. You once again, go back to the family room. She walks into the family room, and comments,<br>\r\n\"The plan has been made, we are to join the rebellion in France. She says they will be able to keep us safe from the Germans. We must leave at once, across the street, into her building. She says that the plans have already been made for us to cross the city with her, into a rebel hideout.\".<br>\r\nQuickly, she rushes to your sister's room and goes to wake her up. While she is doing this, you manage to scrape together everything you could need while away into a leather bag, and strap it onto your back. Finally, after about 15 minutes, everyone is ready in the family room, and preparing to leave. Finally, she makes a quick once over of the apartment, and you make your way onto the street,<br>\r\nInstantly, after leaving the building, fear hits you. You think to yourself of the possibilities of possible snipers, or maybe a stray soldier that catches you. However, you quickly make it across the rough cobblestone road, and into the tall gray apartment building across from yours, where your mom's friend lives. She meets you at the entrance and quickly ushers you inside. You climb the stairs hurriedly, rushing to get to her room. Finally, as you get inside her individual apartment, she immediately starts talking with your mother, discribing multiple plans on how they should make it across the city. Finally, they decide on everything, and the plans are made. They tell you that they will be leaving tommorow, and that they will continue to talk about additional plans. Finally, she tells you that you should go to your designated 'room' in her apartment, and wait until tommorow to come out, as they have important information to talk about. You retreat to your 'room', and without anything else to do, you decide to take a nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes anything interesting happen when you are asleep?</span></div></div>",

In six weeks from 10 May 1940, German forces defeated Allied forces in a series of mobile operations, and conquered France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, bringing land operations on the Western Front to an end until 6 June 1944. Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940 and attempted an invasion of France.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe German plan for the invasion of France consisted of two main operations. In Fall Gelb (Case Yellow), German armoured units pushed through the Ardennes and then along the Somme valley to cut off and surround the Allied units that had advanced into Belgium, to meet the expected German invasion. When British, Belgian and French forces were pushed back to the sea by the mobile and well-organized German operation, the British evacuated the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and several French divisions from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the withdrawal of the BEF, the German forces began Fall Rot (Case Red) on 5 June. The sixty remaining French divisions made a determined resistance but were unable to overcome the German air superiority and armoured mobility. German tanks outflanked the Maginot Line and pushed deep into France. German forces occupied Paris unopposed on 14 June. This caused a chaotic period of flight for the French government and led to a collapse of the French army. German commanders met with French officials on 18 June with the goal of forcing the new French government to accept an armistice that amounted to surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story is about a young French man, aged 15, seperated from the rest of his family when the Nazi's won over Paris, and forced to join the rebellion. We will refer to him as \"Pierre\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Pierre, 15, Male</b></u><br>\r\n ~Height about 6' 2''.<br>\r\n ~Weighs about 150 pounds<br>\r\n ~Black, shortish Hair<br>\r\n ~Tannish skin color.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <u><b>Rules</b></u><br>\r\n~No killing the main character (Killing others is allowed)<br>\r\n~Nothing related to sex/fetishes please<br>\r\n~No violence that is too gory.<br>\r\n~No suddenly joining the opposite side or something random like turning into a unicorn.<br>\r\n~Please make sure that your facts are accurate, or at least not like \"The leader of the Nazi's was Joseph Stalin\"<br>\r\n~Keep adding on!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story will begin on the next page.</td>",
