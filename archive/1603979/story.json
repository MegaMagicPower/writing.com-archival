And sometimes their plans haven't even gotten off the ground. But Sgt. Keroro is determined to one day take over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Keroro held a meeting with his platoon, Private Second Class Tamama, a cute young Keron with a very ugly split personality, Corporal Giroro, the trigger happy munitions expert with a fiery temper, Sergant Major Kururu, the brilliant but demented inventor known for his dark personality, and he even brought in Lance Corporal Dororo, the often-forgotten ninja. Also there was Angol Moa, destroyer of worlds &amp; niece-figure &amp; lover of Keroro, (Tamama despises her, because he admired Keroro as well)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up,\" the Sergeant announced, \"I've finally figured out how we can take Pekopon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always say that...\" replied Giroro. He knew the past several hundred plans to overtake Pekopon have failed, usually because of Keroro's tendency to not finish the plans for invasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time it will be different from the past several hundred times! Kururu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kukuku,\" snickered Kururu, \"using the technology &amp; parts of several of our past inventions used for transforming, including the Age Transformation Gun &amp; the Oni Girl Gun, I have created... The MULTI TF GUN! It can change age, make people into animals, &amp; change size &amp; appearance, as well as a few other effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gero gero, Excellent!\" said Keroro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small Problem, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't tested it yet, but I will quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not testing it on me!\" Giroro shouted. Giroro was always used as the guinea pig for Kururu's twisted experiments, and he wasn't going to allow himself to be exposed to the numerous effects of THAT weapon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll find a test subject,\" announced Keroro, taking it from the inventor's grasp, \"and soon we'll have Pekopon on their knees!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to test it on...  </span></div></div>",

Besides, he wanted to reduce the former pink-haired terror down in more than just age to show just how helpless she was before him. So he activated the \"Shrink\" option, and fired at Baby Natsumi. Within a matter of seconds, the baby shrank down until she was no bigger than a mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kero Kero Kero! Not so high-and-mighty now, are you, Natsumi-domo?\" Keroro taunted, picking up Natsumi by the back of her dress (which shrank with her) and dangling her in front of his face, while occasionally poking her little tummy. The (really) tiny baby squeaked and cooed as she was being dangled high above the floor, practically oblivious to her current situation. Suddenly, she slid out of the little dress and started to fall towards the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whoops</i>, thought Keroro, and quickly shot out his free hand to catch Natsumi in time. She was unhurt but dazed, and upon recovering, she started to crawl around on the Keronian's hand, as she was now small enough to fit on his palm with room to spare. Keroro sat down, put the dress back on the baby, and let her crawl and roll around on both his hands for a bit. He was amazed by this turn of events. Kururu's own shrinking device was huge and cumbersome, but he managed to find a way to fit the technology onto a more portable device, along with several other effects from some of his other creations. Despite being a creepy jerk, Keroro had to admit, Kururu was one heck of a scientist. As he watched Natsumi grab onto his thumb, he was trying to make up his mind on what to do now.</span></div></div>",

So Keroro decided to have a little fun with the size feature by putting the settings at growth. Once Natsumi was siting upright again, he fired the gun at her, causing her to grow to a giant size. Not large enough to fill his room or even the whole house, but still pretty huge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Keroro was setting the device to make her shrink, the now giant Baby Natsumi picked up Keroro, causing him to drop the gun.

HELLLLLLLP!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Natsumi pulled him out covered with saliva &amp; not looking very pleased. But of course, she didn't seem to notice in the slightest, as she began giggling &amp; slamming him against the ground &amp; swinging him around like he was a toy. Eventually, a few of the figures of Keroro's gunpla collection got accidentally knocked over by Natsumi's swinging. \"NOT MY GUNPLA!\" he said upon seeing this. At that point, he'd had enough. The moment he got near to the ground, he quickly grabbed ahold of the carpet as best as he could. Natsumi began trying to pull him out, but he had a firm grip &amp; a steel determination. Soon, he began making his way towards the TF Gun by grabbing handful of carpet after handful in order to move, as well as keep himself from being swung around again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat'll happen next?</span></div></div>",

The whole city looked awestruck at the teen titan, while she looked ecstatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Whoaaaa, I'm humongous ! The city looks so pretty from up here !</b>\" she rejoiced, scrutinizing the horizon. \"<b>Hmm... Am I the right size though ?</b></span></div></div>",

She looked a lot like him and wore his clothes, except she also had hair that reached her back, small breasts, and also obviously resembles Fuyuki's mother, Aki.<br>\r\nFuyuki, hearing the smoke hiss and no longer noticing the bright light, slowly opened \"her\" eyes.

Now that I see the ray gun was a success, I can proceed with Natsumi-dono and Mama-dono, then this planet.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" Fuyuki asked. Keroro trembled in shock, realizing that he whispered to himself instead of keeping his thoughts in his head like he was supposed too.<br>\r\n\"Nothing.

Keroro smiled evilly and placed a hand on his chin.<br>\r\n                 \"Sorry Giroro but you are the tough guy around here, I'm just a tad curious what you look like when you're older. Gero, gero, gero!!\" Keroro laughed evilly as he messed with one of the dials and he took aim at the red alien frog. Before Giroro could react a giant yellow ball shaped energy blast popped out of the gun's barrel and got Giroro square in the chest and exploded. Everyone waited patiently as the giant wall of smoke started to clear and when everything was visible everyone stood frozen in their spot. <br>\r\n                  \"Keroro I'm going to kill you!!!\" Giroro yelled as he grabbed Keroro and went to choke him but noticed Keroro kept staring at something that was behind him. \"What's your problem?\" <br>\r\n                  \"Maybe a cat got his tongue.\" a very familiar and creep-ily deep voice suggested and a click from a reloading gun was heard behind his head. Giroro forced himself to turn around and gasped seeing a red Keronian that looked just like him but his eyes weren't the normal black color, they were small and beady red, giving off a very threatening glare. Oh...and not to mention that he was holding a 22 mm caliber gun right in between Giroro's eyes.<br>\r\n                  \"G-Giropon?!\" everyone gasped, this wasn't the first time that a 'Giroro clone' had came to the household. Back when a mysterious rock from outer space made Giroro's seven personalities come to life a few months ago, they hoped to never see him or the other six personalities. Giroro swore under his breath and withen a few seconds both of the Giroros were wrestling each other [to the death maybe?].<br>\r\n                   \"Kyaa!! How would you say? Commotion in motion!!\" Mois screamed as she covered her eyes. Kururu laughed evilly as he grabbed his gun back from Keroro. <br>\r\n                   \"Kukuku!! Keroro you idiot, you put it on the wrong dial!\" <br>\r\n                   \"Gero? Really Kururu? Then what brought Giropon up? I want one too!!\" he squealed as he could picture himself with seven other of 'him-selves'.  Kururu laughed again and pointed to the small dial with a question on it. <br>\r\n                    \"Idiot, this is the miscellaneous dial!! So after we zap someone with this then we won't know what happens do we? Kukuku!\" he chuckled and then froze as a sword's blade was placed at his throat from behind, just the same way a ninja would do it. Kururu looked back at another figure that looked at Dororo but a grey-ish blue and had small green beady eyes. \"And who are you?\" <br>\r\n                     \"D-Dororo?!\" Keroro and Tamama gasped, even the two Giroros stopped to see what the commotion was about. Giropon looked at the darker Dororo and looked over seeing the real Dororo trying to smooth a bump that was on his head, he instantly knew who it was. <br>\r\n                     \"That's not Dororo.\" Giropon said as he stood up and walked over to the other Dororo and patted his shoulder as if they were buddies. \"This is Doropon. He's the Sergeant that in my platoon.\" he said. Doropon looked over at Giropon and removed the sword from Kururu's throat and Kururu gave out a nervous laugh. <br>\r\n                     \"Isn't that something? Kukuku! A Giropon, and a Doropon!\" <br>\r\n                     \"And you're the one to talk?\" Doropon asked as he placed the sword back in his sheath. \"We have a Keropon, a Tamapon, and a Kurupon as well.\"<br>\r\n                     \"Really?!\" <br>\r\n                     \"How are they like?!\" Tamama and Keroro asked as they gave big shiny eyes at him. Doropon chuckled half heartedly. <br>\r\n                     \"You really want to know?\" <br>\r\n                     \"Yes!!\" they yelled and Doropon looked up at them and smirked.<br>\r\n                     \"They're nothing like you, and they're nothing like us either...they're actually girls.\" he said. Keroro, Tamama, and Kururu stayed silent and Kururu gave out another nervous laugh. Giroro froze not saying anything and looked at Giropon.<br>\r\n                      \"You're kidding.\"<br>\r\n                      \"Nope, he's right we're the only men in the group, which is pretty nice when you think about it but when you <i>really</i> think about it, it's hell.\" he said and looked over at Doropon. \"So how'd you get here?\"<br>\r\n                      \"Well when the green guy shot you this guy was in the way.\" Doropon said as he pointed at Dororo. \"He tripped and after I was brought him I gave him a welcoming punch.\" he said. Keroro sighed and messed with some more dials. <br>\r\n                      \"I wonder what else this thing can do!\"<br>\r\n                      \"Don't you even dare!!!\" both of the Giroros yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[[I'm gonna stop here, I give credit of course to maniacaldude for this awesome topic thinger, I had to try it out, it was the only Keroro Gunso stuff here other then my own posts.
