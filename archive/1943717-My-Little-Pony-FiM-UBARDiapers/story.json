How would she go about doing it? Would she have to wait until her heat started up? Or would she have to resort to unbirth? These questions were not easy ones to answer, in fact she had been debating on what to do for most of the day... which if she knew herself as much as she thought she did it was kinda off since she didn't tend to dwell on such things so often. The sound of happy humming from Applebloom's room snapped her out of her almost trance-like state, bringing to mind the fact that Applebloom was getting older as well; And all her fond memory's of watching the little filly crusade around the town to find her cutiemark made Applejack feel nostalgic and happy, it made her want things to go back to those simple times.</span></div></div>",

The two of them a relatively quiet as they make their way inside the building.  The two of them say nothing to each other as their hoof steps echo off the walls around them, each of them silently thinking of what was about to happen, what they were about to undertake.  It wasn't long before they came up to where Twilight was, apparently Twilight had taken the liberty of getting things set up for them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello girls, so.  You're ready for this then?  After I complete the spell there's no going back.  So if you want to back out, now's your chance.\"  Twilight said as she looked at both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity and Sweetie Belle seemed to think for a moment, if this is really what they wanted, then they turned to face each other, locking eyes, the two of them shared a moment together, a moment of understanding, and they then both turned to Twilight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're ready.\"  They said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded her head quietly as her horn began to spark with magic.  Over the course of a few moments the steady glow of her horn turned into a brightly burning light, the magic she was building could be felt in the air, practically charging it with energy.  Once Twilight finished preparing she extended her magic to Sweetie Belle, enveloping her in a lavender glow, the filly lifted off of the ground a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle didn't know what to expect as the magic touched her, but it felt just like being lifted up like normal, with magic anyway, but soon that familiar tingle of levitation grew, not in a bad way, but it felt like her entire body was constricting.  Like she was being gently squeezed, not hard, or painfully, but enough to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity watched as her little sister became even smaller, watching the years fade away from Sweetie Belle until she looked like a newborn foal.  At which point the magical embrace that enveloped Sweetie Belle shot a tendril of magic at Rarity, more specifically the tendril of magic worked it's way into Rarity's vagina, causing Rarity to shiver a little bit at the sensation, her eyes fluttering a bit as it happened.  The magic made it's way to the mare's womb, where it began to enlarge the space, slowly stretching it out in order to make room for its new occupant.  Thankfully it didn't feel much worse that having herself spread a bit wide to Rarity.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Sweetie Belle gently floated her way through the tendril of magic, which dissipated as Sweetie went through it.  Then she entered Rarity, and in a few moments Sweetie Belle was gently laid inside of Rarity, the magic staying for a few moments to connect everything properly, once the magic was done and it faded away, Rarity could feel the pressure of her sister lying inside of her own body.  It was a sudden thing to take in as she steadied herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked up at Rarity and said, \"Well, if everything goes accordingly, you should be giving birth to Sweetie Belle in..\"</span></div></div>",

I thought you were master of magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I can make you grow to pony size, but its effect won't last long, this is how you come from your world to ours, meaning that you're in your <i>normal</i> size in a sense\" You couldn't believe it, it's mean that you're in your actual size all along? that this world is actually huge? you sigh, tears start to form in your eyes as you cry, this too much for you to handle, Celestia was heartbroken seeing you cry, this wasnt her intention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I didn't meant to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is alot to take, I'm sorry for my outburst, Princess I... just remembered that I won't be missed anyway.\" You tell celestia your life in earth, pretty much a normal boring life, your parents were negleteful, you did anything to impress them from good grades to actual complex jobs but they just ignore you and shunned you and favored your sister, suprisely, she was the only one that cared for you and you were glad for that but when you started college you lost contact with them, meaning that they finally forgot about you, trully in your own. Celestia looked at you sad, it was very depressing and lonely life, kind like her and her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>perhaps I made the right choice, he needs this as much I need it too</i> the true about this experiment is that she wanted her own foal, her spell is was to teleport someone that have the same or similar traits as her, her goal was to unbirth you and birth you as a natural alicorn foal, a foal that she wanted for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where I start? this \"experiment\" will change my size right?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes this experiment will change you alot, a rebirthing experience\" <i>in the literal sense</i> she added in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...\" You say a little uncertain but intrigued \"how this begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With you entering in my womb\" You look at her suprised for several minutes, she continue. \"The process is with you entering in my marehood and my womb so I can begin changing you, in 11 months you will be reborn as an alicorn.\" <i>and my foal</i> she added in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute... is this possible... this mean that you will be my new mother?\" you ask trying to grasp the logic in that it was impossible then again, it was interdimensional travel, so anything could happen. for several minutes, Celestia was staring you, when a motherly smile appears in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I would like you to be my foal, for centuries I've been alone without knowing the joy of a family to nurture and after hearing your story I want to help you by filling that space that your parents abandoned in your heart... please you accept this, I understand if you don't want it but consider it for a time.\" she finshed you look at her, she already have tears in her eyes, she really telling the truth? you nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be your son, Princess.\" with these words finally said this can be the restart of your life.</span></div></div>",

You could probably escape, but what then? No it was better to just wait you decide. Besides, you did agree to this, kinda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to do you sit down on Twilights bed and, well wait. You hear Twilight and Cheerilee talking, about you and what would happen, but you don\u2019t listen. Your thought swirls with what\u2019s about to happen. You are scared, excited, worried, shocked, and elated all at once making a very interesting mix of emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat will happen once I\u2019m, inside? You think. \u201cWill I still keep my memories?\u201d \u201cWhat about growing up?\u201d You already asked yourself these things but you can\u2019t help but ask them again. You know that there is no going back, but you can\u2019t help but wonder just what will happen. You were starting a completely new life after all, all the way at the very beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are broken from your thoughts when the mares walk in. Cheerilee takes one look at you and breaks out into a warm smile. Hello little one. She says in a soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself relax and give a nervous smile in return. The mares notice. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d The teacher asks. \u201cWell, besides the obvious.\u201d She finishes embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough. \u201cWell, it\u2019s just.

I can\u2019t promises nothing will happen, this is a completely untested field after all, but you should still keep most of your memories.\u201d Twilight explains smiling at you. \u201cThe most obvious changes would be the limitations of your new body. You would be a foal after all and have to grow up again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace at that as Twilight continues. \u201cBesides that though you might experience some changes based on the mothers traits.\u201d \u201cIt is very possible that you will become an Earth Pony in the womb and take one some other genetic traits of you mother for example.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh at that but nod. \u201cAnd, after I\u2019m, inside?\u201d You ask causing Cheerliee to laugh. \u201cAfter you are in my womb I carry you around for a year silly.\u201d She says stroking your head. \u201cAnd then, I give birth to you and be your mommy.\u201d She finishes in a warm motherly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel some of your fear evaporate and you nod. Ok. Let\u2019s get this over with. You say. Cheerliee brightens and hugs you. Thank you baby. I promises to be a good mommy to you, and any of your future siblings. She adds with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight coughs breaking the moment. \u201cIf we can get started please? Just hold still and I\u2019ll cast the spell.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can choose anypony from the show that you want, including the ponified and human versions of anyone introduced in the movie; My Little Pony: Equestria Girls, though they will be ponified in this story. No 'Humans are in Equestria and are transformed only by being unbirthed'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings that will not be allowed for this story:<br>\r\n1. death.<br>\r\n2. gay stuff (ex.: Pip gets CV by Big Mac.)<br>\r\n3. In accordance with rule 2, CV (cock vore in case you are wondering.)<br>\r\n4. graphic or gory stuff like \"There was blood splattering everywhere as he/she entered the womb.\"<br>\r\n5. digestion (Age regressed to stage of an egg is ok though.)<br>\r\n6. Characters from My Little Pony Generations 1, 2, or 3.<br>\r\n7. cursing<br>\r\n8. using alcohol<br>\r\n9. fighting (struggling while being unbirthed is okay, but no pony gets hurt.)<br>\r\n10. ending storylines short.<br>\r\n11. making chapters with a sentence like \"They went through the door and then....\" with nothing before or after it and going straight to the next selection. (I will allow chapters like \"Do they get unbirthed head first or feet first\" and then you go to the next selection.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotices for this story:<br>\r\n1. Do not end the story after any of the ponies have been unbirthed. Keep the story going.<br>\r\n2. This will take place in the Pony world of My Little Pony FiM. No transporting to the real world or to the world of My Little Pony: Equestria Girls. <br>\r\n3. You can bring humans from either of the other worlds I just mentioned. You can also make your own characters for this story.<br>\r\n4. This story can also be used for anyone who is a fan of age regression and putting the MLP characters in diapers.<br>\r\n5. I will set up for a story line where you are the one who gets unbirthed, and use first person P.O.V.<br>\r\n6. I will allow sex scenes as long as they don't get very graphic and it will be from the unbirthed pony's point of view. (I will allow cutscenes taking place with the unbirther and other ponies.)<br>\r\n7. Be sure to keep options open so other writers have ways to spread their own storyline while branching off yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings allowed for this story:<br>\r\n1. Age regression (any stage before or after birth is fine.)<br>\r\n2. Transformation of pony type and/or gender. (this includes humans from MLP: EG turned to ponies and/or have their gender changed. No herms in this story though.)<br>\r\n3. Diapers<br>\r\n4. Breastfeeding<br>\r\n5. Baby equipment<br>\r\n6. Sex (as long as if someone is unbirthed they don't get hurt.)<br>\r\n7.Shrinking anypony, including yourself if you are the pony in a first Person P.O.V storyline.<br>\r\n8.Dragon characters are allowed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease email me if you have requests to do something I have not listed and I will see if I want to allow it.
