Floor after floor lurked many shadows, ready to attack them at any time. Minato, along with Yukari and Junpei had just explored the 12th floor of Tartarus, battle numerous shadows along the way. The 12th floor seemed much larger than the other ones before it, many twists and turns that seemed to lead to a dead end and they had to find the stairs to the next floor in order to keep exploring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's split up.\" Minato said to Yukari and Junpei, \"We'll cover more ground that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all split into different directions, when suddenly, Minato felt a wave of dizziness and a severe headache. Being tired can happen after a short time exploring Tartarus, but this felt different somehow from before, and far too quick. Minato brushed it off and continued to look for a way to the next floor, when suddenly, he heard a scream coming from Junpei in the distance followed by what sounded like a shadow attacking him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei was in danger, Minato thought. He began running to the direction of where he had heard Junpei when suddenly, the feeling of dizziness returned, even worse than before. Minato soon collapsed onto the floor and blacked out.</span></div></div>",

When she arrived to where she had heard him, she did not found anything there, no shadow or Junpei was in sight, with the exception of an object on the ground. It was an Evoker, a gun that fired blue fog which they used to summon their personas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be Junpei's.\", Yukari thought as she picked it up. Without the Evoker, they would not be able to summon their personas to fight against the shadows that lurked in Tartarus. Yukari continued to search the area, but with no success, until eventually she had arrived back at the area where they had all split off. This was bad, Yukari thought. Not only was Junpei missing and most likely in danger, Minato also seemed to be missing as well. She began going to the direction where Minato went, when suddenly, she stepped on something. She picked it up, it was another Evoker, more specifically, it was Minato's Evoker. To Yukari, her friends were in danger and she must find them before it's too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Minato had woken up. A headache was still lingering but not nearly as severe as before. He was still dizzy, but this was no time to rest, as he remembered that Junpei was in danger and he had to help him. As he regained his senses, he noticed something different. The walls appeared to be a lot further away than they were before and the ceiling was absurdly high up, as high as the sky. He looked around and noticed a massive brown object. Out of curiosity, Minato touched it and felt that it was made of leather. He then looked up, seeing that the brown object was connected to an absurdly high pillar of black on the lower half with the upper half being a pillar of skin, connected to an even larger expanse of pink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden, it began to make sense to Minato. The massive brown object was a shoe, the high pillar was someone's leg, which connected up a black mini-skirt along with a pink sweater. A massive Yukari was right before him, for Minato, she was to the scale of goddesses. If she was this massive to him, how small was he then? Could Yukari even see him, much less hear him if he were to call out to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato's thoughts were interrupted as Yukari's voice boomed from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i>MINATO, JUNPEI, WHERE ARE YOU?</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato was temporarily deafened by her voice. To make matters worse, the massive object that was Yukari's foot rose up into the air with astonishing speed and distance and came back down, producing an earthquake that knocked Minato back, almost crushing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a bad situation, Minato had to act fast. His options are to either try to communicate with Yukari but risk getting crushed by her or being left behind, or alternatively, attempt to climb her foot and going from there.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the beginning of August.  Yu Narukami and his friends had just captured Mitsuo Kubo after he killed their teacher and fled to the TV world.  While Yu had a gut feeling that this wasn't the end of the murder case he and his friends had been investigating since he came to Inaba, he still felt like progress was being made, and resolved to enjoy his summer break with his friends.  In fact, he was meeting one of his closest friends at the shrine today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko Amagi was waiting for him there, idly dangling a sandal from her foot as she sat on the steps to the main altar.  She brightened up when she noticed him, but at the same time seemed nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-um\u2026\u201d Yukiko began.  Yu had noticed her getting increasingly awkward around him lately, and hoped there wasn\u2019t anything he did to offend her.  Since she invited him here, he decided to let her speak her mind, and patiently motioned for her to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 remember Kasai-san?  The waitress you met yesterday?  Um\u2026 well, she told everyone about you, and they want me to bring you home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?  Huh\u2026 well, I\u2019ve always been curious about the inn.  It just occurred to me that I\u2019ve never been there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!  Good!  You\u2019re not offended,\u201d despite her relief, Yukiko seemed to be growing more nervous by the second.  \u201cWell, it\u2019s not unusual.  I mean, guests come all the time, and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were interrupted by the deputy mayor, who asked Yukiko about the television crews at the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u2026 that\u2019s today!  Sorry Yu-kun, I\u2019ve got to take a rain check.  The inn\u2019s being shown on a travel documentary and I need to go help\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai, the waitress Yu recognized, arrived.  In a panic, she told Yukiko that the \u201ctravel documentary\u201d was actually a ploy by the tabloid show \u201cNews of the Weird,\u201d which had been trying to do a show about the Amagi Inn being central to the Yamano murder for months, and were looking for Yukiko specifically.  Unfortunately, the show\u2019s reporter and his crew followed Kasai to the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shady reporter started hassling Yukiko like he had in the past.  Finally, he said something bad about the inn, and Yukiko lost her patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut the hell up\u2026\u201d Yukiko muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu blinked.  Normally, Yukiko was a head shorter than him, but as she stepped towards the smirking reporter, Yu would swear they were at eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t say another word about our inn!  Who would take your stupid ideas seriously?!\u201d  At this point, Yukiko seemed to be looming over the reporter, who at this point was getting indignant, and argued back.  Yu noted that his crew, meanwhile, was backing up in fear.  Yu smirked at this until he looked to his side and noticed that Kasai was backing up too, a confused and scared expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu looked at the scene in front of him begin, and realized something that months ago he\u2019d have thought impossible, and even now he at least found confusing.  Yukiko was growing.  At this point she was nearly ten feet tall and so angry and focused on the reporter that she didn\u2019t even notice yet.  Unfortunately, the reporter did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, who needs to record some washed up inn?  This is way freakier.  Kato!  Roll camera!  Get some shots of this!  A giant girl\u2019s gonna be great for our ratings!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKato didn\u2019t listen.  Kato ran.  Yukiko was twenty feet tall now, and only getting angrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!  I\u2019ve had enough of you!  If you won\u2019t leave me alone, I\u2019ll make you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the reporter could react, Yukiko punted him clear out of the shrine, into the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026 that felt good.  Wait\u2026 how was I able to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko looked around and seemed to only just now notice her situation.  Fortunately, her growth seemed to be slowing down for now, though she was still thirty feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what\u2019s happening to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai, having been silent this whole time, shrieked and ran from the shrine.  Whether it was the sight of Yukiko being so big, or the sight of her possibly killing someone, Yu couldn\u2019t be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKasai!  Don\u2019t leave!  Wait, I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko almost reached out to grab her, but seemed to think better of it.  She looked down at her side towards Yu, who barely came up to her calves at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYu-kun\u2026 help me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the short time since he came to Inaba, Yu Narukami had become a lot of things to a lot of people.  To his friends on the Investigation Team, he was their cool, unflappable leader.  To his uncle, he was a loyal and helpful nephew.  To his little cousin, he was nothing short of a god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, beneath all of these things, Yu Narukami was still a teenage boy growing up in a sexually repressed culture.  As such, when one of his best female friends spontaneously grew to six times her normal height, his train of thought docked at the same perverted station any teenage boy\u2019s would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My God\u2026 I could use them as beanbag chairs!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing the giantess looking at him, Yu craned his neck up further to meet Yukiko\u2019s eyes.  They were wide with a confusion that was rapidly becoming fear.  She started whimpering.  Yu was taken aback by how loud it seemed, despite probably only being a whisper if she were her normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYu-kun, help me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu snapped out of his reverie.  His dirtier thoughts on the subject could wait until this evening, when he was alone in his room and sure the Dojimas had gone to bed.  Right now, his friend needed him.  It was time to be the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYukiko, stay calm and listen to me,\u201d Yu said, a little louder than normal to ensure Yukiko heard him clearly from thirty feet above.  \u201cRight now we need to get you out of sight.  If too many people see you it could start a panic.  There\u2019s a clearing behind the shrine.  Follow me there as quickly and carefully as you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko steeled herself for the ordeal ahead.  \u201cAlright, Yu-kun.  I\u2019m in your hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko took a step forward.  To Yu\u2019s relief, she wasn\u2019t big enough to cause earthquakes with a single step.  However, her footfall was still the equivalent of a sledgehammer striking the pavement of the shrine.  Her sandal left a noticeable indent on the concrete ground.  He gave this careful thought as he led Yukiko to the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let\u2019s see\u2026 according to the Square-Cube law, she must weigh at least eight metric tons by now.  We\u2019ll have to be careful.  I don\u2019t think many manmade structures can support her weight\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to prove this point, Yukiko\u2019s hips inadvertently swayed into the wall of the shrine, knocking a hole into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYukiko!  Be careful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmygosh!  I\u2019m sorry!\u201d  In her haste to distance herself from the shrine, Yukiko backed into a nearby tree only reaching up to her waist.  The tree was knocked over and fell towards Yu, who barely dodged it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the commotion, the fox poked its head out from underneath the shrine.  It considered Yukiko briefly, and then thought better of getting involved and retreated back out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYu-kun!  I\u2019m so sorry!  Here, let me help\u2026\u201d Yukiko bent down to pick Yu up.  An image of an old American cartoon entered, unbidden, into Yu\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And I\u2019ll hug him, and squeeze him, and name him George!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!  I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m fine,\u201d Yu quickly arose, shoving Yukiko\u2019s gigantic hands away before she could inadvertently pulverize his bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019re hurt\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorry about me later.  For now, you need to get to safety.\u201d  Yu looked towards the shrine entrance.  Fortunately, this was a slow day at the shopping district, and the commotion had only captured the attention of an old man that had just left Konishi Liquors.  He took a long, hard look at Yukiko, took out his newly bought bottle of sake, poured the whole thing onto the ground, and calmly walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow might be good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Yukiko and Yu made their way to the forest clearing behind the shrine.  To Yukiko\u2019s credit, now that she had gotten over the shock of the situation, she was putting the grace she learned playing a hostess at her family\u2019s inn to use, and was only causing moderate collateral damage.  Reaching a place where she could sit down, she did so.  This actually did cause a slight tremor, making Yu wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Yu said once he recovered.  \u201cI think our next step should be to call the rest of the team, or at least Chie.  Is that okay with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 just Chie for now, please.  This is embarrassing\u2026\u201d Yukiko said, curling up to make herself as small as she could.  Given her size, this was a futile endeavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.  She can help us figure out where to go from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYu\u2026 thank you,\u201d Yukiko peeked out from the fetal position she was in to look down at her friend and smile, a slight blush coming to her cheeks.  \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done if you weren\u2019t here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Yukiko,\u201d Yu said with an easy smile.  \u201cThis is what friends do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFriends\u2026 right\u2026\u201d Yukiko said, softly enough that if her voice weren\u2019t amplified Yu wouldn\u2019t have heard.  As Yu brought out his phone to call Chie, he felt a familiar tingle in the back of his head.  The Priestess social link he had with Yukiko just reached level eight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYu-kun\u2026 that reporter I kicked\u2026 do you think he\u2019s alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine,\u201d Yu replied absently as he dialed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reporter was not, in fact, fine.  After Yukiko kicked him, he hit an antenna on top of Tatsumi\u2019s Textiles in such a way that he was killed on impact, his body left dangling from it haphazardly.  The first to spot it was Kanji Tatsumi, who came out to investigate the noise.  Ordinarily, someone happening upon this sight would panic and then call the authorities.  However, Kanji was having an unusual year, and thus reacted to this sight in an unusual way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod damn it.  Not again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, Kasai, having run here all the way from the shrine, stopped to catch her breath.  She looked up, saw the body, screamed, and started running again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the clearing...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
