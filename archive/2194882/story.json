The green shapeshifter and the robotic man entering the 3rd race after they each secured a win. The winner of this next race would reign supreme as the racing game champion, while the loser would know only the salty taste of defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, with Cyborg having just taken the lead after rounding their third lap, the screen suddenly became fuzzy and blacked out for a moment. Falling silent for a moment, Beast Boy and Cyborg exchanged a look of mutual confusion. Then a familiar figure appeared on the screen, a not so dastardly villain they've crossed paths with before, Control Freak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Titans, and welcome to my TV Special episode of...wait? Where are the rest of you?\" He asked, confused as to why all five members of the Teen Titans wouldn't gather in front of the TV on a Saturday afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter, the two of us are more than capable of taking you down dude.\" Beast Boy said, eager to defeat Control Freak so that they could get back to their race and declare a winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what he said! Just suck us into whatever lame TV show you want, and we'll beat you down!\" Cyborg declared, arming his Sonic Cannon for the brawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not today, losers! You see, I'm not bringing you into my world, I'm bringing my world to you!\" Control Freak announced, pulling out a crudely designed gameshow wheel with dozens of frequently used TV parody episodes. Clash of the planets(Teen Titan's version of Star Wars), that creepy scene from that one horror movie, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Titans, come on down!\" he yelled, giving the wheel a good spin. Meanwhile, Cyborg and Beast Boy stood silent. What else could they do beside's attack their TV? Forced to watch in anticipation to see what fate had in store for them, as the wheel began to slow down, beeping as it hit each section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! .Beep! .Beep! ...Beep! ....Beep! ......Beep! .........Beep! ..............BEEP!*- The wheel finally stopped, landing on the selection labeled  \"Shrinking Episode.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later, Tiny Titans!\" Control Freak yelled victoriously, before vanishing, a stream of black electricity shooting out from the TV and hitting Cyborg and Beast Boy, shrinking them down to the size of tiny ants in seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken pair landed on the same seat cushion of their giant couch with a bounce, Cyborg quickly sitting up while Beast Boy adapted to his new size much slower, laying on his back and rubbing his forehead. \"Oh no, now this is not cool man, WE'RE PUNY!\" Cyborg yelled, realizing they couldn't have been more than a centimeter tall(Beast Boy being slightly smaller, of course).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, dude. You don't have to yell! I'm right here.\" Beast Boy groaned, handling their situation better than his friend was, perhaps a product of his power, he'd shrunk himself to the size of a bug on numerous occasions, but this time there was no easy way of going back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I can see you. You know who can't, literally everyone else in the world. We're practically ants!\" Cyborg panicked while assessing their new size with shocking accuracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, dude.\" Beast Boy paused, suddenly noticing something that caused his green complexion to turn a little paler and ghost-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyborg noticed the look of despair displayed clearly on his friend's face, perceiving a sudden absence of light as a towering figure walked between them and the window. The tiny bionic man turning to see what Beast Boy was looking at with such a dreadful expression only too see two thick grey towers stretching high and low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking higher up, Cyborg and Beast Boy got an eyeful of what appeared to be a gigantic butt, barely contained by a skin-tight black leotard. \"Raven!!\" The tiny duo exclaimed almost simultaneously, realizing she must have walked in moments after they'd shrunk, meaning that she was clueless of their current predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd already swept he cape aside, revealing the full majesty of her half-demon, half-human curves. Already in the process of sitting down, she threw her butt back towards the couch, eclipsing all perceived light from reaching the shrunken duo. Both of them panicked, unable to say a single word in response to this turn of events, running in opposite directions from one another as their teammate's booty fell from the sky in slow motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach looked over their shoulder before the moment of impact, seeing Raven's leotard-clad butt hanging inches over their best friend, ready too squash them flat. Then inevitably time sped up, their eyes widening as Raven's butt accelerated to close the distance between her and the couch in the blink of an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THUMP* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven's rear cheeks swallowed Beast Boy and Cyborg in one solitary motion, hiding their existence from the world without anyone's knowledge, not even her own. Meanwhile, for Raven, the whole process was a much more mundane experience. Raven simply dropped her full weight on top of the cushion, unaware of the extra padding that was currently squirming around under her buttocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy and Cyborg survived the initial impact while only suffering minor injuries, becoming so small had increased their bodies density, making them more difficult to crush like bugs. However, that didn't stop Raven's butt from trying to fill every available crevice while she leaned back, pulling out a book from her underarm to do some light reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.Cyborg and Beast Boy give up trying to fight Raven's giant asscheeks, deciding to bite her to get her attention at nearly the same time, most likely ending up on her bad side in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Raven gets up nearly 20 minutes later, seeking a more silent location to read after Robin and Starfire walk in having their own conversation, possibly with a guest such as Bumblebee or Terra. Taking Beast Boy and Cyborg for a ride on her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Starfire flies into the room and attempts to show interest in what Raven is doing, sitting next to her after Raven scoots over to invite Starfire to sit next to her. Moving off one of her ant sized teammates in the process.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I promise this is going to be fun, now lean in closer.\" Alex smirked, waiting for the right moment to strike as the two girls brought their faces closer to her. Whipping out the bottle from behind her back and spraying Clover and Sam both directly in the face, causing them to become woozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, what did you do that for\u203d\" Sam yelled in protest, not familiar with the sensation currently overtaking her body. Clover, however, felt an odd sense of deja vu that she'd experienced twice before. Hoping that she was wrong, Clover forced her eyes open to see that Alex had nearly tripled in size. The two girls continued to shrink even further, while the black haired Afro-Hispanic Alex became larger by comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, Sam!\" Clover yelled, alarmed by how fast Alex was growing right in front of her, getting to a point where every couple of inches lost made her friend and roommate appear two or three times taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it now, Clover?\" Sam asked, annoyed, still oblivious to the shrinking process, finally opening her eyes to see Alex's building-sized soles towering over her. \"What the heck is going on here\u203d\" she asked in a panic, turning to her left to see that Clover was in the same boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious, I shrunk you guys using this new Whoop perfume. It's usually harmless. But when sprayed directly into the mouth, nose, or eyes, it causes people to shrink.\" Alex smiled, rolling her ankles in order to get a better look at Clover and Sam in front of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! So why did you shrink us? Shouldn't this be the type of thing we use on Mandy or someone who deserves to be tiny?\" Clover responded, crossing her arms and pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, we're the size of bugs! We can't be more than an inch tall!\" Sam declared, forming a rough estimate by examining Alex's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a bad idea Clover, of course, I had to test it first. And Sam is right. I didn't think you'd become this small honestly, but you should still be able to serve your purpose now that I've shrunk you.\" Alex said, asserting herself as she picked her feet up over the two tiny girls, bringing them down on the carpeted floor so that her toes were facing upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover felt the shockwave from Alex's feet, managing to stand her ground despite a pair of wobbly legs. On the contrary, Sam immediately fell onto her ass from the impact, having never been shrunk before now. Noting that the carpet strands were now so tall, they reached the top of her stomach while seated. While only reaching the standing Clover's knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you girls to paint my toes for me,\" Alex said, picking up two small glass bottles of yellow nail polish and placing them between her feet for use, each container over double their height. Alex then unscrewed the caps and pointed at her toes while sticking her tongue out, telling her new slaves that they should get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paint them yourself! I'm not going anywhere near your smelly feet.\" Clover objected, turning away from Alex in defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're not?\" Alex asked, a dark shadow appearing over Clover's tiny body moments later. The shrunken blonde turning around to see Alex's foot moving towards her, she tried to run and let out a scream, but it was too late. Alex pinned Clover underneath the ball of her foot, leaving her head free underneath her wiggling toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Clover? I didn't think you were going to touch my <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>smelly feet</b></font>.\" Alex laughed, pushing her foot down hard for a moment at the conclusion of her sentence. \"You might wanna rethink your answer now.\" Alex teased, scrunching her toes several times around Clover's head as a scare tactic, still only playing around. Though for Clover the terror was quite real, Alex could pop her like a grape if she wanted to and she knew that. Her acting so convincing that Clover bought it outright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Alex! Let me go, I'll do anything, I'll paint your toes!\" Clover yelled, struggling under the weight of Alex's foot. The brown-skinned girl pulling her foot back and placed it back into position. \"Good, I'm glad we understand each other. Now get to work!\" Alex demanded with a smile, enjoying herself thoroughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a minute later, Clover and Sam were struggling to lift their individual brushes, each twice their size and weighing close to 30 pounds a piece. Still, they both acted carefully when approaching Alex's toes, not wanting to risk making a mistake and face a similar punishment to what Clover just endured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover started at Alex's big toe, which was about as tall as she was, coating the surface nice and evenly. While Sam started at Alex's pinky and worked her way back, that way, she would have to travel less distance between each toe and the bottle of polish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach girl provided what Alex would consider satisfactory services given their short stature. \"That's it, girls. Put your backs into it.\" Alex cheered joyfully, resisting the urge to wiggle her toes in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it look like we're doing?\" Sam asked rhetorically to Clover, being careful not to speak up loud enough that Alex would hear them chatting. Sam had finished three of the toes on Alex's left foot starting from the pinkie, while Clover had finished two starting from the big toe. Both about halfway done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed off in opposite directions, carrying their brushes over their shoulders in a hobo like fashion. Small drops of paint dripping on the carpet, not enough to be seen by a normal-sized person. But more than enough to turn clover's new shoes completely yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I get back to normal-size I am so shrinking her down to pay for this,\" Clover mumbled to herself, hoping Alex would restore their size once they finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, Clover?\" Alex asked out loud, able to see Clover's lips move at a distance, leaning in closer to hear her response. A shiver ran down the tiny blonde's spine, swallowing her spit as she came up with a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, nothing at all. Don't worry about it.\" Clover said, speeding up so Alex wouldn't interrupt her again. Her adrenaline spike allowed her to finish up her work in a matter of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, Clover. now let me inspect your work.\" Alex smiled, inching her foot towards Clover rather than bringing it towards herself. Maneuvering her toes to grab the tiny blonde between her big and second toes before lifting her into the air. She grabbed her foot, examining Clover's craftsmanship, the giantess's gaze switching from toe to toe without even focusing on Clover. She was merely there for decoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent job, I knew you wouldn't let me down. Now onto Sam.\" Alex announced, switching her gaze to view her left foot. All her toes were painted perfectly as far as she could tell, but Sam was running away from her. Likely trying to escape after seeing her scoop of clover in her toe cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast little girl. I still have to inspect your work.\" Alex teased, lifting her foot up into the air and giving Sam a taste of what Clover had experienced earlier. Traping the puny redhead under the ball of her sweaty foot, grinding her down into the carpet until she was stuck to her sole by sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha, now let's take a closer look here,\" Alex said, pleased with the results as she lined up all ten of her toes. Each painted beautifully by her tiny roommates, blowing a gentle breeze of air over her toes. Clover catching a whiff of her minty breath washing over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls did a great job. So good I think I'll just have to keep you this tiny for a while in case I need anything else done for me, but first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Alex feels like going out for a jog but doesn't want to leave Sam and Clover behind, deciding to take them with her by taping them into her sports bra, so they don't accidentally fall out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Alex wants to watch a movie, picking up Sam and Clover and carrying them towards the couch. She tells them to stay put on a seat cushion and returns a few minutes later with a bowl of fresh popcorn. However, when she discovers them on a different seat cushion trying to run away, she decides that they must have wanted her to sit on them during the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Alex puts her socks on over the girls, trapping them inside with her feet before going to put on her sneakers so she can go to the mall. Planning to do a bit of shoping with them keeping her company.<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"></span></span></div></div>",

She was waiting for Timmy to come home from school so she decided to help clean up a little. She had put some of his toys in the toy box, sweep up the floor, ect, when she went to check under the bed she found a pink locked box. She had never seen this box so she pulled it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the top it read \"Timmy's secrets, don't touch\". Wanda thought about it but decided not to open it, after all it wasn't her business to do such. She just put it back and decided to clean the inside of her fish castle. While cleaning several rooms of the nearly infinite building she couldn't help but to think of that mysterious pink box's tempted by its contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she couldn't take it anymore and poofed back into Timmy's room and pulled out the secret box. Wanda look into the key hole thinking how she will get in. She then had a thought, what time did Timmy get home. She checked the clock and it read 2:59 pm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused her to go into a panic, Timmy could be home any moment. What would he think what would he say. But then she remembered Mr crocker had given him detention most likely to try and catch her and Cosmo (hence why she was not with him, he decided it was to risky). After calming down she continued to try and pick the lock with her magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moment it gives and opens up, inside was a few photos the three of them had taken and a long list. \"What in the world is this\" Wanda said while picking the white paper up and proceeding to read it. It was a list of wishes all of which was terrible ideas such as shark jumping, getting a magic dog, x-ray vision, scuba diving in lava, running for president of a alien world, bringing a friend's deceased pet back to life, wishing he was never born, wanting six extra hands, the ability to stop time, being able to phases thru wall, the ability to disappear, the ability to fly, having a crime fighting agents run by animals, controlling fire with his mind, stopping everyone from ageing wanting to be a baby and go on adventures as said baby, wanting real life to be like a ultra gritty and violent comic to be, a world with no adults, a world where only guys could live in, a world where only girls could live in, that he was the last boy in existence, amongst a wide and expansive verity of wishes that either was just stupid in any sense of regard or so dangerous that the world would have been eradicate over so often that Wanda would have legitimately would have run out of words to describe the pure insanity of what would transpire. Wanda was in shock and that Timmy could right up a list not only this expansive but this bizarre, and she unfortunately knew that any wish even written down had to be granted, so she skimmed the list and landed on the one she felt was the most safe and fun which was............</span></div></div>",

He just needed to make sure Black Canary didn't see him sneaking into the downstairs storage vault, avoiding security camera with a little help from his super speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, he started looking through the box labeled \"Dr. Ray Palmer\" for anything that might help him get a little closer to M'gann so he could try to find out what his crush was into. Coming across a compact looking ray gun inside of a metal container, most likely some kind of shrink ray, proof that shrinking was no longer science fiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I should probably test this first. Make sure it's safe.\" Wally told himself, spotting a box in the corner left behind by Batman himself. But it was covered in dust and had appeared to be completely forgotten, making it a perfect candidate for a little target practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWally cleared away a few other boxes to give him a clear line of sight before zipping across the room, oddly enough the gun didn't have any specific settings. Only a nozzle and a trigger, leading Wally to believe that a second zap would undo the first if he was right about this being a shrink ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe aimed down the box and fired within seconds *ZAP*, the package seemingly disintegrated in the blink of an eye. But upon getting closer Wally could see that it was perfectly intact, just much smaller. \"It worked, it really worked!\" Wally said excited, ready to move onto human trials, turning the device onto himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, nothing to it Wally. Just gonna close your eyes and when you open them again your gonna be tiny. Ready, 3,2,1...go!\" *ZAP*, Wally felt an odd tingle that lasted no longer than an instant, opening his eyes to see that the entire room had grown over 50 times bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>BOOM!!!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWally dove for cover as a loud noise suddenly spooked him from behind, turning around to see Dr.Palmer's shrink ray laying on the floor in front of him. The whole structure was 3 times the size of M'gann's bioship, reminding Wally of his purpose for shrinking himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gun appeared to still be in one piece, putting Wally's mind at ease that he could still return to his normal size before making his way back upstairs. Which for anyone else would have been a challenge, but Wally's speed allowed him to build up enough momentum to run up the stairs at both horizontal and vertical angles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne at the top of the stairs Wally slide underneath the door to make sure the ghost was clear before entering the main part of the cave. <b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!</font></b> A series of consecutive earthquakes caused Wally to fall back until he peaked out from underneath the door to locate its source. It was the sound of Black Canary's footsteps as she made her rounds, checking in on the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at her Wally realized that Canary was much bigger than he had been counting on, thinking that Palmer's shrink-tech might have worked a little too well. She was as tall as a skyscraper, stomping around in her calf tall boots. Luckily she didn't notice him hiding under the door, he could hardly last in a one on one fight against her at his normal size, doubting he'd last much longer while he was the size of a fly. Breathing a sigh of relief as she walked off in the direction opposite M'gann's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">BOOM</font>, <font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">BOOM</font>, <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">BOOM</font>, <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">BOOM</font>, <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">BOOM</font>!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of her powerful footsteps faded and Wally continued running towards his intended destination, being extra cautious to run closer to the walls to minimize his risk of being stepped on in case he encountered anyone else walking around the cave. M'gann's room was just around the corner and Wally was almost there when suddenly...<b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!</font></b> Wally felt a familiar sensation of someone walking nearby, the only question was who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. M'Gann, Wally is close enough to her room to feel her pacing feet in her room through the wall. Proceeding to make his way around the corner and inside to spy on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Artemis, Wally is seen by and then captured by Artemis who quickly puts two and two together about how Wally became so tiny, and why he would shrink himself. Deciding to punish him herself for behaving so inappropriately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Zatanna, Wally suddenly hears Zatanna's voices speaking a spell to capture Wally with her magic. Using this opportunity to prove to the skeptic Wally that magic is real.</span></div></div>",

Wally grimaced at the sight of her: he could hardly imagine a worse person to find him than Artemis. Panicking, he began to make a mad dash for the door, though his superspeed was less effective at his reduced size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Wally, this was a critical mistake. Artemis was an archer, and her trained sharpshooter eyes were constantly looking for the tiniest bit of movement. Her eyes quickly locked on to the sprinting tiny, though she hardly believed what she was seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wally? Is that you?\" Artemis asked skeptically, effortlessly plucking the shrunken hero off the floor off the hallway. \"What are you doing here? And why are you so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWally panicked under the gaze of Artemis's giant brown eyes. \"Uh, nothing really Artemis... I was just experimenting with some of Ray Palmer's tech... thought it might be useful for... stealth missions?\" Wally stammered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stealth missions huh?\" Artemis asked skeptically, trying to figure out what was really going on. It wasn't like Wally to prepare for missions in his downtime.  \"Wait a second, you're right outside M'gann's room! I'm guessing you decided that shrinking yourself would be a good way to peep at your teammate huh?\" Artemis asked, scowling at the tiny redhead in her hand. \"I think someone is going to have to teach you a lesson.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWally was pulled down into her fist before he could object, enveloped in the darkness of Artemis's hand. Even with some super speed vibrations, he was completely powerless against the giant fingers. He couldn't see a thing but based on the booming sound of Artemis's footsteps, he could tell she was heading somewhere with him. When she finally moved her thumb and allowed his head to pop free of her hand, he was in Artemis's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Wally? What do you have to say for yourself?\" Artemis growled, watching the tiny man attempt to squirm out of her fist. \"Do you think it's ok to sneak around spying on teammates?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWally let his anger get the best of him. \"What do you care Artemis? It's not like I was going anywhere near your room!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is that right Wally? I shouldn't mind you perving on M'gann just because you weren't trying to sneak a peek at me? Well, then I think I know exactly what to do with you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Artemis decides to punish Wally herself, by sticking him between her butt cheeks before heading off to patrol Star City on her motorcycle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Artemis decides to show Wally to M'gann, lying and saying he was shrunken as a punishment for breaking protocol on the last mission. M'gann will think he is adorable and also feel sympathetic, but Artemis will insist that his tiny size should not stop them from doing planned training exercises, during which M'gann will surely squish Wally a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Artemis decides to recruit Zatanna to help punish him with her magic. (Reserved)</span></div></div>",

That way you never try anything like this ever again.\" Artemis announced, holding Wally at a perfect level with her ample breasts. The arrow design displayed on her costume pointing towards her looming billboard-sized face from her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Artemis! You had me scared there for a moment.\" Wally replied, breathing a sigh of relief before he noticed how cold Artemis's eyes were as they looked down at his tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I'm gonna ask Miss Martian to help me out with your punishment. That way, I know you'll never even think about doing something this stupid a second time.\" Artemis announced, the belittling tone of her voice sending shivers down the tiny speedster's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Artemis, you can't believe that M'gann would be okay with all of this!\" Wally testified, unable to believe that the kind-hearted Martian would be capable of punishing him in such a vulnerable state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She will if I told her Black Canary suggested it, all you have to do is lie to her face and endure it. Otherwise, you'll be spending a long week inside one of my boots, and not the ones I use for school.\" Artemis proposed, giving Wally incentive to obey her demands, swallowing his spit at the very prospect of spending that much one on one time with the blonde's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Artemis, I can't...Whoa!\" Wally started before Artemis tightened her grip, rolling Wally into the center of her fist, using minimal effort to silence his objections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No arguments? Perfect.\" Artemis shrugged with a smile, standing up and walking back towards M'gann's room down the hall. During that time, she came up with a few ideas that she could use to trick M'gann into helping her punish Wally, picking an ideal method that satisfied all her needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey M'gann, do you have a moment?\" Artemis asked, walking through the Martian's open doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Artemis, of course, what's up?\" replied M'gann, eagerly standing up and taking fast-paced steps towards the blonde archer. She could sense that something was out of the ordinary, but neglected the use of her psychic abilities to read her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's Wally. Black Canary had to punish him for breaking protocol during our last three missions.\" Artemis started explaining, loosening her grip as she prepared to present Wally. \"So she did this to him.\"  Artemis continued, moving her hand between them and opening her fist into a flat plane, keeping Wally at level with their belly buttons(if Martian's even have belly buttons).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nM'gann's eyes opened wide at the sight of an inch tall person, leaning in closer to examine him. Her green face dominated his entire field of vision, smiling down at him. Fantastic, he finally had the alien's full attention, the only drawback was that he was the size of a bug compared to her. \"Black Canary did this? How?\" M'gann asked, not taking her eyes off the shrunken speedster for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She used Ray Palmer's Shrinktech to make him this small, putting me in charge of him until the week is up,\" Artemis explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aren't you lucky?\" M'gann thought out loud, saying it towards Wally while believing Artemis to be the lucky one. \"I hope he learns his lesson.\" She continued, standing upright and turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Artemis paused, taking the opportunity to flash Wally a sinister grin while M'gann wasn't watching, ready to put her plan into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there was one other thing,\" Artemis announced, recapturing M'gann's attention. \"You see, we were supposed to work on team-building exercises today and Black Canary told me that Wally's small size should excuse him from participating.  Conner, Robin, Aqualad, and Zatanna were already paired up. That leaves me, you and Wally.\" Artemis explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Team building?\" M'gann asked puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's an Earth thing, co-workers or teammates complete a series of tasks together to strengthen trust and improve communication.\" Artemis continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like it could be a lot of fun.\" M'gann smiled, still not fully understanding what type of activities she was expected to perform. Luckily, Artemis was there to help her fill in the blanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it could be, one more thing I forgot to tell you, Palmer's Shrinktech didn't just make Wally smaller,\" Artemis said, pausing for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? What else could it have done? He still looks like the same Wally, only smaller.\" M'gann pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, his body structure's been condensed to a single point, meaning his body has become much denser than an average human's, keeping Wally safe from harm, as long as we don't step on him accidentally with our shoes on at least.\" Artemis continued, reminding Wally of this fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So basically in addition to being so small, he's also density shifting to become tougher? Kinda like Uncle J'onn.\" M'gann observed, although there were differences between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically yes, but we're wasting too much time. I just wanted you to be aware of that fact before we started so you weren't worried about hurting Wally accidentally during our first exercise.\" Artemis illustrated, walking towards M'gann's bed and placing Wally on its surface, holding him down with her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to demonstrate our first team-building task, and you'll understand what I mean,\" Artemis explained, standing at her full height over Wally and removing her thumb from his body, giving Wally the freedom to rise to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once he was standing up, Wally realized that Artemis was no longer focusing on him. The sight of her face replaced by her massive green leather-clad ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'gann, this is called a trust fall. It usually involves one person falling into another teammate's waiting arms. Believing that they'll be there to catch you, but since Wally is so tiny were going to use your bed to help cushion our falls.\" Artemis explained, revealing her master plan for punishing the miniaturized young hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go first. Watch me, so you know what to do when it's your turn.\" Artemis announced, leaning back as she began her demonstration. Wally turning to run as Artemis brought her ass closer to him. Unfortunately, Artemis had already adjusted for his speed, watching him from the corner of her eye to make sure he ended up exactly where she wanted him to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis quickly brought her butt down onto M'gann's bed, fully engulfing Wally beneath her costume-clad right buttcheek. \"You see M'gann? It's all about trusting that your teammate will be there catch you.\" Artemis emphasized, twisting her butt in a downward spiral on top of the tiny redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, Artemis. But, do you have to sit on him for so long?\" M'gann asked nervously, noticing the archer's reluctance to stand back up. Fortunately, Artemis was quick whited and came up with a response almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see the thing is, Black Canary told me that because of Wally's size, he might require a little extra time to complete tasks. While it's obvious that Wally is under my butt, he's only under one cheek, and he needs to lift both to pass.\" Artemis reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense, but are you sure he's okay down there?\" M'gann asked, sounding concerned for Wally's safety, watching as Artemis began to bounce up and down on top of her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm sure, it's not like I'm Wonder Woman or anything. Besides, shrunken or normal-sized, he's still Wally. I'm sure he's enjoying every minute of this.\" Artemis laughed. Meanwhile, Wally was struggling under Artemis's full weight, using a barrage of Speed Force charged punches to attack his teammate's backside. Though it had little effect on Artemis, she did find his efforts amusing and felt a slight tickle coming from her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had nearly exhausted her time limit, wanting Wally to save some of his energy for dealing with M'gann's hindquarters. Although, she couldn't deny herself one last effort to humiliate the tiny boy. Grabbing the edge of the Martian's bed, Artemis pulled herself down hard, The springs inside creaking under the pressure of her bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear to M'gann that Artemis was enjoying this exercise a little too much. But she still decided she would sit on Wally when her turn came, not wanting to disobey an order from Black Canary if the archer's giant butt would be waiting for her in the future. Also, M'gann had only been on Earth for close to two months. For all she knew, Wally really could enjoy being sat on at such a tiny size. She never could understand the interests of human boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she did think it was weird how she always caught him staring at her butt when he thought she was looking, this was also true for Black Canary and even Artemis. Convincing M'gann that maybe he did enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Wally continued to struggle beneath the blonde's butt, wanting nothing more than to be free of her crushing weight. Even if that meant he would be starting down M'gann's martian rear next, wondering if it would be a good idea to tell her the truth. Sure, Artemis threatened him with even more severe punishments, but maybe Miss Martian would still be willing to save him. Was it worth a try?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Artemis stood up, leaving Wally gasping for air in the imprint left behind by her ass. The whole room opened up before him, with Artemis standing over him like a human tower. M'gann walked towards her bed, ready for her turn to sit on Wally. What will he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Wally stays silent, M'gann takes her turn thinking that she's taking place in a team-building exercise, while Artemis watches happily. But, will she return him to normal as she promised afterward?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Wally speaks out and tells M'gann everything to avoid being smashed by another one of his teammate's rears. But will M'gann protect him from Artemis's wrath once she knows the truth? Or will Wally be spending some quality time with the blondes feet inside her boot?</span></div></div>",

Let's go pay her a visit.\" Artemis said, smiling sinisterly. Truth be told, she was somewhat reluctant to share the chance to punish the shrunken Wally, but if she was going to share with anyone, it would be Zatanna. And besides, Zatanna's magical abilities would offer plenty of unique ways to punish the shrunken speedster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Wally could object, he was once again trapped in the giant girl's fist, being carried towards the young mage who was only going to make his life worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Z, got a minute?\" Artemis asked, knocking on the door. She used the hand Wally was in to knock, giving him a booming headache from the loud rapping sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Artemis, what's up?\" Zatanna asked, smiling warmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got something to show you...\" Artemis began, before opening her fist and deciding to just let her quarry speak for itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that... Wally? How'd he get so small?\" Zatanna asked, leaning in to get a closer look at him. Wally couldn't help but be intimidated by the beautiful giantess and bed bright blue eyes, even though they were full of the kindness he knew his teammate for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this little creep trying to sneak into M'gann's room. Shrunk himself just so he could spy on her.\" Artemis explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wally! I thought you were better than that!\" Zatanna said, moving her gigantic face down closer to the shrunken boy. He watched the warmth disappear from her eyes as they turned from calm pools of blue to icy daggers. \"I hope you already know that Artemis and I are going to have to punish you. We can't have behavior like this spreading throughout the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry I told him. I was going to torture him myself but I thought some magic might spice things up.\" Artemis explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you have anything particular in mind you'd like me to do?\" Zatanna said, her mind racing with spells as she looked down at her pervy teammate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I was hoping you would have something in mind. Just be creative.\" Artemis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna paused for a moment, rubbing her chin as she tried to decide what to do. \"Hmmm... I think I have the perfect thing.\" Zatanna said, before leaning over and whispering in Artemis's ear. Wally craned his neck to hear her words, desperate to know what the giant girls were planning, but it was in vain. Not that he would have to wait long to find out though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God you're so bad.\" Artemis said with a smile. \"I knew we were friends for a reason. Definitely do that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWally gulped, knowing that if Artemis was surprised by Zatanna's plan, he was likely about to be in a world of hurt. He looked up at Zatanna expectantly, hoping for an explanation, but all he saw was her pointing a gloved hand towards him as her spell began:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ekam yllaw....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"SSimetra eot\" (Artemis's toe) Zatanna replaces Artemis's middle toe on her right foot with the upper half of Wally's body. His legs are gone, leaving him as a torso growing out of his teammate's foot, with his face facing the ground. What will being a toe be like when Artemis puts her boots on and heads out on patrol?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"Ym seitnap\" (My panties) Zatanna decides to make Wally stretchy, then stretch him out into a thong and wear him for the rest of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. \"Neve rellams\" (Even smaller) Zatanna shrinks Wally even smaller, leaving him barely a centimeter tall. Then Artemis brings him back to M'gann's room and flicks him towards the Martian girl now that he is far too small to be noticed. </span></div></div>",

And why does everything smell like feet?\" Wally asked, dazed from whatever magic Zatanna had done. Strangely, he felt like he was floating in mid air, as he seemed to be laying down despite there being nothing under his back. He looked down towards his legs, only to find they weren't there at all. He had his torso, but everything below his waist was gone. Instead, he was looking at Artemis's foot. On either side of him was one of Artemis's toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God Z this is so weird... You really made him my toe?\" Artemis said, flexing and wiggling Wally as she got used to her new digit. The upper half of his body had replaced the middle toe on her right foot, with his face on the underside. She had her foot up on her lap, sole pointing towards the ceiling, allowing her to look Wally in the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey cut it out Artemis! And this is insane! Change me back right now Zatanna, I am not a fucking toe!\" Wally yelled, futilely pushing his arms against where his waist met Artemis's foot, instinctively trying to pull himself free. But of course, there was nothing to pull free from. He wasn't just stuck to her foot, he was, for all intents and purposes, her actual toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that Wally? Are you asking me to do some magic? I thought you didn't believe in magic?\" Zatanna asked innocently, trying not to laugh at the pathetic red head attached to her best friend's foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine Zatanna, I believe in magic! There's no science that could instantly turn me into a toe! Just turn me back please!\" Wally begged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good to hear. I was not looking forward to listening to your BS science explanation of you became a toe. But either way, I'm not changing you back yet. You need to gain some respect for a woman's body, and I can't think of a better way for you to do that than being part of one. Even if it's not the part you're usually interested in...\" Zatanna said, laughing at the distressed look on Wally's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Artemis was still experimenting, twisting and flexing her toes and not heeding Wally's request to stop. He tried using his hands to hold Artemis's two adjacent toes as far away from him as possible, while choking out a scream: \"Turn me back right now you giant bitches!\" but Artemis quickly put an end to that by curling all of her toes at once. Wally's face was slammed into the underside of the blonde giantess's foot. He tried to yell, but all that did was get him a mouth full of Artemis's sweaty foot flesh. He retched as she moved her toe up and down along the edge of her foot, dragging his tongue across her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen closely Wally. You're my toe now. Toes don't tell their owners what to do. In fact, toes usually don't talk at all. So you'd better stop telling me what to do before I tell Zatanna I'd like you better without a mouth.\" Artemis said, and Wally could tell from the steely look in her eyes that she wasn't kidding. \"Now, like it or not, you're going to be my toe for a while. This is a punishment, and it's going to be rough. But when we decide you're ready, we will turn you back to normal. So the better behaved you are, the better this will go for you. Understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWally wanted nothing more than to scream at the giant Archer,but he dated not worsen his situation. Swallowing his pride, he choked out \"Yes Artemis...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Artemis said, satisfied with how the conversation had gone. No longer feeling the need to talk to Wally, she swung her foot down off her lap, letting her toes slap down against the floor carelessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWally was relieved that Zatanna's room was carpeted as his face slammed down into the floor. The feeling was completely unnatural. Without hips to control his torso, all he could do was move his arms and his head. He braced his arms against the ground as her toe came hammering down, not wanting to hit the ground too hard, but his tiny arms were no match for Artemis's toe muscles. His arms were easily forced aside, letting his face smack into the admittedly soft but surprisingly dusty carpet. He was an extension of her foot now, and if she wanted to stand on him, there was nothing he could do to stop it. Once her foot was still, Wally used his arms to push his face up off the carpet, allowing him to gasp in some less Dusty air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis was unimpressed by this effort. She lifted her toes up higher off the carpet, leaving Wally confusedly waving his arms above the carpet. He tried to look at her, hoping she had trodden on him without thinking, but he was quickly slammed back down into the carpet fibers. This time she pressed harder, and no amount of pushing could lift his face up. As if to emphasize this, Artemis rubbed his face into the carpet, stirring up dust and making him cough as his face was scratched by rug burn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how are you going to break the little guy in?\" Zatanna asked, her face still fixated on the tiny speedster trying to lift his face off her bedroom floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've actually got an idea for that already...\" Artemis replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's the plan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Artemis and Zatanna give each pedicures, with Zatanna filing and painting Wally as though he is any other toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Artemis decides to do some training in the team's gym, putting on her well worn uniform boots to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Before they could do anything, M'gann rushes in and tells them they have a mission. (She could possibly sense Wally's mind coming from Artemis's foot, or not, up to whoever picks this up)</span></div></div>",

She had been minding her own business in her room, watching reruns of her favorite show, Hello Megan!, when all of a sudden she felt a wave of nausea overcome her. She recognized the feeling immediately, but had no time to react before the world began to grow as she began to rapidly shrink down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! How did I catch M'iakma on Earth?\" M'gann moaned, knowing that this was going to be a very bad day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nM'iakma was something M'gann had not had to think about since her time on Mars. It's a Martian disease that has two main side effects. The first is that the afflicted finds themself shrunken to about an inch or two tall. The second is that they find themselves very susceptible to involuntary shapeshifting. A Martian with M'iakama cannot help but transform based on the thoughts of the people around them. If someone strongly desires an object and is thinking hard about it, the Martian will often spontaneously transform into that very thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs horrible as it may seem, M'iakama is actually only a mild nuisance on Mars, as Martians have a much easier time noticing sufferers than humans do. Martians have no problem sensing the presence of shrunken or shapeshifted individuals due to their telepathic nature, making the whole disease little more than an embarrassing inconvenience. However, things would be different on Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nM'gann was not sure what to do. She had to get someone's attention if she wanted help getting back to normal size. But going to anyone was exceedingly dangerous while suffering from M'iakma. When she was close enough to read someone else's thoughts, she'd also be susceptible to their whims. She'd have to get their attention before they desired something, or she'd spend the day transformed into whatever it was they needed. Fortunately, she could still fly, so she didn't have to worry about getting stepped on at her new size. But as she flew out into the Hall, she was faced with a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does M'gann go for help (and what does she turn into)? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The common area (where Artemis and Zatanna are watching a movie together, and M'gann becomes a green gummy bear in the bowl of candy between them)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Artemis's Room (where she becomes a replacement for one of Artemis's missing combat boots, with her face on the insole of the shoe)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Zatanna's Room (where she suddenly becomes a lacy white bra for the magician)</span></div></div>",

Plus while she's too polite to admit it out loud, Artemis is kind of a bitch an she'd prefer to not be around her this small and vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer decision made M'gann flew down the corridor and phased through Zatanna's door, still not quite having learnt the social etiquette of humans, like knocking and waiting, or not just barging into the room, however even if she did, M'gann probably would have done it anyway this time, as it was unlikely Zatanna would have noticed even if she'd been screaming at her through the door while slamming her true form at it at full strength. What she saw on the other side of the door was a lot of pale skin, as the magician was currently shimmying into a pair of lacy white panties, Mgann taking a moment to appreciate her teammate before continuing on regardless of the mostly naked state of being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zatanna, it's me M'gann, I shrunk please help\" she yells as she flies over, when she's hit with another wave of nausea followed by dizziness 'Oh fudgecake' she thinks before she drops like a stone on Zatanna's bed, it seems she'd gotten too close and become victim to her friend's desires before she even knew she was there. Like most inanimate transformations M'gann wasn't able to move her body, which was probably why it felt so strange when Zatanna picked her up, bringing her to eye level<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad I remember this, I was in such a rush to pack I was sure I'd left it back home. Luckily I have the most comfortable and supportive garb for this job\" she chuckles to herself, then lowers M'gann again, at which point the martian knew what she was, just before being shown her current purpose: she was a bra, a nice lacy white bra, which matches the panties she saw Zatanna put on earlier, and she was now in a position Wally would kill to be in, wrapped around Zatanna's big perky bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nM'gann was bi, most martian's were given they were total shapeshifters, the outside didn't matter as much as the inside and martians were just as capable of being mothers as fathers, though she still preferred herself to be female, all martians leaned one way or the other. This matters only because until she was literally cupping the younger Zatara's breasts in her not hands did she consider human females as something other than cute, something to model her human form after, or to make the boys blush gender bending their forms. Now she was the one blushing because she agreed with Wally for once, Z was a 10. She was also a DD, a size M'gann considered having for herself before settling for her smaller chest to better match Megan.Also while she could feel everything her curret form touched it appeared she was limited in her other senses to the small bow in the front of the bra, meaning she was gazing into or out from Zatanna's cleavage, not helping her current mixed feelings, What could and couldn't be seen was soon made erelevant when Zatanna put on her shirt and jacket as well as proper pants and shoes, not that M'gann expected her to walk around in a bra, there were 4 guys on the team after all, still it makes getting her attention a little harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Artemis comes knocking, they have a mission and she can't find Mgann anywhere so they'll have to leave without her. It seems the Bioship can at least detect M'gann even if it can't tell them she's being worn by the mage, as it defers to Zatanna as if she were M'gann when she approaches it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) She heads to the training area to work on her combat skills outside of her magic, and Mgann worries: while usually difficult to change back when shifted into something during M'iakma, a strong enough desire could override her current form, and while it might help her be discovered, even Zatanna would find it odd to be suddenly braless with a skimpy thong trapped in her cleavage, just because Wally is a horndog who Mgann often has to consciously block out to avoid either slapping him or hiding in the little martian's room and taking care of business<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Turning a corner Zatanna ends up the victim of one of Wally's prank/traps, covered head to toe in grape jelly. After laying into the by the end of it cowering speedster Z goes back into her room to change out of the sticky mess, maybe take a shower too. M'gann is removed but changes again before she has more than a moment to enjoy her regained freedom (Anything besides a bra)</span></div></div>",

The last thing he remembered was facing M'gann on the Reach ship, wondering how he could avoid hurting her or being hurt by her without revealing his plan with Nightwing. Then he saw her eyes glow their terrifying bright green color and everything went dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good. You're awake.\" Kaldur fell back to his knees as M'gann's voice boomed from behind him. As he turned to look behind, he saw the very unexpected sight of a gigantic Miss Martian. It seemed he had been shrunken, and was currently standing on a small table in an unfamiliar room. The table only came up to M'gann's knees, so he had to strain his neck just to see her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'gann! What's going on?\" Kaldur demanded, yelling up at the giant Martian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're so small I can't even hear what you're saying.\" M'gann teased, sneering at the shrunken traitor. \"I can guess though. I'm sure you're begging for mercy and reminding me of the way things used to be. Well too bad Aqualad. You killed Artemis, and that's a line you can't uncross. She was my best friend, so I'm going not going to make this easy on you. You're going to die eventually, but you're also going to suffer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAqualad began to panic as he realized M'gann still didn't know the truth. \"No M'gann, you don't understand! Artemis is still alive!\" Kaldur yelled, but his words fell on deaf ears. If only she would use her telepathy to contact him, he could tell her the truth. He just had to hope she did at some point before deciding to kill him entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does M'gann have planned?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. M'gann decides that Kaldur will stay between her ass cheeks until the Reach and the Light are defeated, starting now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. M'gann decided she is in the mood for sushi.
