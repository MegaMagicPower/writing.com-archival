You're walking down the side of the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the road!\" roars a voice from behind you. In an instant, three Knightmare Frames accelerate past, causing a huge draft that causes litter and papers to fly everywhere. But despite that, you hear a faint voice nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, and can just barely see a lock of green hair coming out from behind a set a trash cans. You push the cans aside, and find a girl in a loose white jumpsuit lying motionless on the ground. You take her in your arms, and check her pulse. You don't feel anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that, the girls eyes shoot open, and she leans up, kissing you on the lips. You phase out, and hear the girl's voice as she pries into your mind. You hear something about \"Geass\" and a contract, and mindlessly answer \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're back to reality. The girl is lying motionless in your arms. You set her on the ground so you can catch your breath, and catch up on what just happened. First off, who are you?</span></div></div>",

You use a sword and try to slash at him but he doges out of the way and you both start slashing at each other with your swords while flying upwards at high speeds. You pull a lever and two large blue wings shoot out from behind your back and you make them cover your Knightmare as Suzaku tries to smash through it but can't. You release them and they shoot lasers and shoot off his sword, you go and slice off both of his Knightmare's arms and legs, you grab him by his Knightmare's neck and get ready to stab him but he ejects himself from his Knightmare so you just rip the Knightmare in three pieces and throw them in separate directions. \"Sigh, all that hard work gone like that.\" Lloyd says snapping his fingers. You fly down and smash through the roof, grab the generator and fly off leaving them with no power. \"Sir, are you ok?\" asked a soldier noticing Lloyd's freaked out face. \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!\".</span></div></div>",

Plus Fate would call the cops on you the moment I leave her body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.C turns around you and stares down into yours eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave the body now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head at this you left Fate's body and it fell on C.C. You can't tell what C.C is doing but she put her hands on Fate and closed her eyes. After twenty or less minutes later you see C.C eyes open once more with fate waking up, you where about to possess Fate again till C.C put her hand in front of you. Fate turns around and look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my name is Fate Testarossa but you already knew that Alex and I am here to help serve you with my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised your eyebrows at her, you turned to look at C.C for an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just reworked her mind to always serve as your body when we are helping the boy. And do take of her as I took my time reworking her mind. Also I beat he pizza is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the doorbell ringing you saw Fate move towards the door paying for the pizza and place the pizza boxes in the kitchen table. You saw C.C got off the couch and grab 4 pizza boxes leaving behind only on pizza box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I order five becaus I was going to leave you am pizza box because you having been good so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhelp, I got pizza as my reward, activating your Geass you took control of Fate once more. Open your pizza box you took a bite out of the pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wounder what I should do next.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clean hands are your top priority in this situation, all that matters is escaping with not even the slightest blemish to your name, but cooperation and obstinacy both lead to the same end: a day of questioning with the Britannia soldiers. The only way to be rid of such an obstacle is to make an escape, but the Knightmares make for two spectacular reasons why this won't work right away. The only option available is to get them out of their machines, thus applying a wide berth and allowing one sharp turn to free you from their sights. While certainly top of the line war machines, the older models these three were piloting lacked some of the peacetime features of modern patrol Knightmares, such as the ability to sense an object smaller than a compact car (thus why they almost turned you into street pizza).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding your reservations and ulterior motives, you calmly and slowly raise your hands to shoulder level and dawn your best smile, one that can shine a brilliant white light through even Knightmare monitors, all while racking your brain for the right words and lies. Fortunately, the years of practice allow these to come with relative ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soldiers!\" you call. \"I'm all too happy to oblige my government and its military, but I'm also a bit of a skeptic. While I'd love to aid in any business concerning the empire, I'd prefer to know I'm actually performing an act for the sake of the country and eradicate my doubts, and it would be so helpful if the large rifles weren't being pointed at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right!\" a voice calls from the right-most Knightmare. The gruff voice and crude accent left little doubt in your mind this was either an Eleven from the ghettos or a Britannia who couldn't afford to live in the affluent parts of Area 11. \"You just want us to hand over a reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not even securing the girl, and prior to your outburst I had no clue you even wanted this girl alive, and that may be only a preference. I want nothing for myself, I just wish to know I'm doing the right thing. Please, redirect your weapon so we can talk about this like adults.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You son of a...\" the poor one calls again, evidently offended by something you said. However, this time the one in the middle moves its left arm upwards, defending you from both a rifle assault and another charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" a gentle soprano calls from the middle frame. \"I don't see the harm in discussing what we can. Lower your weapons, boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Cindy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No butts, Eleven. Lower your weapon or deal with mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two on the side do as \"Cindy\" commands, allowing you to rest easier now that you're not staring down their barrels. However, one concern about the Knightmares' design continues nagging at you, clearly plastering your worries over your face and wiping off the smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much, but there's one final problem. Since the one on my right seems to have a number of grievances with me, I feel it would be best if his hands weren't on the Knightmare's controls. Forgive me if this is out of line, but perhaps you could exit the frames and allow us to communicate face to face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's jerking us around!\" This time it's the one on the left getting hot under the collar, and you're not too surprised. \"All he wants to do is laugh at us and show him we're desperate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so,\" your savior replies, \"it's best for Britannia to foster a good relationship with the masses, and the first step to that is through the military's generosity and compassion. History has shown that torture and open hostility have only been useful for making enemies and grinding progress to a halt. He'll be more cooperative if we don't make him an enemy, and we can even ask her to restrain the girl first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cockpit of the middle frame opens wide, allowing a beautiful young Britannian to stand upright. Her golden locks cascaded down her shoulders and disappeared below her waist, the angle and frame of the Knightmare preventing you from establishing the length of Rapunzel's hair, but what you saw framed her heart shaped face perfectly and contrasted wonderfully against the slight tan. Her pink lips formed a welcoming smile, and the innocent glint in her brown eyes suggested she hasn't once pulled the trigger in a real combat situation. With the two frames bending to her will and the blue uniform hugging her curvy body tightly, it was almost as if the scene before you was a photoshoot for a print ad endorsing enlistment, and you knew it would win over just about every heart - men off their erotic fantasies and women off their dream of being dominant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My subordinates won't emerge until we know we're not losing the girl, so here.\" While calling out to you, Cindy was reaching into the pockets of her uniform and pulled out something that clanked with each movement she made. It wasn't until she threw did you realize they were two items, two sets of handcuffs. You already had a pretty good idea what she wanted, but she still continued, \"Cuff her hands behind her back and her feet together, then they'll step out of their Knightmares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you kneel down and begin the task assigned to you. While this would only serve to complicate things once you made a retreat and force you to carry her if it became necessary to take her with you, it at least promised you a chance at getting away. The most you could hope for at this point is that you don't need to help this person and that the dragging of your fingers is distorting your fingerprints beyond recognition if you give them the one smelling of pizza. And you certainly didn't want to learn this was some entrapment tactic or a variant of the Milgram experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least I got what I wanted, you think to yourself while witnessing the two pilots of the flanking frames exit concurrently. The three soldiers road down from their cockpits, happy to oblige but weary all the same. The young Eleven Cindy identified wore a scowl across his face, and made sure to clearly express the sour taste you left in his mouth, and for reasons beyond your politeness - your clothes and the affluence they radiated were almost certainly more fuel for the impoverished Eleven's fiery hatred. On the other hand, his partner, an older Eleven certainly on the verge of retirement from the service, showed less contempt for you and more towards her Britannian handler, almost as though he couldn't believe she's falling for this show of airs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your dismay, their cooperation didn't come as much as you had hoped and expected. They may have left their the cockpits and stepped on the pavement, but they're not even a centimeter from the elevator that reunites them with the controls, and those are in a terrific state of operation at present. Worse yet, they brought out their assault rifles with them. They're still lowered at the ground, but that's not inspiring much confidence. Turning the corner and escaping is certainly possible, though extremely risky and heavily reliant upon them hesitating of having poor aim, or would be if you didn't have the girl chained up like a common criminal. Her restraints would force her to take baby steps and allow her to be followed more easily than a tornado, and the time it would take you to pick her up and run would eat up all of your time to escape. Leaving her is certainly an option and would give you that time, but you're not in the mood for such a high stakes gamble. The only thing you can do is try to charm them into taking a few big steps away from the machines, or play to their animosity and make them turn on each other like starved and stranded explorers. Either way, you take a breath and focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" you begin, \"what has caused you three to come looking for this girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't explain it, but suddenly something felt different, like the air had gotten thinner or everything was merely an image on a computer monitor. Nothing felt real anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to your question, Cindy speaks out, \"The girl's wanted on suspicion of terrorist activity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that wasn't the only thing you heard, and the scene before you became more surreal. As Cindy was talking, it seemed almost like she had a second set of lips, a much lighter shade of pink, saying something completely different. It was almost like the dubbing of a movie from the Chinese Federation, but even those still had only one set of lips. Adding to the strangeness was something like a faint echo of her voice saying \"The little whore claimed to want some real lovers like us and not some pompous child like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the prior exchanges with Cindy and the images that border on hallucinations, the bizarre and classless words were enough to make you stagger and arch your eyebrows. You wanted to be enraged at the words and make Cindy suffer for even thinking them, but on the other hand you knew something was wrong and that they were armed Britannian soldiers. You simply had to maintain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like he even knows what to do with a girl!\" The voice came from the older Eleven on Cindy's right. Much like before, the scene was trippy to the eyes and a faint echo called out, \"There's no need for name-calling, Lieutenant Perry!\" However, this time it seemed different, the echo was softer and the second lips were less apparent, almost as though it was coming into focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He may sound like a baby, but he's certainly not one otherwise.\" Cindy's verbal lashing seemed totally in focus this time, nothing seemed even remotely unusual about the scene to your senses. However, it still made no sense to your mind, it was getting harder to think when these scathing insults, juvenile as they may be, made it impossible to focus your thoughts and approach this predicament armed with only your words at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU ASSHOLES!\" was the last coherent sentence you heard. What followed were grunts and groans mixed in with a hail of gunfire.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Almost instinctively, you rushed down to the pavement and out of the line of fire. Having witnessed the gun rising, you were able to duck down just in time to avoid any stray bullets from the young Eleven's rifle. On the other hand, the blind-sided blonde wasn't so lucky. Without any armor over her uniform, the flesh of her back consumed no less than a dozen bullets and spat out at least a liter of blood in several powerful gushes. Serving as more than enough proof of the weapon's power was the body, which quickly went from being almost a meter away to right on top of you and painting you the same color as the pavement Cindy traversed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified, you didn't dare move the cold frame of the soldier off of you to get a better look. Luckily what you heard was more than enough for you to piece it together yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drop the weapon, put your hands in the air, Takashi!\" You recognized this voice as the older Eleven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AS IF!\" And that was the younger one, Takashi. Once again, this was just before his gun burst into life aiming to take the older one's as compensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Takashi wasn't alone in his attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to hear, but you could faintly make out a quicker succession to the bullets this time, indicating the older one also pulled his trigger to stop Takashi. However, it was hard to be sure; the screaming booms of the guns didn't sound for nearly as long as the first stream that took Cindy. You tell yourself, \"Either the older one killed Takashi, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustering up some courage, you move Cindy's legs apart just enough to see past them and take a look. Takashi had made his way to the brick wall his Knightmare almost knocked down when he entered the alley and was steadily collapsing. At the same time, the older one was hunched over, clutching his stomach with his left hand, hoping to dam the rushing of blood rushing out to the cliff's edge. He attempted to make his way back to his Knightmare's cockpit, undoubtedly to signal for help, but his staggering legs barely carried him back to his position prior to his duel with Takashi before he too fell under gravity's merciless influence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" you ask aloud. It wasn't to anyone in particular, you just needed to center yourself, and quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Geass,\" a voice answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were bathed in sunlight once more once Cindy's body was picked off of you and haphazardly tossed aside. Above you was the green haired girl you...kissed? Was that real, or another of today's bizarre incidents? Regardless, the set of keys she dropped next two you answered how she was ambulatory after being restrained, and the new occupant of her hands answered why she needed to drop those keys. Without missing a beat, the rifle from your former meat shield was turned against the expiring Eleven with the shortest stream yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT FOR!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was a threat to me. Do I need any other reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preferably! He was already a dead man walking! ...So to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like such useless gambles when I have a safe certainty at arm's length.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to continue, but already figured out this was going to be like talking to a brick wall. Instead, you shrug it off and redirect the conversation onto a topic she started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" you begin, \"the Eleven was a threat to you even as he died. Now, what was that thing you said, a 'Geass' was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, The Power of Kings. A power that makes you above all other humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice little speech, but it's no good. I don't remember having any power, and I certainly don't remembering activating any power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl giggles at your flustered speech and face, apparently mocking you ignorance. \"It seems your desires led you to activate it subconsciously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll indulge her, you muse, believing it'll lead you to some truth anyway. \"Okay, so what is my Geass? How did it make these soldiers turn against themselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geass manifests itself in different ways for different people. For some reason, it became The Ability of False Perception in your case. Now you can make people see, hear, smell, taste, and feel what isn't actually there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...actually makes a bit of sense.\" It fits your experience at the very least. If your Geass activated, then the voices in pairs were both what was actually being said and what it became after your Geass altered it, and the second set of lips you noticed were the Geass making their lips move in tune with the new words. \"But why did it keep changing? It seemed like reality was more dominant at first, but then the illusion took control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lost your focus. Once you stopped protecting yourself, the Geass affected you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It fits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, you did lose your focus after you stopped talking; you weren't focusing on making them do something, you were focused on what she was saying. Hearing the distasteful speech from Cindy removed most of your focus, allowing the fake words from the older Eleven to take more control, and when they dropped what was left Cindy's true intentions didn't have even one thread to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if I stopped concentrating, why did the illusion continue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Geass is a spirited one. It doesn't stop until it completes the goal you instilled within it when it activates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore logical answers, you think to yourself. In this case, your last focus was to stir up animosity, hoping this would distract them enough for you to flee, but it seems the Geass didn't get that last part and just made them attack each other. In any case, it worked, you got them to attack each other in ways you can only imagine...meaning <i>she</i> is the only one who managed to make use of your distraction. How does the Geass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think, I'm actually buying this! The girl may have made one amazingly convincing story, but that's just it: a story! No such power exists outside of fantasy stories and mythology. Next she's going to try saying another Geass allows someone to move the sun along the sky as if it was pulled by a chariot. No matter how logical, the unreal can never even hope to be the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That answers that,\" you lie, putting up a front as you carefully close the gap between you and the strange lunatic. \"Now, let's talk about something more interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith swift movements, you're able to parry the gun to her left, forcing it and her right arm across her body. Now that her arms were immobile, a swift kick to her knee was all that was necessary to snake your way between them and locking them where they can't force you off of her. And the pain radiating across her face was a nice bonus, a compensation for what she's put you through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" you continue as though nothing happened, \"why were those soldiers after you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you hear Cindy's answer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, and it looked like she was being honest. But her superiors could have lied to her. I want to hear it from you. And try to tell the truth, or I go back on the assault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't kill me, I'm immortal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe you, but even if you are, you already showed me you can feel pain. I'll ask one last time: Why did those three soldiers come looking for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" she sighs. \"They were looking for me because...</span></div></div>",

Squeezing your eyelids tight, you heard the sound as the gun fired a burst of rounds at you, and then... nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a risk, you open your eyes and to your surprise you see several oversize bullets floating inches away from you.  The soldier in the knightmare seemed just as surprised as you as he had not moved since, instead just starting at the miraculous sight.  Taking a dare, you moved your hands towards the giant, floating bullets, trying to touch one.  Before your hand reached the object though, all the bullets shot out, racing towards the huge knightmare in front of you.  In an instant, the knightmare was taken down as a sudden hail of bullets blasted away at it.  You stood there in shock as the purplish knightmare fell down to the ground in a large crash.  What had just happen?  Did you just take down that knightmare by yourself?  Why did they want that girl?  Questions raced through your mind as you tried to figure out what exactly had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your thoughts were distracted as sounds of gunfire echoed from above you.

As you reached the top of the stairs, you see that the bridge consist of two railroad tracks running side by side over the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down the track, you see a red knightmare, strangely missing one arm, riding down the tracks with two more purplish knightmares, similar to the ones you saw earlier,  following closely behind, as if they were chasing the red one.  The purplish knightmares were quickly catching up to the one in front, and just when it seemed like they would reach it, a train came barreling down the track, hitting and slowing down the two knightmares as the red one quickly leaped over the train.  The train didn't stop the two knightmares for long, as one of the purple knightmares attempted to leap on the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, before the purple knightmare reached the ground, two slash harkens fire out from a nearby building and hit the knightmare, destroying it completely.  You couldn't see exactly what was in that building from your position, but the purple knightmare seemed to face whoever fired out the harkens only to receive a hail of bullets which crippled the knightmare's leg.  Before the knightmare had a chance to counterattack, however; the crimson colored knightmare charged out, forcing the knightmare to fire out what looked like a rocket.... no, an ejection pod, which flew out in to the air for a while until air chutes popped out and the pod softly floated to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the red knightmare, you saw that a couple of people came to meet the reddish knightmare.  Although it was hard to make out from your position, it looked to be a fairly large group of elevens and they seemed to be carrying... guns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole scene suddenly made sense now: the people in front of you are terrorist, elevens who oppose Britannia's rule over Japan.  Watching the terrorist from your hiding place at the stairs, you see them talking to someone over the radio, though you are too far away to listen to what they are saying.  Walking over to the sides of the train, one of the rebels open the container door and, to your amazement, reveals a vast collection of Knightmares stored in the train.  You had no idea where the elevens had managed to obtain such a large collection Knightmares but a chance has just opened up for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea wether or not you have seen the last of Britannian soldiers that are looking for you, but if you could sneak in try to steal one of the knightmares then you use it to escape, but there was always a chance that you would get caught and the rebels would not treat a Britannian like you too nicely.  Your second options could be to attempt to follow behind, and use the chaos of what looks to be an open up attack on the Britannian army by the rebels.  Either way sounded risky, but it seemed much better then trying to get out on your own.</span></div></div>",

I did because one of the resistance members is enrolled here.\", you lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why did you really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I had to figure out my limits of my Geass on a closed area. It seemed like the easiest place to do it.\", you kept your face in a seriouse state to make it seem to be legitimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch pondered your explanation and believed you to be telling the truth. In hindsight you made up the excuse to fool Lelouch but it was only a half truth as you needed to learn your limits on it and this place was an idea setting for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is the resistance member?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Q1, the one who helped me save you, with the red hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. So what is your power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know if I refuse you you'll use your Geass to tell you mine so I won't waste my breath, I can create Illusions in a persons mind. But only in their mind, so far I've been able to generate only one illusion to a group of several people.\", you answered. You purposefully left out you had managed to generate two set's of illusions instead of only one just to hold back that info in case you had to keep it from Lelouch for safety reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive, with that kind of power I can't lose against Britannia. I take it you'll join me in my goal's to annihilate it? After all we have the same goal do we not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do, that much is certain however working for your grand schemes might not be in my interests. And how do I know you won't have me choose the way YOU want me to go about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know, and I believe I know someone who can help you with understanding your Geass. So are you with me?\"</span></div></div>",

After a few hours you saw her having her lunch at the main yard with her class mates. You walked over casually like it was just a simple hello but the girls around Kallen took it as what others would expect. Ooooo's and giggling to clarify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Kallen, finally found you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen turned surprised and worried hoping you would be quiet about her name. She stood up and greeted you friendly like, \"Hi Aaron, listen can we talk later I'm not too comfortable talking about stuff we need to say in front of my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooooooooooooooo\", the women reacted to Kallen's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it, your busy. I'll find you later around where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh by the roof on the school building after class.\", she said. For some reason her manner of speaking was different when she talked to you yesterday. She was more shy, dull, and it felt more like she was tired the entire time. But perhaps it was a mask to keep her real personality secret from the school since she was to them a terrorist.</span></div></div>",

Clever tactic. So here your a girl who is sick all the time, but out there your really you. A determined fighter trying to resist Britannia. Quite an interesting life you lead, though some would say hazardous to say the least since Britannia is the worlds largest country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fight for Japan. Not for the entire world, that's impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is only a few things that are considered impossible, but defeating Britannia isn't among them. If we had the resources and a brilliant leader, we'd be able to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you that leader?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't the one on the radio, but I do know that if we do this right they will know what it means to suffer total defeat.\", you stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your an Eleven right? Why do you hate Britannia?\", Kallen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary, I don't hate it. In fact I owe one of it's royal families a debt. They spared me when one of the younger daughters found me trying to hide from the guards and so I was brought on as their...servants and friend to his majesty's daughters. But eventually I was discarded but was left a better life than in the ghettos. It wasn't easy, hell even as a servant I hated myself for doing things no one at my age should do. But I do this for a much different reason. Something you might be aiming for as well, but not so much comparable by scale.\", you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. So you want them out of they way just as much as we do?\", you nodded to answer her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two parted ways for the day glad you were able to talk to her more casually than before. But now you had to see another friend of yours, Lelouch. You arrived at the time and place as Lelouch said earlier but you thought you went insane when you saw C.C alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You left me in your Sutherland seat.\", she said blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? What is going-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C.C ran into the tunnel that lead out of the battlefield before it collapsed while you ran to save some expendable soldier from the front lines. That was not a smart move, leaving a valuable piece like that left open to the enemy.\", Lelouch said clarifying her sudden resurrection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you got shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can't die, trust me she can't. Also good work in telling me who that pilot was, now I have the information I needed from her after you two left each other alone.\", he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were spying on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to find out some way, it was the fastest way to do so. C.C why not run by what he needs to know.\", Lelouch said working on his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To put it simply, Lelouch plans to destroy Britannia and re-make it into a better one. He wants your power of Geass to help achieve those ends. His first step is to recruit the Japan resistance movement, than same people from before.\", C.C explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew some of that stuff, but how do we get them on our side?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy we need a symbol. And a Name for it. You will need ones for yourself, mine happens to already be planned out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, like we become hero's in their eyes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and no. But in your case since I need your power to help me win this, you must be at my side as well. You need a name...\"</span></div></div>",

You both waited in a train car waiting for the Japanese resistance to meet you in the front car and after a while they finally showed up. And they saw two strangers in cloaked costumes and masks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch's was a costume consisting of a tight dark purple suit with golden stripes and long, wrapped sleeves. The outfit combined with Victorian fashion with that of a sleek bodysuit, elegant but practical; worn over it is a black and gold cloak with crimson spandex inside and an enormous black cape encircling the head. Its immediately recognizable feature is a spiky black and indigo mask with a long variation of the Geass Sigil stretched over its bottom, completely hiding the wearer's face \u2014 appearing opaque from the outside, but transparent from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYours was a costume with similar features regarding the outfit underneath Lelouch's cloak however; yours was white with red stripes, and your cloak was more of a cape hanging off from your shoulders with red and white representing the colors of Japan. And the mask you wore was a metal plate that hide your mouth and nose but except for your eyes, which you kept covered by a transparent tarp with white outlines resembling upside-down triangles while having a grayish hood to have it hang over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://th02.deviantart.net/fs44/PRE/f/2009/082/5/e/mask_of_the_phantasm_teaser_by_prototype_EX.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://th02.deviantart.net/fs44/PRE/f/20...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So was that you the other day? You who ordered that cease fire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Lelouch turned and as you did the room went dark blue. \"So what did you think of our tour.\", Lelouch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see the difference, the settlement and the ghetto.\", you finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we know, there's a harsh difference between us and them that's why we resist them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are all wrong. Britannia will never lose to terrorism, a petty war that will lose before it's even begun.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you face is Britannia itself! With us it is a war that can be won! A war waged not on the innocent! Take up your swords and fight for justice!\", Lelouch replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you two to ay, how can we trust you both. Take off the masks and show us who you are.\", one of the resistance members happened to be Kallen and beside her was Ohgi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps if we gave you the impossible, then you'd have gained our trust?\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a plan and it involves saving Suzaku Kururugi and showing Britannia's weakness. Meet us by the dump at sunset, there the plan will be further explained. If any of you decide to help your free to come at your own will.\", Lelouch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you two?\", Ohgi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Zero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I am Saren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the train stopped at an empty stop by the tracks letting them off.

He wears the colors of Japan and is the avenger of Japan, for he is an Eleven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen and Ohgi were both surprised yet somewhat saw this possibility arise to fact hearing those words from Zero. \"But what about you?\", Kallen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zero's history is irrelevant. I suggest working on the vehicle now. We will return and ready at these co-ordinates.\", you said handing them a torn out part of a map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you left the two you arrived back in Lelouche's room in the academy. \"I wasn't expecting you to reveal my heritage like that so soon.\", you pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They might not have followed through if I didn't tell them. Besides it will keep their blind trust in at least you until we make ourselves credible regardless of these things.

You and Lelouch were standing on top of the fake car and readied to reveal yourselves to Britannia. Kallen was driving the car while Ohgi was positioned down by the bridge where you would intercept Suzaku's escort and make your escape. From the looks of things the time had come and the moment of truth came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flag of Britannia burned to a crisp revealing two masked figures on Prince Clovis' transport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Zero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I am Saren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowds gasped in awe of this crazy act seeing two terrorists commit such brazen audacity against a full military convoy. \"I've seen enough! this show is over.\", yelled Jeremiah Gotwald. He fired a shot signalling the convoy to drop his sutherland but you and Lelouch stood your ground. \"First things first Saren and Zero, remove your masks.\", he ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Lelouch pretended to comply but instead you snapped your fingers and the back of the car revealed the same weapon that supposedly held poison gas. Where in reality it held C.C. but Jeremiah had no idea what was inside so the trick worked flawlessly. Jeremiah in response pointed his gun at you both but Lelouch offered a deal before he fired his weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine what are your demands?!', he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An exchange, this for Kururugi.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell! He's charged of murdering the prince!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Jeremiah you are wrong. The one who killed Clovis was myself!\", Lelouch confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a single Eleven, you will save scores of Britannian citizens. I think we all find that a fair deal don't you think?\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are made I tell you! They will pay the price for mocking the crown!\", Jeremiah yelled pointing his gun at you both again along with enemy Sutherlands surrounding you holstering their weapons as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful...you wouldn't wan the public to learn of 'Orange' do you? If either of us die it will all go public.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you don't want it to happen, you'll do everything in your power to let us go, your prisoner as well.\", Lelouch commanded utilizing his Geass on Jeremiah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, you heard him! Release the prisoner now!\", Jeremiah said under the influence of Geass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reluctantly handed over Suzaku with you Zero and Kallen walking over with the detonator for the bomb in your hand. \"Thank you for your co-operation Jeremiah, until we meet again!\", you said activating the gas. The Britannian soldiers attacked as a result of the gas coming out of the device but Jeremiah, instinctively following the orders given to him, ordered them to stop attacking his comrades in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Kallen, Zero, and Suzaku jumped off the bridge with Ohgi launching the tarp to break your fall and thus make your escape. Your mission succeded but now all that was left was dealing with Suzaku.</span></div></div>",

While you were at school you felt rather happy there with everyone. Even though it was based on a lie that you were Britannian, you felt like you had real friends there. But the only real one you could really talk to was Kallen. You two knew who the other really was and related to a lot of what Britannia did to you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an average day for a while until the speakers had an unusual announcement, \"People of Ashford Academy: There is a cat running loose in the school and has something on it. As the President of the student council I want everyone to try and bring it to me. And whoever catches it will win a big prize! A kiss from a member the student council AHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's stupid. Nobody will- Where did everyone go? Ah jeez.\", you said seeing all of the students leave trying to find it. Then you got a call from Lelouch \"What the hell is going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to help me find that cat! My helmet is on it's head!\", Lelouch said hanging up. You disbelieved that something like a feline could expose the identity of Zero but you didn't waste much time in trying to find it. It would prove hard since the whole school was involved and with Zero's helmet on the cat's head it would be a miracle if no one saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around where most of the students weren't looking thinking maybe it was hiding away from all the commotion. To your surprise you heard a meow from up near the bell tower. You ran as fast as possible up to the tower and saw the cat starting to climb it's way up to the bells. You carefully scaled the bell tower and reached for the helmet. The cat was no consequence but the helmet was and with careful precision you snagged the helmet and grabbed on to part of the ceiling nearly falling off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the crowd of students surrounding the bell tower but from this height they couldn't see the helmet. You slowly descended back down to the window and hid the helmet safely where nobody would look. Better to leave it and pick it up later where nobody is watching then try to sneak it out with everyone starring at you. As an added bonus the cat came down to the window and jumped in your arms purring. Animals always seemed to like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch finally scaled the tower to find you took care of the pesky cat problem. \"Good work, that was too close.\", he said with a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left the helmet over by that old trunk. Nobody will think to check in there. You can pick it up at your convenience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you did good today Aaron. I owe you one.\", Lelouch replied grateful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll remember that...Lelouch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Lelouch walked out with you holding the cat. To the student council president's dismay she knew any \"dirt\" on Lelouch was gone since he walked out with you. \"What was that cat carrying anyway?\", asked one of the student council members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm an old friend of Lelouch's and his secret is safe with me so don't bother trying to get an answer from me.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, seeing as you caught the cat I guess you won the prize.\", the council president noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want it. I only participated to help out my friend so there's no business in taking a prize I wasn't after in the first place.\", you kindly rejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? You wouldn't want to get a little smooch from one of the student council girls?\", she flirted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively turned toward Kallen since she was the only one you'd really wanted a kiss from. She noticed you looking at her and blushed in response. You thought there wouldn't be any harm in it so you walked over to her. \"Just a small peck on the cheek.\", you asked her. Kallen was a bit shocked that you asked her and for such a small request. She thought it would be on the lips but instead you chose to be a gentleman and earn something that special later in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe descended on your cheek and lightly kissed it thus with the crowd cheering in celebration for catching the cat. \"This school is just weird. No wonder Lelouch is crazy.\", you thought.</span></div></div>",

How did you two get this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We borrowed it from a friend who owed us a favor. No strings attached.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed Kallen walking inside which brought some awkwardness to yourself after the cat incident not long ago. Kallen walked in noticing Aaron was not inside.in fact she didn't seem to notice that he was there at all. \"why has an Aaron arrived yet? He didn't come in with us so why isn't he here? Could he be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one of the rebels switched on the tv and saw one of the Japanese rebellion leaders had taken hostages in a hotel. The footage showed some of the student council as the hostages causing you, Zero, and Kallen to be uneasy. \"Idiotic methods performed by the Japanese. I dont tolerate this act of crulity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do then?\", asked Ohgi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although I detest this, Zero is the one who makes the calls and it is for him to decide. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what is our next move Zero? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will need time to think this over. We cannot go in without knowing what were dealing with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero left to figure out what todo while you sat around wondering what was going to happen. But you grew nervous when Kallen walked up and asked you somethig, \"Saren, have you seen someone named Aaron? He's part of our group but he should be here except he's not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron...  I know him well. He is my oldest friend of mine who saved me when Britainia first invaded. I sent him on a mission that will prove benefitial in the long run. Do not worry he is safe. (Except he's Saren. But she can't know that. But should I tell her?)\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He stands ramrod-straight and salutes, introducing himself as, \"Lord Kewell Soresi, at your service, sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKewell begins to pull out his I.D. papers, but you stop him, saying, \"That's enough.  I've received word from Headquarters that I am to... er, appropriate your Knightmare for the time being.  Head back to base now; that's an order!\"  Looking genuinely confused for a moment, Soresi quickly recovers and salutes again.  \"Uh, yes, my Lord!  As you command.  Here are the keys; the activation code is THX-1138.\"  Tossing the key to you, he walks off down the alley you came from, muttering something about, \"How come those Special Forces guys get to have all the fun... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drop your psychic veil, C.C. pops out from behind the garbage and congratulates you. \"Bravo, Mr. [?].  You're catching on quite fast; my last contractor was already dead by this time.\"  \"Yeah, thanks,\" you reply, slipping back into German.  \"Don't just stand there, get in!   We're not going to reach the Consulate standing around like damn statues!\"  As the two of you awkwardly cram yourselves into the cockpit, C.C. asks, \"Do you even know how to drive this thing?\"  Your mind flashes back to your time as a member of the EU Army's German branch, piloting the Panzer-Hummel Knightmare Frame.  Having been drafted at 17, you showed great skill and rose through the ranks quickly, becoming a member of the elite Death's Head Squadron.  At 21, after completing your tour of duty, you decided to pursue your dreams and become a diplomat, which landed you where you are now.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I do!\" you answered smugly.  Starting up the Sutherland, you make your way toward the consulate, steering around the ongoing battle in the ghetto.  You briefly catch a glimpse of a mysterious, white-and-gold Knightmare of a type you've never seen before, but quickly dismiss it and keep driving.  Arriving at the gates of the embassy, you pull over and fire a flare to get their attention.  Within minutes, two of the CF's awkward-looking Gang-Lou Knightmares and a squad of armed men surround your Sutherland.  Their leader, a well-built man with long, black hair and a sword at his belt spoke through a megaphone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Commander Li Xingke of the Chinese Federation Military,\" he yells.  \"Are you friend or foe, Britannian?\"  Opening the cockpit and placing your hands on your head, you respond in your admittedly shaky Chinese, \"First, I'm not Britannian, I'm from the EU.  Secondly, I've come seeking asylum from Britannia; are you willing to offer it?\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just drop any weapons you may have and come inside, &lt;i&gt;slowly&lt;/i&gt;.\"  Relieved, you and C.C. drop down the zipline of your stolen Sutherland, place your assault rifle on the ground, and slowly walk toward the Chinese commander, hands in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you advanced toward the entrance, C.C. said quietly, \"Well, it looks like you've done it again, [?].  I wonder how long your luck will last...?\"  Ignoring her, you face Xingke and his guards, who surround you on both sides.  Walking through the large, ornate double-doors, Xingke turns to you.  \"You're actually the second refugee to show up here.  A Britannian school boy who was injured came earlier.  Exactly &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; is going on in the city right now?\"  Your stomach briefly churns as you recall the slaughter from earlier.  \"I'm not entirely sure,\" you begin.  \"Apparently, the Britannian forces are after this girl; they nearly killed me over her!  I actually came for a diplomatic mission, but I doubt they care now; they're too busy slaughtering the Elevens in the ghetto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXingke curiously eyed your green-haired companion for a moment.  \"I... can't imagine why they would go to such lengths for just one person.  Is she carrying any kind of sensitive data?\"  Before you could answer, C.C. glared at you, the message in her eyes quite clear: 'You &lt;i&gt;cannot&lt;/i&gt; tell him about Geass!'  Taking that into account, you merely shrug your shoulders in response to the commander's question.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was suddenly interrupted by a comically high-pitched voice coming from down the hall.  \"Xingke?\" said the voice.  The voice belonged to a gaunt, pale man in fancy robes, flanked by heavily-armed bodyguards.  \"Are you bringing more foreign rabble into our consulate?\"  Xingke sighed exasperatedly, replying, \"Minister Gao Hai, sir, these two are EU citizens who were attacked by Britannian forces.  They came seeking political asylum.\"  The High Eunuch merely turned up his nose at C.C. and yourself, saying, \"Ugh, fine.  Do what you wish with this... Eurotrash.  Just don't overstep your boundaries...\"  With that, he and his entourage ascended the nearby stairs, leaving you alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" began Xingke.  \"Whatever Britannia was after, we'll see to it that they answer for their actions.  For now, you're free to stay here.  Xianglin, lead these two to the guestrooms, will you?\"  An elegantly dressed young woman with elaborately-styled brown hair appeared, motioning for you to follow her upstairs.  C.C. remained silent, apparently content to let you continue doing the talking.  Your escort, Xianglin, suddenly spoke.  \"We're renovating most of the rooms at the moment, so you'll have to stay with the boy from earlier for now.\"  You nodded silently, not particularly concerned as long as you could get a place to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you reached the room, Xianglin handed you a key and motioned toward the door.  \"Here's where you will be staying.  If you need anything, there is an intercom system.  Just don't ask for anything ridiculous, and mind your 'roommate'\".  She then left, heading back downstairs.  You knocked gingerly on the door, and a youthful voice on the other side answered in Britannian English.  \"It's open\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and C.C. entered, a boy sitting on the bed waved mirthlessly, greeting you with a deadpan, \"Welcome.  I assume you were caught up in the chaos outside, as well?\"  You examined him; he wore a black school uniform with stylish gold trim, and bloodied bandages were wrapped around his head, covering his silky black hair.  He gazed back at you with piercing violet eyes and a vaguely bemused expression.  \"Yes,\" you answered.  \"I am [?], ambassador of the Euro Universe.  And this is C.C., my... er, companion.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy extended a hand to shake.  \"Lelouch Lamperouge, student.  A pleasure to meet another victim of Britannia's savagery.\"  His voice dripped with suppressed rage; you couldn't help but wonder if perhaps he had some prior grievance with Britannia.  Maybe it was just the power of your new Geass going to your head, but you suddenly felt an urge to help him.  \"Sounds like you're about as 'enthusiastic' about Britannia as I am,\" you began.  \"Maybe we can help you to actually do something about it.\"  Lelouch stared at you for a moment, before an utterly sinister smile crept onto his face, actually scaring you slightly.  \"Well, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, two strange figures surveyed the scene in the ghetto from the rooftops, watching as Britannian Knightmares, lead by a mysterious white unit, routed the rebel forces.  One, a tall young man with white hair and bright blue eyes listened to his portable radio, hearing the panicked transmissions of the Japanese.  \"&lt;i&gt;Kallen!  There's too many of them!&lt;/i&gt;\" said a frantic voice.  \"&lt;i&gt;Take Tamaki and the others and fall back-- aargh!&lt;/i&gt;\"  The boy smiled for a moment before flipping a switch on the radio and speaking into it.  \"Agent Rai here.  The enemy forces are in retreat; it looks like Asplund's new toy was a success, after all.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other figure, a shorter boy with curly brownish hair, responded.  \"Yes, but we failed to capture C.C.  We'll report our findings to the Emperor, but we shouldn't even consider returning to base until we've gotten a lead on her location.  Agent Halliburton, out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As I ran deeper into the war torn district I could hear gun fire and screams of men, women and children as the Britannian soldiers slaughtered them like animals. I knew that if any of them saw me they would assume I was Japanese and shoot me on sight. So I kept running for as long as I was able until I collapsed in an abandoned warehouse some distance away from the fighting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sat on the floor gasping in some much needed air I couldn't help but ask myself \"What am I even doing here? I don't even know this girl, why am I trying to save her? Why didn't I just leave her and run away from all this?..Running is all I really good at.\" I said rather depressingly. But it was true. All my life all I ever did was run. Run from the orphanage that took care of me, run form place to place, city to city, scrapping for food and money were I can(sometimes even stealing both) just drifting along the never ending road. I was a nobody. A wandering nobody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really all you are?\" a soft curious voice asked from my lap. I looked down to see the girl finally wake up from what was very deep slumber. Her bright golden eyes seemed to pierce my very soul as she then asked \"What if you were more the what you think you are?\" I try to ask what she was talking about but she seemed to read my mind and said \"What if I can show you what you are really capable of?\" she asked ominously. But before I can think of a answer the warehouse doors opened to reveal a group of Britannian soldiers that seem very pleased to find new lambs for the slaughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well troops it looks like we found our little runaway.\" The leader of the troop said with twisted glee as he approached us drawing his gun. I felt my heart freeze at the sight what was very likely my death coming closer. I couldn't move, I could barely think as I heard the deafening sound of him pulling the trigger as blood slashed across my face as the girl was shot through the heart and fell on top of me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then in a split second I found myself in a strange white void with the girl standing in front of my with a rather cold stare.\"Is this how you want it to end? Do you really want to die here? An aimless drifter who was I the wrong place at the wrong time? Or do you want to live?\" she asked with surprising power in her voice. A voice that forced me to answer with only the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you will need power in order to make it through this.\" she said frankly \"I can give you that power. Power most could only dream of having. The Power Of A King. But in exchange you will have to grant me my one wish. Do accept these terms?\" I didn't know what was going on and at that moment I really didn't care. All I knew was that if this \"Power\" she was offering was my only way out of this mess then I only had one choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I accept the terms of your contract!\" I declared with certainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow how can I describe what it was like to have my new power? Well it was once theorized that humans only consciously use a small portion of their brains. The human mind processes information in such incredible detail and yet we can only comprehend so much of it at once. Little do we realize that all of our senses are somewhat muted so we don't get sensory overload and have seizures. Now imagine seeing colors in new shades and hues you didn't know were possible, hearing sounds so acutely that you could literally hear a pin drop in a rock concert, smells become so distinct that you can close eyes and still tell someone the color of their hair, you can taste the air with your tongue like a snake and you could feel an ants foot steps from yards away. That was 1/3 of my new power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I'm sure you have heard of people who have photographic memory right? Well what I had now was like that cranked up to 11. I could recall everything I ever saw, heard, smelled, tasted, touched with such accuracy it was like experiencing them all over again. I could even remember every dream I had throughout my life. That was the 2/3 of my power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I'm sure you have heard stories of people demonstrate feats of near superhuman level when put under extremely dangerous situations, like a mother lifting a car to save her trapped child. The human body is capable of more then we give it credit for. But the mind has limiters in place to keep us from destroying our bodies. Now imagine being able to turn off these limiters at will. That was the final part of my power. The power to unbound the built in limits of humanity and realize your true potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Power Of Absolute Potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this power I was capable of almost anything. I knew that with certainty. The possibilities flowed through my mind with perfect clarity. The only question was what do I do?</span></div></div>",

Running behind it I grabbed the gun of the dead body as well as a fire extinguisher, spraying it all around me. The Knightmare spun around but obviously didn't understand what was going on. I hurled the fire extinguisher at it's already damaged mask and shot at it. The third one hit it and exploded in it's face. The mask crumbled to the ground and as a result the escape pod was forced to release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI picked up the girl and ran but a soldier quickly caught up with me. \"You pulled some crap with my knightmare over there!\" he exclaimed. The he yelled \"Turn around!\" I quickly spun around and tried to kick him but he shot me in the leg. \"AW!\" After the pain subsided a little I remembered the previous two knightmares. They were comrades of his but he shot them anyway just for having mercy. I wished that some miracle would occur here as well. Suddenly I felt naucious again like I was being projected forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier quickly lifted me up and started carrying me. I was stunned. Then soldiers started to surround us. \"Bring them both back to base!\" he shouted. \"Yes, Colonel!\" they responded.</span></div></div>",

The back of my head throbbed so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it from here\", the colonel said. The soldier clicked their heels, saluted and marched out. \"How do you like the hospitality?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"Better than the streets.\" I replied sarcastically. He approached me and said \"Do you know who I am?\" \"You're the colonel...\" \"And your only lifeline. I am Colonel Inuji of the Britanian army. And better yet I am you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you repeat that one more time, I must still be a little wousy. It sounded like you said you were me.\"<br>\r\n\"That's exactly what I said. When that babe met you she gave us this power. The power to transfer our minds to others.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n\"When you were praying for a miracle you projected your thoughts into my mind. I then became you. Why else wouldn't I shoot you.\"<br>\r\nI paused for a moment unsure of this nutcase but he continued anyway.<br>\r\n\"While you were unconscious I interrogated the green haired girl. She says this power is called thought projection. Apparently we're able to send our thoughts into a certain number of hosts. From there the only way to release it is to have that host transfer the power or for the host to die. Furthermore it seems that we can't be more than 200 meters away from each other at all times.\" he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So what does this mean?\" I asked, wondering how I would react if I was in another body. Would I kill myself I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The higher-ups are on their way, I figured we should repay her gift. As for an escape I know all of this hosts bank accounts we should be able to run for weeks.\" he stated.</span></div></div>",

Colonel Inuji then called in the guards and began to leave. I then projected my thoughts into them and they became me. With our four man squad we pretended to transfer me from the interrogation room to a cell. As we headed towards the girl I projected my thoughts into 4 more soldiers. I realized it was becoming hard for me to control so many. My nose was bleeding profusely. I tried to take one more but suddenly he started shouting traitors and shot 3 of the 6 of us. Colonel Inuji quickly disposed of him. But not before the sirens went off. Soldiers were gaining on us from behind and we were still far away from our goal. The 2 remaining soldiers defended our backs as we tried to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe ran into a room, turned off the lights for the camera and hid. I suddenly felt like I was about to have a concussion. 2 soldiers walked into the room. I used my power on them. Luckily they didn't betray me. Suddenly I felt another spasm and fell to the ground I was still conscious but I couldn't move. The 2 soldiers left the room and reported that we weren't there. Colonel Inuji pulled me up through the vent and carried us into another empty room. After I was able to stand we prepared to head out. Then there was a report over the loudspeaker \"the higher-ups are here all soldiers report to b1 to protect there safe arrival from the traitors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute we charged through the empty halls to the entrance we had agreed on. We traveled down the stairs. Boom an explosion came just as we reached the bottom of the stairs, taking out all the guards my nose began to bleed and my skull was hemmoraging. We reached the inside but the girl was already gone. Soldiers were lying dead as a truck drove off recklessly into the distance. But there were still soldiers there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took control of as many as I could. But couldn't reamina conscious anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI awoke in a garbage dump.</span></div></div>",
