The large expulsions of gas came from two very full humans within the inn, a male paladin called Calarren and female mage called Arlexis. Calarren had a regular thin face with blue eyes that went well his short brown which was done in a causal style. Arlexis had a more soft face with blue eyes that complimented her long light brown hair very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had just finished eating a massive feast to celebrate their promotions to deputies and were now sporting huge stuffed bellies that completely filled up their laps. Their guts were massive orbs filled to the brim with food and drinks. Calarren's belly had destroyed the front lower half of the plate chest armor he had been awarded for his deeds in Northshire, leaving his swollen gut completely bare. Similarly, Arlexis' tummy had ripped a huge hole in the robe she was given for the help she provided in Northshire, which let her huge belly completely exposed to the elements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was \u2013UUURRRP- good.\" Arlexis said, giving her stomach a few pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two overfed Alliance members had a little friendly eating contest at Arlexis' suggestion. The paladin wasn't as enthusiastic as the mage at first, who was eagerly chowing down and burping with a look on her face that showed that she was having a blast, but he quickly grew to enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, you \u2013UURRP- said it.\" Calarren replied as he rubbed his belly. \"You wanna call it a draw? I don't think either of us could eat another \u2013URP- bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could actually go for another round.\" The light brown-haired mage casually replied as she drummed her fingers on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! UUUURRRP!\" Arlexis let out a little laugh, causing her gut to shake. \"I'm joking, I'm just as stuffed as you are. So yeah, let's call it a draw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, right. UUURRRP!\" Calarren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both then leaned back in their chairs and sighed in pleasure, letting their stuffed bellies surge out. They continued to let out many loud belches as they rubbed their taut tummies, some of their belches were so loud it surprised even them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully we won't gain too much \u2013UURRAAP- weight from this.\" The bloated paladin stated, looking down at his big tummy as gently massaged it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't worry.\" Arlexis replied as she rubbed her dome of a middle. She belched again before continuing. \"With all the work we'll be \u2013UUURRRAAAP- doing, we'll work off the pounds in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's true. UUUURRAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one!\"</span></div></div>",

Nothing like a big ol' belch to make room in yeh belly.\" Lenniara happily said, giving her a belly a hearty slap for emphasis. She let out another burp before taking a bite out of a pretzel, she quickly ate the whole thing and downed it with some more beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese dwarf had a youthful face, with cute bright blue eyes and a few freckles around the bridge of her nose. Her light brown hair was styled as a hime cut with a braid on each side of the front. She was wearing her Judgement armor, minus the hood and mask of course, though her giant gut had broken the abdominal section, leaving Lenniara's massive orb of a middle completely exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of Lenniara's her weight had gone right to her stomach. It was a giant sphere of a fat that was incredibly soft and malleable whenever it wasn't stuffed to the brim with food. It was also very jiggly, bobbing and bouncing with every one of the paladin's movements. Lenniara's stomach hung down enough to obscure her crotch and nearly touch the ground. Lenniara's gut possessed plentiful rolls and love handles on the sides of it. Her bellybutton was very deep, almost looking like a black hole in the center of her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin had some very impressive breasts. They were massive plush orbs that rested on top of the brunette's belly and jutted out almost as much as the large orb, easily able to break smaller bras. They bounced with every step she made, often in tandem with her gut, especially whenever she was fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenniara's ass was truly worthy of being called a bubble butt. Each cheek was was huge, squishy sphere of fat that would jiggle and jostle with every step the fat paladin made. Lenniara's ass would completely fill up any normal chair she sat down in, with only large ones being able to contain the whole thing. Her ass had even broken a few chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms and legs were very chunky too, a far cry from what most would expect a paladin to have. Her arms were chubby and soft, with big bingo wings. They were connected to meaty hands that had sausage-like fingers. The brunette's legs were so chubby and flabby that they rubbed together and wobbled with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenniara's face was very round and pie-like, pretty much lacking any angles. Her cheeks were soft and chubby, they jiggled and wobbled whenever she let out a bellyful laugh or a particularly loud belch. The paladin's chipmunk cheeks went along well with her double chin. Dimples would even appear when the paladin smiled or grinned. Lenniara's face being chubby and soft went along really with her cheerful and fun-loving personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was far from the first time Lenniara had stuffed herself at Brewfest. Whenever the holiday came and the celebratory festival opened, Lenniara would eagerly spend every day of the holiday glutting herself on the many different drinks and food available. She would participate in eating, drinking, and belching contests and was often the winner. While she did like the prizes she got for winning, she mainly did the contests for the fun of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenniara broke out into another hiccup and belching fit, her belly wobbling and shaking with every hiccup. One belch she unleashed was so massive then it caused her giant belly to jiggle. However, the dwarf soon heard a particularly loud belch that did not come from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like someone -hic- been enjoying themselves -hic- as much as I -UUURP- have.\" Lenniara remarked, eager to see who that someone was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette looked towards the source of the huge gaseous eruption to see that it came from...</span></div></div>",

Running, mmn, low!\"<br>\r\nCalling from the scene of a would-be harem, Tyrande punctuated her request with a low, rumbling belch. The Temple of The Moon was hardly recognizable from it's former immaculate presence. What was a shrine of humility and temperance has since transformed to a den of self indulgence. Sprawled among the piles of pillows, cushions, and the reminders of recent feasts, the high priestess was the center of transformation - the former definition and trim of a woman in her prime had faded -dramatically-. Not one, but two rolls laid into her lap, the divot of her navel making a defined trench of flab. Her breasts laid heavily on top, contained by the thin fabric of her overstretched dress, the silver embellishments digging into her decadent girth. Each thigh encompassed her former waistsize and then some, her rump shelving out behind her with a healthy layer of backfat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweeping her hands over that expansive gut, Tyrande shooed off wayward crumbs of her last plate. The light smears of chocolate still on the corner of her plump lip. Handmaidens bolted upward, rushing to fulfill her request for the next serving. The high priestess of a temple now embodying gluttony. \"Wonderful, thank you..\" Swiping from the nearby platter beside her, she hiked up a massive milkshake, tilting her head back for a long and drawn out guzzle. straight from the rime of the glass. Heavy and already stuffed, she was hardly eating for necessity, the rich stuff just bloating her already round stomach. She had plenty of time to wait for the next course, her priestesses eagerly preparing from the expanded kitchen- a shrine replaced with all the trappings of a bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling away from the glass, Tyrande hardly realized she reached the end of the glass, patting down the bottom for whatever whip cream topping she could scavenge. \"Mmn, uurap..\" A low belch signaled that drink's end, a hearty pat accentuating with a call for haste. \"I'm starving, dears!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rub it.\" The chubby servant nodded slightly as she leaned down and got to work on satisfying the High Priestess' request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooouurrp!\" Tyrande belched quickly as the Handmaiden started the massaging, but it wasn't a perfect spot for it, not yet anyway. \"Low---Uurrp! Lower!\" And so the chubby handmaiden moved her target lower, a bit above the obese commander's belly button. Quickly getting a response. \"Mrrrwwwaaa... L-L...Loweerrr\" spoke the overweight Kal'dorei through a moan. The plumpy Handmaiden hesitated for a moment as Tyrande's stomach grumbled loudly, before quickly moving lower as to avoid her High Priestess' wrath, now massaging the surrounding area of her navel. The Handmaiden received no further words of command, instead being subject to hearing the obese Priest's constant sounds of pleasure, both from her maw and churning stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next several minutes were filled by sounds of belching and moans coming from Tyrande's quarters as her Handmaiden continued, each one seemingly louder than the last. \"Ahhhh--Uurrrp.

Like the journey from Elwynn Forest to Duskwood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lightforged Draenei Paladin had chosen Duskwood as her first assignment in service of the Alliance. Having accepted said assignment from the Hero's Call Board in Stormwind, having been teleported there shortly after becoming Lightforged on the Vindicaar, this meant that she would have to make the journey from there. It was by no means a long journey, but it still left Iinthae doing absolutely nothing for an hour or two as she rode her faithful Lightforged Elekk. The mount had been well trained, he knew to simply follow the road until his rider told him otherwise. for this specific journey, she would only have to do so three times. Once at the crossroads at Goldshire, which she had just recently done, again as soon she entered Redridge Mountains, where she'd take the first right available and continue on the path from there, and lastly she would have to tell her Elekk to stop once they actually reached their destination of Darkshire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElwynn Forest was completely safe, with guards patrolling the roads and keeping away wolves, bears, Murlocs, and the occasional cutthroat. Only when she entered Duskwood would she need to stay on guard. So the Draenei didn't even have to keep her guard up. She could even take a nap for most of the journey, and she did wish she could, but she was the type who couldn't get any sleep unless it was completely dark. Something she would get when she reached her destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Lightforged Draenei had a youthful face, long light blonde hair with a golden headpiece, and Light-infused tattoos on her body that, along with the golden eyes and lighter complexion, were proof of her status as Lightforged. She was lazing on her back, gazing up to the sky and trying to pick out cloud formations in a failed attempt at elevating her boredom as she rode her steed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The appeal of a new land lasts surprisingly short.\" Linthae noted out loud to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rumble came from her stomach. She wasn't that hungry but she needed something to do, so she figured a light snack would at least keep her arms moving. So she opened up her bag of supplies, took out some cheese and water, and soon sent both to her stomach. It was enough to satisfy her minor hunger but now she was right back to just having her arms hanging down limply with nothing to do. In order to correct that, she kept absentmindedly eating. She'd know when she got full, so there was no risk of running out. Or so she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoredom can be a very distracting thing. Without even looking down at her large pack anymore, she just kept eating meat and cheese in a trance, occasionally downing them with some water. What ended up bringing her out of that trance was running out of food. When she reached in her bag and discovered she couldn't grab anything, she got up and took a look at it, confirming to her shock it was completely empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much did I -UUUUURRAP-!\" Her belch had given her the answer she was looking for. Her cheeks turned a red shade. She looked at her belly to confirm her fear. She had a big stuffed belly that was completely round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dreaded feeling of being absolutely stuffed hit the Paladin like it was her own hammer. Groaning, she leaned right back down as she clutched her belly. For once she wished she was on her back because she was bored. She undid her belt, tabard, and the lower half her chest armor, allowing her gut to bulge out two inches further. She sighed in relief at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRP! I didn't even know I could eat so much.\" Iinthae belched loudly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her journey was pretty much her belching and groaning as she rubbed her belly in hopes of soothing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm supposed to be filled with the Light -UUURAAP-, not with food. URRRRP!\" She moaned before giving her belly a poke, eliciting a gurgle from it. \"If I keep this up I'll be a -URP- Food -UUUURRRP- forged Draenei in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon arrived at Darkshire. Normally she would've been very pleased to see the sight of her now commanding officer in The Night Watch, Commander Althea Ebonlocke. Normally she also wouldn't have a huge stuffed gut, be belching loudly, and have her tabard along with parts of her armor removed in service of the round orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly and awkwardly got down from her Elekk, and wobbled over to Althea, her tummy jiggling as she cradled and rubbed it, the Leader of The Night Watch eyeing her with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the help that we requested?\" Althea asked, not sure what answer she was hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRRRAAAAP!\" Was the only answer Iinthae could give her. She immediately slapped her hands over her mouth as she blushed the hardest she ever had in her entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthea sighed. \"I suppose you will have to do.\"</span></div></div>",

You win.\" That was how Taelia's bloated opponent conceded and placed the gold he had waged on the human woman's side of the table. He was a Night Elf Demon Hunter, the typical garb of which left his bloated belly exposed for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Taelia gave her own bloated belly a proud slap and belched loudly. \"Thank you.\" Her gut had earlier snapped both her belts in half, the brown orb of alcohol bulging out freely. \"But are you sure you're not up for another round?\" She teased, already knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BWAAAAP! Positive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally.\" Said the Demon Hunter's companion, a Blood Elf woman and fellow member of the Illidari. \"Are you proud of yourself now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, I lost.\" He said, too tipsy to realize that was obviously a rhetorical question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should've known better then to expect shame from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you should've. You know me, I'm always up for a challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How someone like you got into the Illidari I'll never know.\" Despite her attitude, she still allowed her bloated companion to lean on her as she helped him up to their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't Taelia's first victim that night. During a rainy night at the Snug Harbor Inn, Flynn came up for an easy way to get some pocket change after being inspired by Taelia's incredibly high tolerance for alcohol. As a heavy drinker himself, he knew very well that a lot of inn regulars take great pride in their ability to consume ungodly amounts of alcohol. A lot of them looked like the kind of people who would. A slim, young woman like Taelia didn't look anything like someone who could hold a lot of beer, so as Flynn expected, it wasn't hard to get someone to feel real cocky about betting gold on a drinking match. Flynn liked to think of it as a \"more honorable form of hustling\", Taelia liked to think of as knocking overconfident guys down a few pegs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two men now too bloated for their pants, Taelia's first victim being a Draenei man, she and Flynn had collected 100 gold in total. Normally some of Taelia's share would have to be spent repairing her belt, or perhaps buying a beer belly-resistant one, but she realized she could kill two birds with one stone by doing some work for whoever needed, she could lose the beer gut she would have in the morning and earn money for her belt at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say this is a pretty decent haul.\" Flynn said as he put his share in his pocket, 50 gold in total. \"You wanna cash out now or are you up for a few more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Taelia ran a hand over her swollen belly, she could fell it gurgling and bubbling as it tried to digest the mountains of alcohol she had consumed. When she woke up this morning, her stomach was as flat as could be, now it was a huge ball. Even how it felt was different, being both hard and soft at the same time, which Taelia didn't even think was possible until now. She jiggled it, both hearing and feeling all the liquid in it slosh around. \"BUUUURRP! I think I'm up for one more match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make that two more.\" Flynn suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that way we'll evenly spread 200 gold between us, instead of you getting 60% and me getting 40%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want more gold, then start grabbing a few pints.\" Taelia belched as she bumped her belly into his own flat one, making him stumble back a bit. That made her wonder if a bloated belly could actually be used as a decent weapon in combat. She'd have to keep it in mind if she ever got into a bar fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I'm the idea guy in this case.\" What Flynn said was pretty much exactly what his dark-skinned friend expected him to say.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Evette belched as soon as she finished her second slice of pumpkin pie. She uttered out an apology for her unladylike gaseous eruption and began digging into her next slice. She always loved gorging on pumpkin pie for Hallow's End, long before she had became undead. It wasn't one of the official traditions of Hallow's End but she felt it fitted the holiday. Of course, Hallow's End was far from the only time she ever stuffed herself, as her chubby body proved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvette had a surprisingly pretty face, especially for an undead, with her skin tone being the only visible sign of decay. Even her long hair, which covered the sides of her face, was in excellent condition, though it had turned from brown to green as a side effect of her undeath. Being attractive wasn't the only thing that made the priest unusual among the Forsaken as she was also rather chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvette's belly was a big soft orb of adipose. It was very squishy and jiggly, bobbing and bouncing like jello with every step. Evette often liked to play with it when she was alone, mainly by rubbing it but she also liked to jiggle and shake it. As much as she loved doing that, she would be incredibly embarrassed if someone saw her doing that. Plentiful rolls and love handles accompanied Evette's dome of a middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were large orbs of fat that jutted out almost as much as her big belly. They rested on top of her orb-shaped belly and were just as jiggly as it. Evette never failed to blush when her ample boobs bounced in an especially notable manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green haired women had an impressive ass. Her butt was composed of two cheeks that were each a huge sphere of soft jiggly fat, making it truly worthy of being called a bubble butt. The undead's butt had even broken a few chairs. Evette's priest robes did nothing to hide how large her ass was, if anything they emphasized it's massive size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were chubby and wide, so much so that they constantly rubbed together. They would wobble with every step the well-fed women made. Evette's thunder thighs helped to give her a very curvy figure, which her robes emphasized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvette's face was very chubby. She had a pair of round pudgy cheeks that went along well with her double chin. The priest's face had pretty much no angles, being completely round and pie-like. despite being a member of the Forsaken, these features actually made Evette's face rather inviting and cute, not scary in the slightest, as they emphasized her kind and gentle nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished eating her pies, Evette leaned back in her chair and let out a loud belch, hands on her stuffed tummy. She had undone her robes around her middle to give her belly more room halfway through her meal, when she noticed her robes were uncomfortably tight around her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" She uttered as she tenderly rubbed her big belly. \"Pumpkin pie -UURRP- always tastes even -URP- better on Hallow's -URRRAAP- End.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter resting for a bit, Evette redid her priest robes so they covered her belly again, making sure they were done in a way that provided the least amount of discomfort to her full tummy while still covering the large orb. The undead tried to get up but found herself weighed down by her packed full middle. After a few seconds of trying to stand up and only succeeding at lifting herself slightly above her chair, she sat back down to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should've -UURRRRP- seen that coming.\" She noted before making another attempt. \"Come on!\" She said as tried to force herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few painful seconds, her attempt was met with success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*huff* There we go.\" She said in an almost proud manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overweight women then walked (with a bit of a waddle because of the extra weight from her stuffed belly) outside her home to join the festivities. As she walked to the inn, where candy was being given out, she looked aorund at all the decorations while occasionally letting out a belch, and apologizing after every burst of gas. Even though Hallow's End was about being scary, she always found the Jack-O'-lanterns and witch hats on the statues to be very cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priest was so caught up in looking around that she didn't notice that she was about to bump into someone else, who was overweight and equally stuffed, until she actually did. Waves of blubber jiggled as their big bellies bumped together, the impact causing a loud belch to erupt from both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Evette apologized, it took both their bellies a bit to actually stop jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person she bumped into was...</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds of struggling, she finally managed to clip her belt together aorund her dome of a middle. Julia let out a sigh of relief. She placed a hand on her large tummy and looked down at her body, a look of disapproval on her chubby face. The paladin had put on a lot of weight recently thanks to all the gorging she had been doing. Julia now weighed 332 pounds, making her completely obese. Even while she was wearing her customized Judgement armor, it was clear as day how fat she had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia's belly was a massive sphere of adipose. It was very malleable and soft and would jiggle and bob with every step the well-fed paladin made. Julia's tummy would be especially jiggly whenever she was engaged in combat. With every strike of her sword, Julia's giant belly would react by jiggling violently. The Justicar's gut had gotten so huge that it broke many of her belts, so she now had to always wear tailor-made ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts had also gotten much bigger. Julia's chest was quite impressive, her plush boobs were now the size of melons and were easily able to break apart many smaller bras, which Julia had learned first hand. They jutted out almost as much the paladin's belly and rested atop the massive orb. Much like her tummy, Julia's large breasts bounced with every step, often causing the Justicar to blush behind her mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladin possessed a very big bubble butt. Each cheek was a huge, soft sphere that would jiggle and bounce with every step. Every normal-sized chair Julia sat down in would be completely covered up by her ass, only extra large ones being bale to contain her butt's full flabby glory. Her butt had even managed to break a few chairs, sending the fat paladin crashing onto to the ground and making her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were much flabbier now. They were very chubby and wide, to the point that they now rubbed together. Julia's legs were so chunky that they would wobble with every step she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia's face was very round and chubby. With soft pudgy cheeks and a double chin, her face was lacking pretty much any angles, now being as round as a pie. This helped to give Julia a very cute and inviting visage, though she was afraid it would make her hard to take seriously. She was glad that she had a mask to hide how chubby her face was now, unfortunately it didn't muffle her belches after a huge meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia wasn't the only member of The Silver Hand to get fat, far from it in fact. The Silver Hand had entered a new golden age, with more supplies and successes then ever before, which meant the paladins now had plenty of time to relax and enjoy the new delicious high quality food the order now had, something that was formally a rarity for the order. Every member of The Silver Hand ended up losing themselves in their gluttony and become at the very least chubby. Not only did this mean they're were not as suited for combat as when they were slim, but it also meant a lot of gold and resources had to be used on new and much larger armor to replace all the armor that was broken by their fattened up bodies. For most members their fat gut broke their armor but some had broken them with their big butts or ample chests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting her room in The Sanctum of Light and entering one of the main halls, her belly bouncing the whole time, Julia was treated to a reminder of how out-of-shape The Silver Hand had become. She stopped moving and sighed, she just had to take in the sight before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the training area for Retribution Paladins, Defender Adrielle and Champion Bachi were attempting to spar with each other but all they could do was bump their big bellies together whenever one of them tried to strike. Adrielle had the bigger gut, so odds were that she would win. For what its worth. Brandur, Defender Ursi, Azar, Vindicator Baatun, and Champion Cyssa Dawnrose were watching them, most of them did so while munching on a snack. Cyssa was one of the few who not only didn't mind getting fat, but flat-out loved it, even occasionally sneaking a grab of Baatun's flab. Her new armor looked exactly the same as her old set, and as such still proudly showed off the bare skin of her figure, particularly her stomach. Except instead of proudly showing off a flat tummy, it now proudly showed off a giant gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the nearby training area for Protection Paladins, Commander Falstaav was informing Aenea, Ithelis, and Defender Katroi on fighting tactics and strategies. Unfortunately, that was easier said then done. All four of them were nursing their big stuffed bellies, bloated and aching from a really big breakfast. Katroi was so full she laying on her back, belly sticking straight up into the air. Aside from the obvious issue of how hard it was to concentrate and pay attention while so bloated, there was the other issue of belching getting in the way of the lesson. Whether it was Falstaav's own belches interrupting him, or the belches of his students drowning his words out, Aenea's were probably the loudest, this was their hardest lesson in a long time, for all the wrong reasons. Tiza was checking up on the nearby armory as this went on, greatly amused by it. All the belching going on made her want to do the same, but she knew better then to add even more distractions from her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the hall, at the spot that served served as a place for storage, training, and drawing up plans or writing in general, Katherine the Pure was burping up a storm as she leaned back in her chair and tenderly rubbed her big, stuffed belly. The blonde was one of the best belchers in The Silver Hand. Judging from what was on the nearby desk, Julia assumed that Katherine was writing something but ended up getting more and more distracted by food until she got to her current bloated state. Two nearby Silver Hand Templars, one a male Human and the other a female Blood Elf, were sparring, not performing any better then Adrielle and Bachi were. They soon got out of breath and had to lay down to rest. A male Human Squire was reading a map but dropped it. When he tired to pick it up, his huge stomach got in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the left of that room was the area for healing, whcih also doubled as a training area for Holy Paladins. Crusade Commander Entari, Sunwalker Atohmo, and Brother Wilheim were having their injuries healed there. They had returned from a mission yesterday that was successful but left them injured, possibly because of their weight impeding their skills in combat though all three denied it. Sunwalker Reha, Brother Sammuel, and a male Dwarf Squire were the ones healing them. Holy Paladins were the specialization least affected by their weight gain, as using the Light to heal had nothing to do with physical abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia shook her head at the sight before she resumed walking and left the hall, passing by Jol, who was sitting on a bench that was audibly straining under her bubble butt, and a pair of Squires, one a male Dwarf and the other a male Human, who were having a chat. The human's belly almost completely blocked the Dwarf's view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia's belly, boobs, and butt jiggled with every step she took, a constant reminder of how fat she had become.</span></div></div>",

Should she really gorge herself on the overflowing piles of food in the cafeteria..? She absentmindedly grabbed her stomach as it growled once again and decided to eat. She headed over to the cafeteria, not realizing she had already been going there as per routine. As Julia rounded the corner, she saw two female humans squished together on an audibly squeaking bench, stuffing their faces full of desserts. She unconsciously licked her lips at the sight of food. Nearing her destination, she started to pant from the effort of walking the distance from her bedroom to the cafeteria, her face grew hot after realizing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the cafeteria, she saw tables stacked high with piles of food ranging from meats to desserts. Thanks to the hard work of chefs, farmers, and a handy new spell of duplication, food was being pumped out constantly, resulting in massive production. Looking around, she saw a table full of blood elves that looked to have been feasting on the table for hours. The evidence being their loud moans and massive guts resting on the table, a group of chubby maids, who were munching on the food they were delivering, waddled over with carts to pile more food onto the already existing stacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the table next to the group of overfed elves was her friend, Delas Moonfang. Her gigantic belly was for all to see as her clothing revealed both her belly and bust. Her breasts, twice the size of her own head, strained against her jacket: which reminded her she'd have to get some new custom clothing. While dragging over a chair, she noticed it would be a tight squeeze between a night elf, her, and Delas. As she sat down, she got embarrassed from the feeling of fatty stomachs and big, puffy thighs pushing into her from both sides. She briefly considered greeting Delas before her mouth watered at her favorite foods being right in front of her and began stuffing herself, her belly pushing more and more against her new belt she had just bought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Barenadon dashed at Kor'vas Bloodthorn, poised to make a quick and effective strike with the Twinblades of the Deceiver, only to get bounced back a few feat by Kor'vas' great belly. The impact causing waves of blubber on both of them to jiggle violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This round goes to me.\" Kor'vas said as she gave her belly a proud slap in victory. The Night Elf had a big bouncing belly, large breasts that rested on it, a jiggly butt, chunky arms and legs unsuited for combat, and a round face with chubby cheeks and a double chin. Overall she had a belly-heavy body shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you we're not going to use our weight as a weapon.\" Barenadon said in annoyance. \"The last thing the Illidari need is to act like... this\" Here he grabbed the sides of his tum. \"Is in any way a good thing. We're having a hard enough time losing weight as is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've always been fine with using whatever we can as a weapon. Why should fat be any different?\" Kor'vas countered. \"Besides, it's not like any of us are losing our blubber anytime soon.\" She gestured to a pair, a Night Elf man and a Blood Elf women, who were also having a match on The Fel Hammer's sparring area. Only instead of sparring, they were having an eating contest, even using their demon forms for it. It served as proof to Asha and Barenadon that not even demons could look intimidating while obese. No that they needed any more proof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're able to believe that we can destroy the Burning Legion but not that we can lose weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're willing to use Fel to combat the Burning Legion but not fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending so many long years fighting a brutal campaign against the Burning Legion, it made sense the Illidari would lose themselves in the many wonderful pleasures they hadn't experienced for so long, such as good, fattening food. Even The Slayer himself, Barenadon had fallen prey to the allure of delectable treats, which he was very disappointed in himself for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarenadon was a young Night Elf with long black hair and a black blindfold, he bore the horns and tattoos that signified a Demon Hunter. He wearing the Vestments of Second Sight. Yet even with all that, he was still unable to look intimidating with all the weight he had gained, now weighing around 331 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest part of him was his belly, being a huge orb of jiggly fat that was barely contained by his sash and belt. Well, his current sash and belt. many of his previous ones had been completely destroyed by the fat ball, he wasn't even full a few of the times he broke one. The Night Elf's giant orb of a middle would jiggle wildly from every swift move it's Demon Hunter owner would make. And since the fighting style of Demon Hunters was all about making swift, deadly moves, or at least as swift as moves an obese Elf can be, this meant the sphere was nearly always in a state of intense jiggling during combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis man boobs might be the part about being fat that Barenadon hated the most. The Illidari tattoos he was once proud to show off where now on big, squishy sacks of fat that sat on his gut as if they were a proud testament to his gluttony. All the jiggling they did made it even worse. All this was made even worse by the fact that male Demon Hunter gear always left the chest completely exposed, and the Vestments of Second Sight were no expectation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis butt was also huge, an amalgamation of two huge orbs that were as jiggly as the rest of him. All the bouncing they made when the Demon Hunter was running had torn some parts of his pants. His butt had also ripped one pair of leggings when he a book he was bringing over to another Demon Hunter. Barenadon is very grateful no one was there when his pants had ripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toned physique of his arms and legs was completely gone, replaced with tons of soft fat. Every bit of his arms were chubbier, but fattest part where his biceps, now bingo wings that jiggled with every strike of his warglaives. Said warglaives were held by soft, meaty hands that had sausage-like digits. His legs were meaty and wide. His thighs were nearly always rubbing together, the chaffing sometimes proving to be an annoyance when running, much like jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horns, blindfold, and glowing green eyes visible even with the blindfold on didn't do much to distract from Barenadon's chubby cheeks and double chin. No matter what he said, he was stuck as a total cutie most people would love to pinch the cheeks of. The Night Elf insisting he's not cute only made him even cuter, he could've avoided some cheek pinching, moob fondling, and belly rubbing had he not said that. He was glad his mask could at least hide his double chin, and that his scarf could too when he wasn't wearing his mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I side with Kor'vas on this.\" Izal Whitemoon interjected, she was looking pretty stuffed from all the snacking she had been doing while watching all the sparring. It was a good thing her gear bared her fat stomach all the time. She had an hourglass body shape, though her belly jutted out almost as much as her boobs. \"After all, she was able to win this round due to using her weight to her advantage. UUURAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not denying that.\" Barenadon replied. \"The issue is that it's hard enough for us to lose weight without thinking obesity has it's advantages. It'll be even harder if all our views on being fat improve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's have one more duel, but this time we'll both use our guts.\" Kor'vas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was more or less a sumo match. Both Demon Hunters rammed their guts together, hoping to knock the other down to the ground. Neither budged and both soon stepped back, returning to more traditional moves. The match was a mix of belly bumping, regular Demon Hunter fighting, and many pauses to catch their breaths. The duel only lasted three minutes before both were left panting on the ground. The whole time they were being watched by other Demon Hunters, most of whom were snacking as they watched. Quite a few of them were visibly stuffed by the time the duel was over, as they had been eating as they watched the duels before that ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is embarrassing.\" Asha Ravensong remarked, arms folded under her massive breasts. Her own weight had spread evenly. Her belly wasn't as big as Barenadon or Kor'vas' but it was still pretty big, her breasts were larger then either Demon Hunter's respective chest, her butt was bigger too and had broken a few chairs, her arms and legs were very meaty and wide, and she had a round face with chubby cheeks and double-tiered chin which were hidden behind her veil. \"I'll be waiting at the map for when you two can stand up. We have a new mission.\" She then walked away, her tummy, ass, and chest jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo very loud belches sounded, one of victory and one of defeat. Barenadon and Kor'vas looked at the source of them, the Night Elf and Blood Elf pair from before. The Night Elf was laying flat on the ground, rubbing his sore middle, having evidently lost. The Blood Elf was giving her own bloated gut a few satisfied pats, the winner of the contest. Both were still in their demon forms and burping a lot as they rubbed their tums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKor'vas and Barenadon's stomachs growled in hunger. They both placed a hand on their soft bellies.</span></div></div>",
