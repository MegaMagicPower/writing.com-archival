        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is an Interactive based on the movie The Incredibles. You can add anything you want as long as the story makes sense, with the exceptions of these rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Don't kill anyone off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Drastic changes (such as turning out to be evil, divorcing, quitting their jobs, etc) are fine for OCs, but don't do it with canon characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) No swearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) No time skips that last a year or more or stories set in the future, although stories set in the past are fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.) No illness, serious injuries or sleep deprivation but characters who are introduced as being disabled is fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.) Canon characters changing somehow (losing their powers, turning into animals, etc) is allowed, as long as they eventually return to normal. This includes getting fat. I add this because some writers seem to like making characters fat. If that does happen, again, make it temporary, and remember that food doesn't cause instant fatness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.) A bit of romance is fine, but no explicit sex, bestiality, incest, pedophilia, vore, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8.) Keep everyone in-character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9.) No drugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10.) A bit of potty humour is fine as long as it's not excessive.</td>",
