In the dead of night, nothing moved in the land of Hyrule.  Hardly anything moved on the Hyrule Field, where stray monsters still roam.  A horse running broke the silence.  The horse did have a rider on its back, all clad in a white dress.  Before the horse got to Lon Lon Ranch, the rider dismounted from the horse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Princess Zelda smiled as she held out the Giant's mask in front of her.  It had been stolen by Ruto.  But Zelda needed it.  She needed its powers.  She always wanted to be a giantess, crushing and munching everything in her path.  And now, she had the mask to do it!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Zelda chanted some magic words to activate the mask.  The mask began to glow and Zelda started to grow!  She didn't stop growing until she was 100 feet tall.  </span></div></div>",

She poked her belly and burped again. *buuurrrrrrrrp*  *BEEEELLLCCCHHH* *burp, burp, buuuuurp* *BBBBBBBEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHH* *buuuurp* Zelda sighed and let out one last burp, rubbing her gigantic belly.

What to do, what to do? she though. \"I know! I'll burp the alphabet!\" She sat up, leaving a dent in the grass where she had been laying, waited for the urge to belch, and when it came, she shouted, \"A!\" with perfect timing. \"B!\" she called out as another belch rose from her throat. \"C!\" as an even larger belch exploded past her lips. She recited the whole alphabet and still had gas left, so she decided to see how long she could make a burp last. The longest she got was 21.7 seconds. finally, when she was out of gas, she sat there quietly letting her stomach do its work. her meal had made its way through her large intestine and was now in her large intestine. She let out a massive fart so powerful that it pushed up her dress for all to see her panties- except no one saw because they were all in her belly. She let out another great wind that pushed over Hyrule castle, and another that destroyed Ganon's tower.<br>\r\nSuddenly, she found herself thirsty.

She brought her hand to her mouth and lapped up the water noisily like a dog, and felt it pour down her throat and into her belly where it mixed with the remains of her meal. She reached down for another handful of water and found a blue tektite trapped in her palm. She swallowed it as if it were a pill along with the water. She decided that it would take to long to drink the lake one handful at at time, so Zelda headed over to Kakariko village, pulled the long shaft of the well out of the ground, then used it as a straw to drink the rest of the lake. While drinking the water in the lake, Zelda swallowed several more Tektites, ate the old man in the lakeside observatory, and belched out the gas from her new snacks. After Zelda finished with the lake, she went back to Hyrule field to lay down. She rubbed her full tummy and felt that her bladder too was full; she would have to pee soon. Sure enough, she felt the overwhelming urge to urinate and simultaneously her stomach announced that her meal was ready to go. Then Zelda...</span></div></div>",

First came the food: a town's worth of people all transformed into waste by Zelda's great belly. Zelda ripped a massive fart as her first turd inched its way out of her butt. The turd kept coming and coming and finally fell to the ground with the force a bomb. Another huge tube of crap lowered down from her bottom with another fart, then another turd and another fart and another turd and another fart, and then she was done crapping. But then there came the pee. Zelda rushed to the huge crater where Lake Hylia once was and squatted at its edge, then opened up the great nozzle of her bladder. Thousands upon thousands upon thousands of gallons of golden liquid poured in a great waterfall from Zelda's rear end. Soon the lake was full again, but now its waters shined the color of the triforce instead of being clear. Before Zelda left she pooped out  the remains of the Tektites she'd eaten, their hard shells still whole and undigested, but the meat within them ripped out and absorbed.</span></div></div>",

Her belly had made short work of Hyrule's townspeople, and now they were mere pile of poop withing Zelda, waiting to be let out. She pulled her dress up and her panties down, then squatted in the middle of the field to do her business. The first turd slid out easily with one huge fart, and hit the ground with and Earth-shattering thud. Zelda looked between her legs and saw her turd, which was thirty feet long and must have weighed at least two and a half tons. Another massive turd squeezed its way from her bottom noisily with several wet, spluttering farts. After it fell to the ground on top of the first, Zelda, rubbed her belly to ease the rest of her load out of her bowels. A final turd, longer than the other two combined, snaked its way from her backside and coiled around the first two logs four times before the other end of it fell. Zelda, feeling considerably lightly, began to walk away when she noticed that some of the people had survived somehow. She picked up the eight survivors and said, \"Now what am I going to do with you?\"</span></div></div>",

Now you would think that she would grow, right?  Unfortunately, the mushroom that she ate was poisonous, and when she opened her eyes, she saw the mushroom and saw that it was dark purple, much like one of the mushrooms in the game, \"Super Mario in the Lost Levels\".

The good news was that Mario and Luigi were closeby and when they heard her scream, they rushed to her side and sent her to the hospital in the Mushroom Kingdom.  However, buy the time they get there, then mushroom's poison was so powerful that it can kill even an elephant within minutes, and so she dies.  Then when the plumbers saw that she died, they got depressed and took her body to the king.  The king sees poisonous mushrooms closeby, and at the first he thinks that the plumbers poisoned her, but Mario and Luigi convince him that they did not poison her.  The plumbers found a note close to the room with the mushroom written from Peach, written thus, \"ON THIS DAY, I HAVE BEEN SO FED UP WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM THAT IT IS TIME THAT I GROW TO BE VERY BIG, EAT MY COMRADS AND ENEMIES, AND TAKE OVER THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM.  I WILL USE A MUSHROOM TO MAKE ME GROW TO BE VERY BIG.\"-Peach  Mario shows the not to the king, and the king says as he sees the poisonous mushroom that she ate earlier, \"so Peach was planning to upsurp my throne eh?  I guess that her plan had backfired big dime, but we must give her a proper burial\".  Then a few weeks later, a funeral took plac where the people in the kingdom buried Princess Toadstool(Peach) and did a farewell ceremony.  However, Mario and Luigi were so depressed over Peach's death that they decided to retire from being the heros in the kingdom and went back to the real world, figuring that with Peach gone, there is no one else for them to save.  Then within 20 years later, Bowser had found out that Peach had died and that the plumbers had retired, and so he took advantage of the situation and although the remaining people in the kingdom put up a struggle, they were defeated, and after eating the previous kings alive, Bowser set up his whole kingdom in the entire land, and the entire kingdom went into a long age of darkness and gloom.  Oh, and when the villiagers screamed for help to Mario and Luigi, they found out that the plumbers had joined the military were killed in the war in Iraq.  Well with the heros gone, Peach dead after her foolish attempt to grow, and the mushroom kingdom taken over by Bowser and his minions, I have 2 words to tell you, GAME OVER!!! </span></div></div>",

I will get you out you perv!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach was keeping up with the colossal heels making sure not to get crushed by them, she shuddered to think how painful they would be.

Unfortunately, the only thing directly below the plumbers was Peach's stomach acid. Even the nearest island in the lake of acid was too far away for Mario and Luigi to reach before the acid weakened and eventually dissolved them. The once hopeful villagers quickly went into a state of panic, a few of them even jumping into the stomach acid in the vain hope that they could find Mario and Luigi and save them before they were digested, or because they figured that all was lost and chose to end their lives sooner rather than later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter swallowing the Mario brothers, Peach listened as carefully as she could to her belly because she had a feeling that they would try to evacuate the villagers, which was not good news for her poor tummy. Once she heard the sound of villagers crying in despair, she was satisfied that Mario and Luigi had been digested. As more and more villagers shared the Mario brothers' fate, Peach started letting out small burps, which she found amusing. Then her tummy made the same loud rumbling noises it did before Mario and Luigi were digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mario and Luigi,\" Peach said while smiling and looking at her protruding belly, \"it was nice of you to feed yourselves to me, but I'm hungry again.\" With that, she got down on her knees and searched the entire town for more people to eat. Her search destroyed most of the buildings in the town, forcing those inside to evacuate, only to be scooped up in one of Peach's hands, shoved or tossed into her mouth and swallowed whole. It wasn't long before Peach was filling her belly with villagers faster than her belly could digest them and, soon enough, the town's inhabitants had all become giant princess stomach inhabitants. Peach rubbed her bulging belly and softly hummed a happy tune, throwing in a few loud burps at regular intervals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Peach was about to move on to another town, however, she heard a familiar voice coming from behind her.

Peach?\" Daisy shouted to the colossal princess. \"I thought we were going to go on a picnic!\" Clearly she had not gotten the memo from Toadsworth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Daisy!\" Peach replied cheerfully. She then turned around to face her seemingly diminutive friend, who was dumbstruck by Peach's gigantic belly. Figuring that she had better explain what was going on, Peach continued. \"Yeah, Toadsworth heard that Bowser was planning to kidnap me again so he wouldn't let me go, so I snuck out and found a mega mushroom. Then I got hungry.\" She continued to smile innocently like it was no big deal that she had just devoured the entire populations of two towns, including the Mario brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what exactly did you eat to make your belly so big?\" Daisy asked nervously, even though she was fairly certain she knew what the answer was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first I ate all the people in that town,\" Peach answered as she pointed at Toad Town, \"and then I ate all the people in this town, and then I was going to ...\" Suddenly, she paused for a moment, and not because Daisy had said that she got the picture. \"Wait, is my belly really that big?\" Peach asked with a hint of mock curiosity as she looked at her obviously big belly. Before Daisy could do anything, Peach reached out and grabbed her, causing her to scream. Peach then stood up and slowly brought Daisy closer and closer to her belly. This only made Daisy scream even more, but when she was close enough, she found her screams being drowned out by the noises Peach's gargantuan belly was making. To Peach, it was nothing more than the normal sounds of digestion and some really faint screams. To Daisy, it was a deafening cacophony of gurgles and rumbles accompanied by cries of desperation from the villagers inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Daisy realised that Peach was bringing her towards her navel. By this point, she had screamed all she could and was powerless as Peach shoved her face first into her cavernous belly button. As if the noise wasn't bad enough, Daisy now felt her world shift with every movement Peach made. Fearing that she might fall out of the huge navel, Daisy thrust both hands into one of the folds right at the back of it and grabbed as tightly as she could. As soon as she did, though, she felt her world bounce up and down and heard Peach's voice above her. The huge princess was giggling, which in turn was causing her belly to jiggle slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the bouncing stopped briefly, only to return much more violently. The cries inside Peach's belly turned into screams. As Daisy was thrown about inside Peach's navel, her grip weakened until she could hold on no more. Upon letting go, Daisy found herself being tossed about towards the edge, where the bouncing seemed to be even more violent. Moments later, she tumbled out of the giant belly button, but instead of landing on the ground, she landed not far below on the roof of a building that Peach hadn't gotten around to destroying. From there, she could see what the cause of all the turbulence was. Peach had grabbed her belly with both hands and was shaking it up and down. A short while after seeing Daisy sitting on the roof of the building, she lifted her belly up as high as it would go and then let go. Daisy saw the enormous belly jiggle for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess my belly really is that big if it jiggles that much,\" Peach said, still smiling about the whole ordeal. Daisy tried to say something but after all the movement that had just happened, she could only utter gibberish. Peach looked at the much smaller princess and wondered what to do with her. She could eat her just like she had eaten all the other villagers, but she was still feeling quite full. Besides, Daisy was a friend. Sure, she had eaten Mario and Luigi earlier, but they literally jumped down her throat. She hadn't intended to eat them. And then she got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, if we find another mega mushroom,\" Peach said to Daisy, \"you could eat it and become a giant just like me, and then we can have that picnic! Except instead of the usual picnic food, you could eat whole towns' worth of people! It'll be great!\" Daisy's jaw dropped when she heard the idea. Could she really do this? Surely it was wrong to kill so many innocent people just for a thrill and a full belly. On the other hand, Peach seemed to be treating it as no big deal, so maybe it really was no big deal. Besides, what would the alternative be?</span></div></div>",

Stop this now and get a mini mushroom before you kill us all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you look so cute!\" Peach said while giggling at Daisy's protests. This only seemed to make Daisy even angrier as her yelling became incoherent and she started jumping up and down on the building she was on. Peach couldn't help but find this amusing. However, if Daisy wasn't taking too well to Peach's behaviour, she might try to put a stop to it or find someone else who could. Peach could not let that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like watching a little girl having a temper tantrum,\" Peach said as she reached out for Daisy. \"I think you need a time out.\" Despite Daisy's best efforts to evade the giant hand, there was only so far she could go when she was trapped on the roof of a building. She was soon scooped up by Peach and, unable to free herself from her captor, she began to panic as Peach lifted her up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where shall I put you for your time out?\" Peach wondered aloud. \"Maybe I should just eat you.\" This caused Daisy to freak out and Peach felt the tiny princess struggling to get out of her hand. Not that she cared much, of course. \"After all, you look very tasty,\" Peach continued as she licked her lips, \"and you'll help fill up my big belly.\" With that, Peach lowered Daisy to her belly and rubbed it while moaning in pleasure. Daisy tried to scream but, because Peach was rubbing her belly with the hand Daisy was held in, her mouth was constantly filled with Peach's fat, so she was forced to listen to the sounds of the villagers being digested inside Peach's belly. Oddly enough, there was no screaming or crying to accompany the grumbling and gurgling this time. Perhaps they had all fallen unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again,\" Peach said, \"I still haven't finished up those villagers yet. Maybe I should keep you for later.\" Daisy then found herself being moved once again to Peach's belly button and pushed in. The noises she had heard just a moment ago surrounded her as she stared straight at the back of the cavernous belly button she was in. This time, however, everything started to go dark for Daisy. When she turned around, she saw Peach's hand heading straight towards her. Before she could attempt to escape, though, Daisy was engulfed in darkness as Peach's hand completely covered her belly button. Desperately, Daisy tried to punch the obstructing hand and the surrounding belly button walls to get Peach to release her, but instead this made the titanic princess giggle again. The laughter made Daisy's surroundings shake like an earthquake and she fell on her backside. She then started to cry when she heard Peach sigh happily.</span></div></div>",

As peaceful as they liked to be, they would not let their morals stand in the way of this--- it was by the far sexiest thing they'd yet experienced. And so they took to the streets of the village, working their way through every alley to find more villagers to feed to Princess Peach. Once they had finished, they tossed these limp weaklings into peach's expectant mouth, and she slurped them up like spaghetti. One by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had taken in the last one, she downed them all with an almighty gulp, and smiled contentedly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooohhh *urp*... thanks, boys, that was... that was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, from the depths of her gut, a deep rumble began once more. But this was not the same rumble as the brothers had just been hearing. For a while, they were puzzled... they had no idea what this new sound was. Peach, however, knew exactly what was coming. She smiled devilishly. And, indeed, just as she expected, this rumbling grew louder, deeper and richer, building up and up, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mario, Luigi. You'd better get out the way.

Mario found a fire flower growing in the lint somewhere down in the bottom of the cavernous belly button and plucked it from one of the princess's navel dimples, inciting another fit of laughter from the Princess.

Haha!\"<br>\r\nRikku then let go a devastating gas from the other end, leaving the teenage boy, trapped inside Rikku, breathless for minutes. \"Excuse me!\" said Rikku, laughing uncontrollably. \"Don't worry friend, plenty more where that came from!\"<br>\r\nRikku then exclaimed, \"This is so much fun... ohh... oooohhhh... ooooooooh... what's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikku then noticed that she began to grow even more in size, her clothes getting even tighter, her breasts getting larger, ass firmer, and all of her muscles developing.<br>\r\n\"Even BIGGER? This is so great! The vore sphere has so much power. I'll be able to eat, and eat, eat and forever now!\"<br>\r\nShe grew to nearly 130 feet tall! Rikku, noticing that she could now be unstoppable in her hunger quest, decided to seek out a more appetizing meal. \"But where will I go now to eat? So MANY people left!\"</span></div></div>",

Is that the best you got, you must be weak from bein'' in my big ol' tummy so long.\" she said as she patted her stomach.

Mmm.. and what a good snack you were.... filling and oh so delious... I wish I could eat you again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pondered her statement, but then felt a wet sounding gurgle emit from her stomach. She looked longingly into her stomach and sighed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suppressed a belch causing her chest to pop out a little and a ever so small sound to emit from her closed mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh... I think I almost threw up into my mouth. I must be more full then I thought... But i suppose that's what good food will do to you, right my little treat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reply she got was a wet squelching noise from her stomach.

Soon, the man saw the cliff, but he didn't stop in time so he fell off the cliff and into Tifa's hungry mouth, and she swallowed him quickly.  With him gone, the evil giantesses basically decided to eat the rest of the people and all living creatures in town and there was nothing to stop them, not even the other heros from the final fantasy universe.  Eventually after they ate up the whole town, they began to go after the rest of the world, and although there was some resistance, the evil women ate every single living being in the world.  After that, Tifa and her friends looked shocked and realized what they had done, they had destroyed the world as they knew it due to their cruelty, their lust for power, and relentless hunger.  \"Oh my gosh, what have we done?  We have destroyed the whole world.  What are we going to do now?\"  They asked.  But onething that they didn't realize is that God was watching the whole thing, and by destroying the whole human race, he was quite angry with the evil women, so he sent a fire to consume them by which they died quickly, and he created a new set of people after the previous final fantasy universe had perished.  Many of the womens' victims were resurrected and placed into the new final fantasy world, while Tifa and her evil friends went to hell to be with satan for all eternity.  In hell, Tifa said to her friends, \"damn our pride, all civilization was wipped out from our lust for power from our giant size and our relentless hunger.\"  Well, that is the end of the old Final Fantasy universe, and in the new Final Fantasy universe, God placed the memory of the first FF universe so that they can avoid having the same fate as the first one.  And with that, they begin the long process of rebuilding society and almost 1 million years later, they return to the state that they were in just before Tifan and her friends' tragic rampage.  What a waste of a civilization due the desire of Tifa and her friends to become giantesses and wreak havock.  Start over!</span></div></div>",

Which he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God! I heard they ate almost everything in Corel!\" said a person. (You know what they say. Rumors spread quickly hehe...) Cloud felt someone touch him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me. We have to talk about this. Now...\" said a black haired stranger. Cloud followed him into an alley. The stranger had a black smooth leather jacket and black pant. He wore black sunglasses. And black gloves. And he had small spiky hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" Cloud interrogated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryu Ozaki. What town, city or whatever did those giantess devaor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coral.\" Cloud answered. The stranger was taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! I swear those giantess will pay!!!\" the stranger said with intense anger in his voice. His hand turned to a fist. Suddenly his hand was engulfed in a black flame. Cloud took a step back out of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you do that without... materia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a curse I have and it is also a gift. That's why I know as Ryu of the Dark Fire Fist. They're here!\" Ryu said as his jump against the walls to get on to the roof. Cloud easly followed. Ryu started to yell at the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three will pay for what you did to my hometown!!! Now here the payment!!!\" he jumped up high above the girls heads. He put an outstreached arm behind him. The black flames covered his arm. He threw it at Yuffie. It hit her square in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! THAT REALLY BURNS!!!\" Yuffie said covering her face and accidental dropping Barret. (Luckly they didn't eat them yet.) Cloud rescued him and got back up on the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Spikehead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me Spikehead.\" he said automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's the new foo'\" Barret asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name's Ryu. He try to get vengence for his hometown of Corel.\" he said as Ryu began to taunt the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA! You're all powerful yet you use hosteges. That's weak and lame!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET IT!\" Tifa yelled at him. Ryu shot many black flame shots. Tifa blocked them with her glove then whacked him toward a building. He stopped from hitting the building and gracefully landed on top of it. He examined his glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These were favorite glasses, you son of a...\" He jumped to avoid one of Yuffie's shurukins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DARN. I MISSED.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you like sharp objects, huh. Well this one gonna hit. And it doesn't even need a money back guarentee.\" he said hitting Yuffie in the face with many B. flame shots. She took a couple steps back. Ryu drew a blood red sword. He grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scorching flames of hell. Grant me your power.\" he said as the sword became coveredin black flames. Tifa was going to punch him 20 miles away when in the blink of an eye he disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUH? WHERE'D HE DISAPPEAR TO?\" Tifa said. She saw him on the roof with Cloud. He rescued Cid, Red, Vincent, and Cait Sith. She count down with his fingers. 3... 2... 1... Suddenly Yuffie screamed in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YUFFIE WHA- OH MY GOD!\" Aeris said devistaed. There was a gash that went from the left side to the right side. THe heat from Ryu's blade sealed the wound just as fast as it cut open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop Ryu.\" Cloud ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense it too. I presanse inside them. I'll finish it. Stall them until I come back.\" He used the flames to propell him to give Yuffie a strong punch in the gut. THen Ryu jumped down her throat.</span></div></div>",

They decided to just give in. He was simply too powerful and dangerous. And they asked for forgiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. And you deserive to suffer just like the children, mothers, and other people that live there. Having hope for better lives!\" He said get angrier. \"The children had dreams, hope, some even wanted to help others. What gives you the decision to choose between their life or their death. And any and all orphens that had hope to  have a family one day!!! You can't consider yourselfs human. Killing children. Infants...too.\"He shook his head. When he was say all of that Aeris and Tifa were going to tears. They knew all that he said was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE'RE SORRY. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT GOT INTO US.\" Aeris said. Ryu shook his head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This goes against what i believe in but I'll forgive you. But I swear this happens again I will kill myself. HEY!!!\" Ryu said. Both Tifa and Aeris hugged him. \"AY quit it. You're going to tear a wing off!\" After that he got rid of the spores inside of them returning them back to size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ryu. Without you we could of been dead. You're a real lifesaver.\" Cloud said thanking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ay kid.\" Ryu quickly turn around backfisting Cid.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Don't call me a kid!!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to ask just what the hell are you?\" Cid said rubbing his right cheek.

I'm a half angel- half demon.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that explains the thing with the demonic and angelaic wings, right?\" Red XIII said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That about sums it up.\" he said turning around. And walking toward a spot that had sunlight on it. As soon as he stepped through it he disappeared.

This struck her with curiousity, as it was very uncommon to see mushrooms growing on this part of the island.<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose it doesn't hurt to try.\" Kairi said, plucking one of these mushrooms and taking a bite out of it. She immediately dropped it when she could feel its sour taste and then decided to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it started to hit her. Kairi clutched her stomach as it throbbed with pain. Little did she realize those mushrooms were causing her to grow in size as well. Eventually, the growing stopped at 100 feet tall, big enough for nearly the whole island to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKairi got up to view the island from her new perspective. As soon as she gasped in amazement, her stomach growled once again.<br>\r\n\"Oh... why is my stomach growling? I know I had breakfest a short while ago.\" Kairi said. She had to find something to eat right away, but what? Kairi peeked up to the sky and saw something... something familiar between herself, Sora, and some other friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe portal?</span></div></div>",

What had started this love of vore?  Even Jerome didn't exactly know where this vore fetish began for him.  All he did know was that he wished he could be in vore stories, being devoured by a cute girl.  It wouldn't matter if he got digested either, he would be a part of a girl forever.  Now, his greatest passion (other than vore) was Video games.  Jerome was extremely good at video games.  He loved the DOA games and imagined a vore story involving the hot chicks of DOA.  Jerome really  liked the American Tina Armstrong, who was probably THE hottest girl in the game.  Some people would disargee with Jerome, but he didn't care.  <br>\r\n      Jerome was a 25-year-old with fair skin and black-brownish hair.  His eyes were light brown and his hair was wavy. <br>\r\n       Jerome worked for a computer company called  \"Shattered Illusions\" , that made virtual reality games.  Shattered Illusions promised to have the most realistic virtual reality games around.  Jerome was a programmer, and had made several attempts of making a virtual reality version of DOA.  The problem was that the women was much taller than he was.  Jerome tried to fix the problem, but to no avail.  The program ran okay...it was just the girls were 100 feet tall.  He did manage to shrink the girls down to normal height, all except Tina Armstrong.  <br>\r\n    Today, he was programming the VR version of DOA  for vore infomation.  Since he couldn't experience vore in real life, he decided to try it out on virtual reality.  <br>\r\n      Something went wrong.  A lightning bolt had struck the building that housed Shattered Illusion's computers.  Jerome watched in horror as his computer he was working on suddenly exploded.   Jerome gasped when he saw what had happened.  He had been in VR, talking to the giant Tina about vore and what it meant.  The virtual reality Tina was actually quite smart, although Jerome didn't knew how smart. Tina Armstrong was standing in front of the ruined computer, wearing a bikini  from \"DOA Xtreme Beach Volleyball\" <br>\r\n        Tina was looking stright at Jerome with a smile.  <br>\r\n        \"So, you want to experience vore?\" asked Tina, as she began to grow.  Jerome made a yelp and ran out of the building as fast as he would go. </span></div></div>",

Knuckles could only watch as the Chaos Emeralds began resonating, dark storm clouds formed as the energy grew. Then an opening came from out of thin air appeared, then a silloette of a group of Echidna's walked out. All uniformed, they marched in two lines until to knukles fear, walked in Lein-Da. She looked down at him, \"Well isn't this a suprise, I've been waiting to see you again Knukles.\" She walked closer to the now quivering echidna, nelt by his head and whispered,\" And I have some fun planned for just you and I, and I won't dissapoint.\"<br>\r\n       Knuckles had no idea what she had in store for him, but he knew two things: one, she found an even more elaborate way to kill him, and two she was going to kill him slowly and painfully, for she enjoyed watching her victims suffer as he already knew from their last encounter. She took out a small bottle of blue fluid from between her breasts, all the soldiers gasped and shake in fear. She looked at the bottle and then at Knuckles. <br>\r\n      \"Wh...What are you going to do with that?\" gasped Knuckles. She opened the bottle and drank the liquid and finally threw the bottle on the ground, breaking it to peices. \"That was a growth stimulator, I'm sure you know what that means...\" </span></div></div>",

That's one of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf: I see that guy!  What's the plan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth climbed up her hair and crawled into her left ear, telling her the plan just in front of her ear hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth: Here's the plan: You will sneak behind the house and wait there.  I will lead all of them out of there and when the boys and I get out of there, crush the house into pieces!  Eventually, they'll panic and run around in fear or just freeze there terrified.  Either way, they're your meal that I prepared for you!  Are you ready?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf: I'm hungry, so yeah I'm ready!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snuck behind the house and stood there, watching him run into the house.  Her stomach growled more violently, causing Blue to get knocked rapidly from side to side in her hungry stomach.  Meanwhile, Seth taunted them with teasing signals, causing the whole gang to chase after him and outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf: Hi, boys!  (She stomps on the house and crushes it)  So, you're the boys that made trouble to Seth, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trouble makers looked up at the giantess, causing them to freeze in fear and letting Seth get away in the process.  She crouched on her legs and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrouble Makers: No!  Please!  We didn't mean to make trouble to Seth!  Making trouble's our thing!  Yeah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf: That's enough!

I have so much to live for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf: You'll be living a lot of time...in my gut!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf puts him on her tongue and played with him in her mouth.  The trouble maker was being knocked from one side of the mouth to the other rapidly as her tongue was doing her work.  She played and played with him until her stomach growled again, leading her tongue to throw him down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrouble Maker 2: (Muffling in Leaf's esophagus) No, Seth's grilfriend!

The ammonia smell was going down his throat, disabling his voice box.  He wanted to exit the body through the urethra, but the pee was too lethal for his body.  So, he had to climb up to the girl's colon and through the pile of shit.  In the middle of the colon, there laid a small hole that held the \"ganglion\" thing.  He approached it slowly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Outside Leaf]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf and Seth were already in front of Mt. Moon, looking at it closely to cherish its view from high above.  Shortly after wards, a force was churning her intestines.  She put both of her hands onto her tummy, gripping her tank top at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf: Uh...Seth, I need to...take a dump!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth: Take a dump?  Where can we?  There's no giant toilet in this world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf was thinking about something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf: Ah ha!  I know!  I'll probably hate myself for doing this, but I have to if I need to let out my turd!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth jumped into Leaf's tank top and hid inside her bra, being aroused by her nipples on her huge breasts.  She stomped on Mt. Moon to make a hole for her delivery to be shipped.  She lifted up her mini skirt to her bra and crouched deep inside the hole...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Leaf's Large Intestines]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue gave Leaf's \"ganglion\" thing a long tickle to get her to take a crap.  After exiting that cramped hole, the pile of shit grabbed him and kept him in the pile.  He struggled his head out and saw the beam of light, coming out of that hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue: Finally that bitch can take a crap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes and once he and the shit reached to that hole, his head was taken back into the shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Outside Leaf]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf's grips tightened in her hands, gripping tightly on her knees.  Her delivery was falling into the cave, dropping on the poor Geodudes and Clefairies.  Her enormously-sized butt was unleashing a large portion of gas and wet poop, startling the Zubats to fly around, panicking.  Some of them flew away while some of them flew underneath her.  Some of them gripped onto the perinea part of her labia while others crashed into her hairless and beautiful labia.  She was struggling to let out the hounds so hard that her pee was shot down to the cave at fast speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth, still inside the bra, heard the struggling from Leaf's mouth.  He felt as though he needed to do something to make her feel better, until he remembered that he had a Blastoise that knows Hydro Pump.  He squeezed through the bottom of her bra and slid down the inside of her tank top.  He fell past her clitoris and down to the cave's ground, where most of her shit was flooding the room.  Blastoise used Hydro Pump to wash off the remains of shit on her butt.  After her butt was shiny clean, she let out one last fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf stood up and pulled down her mini skirt, then turned around to see who was washing her butt.  Her face had let out a smile when she saw Seth with a Blastoise.  Blastoise was retrieved back to the Pokeball and Seth was grabbed by Leaf's hand, where she gives him a kiss.  She went on forward with Seth on her shoulder and headed for Cerulean City.</span></div></div>",

She hasn't found any worthy humans to suck blood out of for quite some time, and as any vampiress will tell you, blood is needed to survive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly got up and walked into her potion room, where she stared at her gallery of special (and mostly deadly) potions. One potion caught her eye as she stared at it for a short time. She then took it off the counter.<br>\r\n\"I'll never forget this potion for as long as I live. It only seems like yesterday.\" Morrigan said. She then thought back to that very same day. The day she grew to goddess size and completely obliterated an entire city through any means possible. The power was incredible that day, thinking she could destroy an entire city that easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she advanced to another city, her good sister, Lilith, interfered by stealing the potion's effects from her body, making her the goddess now. The tiny humans of the destroyed city thought they had killed her for her troubles, but it wasn't easy killing a Darkstalker, that's for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Morrigan flashed back to reality. She needed human blood and fast... and what better way to get that blood than to devour several humans at the same time? Morrigan let out a small laugh.<br>\r\n\"It's time that goddess Morrigan returned to what she did best.\" she said. She immediately drank the entire contents of the potion bottle. Once it was gone, she threw the bottle down onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened. Morrigan could already feel the power going through her body. The ceiling to the room was closing in fast, and Morrigan found no shame in breaking through her own castle once again. The growth was happening fast, and it was only a matter of a couple minutes before Morrigan reached her full height of 500 feet tall once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan looked down at her castle, with the hole in the ceiling made from her growing body as she stood in it. She then had to laugh.<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHA!!! Now the world will tremble before me once again! Once again, nothing can stop me!\" Morrigan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took her first steps away from her castle, she began to think of where she could go. The very same city she destroyed several months ago, or an entirely different city.</span></div></div>",

She brought her socks up to her nose and took a big whiff.  She loved the smell of her own feet.  She wanted the little people to experience firsthand how powerful and sexy her stinky feet were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe treaded gracefully through the street, making sure to step on as many people as possible with her lovely giant bare feet.<br>\r\nMorrigan spotted an elementary school nearby and advanced on it. She smiled and pressed her smelly toes against a first story window and smashed through it. Her entire foot entered the classroom delightfully. She felt the children touching the bottom of her reeking bare foot and giggled when they began to run. Morrigan slowly lowered her massive bare foot, trapping them and cruelly crushing them to death. She smiled as their bodies popped and spread warmly all over her sweaty wrinkled bare sole and she wiggled her toes. This caused great chaos in the school and children of all ages began to flee out the front door. Morrigan\u2019s stinky bare feet had their way with them. The children met their demise painfully and slowly as Morrigan\u2019s giant smelly bare toes came down upon them, mashing their worthless little bodies into the pavement. Morrigan placed her hand inside the building, seized a handful of children, and lifted them up to her face. \u201cMMM, you all look mighty tasty. I believe I am going to eat you all, and there isn\u2019t much you can do about it now is there?\u201d The children screamed in gut wrenching terror as Morrigan raised her hand to her mouth, lifted her head and dropped the screaming children into her mouth. She closed her mouth and listened to them squeal. She loved having this power and slowly began to chew. Slowly and cruelly she grinded them between her teeth. It made her beautiful stinky toes wiggle she loved it so much. She swallowed them and exclaimed, \u201cWow, human beings sure are tasty to a goddess, I think I\u2019ll have a feast\u201d. Morrigan ripped the roof of the building and plucked scores of children from the structure. She devoured them wholeheartedly and they tasted wonderful. After she had her fill there were still about a dozen or so, children left. Morrigan got an idea that made her bare toes tingle. She plucked out four children and placed one in between each of her long lovely toes. Morrigan raised them in the air and said, \u201cHow do my sexy sweaty toes smell? Do you like being near my toes? Aren\u2019t my toes beautiful?\u201d and she slowly began to curl them. She giggled as the third graders screamed bloody murder and their bodies began to compress. And my goodness did Morrigan\u2019s bare foot stink! Morrigan waited until she felt some of the children\u2019s bones break and then spread her toes, leaving them alive and suffering. \u201cNow that wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d She began to curl them again, laughing and getting a bit turned on by the power that her sexy stinky bare foot had over these worthless mortals. Looking up at her beautiful toes, she got very sexually aroused. She got moist looking at how powerful her feet were and her nipples hardened. Morrigan curled her lovely toes even more until her victims popped like grapes. The children\u2019s blood dribbled down her lovely wrinkled sole and she giggled at the tickling sensation. Morrigan smiled as she realized this was another opportunity to suck on her toes. Thus, Morrigan took her stinking bare toes into her mouth gracefully. She loved sucking on her own toes. They were so sweaty and sexy. Morrigan also licked the blood from her bare sole. The blood and her sweaty sole were delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she...</span></div></div>",

He spent the rest of his life on the streets begging for money, robbing people's houses, getting into bar fights, and doing odd-jobs for beer money...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 years of this life caused Ray to become very depressed and suicidal.

It would be so nice to weild a glowing saber like Zero's at sigma and his mavericks. Just so I can give them all a piece of my own mind! But sadly im only a spotter for the hunters. Im not even built to fight.\" Alia said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"is that so? You should be proud of who you are alia./ You've helped alot of Maverick hunters during many many dangerous missions you know, including X Zero and Axel. Without you im sure alot of our friends wouldnt be here.\" Iris said ((ignoring her death in X4, now working as a spotter))<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks my former repliforce friend. But I just want to experience a little action sometime in my life! Not just be stuck here all day long! Anyways, Im going to check the messhall and see if theres anything left before we check in on the current mission status.\" alia then leaves for a little moment then comes back with some things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"great they really wiped it out! All I could find was this sandwich and can of E-juice. looks like we will have to split it up.\" Alia said. Both reploids split the sandwich and finish it off rather quickly then proceed to drink the juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vile. This doesnt taste at all like E-Juice.\" Iris slid the can over to Alia. Alia grabbed the can and took one drink before coming to an agreement with Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it does taste awful. It must of expired. Alia said then quickly threw the can in the waste bin nearby. just then both reploids could feel a strange energy going thru there bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"alia....something is very wrong right now!\" Iris cried out as both their bodys started to surge with a strange electricity1! Before they knew it they shot straight thru the ceiling of the building. It happened so fast that they didnt even know they were growing! and they didnt stop til they were hundreds of feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh....what happened?...Zero isnt going to like this..\" iris looked down noticing the destruction they have just caused to the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well....looks like we've grown. Probably had something to do with that foul tasting beverage we just had.\" alia said then stepped out of the damaged base and onto a bunch of trees smashing them in the progress. At the same time her mechanical stomach growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"we will worry about this little dilemma later. right now im just hungry and need to eat something.\" Alia then..</span></div></div>",

She was oogling over the young warrior, his muscular body, his fit form, \"Ohhhhh he's going to taste great...\" Tira said, licking her lips again.  She then hopped over a pile of debree and stood before Kilik, who was now in mild shock.  \"You!\"  Kilik announce, pointing his staff at Tira.  \"Ohhh this is going to be fun!\" Tira said with her deranged enthusiasm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKilik charged, and thrusted his staff into Tira's stomach, dropping her to her knees while Kilik drove his staff to the ground and used it to catapult himself at Tira, drop kicking her, hurling her body several feet away.  \"Wooo!  Oh I knew you'd put up a fight!\" Tira said, even more excited than before.  She ran towards Kilik who swung his staff at her again, but she ducks down in time and slices Kilik in the thigh with her full circle moon blade, splattering Kilik's blood to the floor while he dropped to one knee, wincing in pain.  Tira laughed and followed up by a round house kick, dropping Kilik all together.  But the young warrior knew how dangerous it was to stay down against a psychotic girl like Tira, as he immediately backflipped to his feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTira sprints towards Kilik and jump kicks him in the chest, forcing him to skid back several feet.  He swings his staff at Tira, nailing her across the shoulder, dropping her to her knees, and again in her belly in an almost stabbing motion.  She grunts in pain as she falls to her back.  Kilik runs towards her and slams his staff to the ground, but Tira rolls out of the way and hurls her blade into his staff, cutting it clean in half.  Kilik growls angrily and throws both pieces of his staff at Tira, as she deflects them, Kilik runs towards her, grapples her, forcing her to remove her blade, and tosses Tira to the ground, focusing a fighting stance towards her.  \"Just what do you want!?\" demanded Kilik.  Tira, bleeding from her lip, licks the blood and moans seductively.  \"Just you...\"<br>\r\n\"Why?!  Are you after the holy blade as well?\"<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh no no no, my master is already drawing near the blade.  He just requires more souls to keep going.  Souls like strong young boys like you,\" Tira says, laughing as if she had just been told a mildly funny joke.  She then held out her palm, revealing the jewel encrested into the palm of her black green glove as a bright blue light shined upon Kilik.  Suddenly his entire body shrank down to the size of a mini Buddha statue, literally no bigger than 9 inches tall.<br>\r\nTira approaches Kilik and picks up his tiny body, licking her lips again.  \"And I'll be delivering those souls.\"<br>\r\nKilik resisted, pounding on the fist clutching over his waist, proving to be useless as Tira opened her mouth and inserted the warrior head first into her mouth.  Kilik resisted, as he entered the mouth, he felt her throat pulling him deeper.  Tira's throat muscles clenched down on Kilik's body, pulling him deeper towards Tira's stomach.  He held onto the muscles, attempting to stay in her throat.  But Tira gulped hard, and forced the muscles to retract, causing Kilik to lose grounds of the muscles he was holding.  Suddenly he was pulled deeper and deeper down Tira's throat as she gulped again.  It was like trying to swallow a very large piece of meat.  But eventually she succeeded.  Kilik had fallen from Tira's esophagus all the way down to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Tira moaned happily as she rubbed her trim belly.  Not so much as a single bulge appeared, it was still as firm and trim as ever.  Kilik, now drowning in stomach acids from outside, pounded on Tira's stomach walls over and over.  Tira smiled, rubbing her belly when suddenly she stopped rubbing and felt a rush of air approach her throat.  Suddenly Tira opened her mouth and let out a loud *BRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPP!*  Tira took a breath, and laughed, patting her belly again.  \"Whew...excuse me *urp.*\"  Tira said.  She knew digestion was taking its' place.  Kilik's body would dissolve into her stomach, and his soul would be transferred into the jewel in her hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was one soul down, many more to go.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Surveying the shattered remains of what had once been the tower, Raine - still adjusting to her new height - deliberated over what she ought to do. She was a little confused; even frightened. What was it that a giantess should do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question was answered when a deep rumbling began to resonate in her gut, echoing across the continent. That was what she needed: food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo begin with, she was unsure where a giantess should go to grab a bite to eat. The old human food was hardly going to satisfy her churning giantess stomach. However, again, her questions were answered when a desire began to build up inside her, entirely outwith her control. She couldn't understand it at first, but she soon realised that her new body was telling her that she was to eat not human food, but human beings themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea why she suddenly felt this way, but the craving became so overwhelming that she had no choice but to give in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where to start?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was one question she could easily answer herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Genis\". That brat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith giant steps, she stomped off home, causing earthquakes with each step. When she reached her house, the townspeople all crowded round to get a glimpse of her. They were uniformly terrified. She became somewhat frightened herself. Sure, they couldn't do her much harm if they decided to attack her, but she didn't want to risk it. She didn't know how to get rid of them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then an idea flashed through her mind. A devilish grin spread across her face. She knew what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning right round, she began to lower her enormous ass towards the ground. Its curvaceous shadow spread across the town as she lowered it. Then, with an almighty thud, she squashed every villager flat with her enormous ass. Their screams of horror were silenced as they were utterly flattened. In order to make sure they were finished off, she shuffled a little, squishing them entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't over yet. Another devilish grin spread across her face as she realised what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tremendous, deep, juicy fart rumbled out from underneath her. Its volume was enormous; its tone deepened and richened by the fact that she was sitting as it happened. A final, blood-curdling scream could be heard from underneath her, but it was muffled. That last villager had been finished off by Raine's incredible fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaine laughed a full, hearty, womanly laugh. \"Well, ex-CUSE me!\" she cackled. \"It must have been something I ate\", she added, as an extra little fart squeezed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, little Genis' head poked out of the window of their house. He must have been awoken by Raine's earth-shattering fart. He was trembling with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raine...?\" he trembled. \"What... happened...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaine had no desire to stretch this out. \"My dear little brother,\" she said, \"I'm sorry, but... well, let's keep this short. I'm hungry, and I'm going to eat you. Is that quite alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, Raine grabbed ahold of her brother and chucked him into her gaping maw. She chomped him up, savouring the taste and not feeling particularly upset at all about the fact she was eating her only family. With a mighty gulp, she downed him into her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaahhh...\", she sighed blissfully, her hunger abating, \"that's better... but... ohhhhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pressure building in her stomach, but she relieved it with an almighty belch, which sent Genis' saliva-coated staff splattering out of her mouth. She giggled... \"ooohhh, looks like you gave me some pretty bad gas, Genis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed he had. Raine began belching, and she just couldn't stop. These belches were no dainty, ladylike burps, either; they were the real thing: juicy, chunky, deep, bassy, rumbling, meaty... \"and they just feel soooo good,\" Raine moaned with pleasure as she let out a particularly juicy one.</span></div></div>",

Link put on his zora tunic so her could breathe, but there was nothing he could do to fight the current. he was trapped in the intestine, and the only way to go was out. He decided to get through the endless labyrinth of Zelda's digestive track as quick as he could so her wouldn't be digested. After that... well, he'd plan that part out when it came. He put on the iron boots, making him so heavy that he passed through Zelda's belly twice as fast as he should have. He pushed the rest of Zelda's previous meals with him, doing a much better job than the pills had. Zelda suddenly began farting uncontrollably as all of her food was forced downwards towards her bottom. She rushed for the toilet and let loose an immense pile of poop. Link hid in the pile, his blue zora tunic now stained brown, and went unnoticed by Zelda. However, the water Zelda drank earlier suddenly erupted from her bladder and showered down on Link, and he was glad he still had on the zora tunic, which was now stained yellow.

Ruto's throat bulged as Link slid past her uvula and down towards her stomach. Link's hind-quarters slid into her bulging mouth, and it required several swallows to force Link down. <br>\r\n     Link head hit a wall, the sphincter that was the entrance to Ruto's stomach.

The fishy smell increased, and Ruto's stomach expanded to contain her meal. <br>\r\n     Outside Ruto's chefs could see their princess's mouth, then throat, then stomach bulge as the tasty looking morsel progressed.

It stretched to accomidate him, but the fit was still tight. Finally, his feet slid in and the esophagul sphincter closed tightly. Link was trapped, still bound, in the ravenous Ruto's belly. He felt her pat her stomach, and heard her sigh over the ever present sound of her heartbeat and the squelching sounds of the stomach adjusting to his presence.<br>\r\n     \"Zora stomachs are slower than human stomachs, Link.\" Ruto said towards her bulging belly. \"You'll take a while to digest.

The burning was intense, but he wasn't distracted enough to miss where her belly gases were going. The sphincter at the bottom of her belly kept opening, wider and more often then the one at the top, which he couldn't really reach anyways. Maybe I can escape by going down, he thought. He would end up down that tube sooner or later anyways, and the longer he waited, the more likely he wouldn't survive. <br>\r\nThe next time the bottom of the fishy belly opened to expell gas, Link wedged his head in. It closed around his neck, but his struggles forced it open again. Ruto could feel this. Even though it was causing more gas, she assumed he was finally done for and moving into her intestines like any meal. \"That hero is causing way too much indigestion. He won't be pleasant coming out.\" Ruto's bedroom had filled up with her fart smell.<br>\r\nLink had muscled his way into her small intestine. It was a tight fit around his body, but was more of a massage than a crushing pressure. There was also no stomach acid, an improvement in Link's mind. The muscles of Ruto's intestines were pushing Link forward, and Link began pushing with the flow. After a while, he came to another sphincter. The slimy walls helped lubricate Link as he pushed into her large intestine. <br>\r\nHe was immediatly hit by the foul smell of her feces, fishy musk, and salt.He had no choice though, and continued his trip. He pushed his way through the remaining poop and at last came to her rectum. <br>\r\nLink was surprised by how roomy the inside of her ass was, but didn't dwell on it. Just below him was Ruto's anus, his ticket to freedom.But Link didn't feel he could open it. Hopefully Ruto would need to poop soon. As if on cue, the feces Link had passed began to be pushed down to him. <br>\r\nOutside, Ruto had long ago stopped farting. She had gone back to sleep, pleasantly feeling Link navigate her bowels.

She strains though, and Link finally splashes into the toilet beneath her. He is smeared with her waste and reeks horribly of shit and fish. He then glances up in time to get hit in the face with a log of shit that Ruto forced out behind him. The princess of the Zora Domain let out a distinctly unprincess-likefart right in his face, then went back to releasing logs of shit. <br>\r\nAfter a bit more defecation (and dodging on Link's part) Ruto finished. She stood up and turned around, ready to wave goodbye to the remains of Link. But there he was, staring back up at her. \"You dirty human! No wonder you were so big coming out. You practically ripped my ass open,\" she accuses Link. Link shrugs while treading the dirty water. It's not his fault if he wanted to survive. <br>\r\n\"What am I going to do with you now?

Hmm...let me clean you off first.\" Ruto then calls for her attendants. \"Clean him up,\" she orders, as her attendants wrinkle their noses. <br>\r\n\"Princesses shouldn't play with their food,\" one of them remarks under her breath, but Ruto is deep in thought and doesn't hear. Link is lifted out of the massive toilet (probably built for King Zora...or for large, human sized piles of shit) and cleaned by the attendants. <br>\r\nWhen Link is finally smelling fresh again (and looking good enough to eat according to one of Ruto's attendants) He is escorted to Ruto's breakfast table. She looks up from her meal and smiles at Link. \"I've finally decided what I can do with you,\" she says. \"I can shrink you, making you a smaller meal, but easier to digest, and eat you again, or give you to one of the other to deal with.

The acid didn't burn his skin. It did, however, begin eating through the ropes securing his hands and feet.<br>\r\nLink began struggling again, snapping the weakened bonds. But he had no idea what to do next. The only ways out of the stomach were up and down, and both were sealed by tight muscles. Link would have tried to pry one of the sphincters open, but being swallowed had disoriented him and he didn't want to descend further into Ruto's belly if he could help it.<br>\r\nAll the struggling caused two side affects though. The first was that Ruto's belly began to churn, tossing the Hero of Time about. The second was to redirect Ruto's attention to the lad. Ruto patted her belly with a smirk. \"None of that now, Link. No human has ever escaped a Zora belly, and no matter how hard you struggle, you won't make me throw you up.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly, Princess Zelda warped into Zora Domain, right in front of Ruto. \"Ruto, have you seen Li... Whoah, I guess you have.\"<br>\r\n\"He was delicious too!\" said Ruto. \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n\"When we female sages decided to eat Link, I looked up a book that might help us. It gave me a shrinking spell, but I didn't read it all the way through. After he escaped, I went back to it. It turns out the Hero of Time can't be killed by the body of a Sage. In other words, we can't digest him.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, good, I like him in my belly,\" replied Ruto.<br>\r\n\"We all agreed to share him, and just because you caught him later, doesn't mean you can back out now. The rest of the girls and I want a turn.\"<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do? Zoras are stretchy, but I don't think I'm stretchy enough to pass him whole without hurting myself.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I could use the shrinking spell, with him in your stomach. Then you could pass him, wash him off, and hand him to the next Sage on the list,\" suggested Zelda.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, well that seems reasonable,\" said Ruto.<br>\r\nLink, inside her belly, could hear everything, albeit muffled.

She could feel still more gas inflating her intestines - Link had apparently not agreed very well with her bowels. Each subsequent belch stung with an even greater intensity than the last, and yet Ruto found that, strangely enough, the pain was beginning to arouse her. *BUUUUUUURP* As she let out another tremendous belch, she could feel her stomach yearning for more. *BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria and Zelda exchanged worried looks. \"Are you sure you're going to be okay?\" Saria queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto looked toward the girls. The juices within her massive belly splashed about noisily as her stomach let out an earth-shattering growl - not because of her indigestion, but rather her renewed appetite. Ruto smiled cutely, before proceeding to sprawl down on the ground, her bulging gut splayed out between her parted legs. \"Maybe not,\" she replied coyly. \"My tummy hurts really bad. Maybe if you could rub it for me it would help some of the gas come out.\" Her deep purple eyes shimmered sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru raised her eyebrow, throwing Zelda a questioning glance. The latter shrugged. \"Uh... sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some apprehension of the awkwardness of fondling the Zora princess's stomach, Zelda reluctantly stepped forward. She laid down by Ruto's side and began to hesitantly massage the fish-girl's troubled tummy. Ruto squirmed, slightly aroused, as she let a burst of gas slip from her other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it,\" came Nabooru's voice. \"Sorry girls, but this is just a bit too kinky for me,\" she said bluntly, indicating the pair of reclining giantesses. \"I'm off to gobble some Gerudo.\" She strode off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that just leaves the three of us, then,\" Ruto simpered. \"C'mon Saria, join the fun!\" Ruto giggled girlishly as she massaged her own massive breasts. She let out another fierce burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria smiled, kneeling down next to her two friends. \"Sure Ruto, just as long as you promise you'll feel better,\" she chimed cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto was certain she would feel better... once she had introduced the two of them to her stomach. But how? She was outnumbered two to one. Both Saria's and Zelda's hands caressed her gurgling tummy. Their soft circling rhythm was somehow turning her on. She felt her nipples begin to perk slightly and her pussy lips begin to moisten. She was suddenly struck with a brilliant idea. If only Saria and Zelda would swing that way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls...\" Ruto began somewhat timidly. \"What do you say we make this a little more fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would we do that?\" Saria asked, puzzled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking maybe something like this...\" Ruto took the forest-girl's hand and placed it between her own shimmering legs. Ruto felt a timid poke, which soon morphed into a confident stroking as Saria began to finger her. Zelda smiled roguishly, taking her hand off from Ruto's growling gut and beginning to strip down to her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had always hoped that something like this might happen,\" the Hylian princess blushed. \"Here Ruto,\" she giggled, unclipping her frilled bra and unleashing her massive breasts. \"Why don't you get a taste of these?\" She lowered her giantess boobs over Ruto's face. The fish princess began to suck on Zelda's nipples, slowly rubbing her tongue over the princess's sensitive skin. It was the perfect opportunity. Her stomach let out an enormous growl. She moaned in pleasure simultaneously as Saria's stimulation sent cum gushing forth from her cavernous pussy and in anticipation of the sexy woman about to enter her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to suck harder on Zelda's perky nipples. The princess began to blush as her panties became wet with arousal. And yet Ruto sucked still harder. The Zora's tongue was beginning to feel rough, and Zelda felt her breasts throbbing - no longer in ecstasy, but rather in pain. \"Ohhh, Ruto,\" Zelda gasped between mixed pangs of pain and orgasm, \"you're hurting me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria looked up in confusion, only to see the Zora girl tilt her head back and suck Zelda in chest-first. \"Ruto!!!\" She made a dive for Zelda's rapidly disappearing body, but came up short, only to observe her ample thighs sucked down into Ruto's monstrous belly. The Zora princess let out a satisfied belch as she orgasmed again. *BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURP* The pressure of Zelda's struggling body within her own elastic fishy gut only added to the pleasure, as she writhed in ecstasy. She gave up all control of her body to the intense orgasm, her moaning interspersed only with her monstrous belches and the juicy sound of the gases passing out from her tight anus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria stood up, looking down in horror at her engorged friend. She could see Zelda beating futilely at Ruto's tight stomach walls. \"Ruto! How--How could you!\" she sobbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto regained control of her body, beginning to feign guilt. \"Gee, Saria, I--I just don't know what came over me. No worries, though, I'll make sure you are with Zelda again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of confusion dawned on Saria's tear-streaked face. \"Wha--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto leaped up from the ground and grabbed Saria, pushing her down into her gullet. Her young friend's squirms only sent renewed shivers down her spine, as cum squirted forth once more from her giantess pussy. Within seconds, she could feel the girl within her bowels, beating on the solid walls of her distended belly. She let out one last satisfied belch and patted her massive tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. That was tasty,\" she sighed. \"But what to do now?\"</span></div></div>",

She giggled gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, she remained on her back on the grass until evening set in. It was not long after the first stars appeared in the sky that Nabooru returned from her journey. Assuming that Zelda and Saria had wandered off for a while, Nabooru sat herself down next to the massive Princess Ruto. Lying back, she let loose a chunky belch and followed this with a hearty, womanly laugh. \"I've been at Gerudo Valley,\" she explained, \"they didn't put up much of a fight. I ate some of them alive; the rest I fried and ate with fried onion rings.\" There was a rumble in her gut, and for a moment her face looked pained. But she relieved herself by letting loose a raunchy onion belch. \"'Scuse me,\" she cackled, and she laughed even more when Ruto's nose wrinkled at the smell of onions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Ruto,\" she cackled, \"the onion rings gave me serious gas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto laughed, before responding with a belch of her own. Nabooru smiled. \"Wanting a contest, huh?\" She paused and looked around. \"Where are Zelda and Saria? I'm sure they'd like to join in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto smiled devilishly, but remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru laughed. \"Haha. What is it? What are they up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto gave no answer. Just continued smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well,\" Nabooru smiled, \"wherever they are, they'll probably be back soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay back and stared up into the night sky. \"It's getting pretty dark,\" she observed. \"I think I might get a little shut-eye for now\". Laying a hand on her huge, gurgling belly, she added \"Give them some time to digest and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she drifted off into slumber next to Ruto, and she dreamed peacefully for half the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was not long before something interrupted her peaceful. Something dreadful, something monumentally awful...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBBBBBUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPPPPP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up in an instant to see Ruto's face in front of hers; Ruto's playful grin. \"Ruto...?\" she began; slightly panicked. She began to wince when the rancid stench from Ruto's belch invaded her nostrils. \"Ruto? What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Nabooru,\" she smiled, almost kindly. \"I just wanted to tell you that I know where Zelda and Saria are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru was slightly puzzled, and Ruto's breath was awful. \"Oh! Um... okay. Where are they, Ruto? Are they... are they back yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Ruto smiled, \"they're certainly somewhere comfortable...\" That devilish grin of hers began to spread slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was now dawning on Nabooru, but she simply couldn't believe it. \"No, Ruto... No!\" She began to panic and tremble. \"No! Ruto! You didn't! You didn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto was still grinning. \"Don't worry, Nabooru. I'll let you see them. I'll let you see them right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, RUTO! NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late. Ruto had already crammed Nabooru's head into her mouth, and was working her way down. Nabooru's blood-curdling screams of terror became more and more muffled as she went deeper and deeper inside the Zora Princess's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, only Nabooru's legs were left, dangling limply out of Zora's mouth like two strings of spaghetti. In one big slurp, Ruto slurped them up, and then she downed everything in one big gulp. For a second, her stomach began to cramp and a look of pain spread across her face, but it was not long before she got the relief she was looking for. And it came in the form of a deep, bassy, rumbling belch, which echoed through the forest and through all Hyrule. The earth itself trembled, and flocks of birds took flight to escape the mighty belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Ruto sat back down once again on the wet grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another rumble in her stomach, and she silenced it with another brutally juicy belch, which sent a couple of locks of Nabooru's hair out of her open mouth. \"Oooooh...\" she sighed with relief, \"well, ex-CUSE me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she listened to the gurgling of her stomach. It wasn't long before Saria, Zelda and Nabooru would be totally digested. </span></div></div>",

He tried and tried to find a foothold, everything was to smooth and slippery.<br>\r\n       Then he felt the tight squeeze around his feet lossening which was a releif at first, then he realized the was about to enter the stomach. And when he fell in he....    </span></div></div>",

The energy feild activated, he saw a blue,staticy bubble surround him, giving off a little light as well as keeping the acid out. However, somethings are not to be seen, and what he saw would be a final testament to that, he saw parts of Peppy and Falco, oozing red and white which would have to be their flesh and bones digesting, Fox held in his vomit, that was until he saw Slippy who was still alive! Choking and gaging as blood flowed from his mouth, and his torso partially digested.  And to Fox's terror he could hear him grutally strain,\"Kill me.Kill me\" until he sank deeper into the acid with blood clouding the top. <br>\r\n     Fox was seeing first hand the terrors of Hell. Then he heard Kystal,\"It's no use hiding in your sheild, you are only delaying the inevitable, it's over Fox, trust me and let go.\" Fox looked at the meter, only five minutes left until it will evenually burn out, and he would die.\" <br>\r\n      Fox sat at the bottom of the sheild bubble, losing his will to live just as the sheild was losing power. He finally decided to fall asleep, finding a siutable way to die as the stomach's contractons and expansions soothe him hike a lullaby.</span></div></div>",

Should Fox's sheild be able to make the journey out. You know and I know that It's senseless to leave a story in a cliff hanger, so lets kick it up a notch and see what happens.<br>\r\n       So I leave you all saying good luck and most importantly have fun!  </span></div></div>",
