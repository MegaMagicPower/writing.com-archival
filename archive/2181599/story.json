The laughter came from the golden, shining royal throne, upon which was perched a triumphant Sweetie, who wore the coveted and elaborately decorated Barkingburg Royal Crown! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAhahahaha-<i>snort</i>!!!\" She laughed once again, elated in her victory. \"I've done it, I've finally done it for real, Busby!\" She declared to her robotic squeaky frog toy, who had been her most faithful underling...mostly due to him being programmed that way. \"I'm finally the Queen, just like I've always deserved to be!\" She went on, \"And the best part of all is now NO ONE can stop me! Now that the old Princess and Duke and everyone else who used to hold me back are banished! Not to mention that annoying <i>Paw Patrol</i>,\" she said, sneering at just the thought of them, but grinning yet again when she remembered \"They can't take anything back from me either, Now that they're forbidden by <i><b>my</b></i> law to even enter the country!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie jumped up and down in glee, laughing loudly, before settling back down with a smug smile. \"Now, for the first order of royal business...\" She said, biting Busby's head. Immediately, the frog toy's eyes lit up, and it sent out a signal like a remote control. Several large, more metallic, definitely more evil looking versions of Busby came out into the grand hall, along with a few nervous members of the castle's staff who Sweetie had decided weren't enough of a threat to get rid of. They all looked up to their new tyrannical dog-Queen, awaiting her command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you lot! Robo-servants, real-servants, each of you!\" Sweetie shouted, \"From now on, no more dog food- not ever! No kibble, no canned, no rawhide, no nothing! Do you get it?\" All the humans nodded, mumbling in agreement, while the robots stood still- they didn't have to agree out loud, she already knew they'd obey her. Sweetie's eyes lit up, a grin spread across her face as she declared triumphantly, \"Good! Now, I want hamburgers!!! Loads of 'em! And keep them coming, even after lunchtime is over!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie didn't have to wait long, as all the servants ran off to fulfill her request. Soon, they would return, carrying plates and platters and dishes of all sorts laden with her favorite food. One servant held a silver platter piled high with hamburgers. She licked her lips, eyes wide,  drooling at the smell of the greasy meat patties for a moment, before opening wide and digging in. Sweetie buried her face in the pile of burgers, scarfing them down with big greedy bites, being as messy as she wanted. By the time she was hungrily lapping off all the sauce and grease left on the platter, her muzzle had ketchup, melted cheese, crumbs, and grease splattered across it. She smugly looked up, letting loose a loud, rude burp right in the servant's face, causing them to cover their nose and run away. Sweetie's stomach had gotten filled up a lot by those burgers. As she sat on her haunches with her forelegs down on the throne, it bulged out, touching the seat of the throne as well as the backs of her forelegs. Next, a robo-servant came up, offering her two platters with neat piles of Hamburgers. She devoured them just as furiously and greedily as the first, using her paws to sweep in armfuls of burgers at a time to her greedy maw, if something didn't fit into her mouth she'd just keep pushing it in, not caring if it got squished or crushed, just continuing to chew and swallow whatever was currently in there until she made enough room to cram the next one in, Though she was gorging so fast she barely chewed at all before gulping it down. Halfway through her binge, there was a tearing sound. <i>Shhhrrrrip</i>- as her burgeoning stomach tore through the front of her black suit with glowing pink lines. She didn't care, though, just eating and eating until both huge platters were empty. Her belly was so big, white fur spilling out from the tear in her suit like a little avalanche, that she couldn't put her front paws on the ground when she sat, as it pushed out past her forelegs enough to lift them a little bit, forcing her to rest her paws on its surface, as she had to spread her hind legs further apart to make room for it. Her butt had gotten bigger too, humble haunches blowing up into twin bulbous, fatty globes, her rotund rear straining against her tight suit, which conformed to and highlighted its new shapely and sizable nature. Sweetie's face was somehow even messier than before, covered in scraps and stains of leftover hamburger, some of which had actually gotten on her chest, arms, and especially her paws because of the way she ate them by simply shoving her front into a big pile. Sweetie threw back her head, unleashing a loud, rude, triumphant burp which made a few droplets of spittle and grease fly up like a sprinkler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More! More! More!!!\" Sweetie yelled, maniacally, as five whole platters of hamburgers were held up to her by a robo-servant and three trembling humans. She grinned, laughing yet again before digging in. \"HAHAHAHAHA-<i>snort</i>!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Here's another link to what Sweetie looks like)<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/r1uPopb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/r1uPopb.jpg</a></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the day went by, Sweetie absolutely refused to stop gorging her brains out for even a minute. Servants lined up, presenting her with platter after platter of decadent high calorie unhealthy hamburgers, which she greedily mowed through in minutes, never asking for any other kind of food, not even stopping to drink- barely stopping to take breaths- as her body expanded at a downright alarming rate, from her surging sloshy overstuffed belly to her increasingly voluminous bulbous and bouncy butt. From the chubby chipmunk cheeks on her increasingly round, greedy, messy face to her over sized bubbly and soft toes, being squished up against by her own paw fat. And yet, as she grew and grew, more and more, bigger and bigger and bigger, Sweetie didn't stop eating for more than a few seconds to rudely burp, take a quick breath, or demand more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was quite a shock when a servant who currently had Sweetie's fattened, pinched up, greedy little face buried in her platter of hamburgers, heard the furious and intense chomping, slurping, gulping, and glutting sounds of her ravenous feeding slow, picking up a bit again- before lulling to a steady stop, as the pile of burgers was only about three quarters eaten. He blinked, as did the few other exhausted human servants, who each had their own platter of hamburgers for the monstrously fat villainess who was their queen, now fallen mysteriously silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...Queen Sweetie?\" The servant said. After a moment of no response, he nervously repeated again, \"Sweetie, your majesty? Are you alright?\" He asked. Again, no response. He took a careful step back, afraid Sweetie might yell at him for taking away her precious favorite food, to get a better look at his ruler in all her greedy glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing on the throne was barely recognizable as a dog. Sweetie had become fully immersed in her own white furred flab, and she appeared similar to a big beanbag chair sized sack of dough. Her body overflowed the seat of the throne, pouring off of it on all sides, squished up against the backrest as she bubbled through and around the armrests, engulfing them in herself. She could be described as a pile of several bulbous rolls with pudgy paws sunken into them at points, dangling uselessly, along with a messy, sunken face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie's belly had grown out so far it sagged past the cushion on the throne, and was wide enough to obscure both corners from the front. It had been bisected into two large plush fat rolls, the fold along her naval carrying up and melding into her love handles. Sweetie's legs were all fully spread out, resting on their own sacks of doughy flab like big luxurious pillows. She bulged out over the top of the armrests on both sides of the chair, fat also oozing out from the spaces under the armrests. That combined with the way her utterly gigantic beautifully round and bouncy but still soft and tender juicy plush massive rump was crammed up against the backboard of the chair, easily wider than it and spilling out the back, fat wrapping around and engulfing it as the top of her big fat butt crested almost as high as her crown, visible rising up like twin hills above her submerged head and rolls of back fat. Her face was hard to make out at first, as it was squished between cheeks so big and squishy and overstuffed that they rested on her arm fat and crested high enough above her head to pinch her crown into place, as her back fat being pushed upwards by the unholy size of her butt was smothering the crown like oozing lava. Her face also bulges out into a big hefty triple chin, the first two squished between her cheeks and the third resting on her fatty voluptuous overgrown soft and doughy chest fat. Sweetie's stomach, chest, and chins were so fat they forced her to look upwards a bit. She'd almost completely torn apart her black suit, outgrowing it to such a degree that only a few stray scraps around her arms, chest, and back desperately clung together as white furry flab poured out from between them. Also, because of her furious and ravenous method of devouring the burgers, her entire face was covered in messy stains. Ketchup, crumbs, meat juice, melted cheese, and lots of grease caked her snout and splattered out, covering most of her first two chins as well as her inner cheeks- which were so big and chubby that they wrapped up around about the same length forwards as her muzzle, but probably a bit more. The stains also went up to her forehead, simply because of how deep she would bury her face into the food piles as she ate, the mosaic of messy red, brown, and orange splotches caking her face like a mud mask. As the servant took a look at Sweetie's colossal form, he noticed that her little eyes, smothered by her cheeks- a stark contrast to how huge the rest of her had become, were closed, stains all over her eyelids. To his shock, Sweetie's mouth- which had been clutching a half eaten hamburger, fell open- the bun and patty tumbling down the slope of her fatty belly and splatting on the floor, as the chewed up part she hadn't swallowed yet joined the menagerie of stains on her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no- oh no! It happened!\" He cried in a panic. Another servant stepped forwards, holding a full platter she was going to give Sweetie after the first. \"What? What happened?\" She asked, worriedly. \"I've killed her! All this unhealthy junk food- she ate herself to death but I'm the one who fed her the killing burger! Oh no- I'll be thrown in prison!\" He cried. Astonished and horrified, the servants all crowded around to get a look at the messy doughy blob, to see if it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not dead you idiot- look!\" Another man said, pointing to the behemoth pup. Sure enough, the overstuffed mound of bulging saggy rolls and folds was gurgling lightly, heaving with slow, drawn out, labored- but relaxed sounding- gutteral huffs, wheezes, and snorts. \"She's breathing- see?\" The servant who had been feeding her sighed in relief, \"Oh thank goodness- I was so worried I'd really messed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But- what are we going to do now?\" A servant asked, looking to her companions. One man with a big mustache rubbed his chin in thought, looking around. \"Well, let's see- who do we have here?\" He asked, looking at the other servants. \"Hmm...we have five of us human workers, and it looks like...Eleven of her robo-servants\" He said, looking up at one of the ominous frog robots, which were taller and stronger than all the humans there. \"Well...if She's fallen asleep, I guess we have to bring Queen Sweetie to bed.\" The other servants all groaned, dreading the thought of trying to lug that insanely overweight soft and squishy fat sack anywhere. \"Why don't we make the robots do it? They're stronger than us anyway.\" A man recommended. \"Not possible- Only Sweetie can control them. And since she's asleep, they haven't got any orders to follow. Look at them, just standing there.\" A man shuddered at the gleaming, silver titan with glowing pink eyes. \"Ugh. It gives me the creeps.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at any rate, it looks like we are going to have to carry her to the royal bedroom ourselves.\" A man pointed out. \"Now let's stop whining about it- there are five of us after all. Everyone grab as much of her as you can, and try to get her unstuck from that throne. I'll bet since she passed out from all those burgers, she'll be in a pretty heavy sleep for a while, so we don't have to worry too much about being gentle.
