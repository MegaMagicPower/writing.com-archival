To think in about 8 hours we will be in paradise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Emily were super excited to be on vacation. You had never been on vacation and knew that the possibilities were endless. You and Emily had been dating for a few years and thought it was time to go explore the world. Emily was a 5\u2019 3\u201d blonde with a perfect body. A busty chest, wide hips, and her hair was down to her mid back. She has a cute face with a small nose, beautiful eyes, and a smile that could light up your world. You were so excited to finally be on vacation with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 2 hours you and Emily got to the airport and were boarding the plane. The intercom came on and said, \u201cThank you for flying with BigSky flights, we are looking like we will have a great flight today and in 5 hours we should arrive at </span></div></div>",

It seemed straight forward and sounded fun. Once you and Emily arrived to the show to get tickets a man was going by talking on his cellphone. He stopped and looked at Emily and I. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey can I call you right back? Okay. Bye,\u201d he said while hanging up his phone, \u201cHey guys thanks for coming to the show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you are? I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry, I\u2019m the magicians manager. Is this your guys first time to our show?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, this is our first time in Las Vegas,\u201d Emily blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really? Well how would you like to be apart of the show? It\u2019s really quite easy. You just sit on a chair in this box, we cover it up and then you \u201cdisappear\u201d to the audience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d Emily says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome,\u201d he said. \u201cHey, let these two in for free, they are coming with me,\u201d he said to the ticket seller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, enjoy the show,\u201d the ticket seller said while smiling a bit weirdly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you and Emily got back stage you saw the stage getting set up and then the main magician and his sidekick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Joshua and Brittany. They are the magicians.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua, had short brown hair, blue eyes, wasn\u2019t super muscular, but overall was a good looking guy, he came up and looked Emily up and down. Then Brittany, blonde hair, a bit larger, wide hips, stunning eyes, and a confident smile eyed me up and down and winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect. She will do just fine,\u201d Joshua said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused as to what they meant you and Emily waited for further instruction. Pretty soon you heard the show start up. People were clapping, they had quite an audience. Not understanding how the trick was to be done you watched from the sides. That\u2019s when they called Emily out onto the stage. Emily walked out and sat inside the box. After a while, Joshua covered up the box with a large dark sheet. Once this happened, a beam of light struck you. Rubbing your eyes you looked around. You were 1 inch tall, tiny, and you turned to see Brittany smiling at you, \u201ccome here little one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried for Emily you saw a small hint of a light flash in the box. They must\u2019ve shrunk Emily. Not freaking out you asked if they were going to switch out Emily and you for the show act. Not saying a word Brittany ignored you. After about 1 minute they showed the box empty. Finally, after another 20 minutes the show was ended. Once everyone left you saw Joshua go in the box, bend down and pick something up. It had to be Emily. That\u2019s when the manager met up with them. \u201cAight Joshua and Brittany, great show. It went perfect as it always does. You know what to do from here.\u201d</span></div></div>",

At the same time you and Emily see each other dropped into their mouths. Landing in Brittany\u2019s saliva, her tongue kept pushing your around as your were sucked on. That\u2019s when they opened their mouths to show me and Emily each other\u2019s predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany mumbled, \u201cReady to watch her disappear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was screaming and Joshua then said, \u201cOh she will come back, just out a different way. Hahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you watched as his tongue moved Emily towards the back of his throat. And as soon as he dropped his tongue showing his throat, Emily slipped down. That\u2019s when Brittany leaned her head back, shut he mouth, and you were swallowed whole. Inside her stomach it was moist, stinky, and stung your eyes. You tried pounding on the walls of her stomach only to get her stomach mucus barely on you. It was hours later that her body processed you and she shit you out before her next show. You never knew how Emily\u2019s experience went, but you couldn\u2019t imagine it was too different. </span></div></div>",
