One in a white suit with a red tie, with black skin, scans the area, His Uzi swinging about. A noticable bandage is around his leg. \"No zombies so far, looking good.\" Another figure, wearing a biker jacket, reels in a fishing rod, with a rather large fish on the line. \"Ah, shut up louis. You KNOW there are going to be zombies on the island.\" He takes it off, tossing it to the last figure, with long, brown hair that goes down to the neckline of her red jacket, with white stripes on the side. She catches it, putting it in a jar. \"Shut up francis. Zombies can't swim, and on the island we're headed to, there isn't any known hotel or town.\" \"Yeah, you tell him zoey.\" Louis says, smirking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up. Hey, there's something on the horizon...\" He looks and sees...</span></div></div>",

LAND, HO!\" <br>\r\nLouis said \"Told you francis.\" Zoey smiled. <i>Finally...</i> she thought. <i>This is what bill died for. He died so we... So i....could escape. So that we didn't have to fight one more zombie. Now it's just a matter of survival.</i> She stepped into the kitchen, stockpiled with food, and began to clean the fish that francis caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boat landed on the coast of the island, and louis and francis stepped out, francis wielding his shotgun, louis aiming his Uzi at the treeline. Not one zombies stepped out. Zoey cried out from the boat, \"SUPPER'S READY!\" After getting onto the boat, they enjoyed a feast, which quite some food had been saved for. \"Fuckin' A, Zoey! Best fish i've tasted since... uh... ever!\" Louis bit into his halibut, saying \"Amazing! You're a great cook!\" But zoey was too busy eating to pay attention. When the feast finished, the two men stepped out, Louis with his uzi, Francis with a fire ax, and they began to chop down trees. Zoey finished her meal, and saw that her belly had distended a good two inches.  She looked at her new girth, and decided...</span></div></div>",
