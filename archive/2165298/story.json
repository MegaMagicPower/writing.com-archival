When you get out of the bed, you notice a little letter along with a little stone. Confused you grab the stone and it started to glow white until a while light blinded the room. After the light ceased to exist your eyes widen. \"What the hell was that?!\" You thought. Remembering the letter, you grab and began to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Nick, The rock that came with the letter is  not an ordinary rock but a magical rock. Once its used, it will be absorbed by you. Now don't worry, it won't do anything bad. But thanks to the rock, You have the ability of.......\"</span></div></div>",

You open the garage door and there's a tall woman with auburn hair, she's breathtakingly beautiful with some kind of green aura glowing around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looks over at you \" Hello Nick, we don't have much time, you must come with me and take whatever you absolutely need because you will not be able to come back.\"</span></div></div>",

I can't afford for anybody to find it\" He thought. After what seemed like hours to Nick, he hid the rock in his bottom drawer and went out of his room. He heard noise coming from the living room.
