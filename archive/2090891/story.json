From it came residents of those worlds, and they each have claimed knew powers. Worse still, they now seek to mold the world however they prefer, no matter how they feel about it. Luckily the Pint Puncher is here to stop their assault. Go, Pint Puncher!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny - a tall, rabbit-like creature that comes from the world of Pok\u00e9mon. Apparently this one grew sick of becoming subservient to people, so now it seeks to overpower humans of this world and make them subservient. This Lopunny earned the power to suck a victim's energy from them by sexually stimulating them enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmelita - a lean, mean vixen machine. Where she's from, she's a powerful ally of the law. However, ever since she came here, she's seen the human world as full of crime. She's now using her powerful skills to subdue all human. She shows equal hatred towards other villains, so she's known to quarrel with both sides. When she came in, she acquired the power to manipulate chains, so she uses these to enwrap her foes and punish them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon - a short dinosaur with a big appetite. Where he's from, he usually doesn't pay much mind to the well being of those around him, and just eats away at whatever he wants. He's also notoriously gassy and tends to throw tantrums time and time again. In this world, he earned the power to grow the more he eats.</span></div></div>",

One guy in particular was approached by what he assumed to be one of those playbunny waitresses. He saw the ears and curves as she passed by, but he was too focused on the potential to get a jackpot to really notice her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, sir, can I get you anything?\" the rabbit figure said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on,\" he said as the slots each ticked. 7... 7... Bar. \"Damn it!\" He reached for more tokens, but another hand grabbed his wrist. It may've been the high of getting so close to riches or the alcohol, but it didn't register for him at first that the hand felt fuzzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you want something first?\" the rabbit asked. The gambler got upset and turned towards the lady, ready to chew her out. However, he noticed that the playbunny waitress was an actual bunny lady! Or at least what looked like an actual bunny lady. She had chocolate brown fur, large rabbit ears, and a very curvaceous appearance. It appeared Lopunny showed up to cause some havoc. Her eyes seemed to attract the guy's attention more, like she were magically attracting him towards them. Meanwhile, her hand on his wrist traveled toward his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't this body demand a bit more attention from you than that game?\" she said. Her hand finger-walked towards his fly, however, before she could do anything, a loud crash was heard as someone flew through the front doors. Lopunny turned towards the source of the noise, and saw the famous Pint Puncher. He was flying straight towards Lopunny, a hand outstretched. He was about to hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leapt away, rolling in the air. The moment the attendees realized the Pint Puncher was on the scene, they ran. They knew where the Pint Puncher was, there was trouble. Lopunny wanted to capture them, but she was forced to leap away as the Pint Puncher chased her. Soon, everyone left the casino, and Lopunny huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now why'd you have to get in my way?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way I'm gonna let you get away with draining innocent people like that!\" the Pint Puncher shot back. With that, Lopunny scoffed, stretched, and began hopping from foot to foot, ready for a fight.</span></div></div>",

She weaved under his attack, and the next thing he saw was her terrifying grin, for that meant he got himself set up for a counter. Lopunny pivoted, and flung herself backwards, bashing her rear against his abdomen. He was knocked back by the force, and he felt the air leave his lungs on contact, and he keeled over, grasping at his stomach. While he was recovering, he heard her chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his head up to look at her, but another thrust from Lopuny introduced his face with her butt, punching him again. He had to focus to make sure he didn't fall over, but his strength would fail him when Lopunny struck him again. With that blow, the Pint Puncher fell onto his back. His mind was swimming in fuzz, before he turned towards Lopunny again. He saw she was about to strike again.</span></div></div>",

He tried to put his arms up in defense, but she fell too fast and she landed on him with a loud CRASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact was so great and her ass so large that his head was nearly completely swallowed up by her cheeks. She clenched her strong glutes over his face and ground down on him further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, you have an impressive strength to you human. You're going to be perfect. But you're not quite ready yet...\" she mused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the Pint Puncher could get his hands on her ass to push her off, the Lopunny propelled herself off of the hero's face herself, just to land squarely on it. She bounced on his face again and again, pounding him mercilessly. The hero's impressive stamina was draining quickly, and by the time the villain stopped bouncing, he was barely holding on to consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny sat up confidently, her ass still gripping at the sides of the Pint Puncher's skull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, so much energy in you little human. You will be the perfect way to begin my conquest. Open your eyes and focus on my beautiful ass as it surrounds you, as it becomes your world,\" she commanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero tried to resist, but her words were so alluring. A pink aura surrounded the pair, and the Pint Puncher gasped as he felt his body absorb the energy. Suddenly, he lost his desire to fight. He was filled with an urge to worship the Lopunny's perfect round ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villain shifted and grinded her body over his head, forcing his face deeper between her massive cheeks. The hero felt himself growing excited at the sensation of her soft fur covered flesh over his body. He heard a voice from deep within the recesses of his mind urging him to fight back, to resist her sexual stimulus, but it felt like the voice was miles away compared to the seductive flesh that surrounded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I feel your energy starting to course through my body. I need more, you have more. Focus on my ass hero, worship it. Kiss it,\" the Lopunny commanded confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher had no chance of resisting the urge to follow her command, and he grew more excitement flow through his body as he felt his lips press up against the inside of the Lopunny's backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the Lopunny wasn't satisfied. She knew she could draw more stimulus out of the human hero. She slowly lifted herself to her feet and prepared to reposition herself. As she stood, the Pint Puncher stretched his arm toward her in longing. </span></div></div>",

She landed on her butt, back leaning against the wall, unconscious. The hero gave a sigh of relief. If she'd gotten just a little bit more aggressive, she could've easily drained him of all his life. But now, he needs to move on. Before he can relax, he hears another villain afoot nearby. What could be attacking now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Miltank - A fairly plump cow-like Pok\u00e9mon. She's usually rather dopey, and usually doesn't even register that she's doing something bad. She doesn't really seem to realize she's getting hurt either. When she crossed over, she came with a monstrous appetite, scooping up whatever was in arms reach and swallowing it up. She also tends to squash unfortunate citizens with her girth. Crossing over gave her the power to steadily restore her energy, requiring opponents to keep up the pressure to beat her, and hopefully avoid her disastrous habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Goodra - A dragon seemingly made of slime. She appears big and imposing, but she is very loving. Perhaps too loving. Sometimes she shows victims a very adult love, but most of the time, she accidently sucks victims into her slime-like body. Though, at that point, she seems to think that keeping them there is just a further way for her to show her love. Even if they end up getting digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Plusle and Minun - A dangerous duo of electrical, mouse-like creatures. The Plusle is a tall, curvy lady, and the Minun is a thin, spry male. Individually, the duo are able to manipulate electricity, conjuring short bursts of electric bolts, touching opponents to stun them, or using their speed to surprise opponents. However, their real danger comes when they're together. With a tap of their tails, they become supercharged, and thus are able to summon more powerful electric bolts, move even faster than before, and even pull people towards them like they were magnets. Once they electrify a foe, they love to bully their opponent after the fact, either with a good old fashioned facesitting, or with more juvenile punishments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho'll the hero face? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Reports were flying in of hotel staffers getting swallowed up, sat on, and steamrolled by the cow-like creature. With a shake of his head, the Pint Puncher quickly leapt into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for him to find Militank's path of destruction. She was clearly oblivious to just about everything around her. The hero smiled, happy to have the element of surprise on his side. He was hopeful he could make it a 2 for 2 morning with quick fights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPint Puncher took off at full speed and delivered a powerful punch to the back of Militank's head. She let out a low \"Oooooh\" and stumbled forward, squashing her would-be meal beneath her girth. As the hero prepared to call the authorities and alert them that they had not one but two villains to haul in, he gasped as he saw the creature roll over and stand up, shaking the cobwebs out of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid eyes on the hero and appeared to be trying to put the pieces together. \"Hey! Did you just hit me?\" she asked in an irritated tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher didn't know what shocked him more. That Militank absorbed his best shot so easily or that she couldn't figure out that it came from the masked, costumed, hovering guy who happened to be the only one not squashed into a pulp left in the room. He simply slowly nodded in confirmation and took up a fighting stance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that wasn't very nice!\" she whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not very nice to go around eating and squashing folks either Militank! I'm here to make sure that ends now!\" The hero responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings seemed to finally register for Militank as her eyes narrowed and she took on a fighting stance of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's gonna take a lot more than that buster,\" she said with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any further warning, the villain leaps and rolls her massive body toward the hero. She destroys everything in her path, but at the last moment the hero is able to dive out of the way. She's much faster than she looks! While her back is turned, the Pint Puncher flies in and tries to deliver a suplex from behind, hoping a move similar to the one that defeated Lopunny will pay off again. But to his shock, Militank doesn't budge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs as she looks down at him over her shoulder. \"Uh uh,\" she giggles, using her large hands to secure his smaller body to her backside before...</span></div></div>",

Without another word, the anthro pokemon laughs loudly and lets herself collapse backwards. The hero simply isn't strong enough to support the sheer amount of weight that was suddenly being applied to his body and he collapsed beneath her, squashed by her cow-like ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiltank's laughter gets louder as she feels the hero flatten beneath her rump. She bounces and dances in place happily. Each move she makes compresses the Pint Puncher to a greater degree until he was flatter than a single sheet of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, the villainess pushes herself to her feet and turns around to get a good look at what she expected to be a very defeated foe, anticipating a mess on the floor like so many of the hotel help and patrons she had crushed in her ravenous rampage. She gasped in surprise when she found the floor clean and bare. She spun around again, thinking she may have missed her foe. But no, the whole room was empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilbank continued to spin in a confused daze until she tripped herself on her own legs and fell backwards with a room shaking WHOOMPH.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooof,\" she moaned as she collected her thoughts. As she sat, she felt something. Thinking for a moment, she stood up and found a mirror in the corner of the hall. With a smile, she saw the hero in his stark white uniform, flattened and plastered to her pink flesh. She laughed at the sight of his body, his arms and legs spread wide and his face pressed against her flesh. She slapped her ass and laughed even louder as she saw his body jiggle with her booty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you survived? Maybe you're tougher than I thought little dude,\" she chuckled. \"Not tough enough though, clearly. Now...what should we do next?\" she wonders to herself. </span></div></div>",

Groggily, he brought his head up, only to see the cow-like Pok\u00e9mon's lips in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, before she opened up her mouth. Her warm, smelly breath bathed the Pint Puncher, who began struggling in her grip, both from the feeling of her breath, and from the realization of what she's going to do to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go!\" he demanded. \"I'm not some morsel!\" He tried to break free from her grip, but she held him tight. She slowly dragged him closer and closer to her maw. Then, she tossed him in, before snapping her jaws around him, sealing him up in smelly darkness. She immediately tilted her head, intending to let gravity carry her next meal into her throat. However, the hero flew up, keeping away from her gullet. Realizing this was going to be a struggle, the Miltank brought her head down again, and got ready to put the hero to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately started by lapping at him, her large tongue flicking against him and roughly punching him against the sides of her mouth.

And with every futile escape attempt the Miltank battered and bruised him further. The overwhelming tongue slammed into him, throwing him around and leaving him dizzy. Saliva flowed freely, soaking the hero and making it even harder to resist. The slippery drool let his tormentor easily slide him all over her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, y'know you make good chewing gum...\" She'd taunt whenever he found himself near her teeth, who gleefully chomped down on the superhero. His super endurance was taxed heavily, sapping his stamina with each heavy chewing session. Before long the Miltank had grown tired of playing around with her little snack. His taste was beginning to fade and she could still see so many delectable morsels to eat. Those that would survive her hunger could serve as toys to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero tried one last desperate plea. \"You've had your fun, now spit me out!\" The Miltank responded simply by shoving him onto a row of molars and biting down, squishing the hero between the hard surfaces. Finally her tongue came in to peel him loose from the blunt teeth. He popped free and flew through her mouth, landing with a wet squish. Just as he hoped she'd spit him out a ring of muscle took hold of his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GULP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher's struggles increased tenfold, but the grip her throat had on his legs was unshakable. Another gulp condemned his waist to her throat as well. He slowly felt himself sink in deeper, even gravity working against him as his tormentor tilted her head back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cruel smile the Miltank felt her prey slip deeper down her throat. One last time she opened her maw wide, showing the terrified humans their hero. Beaten, bruised and about to be reduced to a snack for this mighty Pokemon. All the superhero had left to add was a strained groan before another gulp pulled him deeper into her body. The onlookers were shocked that this Miltank didn't just defeat their hero, she humiliated him. She shrugged off his punches and put him through the wringer without any effort. And now she'd seal the deal by eating him whole, leaving him to stew in her belly. What little hope they had now rested on the Pint Puncher being able to escape her gut. This wouldn't be the first villain to eat him, but could she be the last?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GULP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Miltank was ready to put that to the test and with a last mighty gulp the hero vanished down her gullet. She felt him slowly slide down to his final destination, forming a visible bulge traveling down her neck. It vanished into her pudgy belly. She patted the rotund gut contently and sat down. After playing around like that she needed a little break. But before any of her toys got clever with this situation she spoke threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody leaves. If you try to run I'll catch you and sit on you. And trust me, there's enough space under this butt for all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne young man decides not to heed her warning. He wasn't going to sit and wait until the Miltank was ready to swallow or crush him. He bolts for the door but is stopped in his tracks by the charging supervillain. She delivers a devastating belly bump, sending the scrawny man flying into a wall. With a weary sigh she walks towards him. \"I warned you...\" Her smile quickly grew as the man tried to scramble onto his feet again. Before he could take a single step she turned around and dropped her enormous butt on him. Only his head was spared the overwhelming weight. He screamed out with all the air left in his lungs. The Miltank once more sat back, enjoying his puny struggles along with those of the superhero in her belly. Nobody else in the room dared to move a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere minutes later the Miltank was bored. She was confident her strong belly could keep the still struggling hero contained. She looked down at her second victim and smiled.</span></div></div>",

However, these Pokemon have been increasingly difficult to deal with as of late. There's even been a few that the Puncher hadn't been able to defeat yet! Pint Puncher decided the best course of action was to survey the situation from afar first. He flew up atop the tallest building he could find...and sure enough, the Pokemon attacking the civilians was one he'd never beaten! It was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkuntank: A fat, cocky skunk-like Pokemon. Skuntank smells so awful that just being near him can bring people to their knees! His spray doesn't wash out, and smells worse the longer it clings to you! Couple that with gas that can fumigate an apartment complex, and you've already got a top tier stinker! However, Skuntank can also control stench! He can physically manifest his own, or someone else's stink and use it to hit or grab people, or he can lick someone, causing their body to start producing its own odors! One lick equates to about a month of not washing! Skuntank wants to make the entire world stink like he does!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales: A centuries old fox woman who's never bathed in all the 400-ish years she's been alive! Her fur is well brushed and groomed, but it reeks to high heaven! Her paws are even worse than her noxious B.O. In addition to her long lifespan and ghastly stink, Ninetales can control minds via eye contact, can lay curses that range from bad luck to \"can never stop masturbating,\" and her tails are soft enough to make anyone who touches them instantly weak kneed! She wants the world to bow down before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon: A hedonistic, foxlike Pokemon who seems to exist for one thing only. Sex. Every part of his body seems almost enchanted! Just a touch can send an average human into a lustful trance akin to heat in animals. His touch also brings incredible pleasure, and even a simple footjob can shock someone's mind into a pleasure trance!</span></div></div>",

Way, way down he could see a skunk-like creature, except it had purple fur with tan-colored fur where the white should be. His tail went up his back to just above his head, whose cheeks were so round, the creature almost looked like he had a butt on his face. And that head was upon a plump belly, boasting wide hips, and stubby legs. This guy's known to be intensely stinky. Now, most creatures the Pint Puncher faced were naturally stinky, but this guy was different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhereas most creeps would be content with rubbing their stink on a prey, this guy not only held the power to render another person stinky, but, as evidence with the gaseous hand grabbing some young man, he could use the stink to form physical constructs and assault literally assault the world with stench. The Pint Puncher knew he wouldn't come out of this fight smelling like a rose, but he needed to stop him from this. The more stink he produces, the more ammunition he has. So, the Pint Puncher flew down, striking the road with enough force to shake the ground beneath Skuntank's feet, who struggled to stay upright. Immediately, the Pint Puncher was greeted with the horrid smell of skunk, though he tried to power through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gone far enough, punk!\" the Pint Puncher declared to the smelly pokemon. Soon, he regained his footing, and looked down at the hero. Realizing who it was, he grinned, and let out a dopey chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, it isn't everyone that comes up to me,\" he teased in his dumb sounded voice. The Pint Puncher grit his teeth at what Skuntank was implying. He would've argued, but opening his mouth too much would be very costly in this field of stink. Instead, he drew towards the smelly Pok\u00e9mon, figuring the right moment to strike him.</span></div></div>",

Luckily for you, I'm feeling generous today.\" The Pint Puncher cringed as her putrid breath washed over him. \"I'm going to run along and play with some other humans now. If you can catch up with me and ask me nicely, I'll lift all the curses on you and we can have a fair fight. But, before I go, I'll give you one more curse to make things interesting: you will be compelled to serve at the feet of anthros.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher gulped as the curse took hold of him. This was bad... really bad. Any of his foes could walk up to him, ask him to smell their feet, and he'd be forced to oblige... if he wasn't already on his knees before he said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales dropped the Pint Puncher, leaving him back at her feet. Her beautiful, creme-furred feet. Already, the Pint Puncher's cock sprang back to life. \"Before I go, however...\" Ninetales raised a sole and spread her toes right in front of the Pint Puncher's face. \"One more sniff for the road?\" The Pint Puncher was more than happy to agree. He took a sniff, and took yet another body-rocking orgasm. At least he was able to feel this one before drifting back into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ninetales whistled cheerfully as she trotted away. In reality, she never had any intention of lifting the curses from the Pint Puncher. She knew there were only two possibilities: the Pint Puncher will serve as the footslave of some other anthro, or he'll beg to smell her feet when he finds her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome moments later, the Pint Puncher regained consciousness, with the Ninetales nowhere in sight. He was about to take to the skies to search for her, but he stopped when he saw another anthro running toward him...</span></div></div>",

Before the Pint Puncher could even get a breath of fresh air, the Lopunny scooted backwards, shoving her plump ass right into his face.

She bit her lip as she saw the poor hero writhe about underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you feeling sorry for denying me earlier~?\" she cooed out as if she were talking to a puppy.

By now, his body was in such weak a state and in such a state of panic, he couldn't even realize she stunk. \"Will you even submit your will to me to stop?\" At that, the hero hesitated. It seemed even that was a little too far for him. However, a brief stroke reminded him why he might accept her offer. \"Just kiss my ass, and I'll make you my servant and stop this~ Hurry up, boy!

The hero's legs stiffened, and he felt himself stumble back a little. He reached back and grabbed on a bench to make sure the intensity of Sylveon's blowjob didn't knock him off his feet. Yet even now, with his legs shaking, the Pok\u00e9mon threatened to, for lack of a better term, blow him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Sylveon's arms reached under the Pint Puncher's thighs, just past his knees, while he kept bobbing up and down his dick, his tongue dragging up and down and occasionally wrapping around as he kept servicing him. Soon, Pint Puncher was forced to sit down on that bench, the intensity of Sylveon's blowjob forcing him to crane his neck upwards, jaw dropped as he could only pant. His heartrate doubled as the blowjob continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Sylveon lifted his arms, hoisting the hero's legs over his shoulders, and suddenly he was yanked deeper into the villain's maw, the blowjob only becoming more stimulating as he bobbed and lifted in tune with his lifts, making sure the Pint Puncher got deep into him each time. The hero was sure he was seeing stars by now with the amount of stimulation he was receiving. And whatever voice was telling him to stop him was miles away by now. He was pretty much only his...</span></div></div>",

Instead of a devastating drop kick like he may have expected, Lopunny's legs twisted around the Pint Puncher's neck and pulled his smaller body with her as she flew back and toward the ground. The two rolled over each other for a few moments until the villain sat up confidently, her thighs still locked around the hero's neck and his face buried in her crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that little boost hero,\" she cooed as she stretched her curvaceous body, \"But I'm still hungry for more,\" she giggled as she started grinding her hips over the Pint Puncher's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to squirm and struggle for an escape, but the leverage she had in this position made any type of movement difficult. She arched her back away from him and pulled his tights down, wrapping her warm, soft hands around his growing erection. The hero gasped at the sensation of the villain's touch, but was starting to lose the will to push her off. He moaned into her crotch as she continued to apply pressure to his face and dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, that's it Punchy, you just sit back and enjoy yourself,\" the Lopunny moaned as she started to feel the hero's energy flow into her larger body once again.

The force of the impact had also created shock-waves causing a couple support columns and the floor above to collapse on top of the Lopunny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher looked over the destruction guffawed at the sight of the opponent who had just moments ago had the upper hand on him now laid defeated under a pile of rubble. However, unbeknownst to the Puncher, the debris had begun shifting around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fit of laughter had halted as he saw the Lopunny leap out of the her supposed burial and onto her feet. She wiped the dust off her face and looked over to the Pint Puncher. \"I see you are a lot stronger than I gave you credit for human.\" she said. The Pint Puncher smirked, \"You should never underestimate The Pint Puncher!\" he declares striking a heroic pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lopunny raised an eyebrow, \"Pint Puncher huh? Well Mr. 'Puncher' don't get a swelled head just yet.\" she says. \"You see, you have only gotten a taste of my powers, I still have a greater power that I have been holding back.\" The Pint Puncher gave a doubtful look. \"Your fiendish tricks won't work on me you fiend!\" the hero stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis opponent gave a chuckle, \"I assure you this is no trick.\" the Lopunny reached behind her and revealed out a cream colored orb with a brown wave on it. The hero scoffed, \"That's what you're going to beat me with? A little orb?\" he said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lopunny scowled at him,\"This is what is known as a mega stone and with it I can transform into a much stronger form.\" She clenched her fist around it and began to glow. \"Normally this requires a trainer with another stone, a key stone as it's called, but I discovered a way to harness it's power and transform without it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished speaking, a bright glow began to emit form her, too bright for even the Pint Puncher to see. The Pint Puncher was stunned at the sight and covered his eyes to avoid being blinded by the light. A few moments later he heard the Lopunny's voice, \"Well little Pint Puncher, what do you think?\" she said in a rather calm manner. He took a glance at her direction and was astounded to see that she had indeed transformed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he had noticed was her size, while she was already rather tall to start with she was now nearly twice the size she was previously. Her strong legs were now astonishingly large and thick, even taller than he was. It seemed she could snap him like a twig with them if she wanted to. It was covered in tattered leggings that was clearly too small for her size. Above that, her rotund buttocks protruded out from the leggings and seemed as if just one of those beefy cheeks could smother a good portion of his body. He looked up further to see her breasts have received the same treatment, if not a bit less than her lower body portions, still very large and bouncing with even the slightest of movements she made. The Lopunny's ears also changed, becoming even longer and braided. The Pint Puncher stood mouth agape at the sight of this Lopunny's new, sexier body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my 'Mega Form'.\" Lopunny said, \"What do you think?\" . The Pint Puncher was too distracted at her curvy body to piece together a response. The Lopunny giggled, \"Well it seems to me that you're liking my new form <i>very</i> much.\" she said, sticking her chest out to show off her breasts to the hero more. \"Ready for a real fight Mr. Puncher?\" The boy snapped out of his daze, \"Oh, y-yeah... L-let's fight.\" he stuttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The puncher took a defensive stance, readying for any incoming attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lopunny gave a smug look, \"Come on Pint Puncher, i'll let you have the first strike.\" she taunted. She leaned her head forward and pointed to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero glared at the lopunny and wheeled back his fist. He had to give this punch everything he had. Concentrating himself, the Pint Puncher bent his knees and launched himself forward with all his might  and delivered a punch right to the lopunny's face. The power of the attack sent a shock-wave that shattered all the nearby glass in the casino and blew away all the machines and furniture around the Puncher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up expecting to see the lopunny on the other side of the building, but instead saw she was still standing in the same spot where he punched her and she was completely unfazed! The puncher lowered his arm and backed away in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lopunny smiled, \"Aww, was that all you had little hero?\" she teased. She reached an arm out and put her left hand on the Pint Puncher's right shoulder, \"Let me show you <i>real</i> power.\" the lopunny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a split second, the Pint Puncher felt overwhelming pain in his stomach. He looked down and saw the lopunny's fist where he was feeling pain. Soon his whole torso began to ache with pain and managed to make him cough up a bit of blood. The hero fell to his knees and clutched his stomach. Her mega form not only increased her power a great deal, but it increased her speed as well. He never even saw her throw a punch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis adversary rolled her eyes, \"One punch and you're already down? So much for the Mighty Pint Puncher.\" the lopunny scoffed while looking down at the pitiful hero. \"Only one thing to do now.\"</span></div></div>",

He soared toward Lopunny with an outstretched fist, hoping to make this a quick fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before he made contact, the Lopunny leapt over him and landed back in his original starting place.

If that wasn't a weapon or a dangerous blast, what was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to face his opponent, and suddenly all thoughts and questions melted from his mind. At the sight of Lopunny, striking a casually seductive stance, the Pint Puncher's jaw dropped. He hadn't realized until now how mind numbingly beautiful she was. Why would he want to fight such a magnificent creature? How could he dream of doing her any kind of harm? He dropped to his knees, weakened by his admiration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLopunny smirked seeing the immediate impact of Attract. She had used the move in battle numerous times, but she never grew tired of seeing her foe suddenly bend over backward to give themselves to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I'm sorry Lopunny. Please forgive me for trying to hurt you.

With one foot, she spread the hero's legs apart, opening him up and leaving him more and more vulnerable. She grinned, rested her heel just in front of the hero's balls, and gently lowered it. Then, a tingly feeling racked the Pint Puncher's body as he felt her sole press against the underside of his dick. Lopunny grinned wider than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt that,\" she teased. \"That little heartbeat between your legs~ Oh I can't wait to make a rhythm out of that lust.\" She pressed lower and lower, pinning the hero's dick against his stomach and underneath her foot.

However, as she ran, she wound up smacking into buildings and stepping on cars, which her increased size instantly destroyed. With all the commotion, it didn't take long for the Pint Puncher to fly in.

He heard about a museum heist in progress, so he went to check it out. He found a path of old jewels and jewelry leading from one of the wings of the museum, through the air vents, and into a safe room that was apparently locked from the inside. When he got inside, he saw a bunch of portraits, statues, and all sorts of gold and jewelry. He thought nothing would surprise him any more, but was swiftly proved wrong when he witnessed a strange cat boy apparently humping his treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher rose a brow curiously as he watched the excited thief head over heels for his hoarde, letting out excited and lewd \"mew\"s and \"mrowr\"s. The cat himself seemed to bear mostly black fur, white on the tail tip, feet, and hands, as well as around his mouth. Unlike many of the villains he dealt with before, this cat guy seemed a lot more cartoon-y than most, almost like a living chibi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrow-how-how-howr~\" he purred out as he slathered over his haul. \"So... shiny~\" He was practically drooling at this point, the hero left an uncomfortable witness to him. He nervously rubbed the back of his head as he watched. He could've probably capitalized on the moment to surprise him, but at the moment, he simply cared more about stopping this display than dealing with that junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, are you the thief?\" he asked. The cat didn't seem to register. \"...Hello?\" He just let out a pervy giggle as he felt up his hoarde. \"Hey!\" At that shout, the thief was taken by surprise, him shooting bolt upright and stumbling on one foot, before he turned towards the source of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what's the big deal!\" he shouted. \"I'm just playin' with my... Huh, that's a fancy mask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fancy mask?\" the Pint Puncher thought. \"Why're you curious about that?\" The cat put a hand on his chin, as if considering his next words carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, kid,\" he asked. \"Have you been hearing weird voices? Dealt with shadows? Are you... native to this world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... This is my home, yeah.\" The cat let out another \"hm\" as he paced around, hand still on his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You perceive this world as normal... you wield a mask... Heh, then I know just what you are.\" The cat reached into one of the satchels at his side, and pulled out a curved sword that seemed bigger than him. He then pointed it at the hero. \"You must be a shadow here, then!\" At that, the hero held up his arms defensively, already anticipating a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow? I have no idea what you're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No talkin' outta this, bud,\" he said. \"Yer going down!\" The cat swiped his sword to the side as if offering a challenge, and the Pint Puncher suddenly realized he'd have to fight this cat, regardless of how sensical this situation was.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just a cat burglar, right? He was still charging him, but the cat seemed to be looking on in consideration. He didn't think anything wrong with it, but he should've. Morgana, meanwhile, seemed to realize something about this \"palace\". He could read the cognition of this shadow for some reason, and foresee his upcoming attack. Something he knew he could use to his advantage. Morgana got down into a crouch, his butt sticking upwards and wiggling in the classic pounce pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero came closer and closer, but before he realized the villain's trick, it was too late. Morgana suddenly leapt, faster than the hero could recognize, and he completely vanished. The Pint Puncher stopped his flight, looking around shocked for the missing thief. However, he heard a squirming against his chest. He looked down, and spied a sizable bulge in his shirt. The cat snuck into his suit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nya ha ha ha ha!\" he purred from within the hero's suit. \"Time t' show my skills!\" He skittered around to the hero's back, just in time to avoid a fist slam. He felt the hero fly backwards, and crawled over to his front to avoid being smashed against the wall. As he skittered around, he used his cognition reading powers to look into the Puncher's head and get a read on the kind of stuff that distracts him... And his eye shot open with shock as he got a read on him. \"Woah... you're one messed up mind...\" But he decided to shake off that shock as the hero flew forwards again. As he did, he crawled down to the hero's backside. The hero slammed into the wall, only for Morgana to pop out the bottom of his shirt, hanging just above his butt, a paw raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this for? Storin' Maras?\" he teased as he tauntingly smacked the hero's backside. The Pint Puncher blushed at the taunt. The spanking didn't hurt, but he had a feeling if he knew what he was referencing, he'd be very offended. The hero tried to shake his back, hoping Morgana's position would make it easier to toss him down. Though he was taken by surprise by the act, that didn't stop him. Morgana simply crawled backwards, hiding in the shirt again. The cat kept crawling around his torso, the hero repeatedly trying to hit him as he ran around. Eventually, the cat crawled up to his neck line, which the hero was sure would give him a chance to nock the cat burglar down a peg. Then... a black-furred butt shot out, dangerously close to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know why this kinda thing's all over your mind, but if you're weak for it, I ain't complaining!\" the cat declared. Before the surprised hero could ponder more about what that cat meant, a cheesy stench trumpeted forth, blasting him point blank. Coughing and stunned by the blow, the Pint Puncher suddenly fell onto the floor. He was shocked by the potency of this strike. He was such a small villain, how'd he smell so bad! Morgana pulled himself the rest of the way through the neckline, and now sat on top of the Pint Puncher's face, his cheeks settling around his and burying him deep into the valley. He could only imagine the smug look on the cat's face as he brought out his legs, crossed them, and reclined on him like he were some kind of throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, more ushered forth. The Pint Puncher winced at each rancid fart that pelted him, the cat simply sighing contently as he went to town on the hero. It didn't take long for his vision to get dizzy, the world seeming to warping around him as the horrid smell filled tainted his lungs. His many thrashings were getting weaker and weaker as the cat piled on the torment, the little burglar chuckling. \"Aren't you tired, already? Let's call it a day, get some sleep,\" he cooed out, rubbing side to side on top of the hero as he kept pounding him. The hero was beginning to get sleepier. He didn't want to imagine what that cat would do to him if he fell asleep though. Unfortunately, it was getting harder and harder to resist the curtain of sleep...</span></div></div>",

The hero lifted his hands weakly one more time with that blast, but, unfortunately for him, that seemed to be too much for him. Those hands flopped back down, completely limp. Morgana grinned mischievously at the hero's defeated form, and stood up. He looked down at the Pint Puncher's face, it firmly asleep. Morgana's grin widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! It's almost scary how good I am!\" Morgana cheered. He then stopped his cheering, and shivered a little. \"Ugh, can't believe I did all o' that...\" He shook his head, and looked down at the Pint Puncher again. \"Hm, that boy was too easy. A victory like that is nothin' to be proud of. Hm...\" He patted a foot against the hero's cheek curiously, pondering what to do with him. He glanced left, then glanced right, as if there was the chance that someone could come in and see what he was doing. \"You better make this worth it, kid...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to the Pint Puncher's pants, looking at his groin curiously, a soft blush on his face. Again, he glanced left and right. He bent down, grabbed his waistband, and pulled it down... underwear included. He saw the hero's manhood, which seemed to harden a little bit. \"Ugh, you were really likin' that stuff I did to you, weren't you!\" Fortunately, it seemed the hero didn't respond to that little outburst, he just lied there unconscious. Morgana sighed, sat down at his legs... and wrapped a hand around that dick. \"Hm, guess it is kinda fun, playing with you like this~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began rubbing up and down the hero's length, him letting out a little squirm as he slowly grew harder. Morgana chuckled at the reaction, feeling a bit of arousal on his own end. \"There, there, just lie back, and think about Olivia...\" He kept stroking and stroking. He may be a shadow, but this boy clearly had some fear of embarrassment, thinking that he'd never be able to show his face if he were caught having these strange creatures mess with him like he just did. \"Or Helena... or Susan... or Derek...\" The hero kept squirming at the combination of Morgana's words and the stroking. Morgana smirked as he glanced at his cognition, those very villains showing up and roughing him up in his dreams. \"A glutton for punishment in your dreams, eh kid?\" he joked. He chuckled a little more, and stopped rubbing as he realized he was now looking down at the hero's fully erect manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked confidently and cracked his knuckles. \"Time for the real fun~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><b>Hold Up!</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher soon woke up with a groan, the memory of that cat burglar still fresh in his mind. He tried to rub his forehead, but found himself unable to move his arms. He looked up, and saw that his own pants were bound around his wrists! But if his pants were up there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nervously scanned downwards, and saw that cat... sitting on his erection. It was pinned right between his cheeks and squished against his stomach, the cat's butt partially resting on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad t'see you're up,\" he said. \"I was beginning to think I'd have to kiss the prince awake.\" He snickered at that statement, the hero's nervousness peaking a little more at that. \"Now, you don't like bad guys doin' weird stuff to you, right?\" Morgana was sure the contrary was true, but for this to work, he had to play along with the Pint Puncher's persona. \"Y'know, stuff like... this!\" Another fart rang out, this time the hero's dick trapped between those cheeks as he unloaded. He whined out at the noise. He felt the vibrations of her strike immediately go to work, rapidly rubbing his dick and making it throb. This was followed up quickly by the horrid smell pelting his nose. He squirmed at that, but the rubbing made him rub against the cat's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't do that!\" he cried out as he writhed about. Morgana chuckled at that reaction... and quickly stopped his squirming with a clench of the cheeks. The hero froze up at the tight squeeze, and stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make one thing clear: I'm callin' the shots here. Your dignity, your manhood, the fate of those now lie in my hands... Or to be more specific, in my cheeks~\" He gave a cheeky rub, causing the Pint Puncher to groan and throb more. \"I can see the cognition of a lot of people. I can tell their many thoughts, and I heard of many 'loss of virginity' stories. Many great, passionate-filled stories. And lemme tell you, among those stories, cumming to a cat farting on you has gotta be at the top 5 in terms of most embarrassing. Speaking of...\" Another fart blasted forth, and that intense stimulation pounded the now thrashing hero as he flailed and kicked. This thrashing was silenced with another squeeze of the burglar's glutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you don't have to have one of the most humiliating insert-stimulator-here-jobs in recorded history,\" Morgana assured. \"I could get this butt off of you and let you rake up whatever scraps of dignity you can find.\" The hero nodded at Morgana's apparent offer, hoping he could avoid suffering a fate like the cat describes. At that, Morgana smirked as he realized he had him hook, line, and sinker. \"Now it isn't that simple, kid... You wanna get outta this without, how shall we put it, leaving your dna at the crime scene? Make me an offer I can't refuse!\" The Pint Puncher glowered at the villain. He couldn't believe this: this cat was half his size yet he had a firm grip on him, both figuratively and, unfortunately, literally. He'd hate to give in to his demands like this, but he'd also hate to be stimulated in <i>that</i> way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before we start the Pint Puncher's battle, let's decide on who he fights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorris: a fat boar the size of a truck. When he received super powers, he suddenly felt extremely hungry. In his rush to get any food, he found he could draw in air to suck up food. The air he created was strong enough to lift a truck off of its tires, while he himself could swallow half a car whole. This made people scared of him. they try to stop him, but that only made him mad. They were stopping him from eating. He decided he'd just eat anyone that tried to stop him from eating. The Pint Puncher stopped him from feasting on an entire carnival time and time again, so he decided, whenever that brat showed up, he'd drop everything and get to prepping him for his stomach, from \"tenderizing\" him to \"covering him in spices,\" before he eats him in one bite. For some reason, he's started to wear gold colored wrestling shorts. One of his most dangerous and humiliating moves is the Dutch Oven, in which he traps foes in the back of his pants and farts all over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen: a hippo the size of a van. She came to believe that money is used to control humans, so she tries to steal as much as she can, firmly believing that anyone that denies her money is just too weak to control anyone. She tries to prove that by beating up, or otherwise humiliating, anyone that denies her. Apparently, she received the power of powerful gas, delivering belches strong enough to break brick and smelly enough to almost instantly knock out most people. She also delivers farts that can either propel her or blast foes away. Her gas also likes to cling to wherever she releases it. She can control the power or stench of her gas in order to maximize torture. She's seen squishing people under her butt, trapping people in her butt and farting (with farts weak enough to keep them trapped in between), even swallowing people with either end. She also likes to use her tongue a lot. She wears purple panties and a hot pink tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia: a fox the size of an amazoness. She boasts d cup breasts and two butt cheeks the size of cantaloupes. She acquired the ability of elasticity, enabling her to stretch or expand any body part a set amount. Having been forced into hiding as a fox before she earned her powers, she uses her powers to bully anyone else so she doesn't feel as low as she felt back then. She doesn't wear anything. She can throw punches and kicks up to a mile away, but she more often likes to bring opponents to her, either grabbing them with her hands or legs, or wrapping her tongue around them to pull them close. She likes to squeeze opponents by expanding her breasts or butt or legs and wrapping them around prey. There are also times when she swallows targets, using her tongue to ensnare prey, expanding her head to contain them, then expanding her throat and stomach to swallow them. She's occasionally seen contracting her form to squeeze around prey in her stomach, just to make them as uncomfortable as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank: a honey badger the size of the average male. He often wears a black thong to show off his buttocks and bulge. He can now use his stench to hypnotize prey into doing what he wants, no matter how sexual or demeaning. Since he never got in a relationship as a normal honey badger, he intends to collect an entire harem, men or women, to serve his beck and call. He performs a wide range of attacks to subdue prey, from farting at them, to burping at them, to making them sniff his feet or armpits, any whiff around this guy is likely to render anyone submissive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the Pint Puncher going to fight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

In it, food from all over the world is provided for attendees, from real Mexican food to German meats to Chinese platters, so on and so forth. In the middle, they start to realize the wind make a sudden shift in direction. Then, the wind started to pick up, yanking food out of vendors and off of plates, as well as yanking trash away. Citizens turn toward where the wind is blowing, then cream upon seeing a giant form walking into view from behind a building, sucking the air right towards him. The creature's a boar, the size of a truck, walking on its hind hooves and displaying large, human like hands and a pair of gold colored wrestling shorts, inhaling anything from the festival he can, be it edible (to humans) or not. This boar is known as Borris, a super powered boar with an insatiable appetite and a new ability to inhale most things towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttendees and those inside vendors start running upon spotting him, leaving behind discarded jackets, food, etc, which would subsequently get sent down the pig monster's throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, fatty!\" Borris hears a familiar voice come from the sky, and he shuts his maw, stopping his inhaling session, to look up at the source of the voice. In comes a tiny human in white spandex, blue cape, and white wrestling mask, flying from the sky and landing onto the concrete before Borris, cracking the ground beneath him. This is the Pint Puncher, superhero to the city, a human that also acquired super powers like Borris had, except this human had the power of flight and super strength. Borris glares at him, this brat keeps trying to stop him from eating. The Pint Puncher gets up to his feet, glaring right back at Borris. \"Do I have to teach you another lesson?\" He crosses his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time, how about I teach you a lesson,\" Borris bellows at the hero in front of him. \"This is the last time you get between me and my food!\" </span></div></div>",

He goes, kicking and flailing towards the boar's awaiting maw. Despite his best efforts, the Pint Puncher ends up captured in the monster's mouth. Upon entry, he's hit by the glutton's terrible breath, nearly passing out from the stench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chuckle from Borris causes everything around the Pint Puncher to vibrate, knocking him off of his feet and onto the tongue. Borris moves his tongue about, slamming it on top of him, dragging him from cheek to cheek, and grinding him against the roof of his mouth. Borris moves him underneath his teeth, gently chewing on him, almost playfully. The Puncher feels completely soaked, and he's sure his outfit's tearing from the torment. </span></div></div>",

The Pint Puncher couldn't even move or think before Borris already had his butt over the hero's head. \"Hope you enjoy the view!\" The Puncher couldn't even realize what was going on when his head was squashed by the big boar's butt.

Borris grabs what he can so he can push down on the Pint Puncher as hard as possible. The Puncher hears the foreboding growl of his stomach, which he swears Borris let stretch out so he can really extend this spicing session. Borris grunts, and a cloud of methane and grossness washes over the Pint Puncher's face with a thunderous blast from his butt. The hero gags and twitches as little as he can, much to the boar's amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't like that, eh? That's just the beginning of the end, boy!\" the Puncher's tormentor taunts. He cruelly laughs as he feels his stomach grumble some more. More farts erupt on top of the Pint Puncher, Borris capping off the end of each blast by grinding his butt on top of the weakened hero, much to the Pint Puncher's disgust.

Tell me what's like?\" The boar asked rhetorically as the Pint Puncher squirmed and tried to get away. \"You... 're... Disgus...ting...\" the Pint Puncher said as he lost his strength.

The Pint Puncher thought it was his doom, now Borris was finally going to eat him, but, he was surprised when Borris sniffed the boy, and with a bit of frustration in his face, he said \"You're not spiced enough, you'll need an extra spice\". The Puncher had a lot of possibilities in mind, but when Borris raised his arm, breaking free the smell which was in there, he knew what he would do.

We must fix this at once.\" Pint Puncher's resolve would be tested again and he gritted his teeth in anticipation. Soon enough the large tongue came back for him, pulling him to the middle of the boar's mouth. Once there the large muscle coiled around him with the dexterity of a snake and squeezed hard. He yelled in pain, the tongue crushing his body with great might. But Pint Puncher was used to being on the receiving end of some punishment. Borris would need to do a lot worse to break him. Just then he felt the wet cavern of the boar's mouth tilt down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorris grabbed the waist of his shorts and pulled them open again. He spat the little superhero right back in there. Coated in saliva and unable to move before the boar let go of the elastic band and sealing him back in the pungent hell of his crotch. Trapped between the tight fabric and the boar's throbbing shaft the little hero winced in disgust. The overwhelming mixture of arousal and spit making him fight to hold in his lunch. To add to the torment a large hand pushed through the fabric. Borris rubbed him against his growing erection, growling with delight. Choosing not to blow his load too soon he let the hero stew in his shorts a bit longer, directing his attention elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like it in there, don't you, Puny Puncher? I'm not feeling much of a struggle against my great body in there. You might want to start putting up a good fight, or people will start talking. Maybe some motivation is required. Since you don't care about being inside my pants, how about somebody else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spotted a bystander trying to film the whole thing on his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should ask me permission before you film me, morsel!\" He roared before inhaling deeply. The man was pulled towards Borris' mouth but intercepted by his hand. Snatching the bystander out of the air and holding him tightly in his fist, the boar continued taunting Pint Puncher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd best start fighting or our little friend is going to beat you in the race to my stomach.\"</span></div></div>",

Not just because of the foul smell, but the thought of what the boar might do to that civilian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this really all you've got for me? I am disappointed in you, Pint Puncher.

The heavy weight on the other side of the shorts proving far too much for Pint Puncher to handle. Up above the boar looked once again at the bystander he held in his clenched fist. The man was squirming in a futile effort to break free. Borris chuckled in his deep voice. The man's tenacity was adorable, but they both knew there was only one end to this scenario. Borris opened his slavering maw wide and deposited the bystander on his thick tongue. He quickly closed his mouth, the tongue coiling back, dragging the man into his hungry mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed would be etched in Pint Puncher's mind forever. He could hear the boar loudly smacking his lips, playing with his food. The man screamed for his life, but the boar was deaf to his pleas. He would slather his tongue around him and push him against the inside of his mouth. Sometimes he'd shove him into his cheeks, a distinct bulge forming for the onlookers to behold in fear. Then he'd roll the bystander onto his teeth, pretending to chew on him. All of this he did whilst keeping his mouth open as much as possible, letting the sounds of him enjoying his meal-to-come far more then he should. The loud smacking, squelching and slurping was utterly devastating to Pint Puncher. He knew some innocent man was in the boar's mouth, taking his punishment. All because he was too weak. No! That's just what Borris wants him to think. He'd show that arrogant swine just how wrong he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, thish guy'sh delishioush. I don't think I can hold off mucsh longer.

His tongue smacked into Pint Puncher, pushing the saliva-soaked superhero around in his big mouth. He was slammed into the roof of the cavernous maw, then the side of his teeth, then into his cheek. The hero could barely keep up with the large tongue's actions. He even landed on the teeth, something Borris immediately exploited by chewing him. The boar held back, mostly teasing the hero with crushing pressure. He wanted to swallow him alive and screaming. As the mouthplay wore on, Borris grew bored. The Pint Puncher wasn't really fighting back anymore. Any more licking and his taste might go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, for the moment I know you've been waiting for...\" He said with a giggle. The large tongue twisted and coiled, maneuvering the beaten hero slowly towards the hungering gullet. The boar's ravenous appetite was made very clear. The moment the powerful muscles at the back of his throat caught the Pint Puncher, they quickly dragged him further into their slimy embrace. Borris felt the hero sink deeper into his throat and gulped him down with haste. The sensation of his hated nemesis sliding down to his stomach filled him with pure bliss. It was the single most delightful morsel he'd ever eaten. And once he'd digested him the boar would endeavour to eat everything and everyone just to find something that could get near this amazing flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher groaned and fought as best he could against the narrow crushing tunnel. But the slimy surface and overwhelming pressure of Borris' insides handled the struggling with ease. The hero felt his descent slow down for a moment before the passage below him opened up. He slipped through and landed in the boar's vast stomach with a loud splash. The stench of slowly dissolving food could strip paint and the hero almost immediately slipped beneath the surface of the large pool of stomach juices. It was completely dark inside the boar. The slippery lining paired with the constant pulsing motions of the stomach made it very hard for the hero to keep on his feet. He felt the sloppy liquid wash against him, eating away his suit.

No longer flying directly away from the boar only amplified the rate at which he was pulled towards him. He practically threw the citizen down the alley, letting him slide on the floor. The only thing that mattered was getting him out of the powerful suction. He wouldn't let the civilian share in his torment for another second. The man slid along the floor and landed in some garbage bags. Pint Puncher could only just see the man giving him a thumbs up before Borris demanded his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, how selfish, you want my belly all to yourself.\" Puncher knew he could probably drag himself into the alley too. But the boar would immediately use that time to suck in and devour more people. No, this had to be resolved right now! He turned to face Borris, his mouth still wide open. The powerful vacuum drew in all manner of debris, but none of it mattered to him. He had his sights set on the superhero and he saw him slowly get pulled closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf another meeting with his maw was inevitable, Pint Puncher would leave one hell of an impression. He turned around and flew straight at the boar. The potent suction now added to his speed as the hero charged in fists first. The boar realized what was happening and opened even wider. He was not about to be cowed by this display of madness. Borris would show the world that the Hungry Hog is not to be messed with. The superhero flew into the boar's throat, hitting the back of it with both fists.

He slid through the narrow esophagus at record speed before crashing into the pool of stomach juices again. The boar let out a wet cough and held his gut. That was no doubt the fastest anything had ever gone down to his belly. But he had an iron gut, well able to handle that sort of punishment. A confident smile reappeared on his face as he felt the hero struggle. The deep dive left powerful digestive fluids stuck to the superhero. His torn suit, straps and scraps held together mostly by wishful thinking, finally fell apart completely. Echoing through his rotund body, Borris taunted the trapped hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah was gonna make a fast food joke, but you're already in ma belly.

One taste should suffice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorris reaches into his shorts, grabbing the boy. He rubs his face into his balls a little more before bringing him up to his grinning face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're disgusting!\" the Pint Puncher spits at him. Borris just laughs at his prey's defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're going to be delicious,\" Borris taunts, patting his stomach. The boy stares on in horror as Borris' tongue pokes out between his lips and slowly approaches the restrained hero. He can only kick and squirm in his grip as his tongue drags from his legs to his face. He licks a few more times before the boy sees him open his mouth up wide. He screams as the boar wraps his lips around the kids neck, trapping his face in his foul breast infested mouth. Borris sucks on the boy's head like a sucker, making the Pint Puncher feel a pulling sensation on his face and his mask starting to come off. He kicks, flails, and scream at the sensation, until something gets caught in the creature's throat. He removes his lips from around the boy's now mask-less form, swallowing the mask down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taste...\" the boar begins.</span></div></div>",

A pair of security guards are leaning against a far wall, watching over the crowd, when they suddenly hear loud thumbs outside. One of the guards hold their ear up to the wall, trying to determine what the thumping was. The guard stumbles back in shock when he realizes the thumping is replaced by some sort of gurgling, he knows what's out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUURRRRRRP!\" A loud belch sounds from behind the wall, a smelly force breaks through the wall. The guard listening in manages to dip away from the attack in time, but the other guard is shot forward by the force of the belch before losing consciousness on the floor. Everyone in the bank looks at the source of the sound of the shocked. That shock turns into terror as they spot a hippo, the size of a van, on the other side of the hole in the wall. This is Helen, a hippo seeking to dominate the human race by acquiring as much money as possible. She wears purple pantie and a hot pink tank top, and lightly taps her belly, bearing a triumphant smirk. She's also holding a sack with a dollar sign on it. Everyone inside the bank except for those behind the counters run, while the bankers are stuck on their side of the bank. Helen marches up to one of the bankers, each step sending jiggles across her stomach and butt. She stands before the cowering banker, dropping the sack in front of them. \"If ya know to fear me, ya know why I'm here.\" The bankers only shake in place out of fear. Helen rolls her eyes and hops up, placing her butt on the counter, facing them. The bankers jump in fear and scurry to get the money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen sits there, proud of how smoothly her operation's going, when she hears something zipping through the air. She hops of the counter and faces the hole she created, arms crossed. Just as she expected, one boy wearing white spandex, a blue cape, and a white wrestler mask flies before the hole, covering his nose as he walks through, glaring at Helen, the hippo returning the glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I smelled you around here,\" the hero known as the Pint Puncher says, removing a hand from his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna be smellin' a lot more if you stand between me and the green.\" The Pint Puncher takes a fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and try.\" Helen pops her knuckles, and gets ready to wail on the boy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The bank door was too far to get to and reach Helen before she fired, leaving the bank employees on the receiving end of what was sure to be a toxic blast. Very likely multiple blasts. He couldn't leave them to suffer, no one deserved that!  He needed to get to Helen quickly and stop her, by any means necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPint Puncher charged with all of his strength.

She had a plan for her greatest rival, but she wanted him awake when she revealed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as her mind ran through the events of the day, reliving the feeling of her beaten opponent landing unconscious in her ass, almost as if he was throwing herself at her in defeat. Her smile grew broader as she recalled the look on the faces of the terrified bank employees who had witnessed his defeat. The only thing that would make this day better would be if the news cameras were rolling. She wanted the whole world to know that she had the super hero the Pint Puncher trapped between her mighty butt cheeks. Her plan would ensure they learned of his defeat soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen sat forward, directly on top of the Puncher's throat and chest. She spread her nude legs and ass, ensuring her next blast would be as close to the Puncher's nose as possible without her sitting on his face. She wanted to see the look in his eyes as she spelled out her plan. She clenched and released the loudest fart she could, but ensured the smell was at a minimum. This was intended to wake him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of the blast, Pint Puncher's eyes shot open. He tried to move his arms and sit up, but found himself completely pinned. His eyes shot all around in terror. It was his turn to relive the events of the day, and it ended with the sight of Helen's massive ass right in front of him, just before everything went black. That ass was now directly on top of him. He looked up and saw Helen sitting with a beaming smile of victory on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wakey wake little Puncher\" she cooed. \"As much as I enjoyed your submission to my ass, I need you awake to know what the rest of your pitiful life will look like.\" she said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what the best thing about having money is?\" she asked. Without waiting for an answer, she said \"It gives you the power to get any. Thing. You. Want. Like this little thing here.\" she continued, gesturing to a vial of red liquid in a syringe she was holding in her right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was able to procure a bit of hair from our mutual friend Felicia. Some well paid, and since disposed of, scientists helped me isolate the source of her elastic powers and refine it into a solution. Strong enough to bond to you, but weak enough that it would give you no control of those powers.\" she said with a huge smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for a response from the Pint Puncher, Helen plunged the syringe deep into the hero's arm and pulled it out empty. The Puncher felt pain all over his body. His body shook and convulsed against the bad science in the red liquid, but he remained conscious. When his body was still, Helen smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The key to your bonds is right over there on the table Punchy. Go ahead and reach for it.\" she said with a smile. The Puncher sighed, but played along. He reached with all his might, but the table was too far out of reach. He couldn't extend his arm any further than normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let me try.\" she said, finally lifting her huge body off of him and allowing him to breathe normally. She wrapped her hand around his arm, the same one he was unable to stretch, and pulled. To his great shock, it stretched like a rubber band! It hurt a great deal, but Helen didn't seem to strain in pulling him a great distance at all. When she released her grip, his body snapped back into place. The Puncher winced on impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you're prepared, it's time to let the world know of my victory. I haven't fully decided how you should make your debut though. What do you think would strike terror better in the masses? Seeing their hero's body wrapped around my glorious curves like a thong? Or seeing you flattened against my glorious ass for all of time?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her words hang in the air above the Pint Puncher, and they had a heavier weight on him than her ass ever could. His eyes shot open in terror. He fought against his bonds, tried to stretch his limbs, but could do nothing. Helen laughed, enjoying his struggles, but had finally come to a decision. </span></div></div>",

She knew exactly what she wanted to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you so clearly demonstrated your love for my ass crack in the bank, who am I to deprive you from spending even more time there Punchy?\" she said sarcastically. \"As much as it will pain me to part from my purple panties, you will make a fine replacement!\" she said with a sinister laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flipped a switch on your table and your arms were snapped above your head and your legs were locked into place. The table began to separate, slowly pulling your body and stretching you apart. It hurt, but not in the way you would have expected. All the same, you struggled for escape. But Helen's bonds had you held securely. There would be no escape for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou body was stretched yards and yards apart. Helen smiled as she took hold of one of your legs and pulled it around to your arm, which she tied in a secure knot. She repeated the routine with your other leg and arm. She licked her lips as she admired her handiwork, but wasted no time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen lifted your stretched, knotted form and dropped you onto the floor at her feet. Your eyes were wide and you screamed at her for mercy, but Helen didn't hesitate as she placed a foot into the loops she had created on both sides of your body. Bending, she grabbed your body and slowly pulled you up toward her incredibly large ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirmed and fought, but even with your super strength, with your body stretched so thin you were helpless to undo the knots that Helen had created or to pull away from the huge hippo. All you could do was wait as you saw her round ass and her deep crack draw closer and closer until you made impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour elastic body finally began to try to reform, but Helen's huge ass now made that impossible. You felt your body sink into her flesh on all sides. Your head and face were pulled deep into her ass as she continued pulling you up tighter against herself. Finally, with a satisfied sigh, Helen released you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think Punchy? I look good right?\" she asked. \"Well, probably not from your perspective.\" she said with a laugh. Helen clenched her ass over your body, making you completely disappear between her cheeks as she simultaneously released a quiet, but noxious fart at point blank range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get used to that Punchy. Welcome to your new world.\" she said satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Helen was not one to sit still for long. She had her grand victory to display to the world. Where was she off to?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The local news broadcast was just getting started, and the anchor, a well dressed man in his late 40s named Stone Jackson, was discussing Helen's abandoned bank robbery and praising the efforts of the Pint Puncher, when things within the station took a turn for the unexpected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive belch erupted from outside the station, creating an enormous hole in the wall of the studio. Everyone went into a panic, except for the anchor. He had seen and covered just about everything on the field and managed to keep his composure. Helen confidently strode into the studio as the remaining cameramen tried to remain focused on doing their jobs amidst the disheveled station. The hippo simply stood in silence with her hands on her hips proudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah....I see we have a surprise commentator to add insight into the events of this afternoon,\" Stone started, disregarding the prompter. \"Helen, th-thank you for joining us. This is...quite unexpected,\" he said, trying to hide the nervousness in his voice at the sight of the villain he had just been discussing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it is,\" the hippo said with a wide smile as she strode in the middle of his shot and sat on the desk. The normal desk was nowhere near prepared to support her weight and it collapsed instantly. The surprised anchor gasped, but Helen just laughed as she felt her ass impact the ground and her defeated rival squirm in pain upon her landing. She stood up and posed seductively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We..we were just describing your attempted robbery this afternoon. Most of the witnesses were in no shape to tell us what happened beyond the appearance of the hero the Pint Puncher. Can....could....would you tell us why you abandoned your robbery attempt?\" Stone asked, still stunned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen smiled, this was just the opportunity she was looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The so called hero the Pint Puncher did interrupt me. But I wouldn't say I abandoned the robbery. That bank will see me again soon,\" she said with a smile, hoping to prod the next question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu...but aren't you a bit concerned that the Pint Puncher will be there waiting if you try again?\" the anchor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo chuckled. \"Well, he'll certainly be there, but I wouldn't say he'll be waiting. And I'm certainly not worried about him. Not anymore at least,\" she said confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStone was confused and sat in silence. Helen sighed in frustration. No one had noticed her wardrobe change yet! She was going to have to get direct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Notice anything...different about me Stone?\" Helen cooed seductively. This was the last thing the experienced anchor expected. The hippo wagged her large ass in his face. Stone's eyes widened as he was presented with Helen's greatest weapon. He calmed momentarily as he realized she had no intention of hurting him, but as his eyes focused on her large backside, he gasped in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen stepped to the side, allowing the camera to focus on Stone's stunned face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something you want to tell the world Stone?\" Helen cooed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y....your ass. In your ass....\" he stammered. The hippo simply laughed as the camera refocused on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Stone. My glorious ass. That's why I'm not concerned with the Pint Puncher.\" she said, running her fingers across the hero's stretched body that formed her waistband. \"You see, all you Helen fans out there, you don't have to worry about that pipsqueak spoiling our fun.\" She turned and bent at the hips and pulled the Puncher's manipulated body out from between her cheeks on full display for the camera. She could feel him squirming within her grasp and laughed maniacally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have him right where he belongs,\" she said, releasing his body which snapped back into place, lodged deep between her large cheeks. She smiled as she released a loud, slow fart over his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be expecting a tribute from all of my wonderful fans out there in this wretched city,\" she said with a cruel grin, \"If I don't get what I want, each one of you can expect a similar fate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen clenched her massive cheeks together, enforcing her verbal threat, and violently stormed out of the studio. </span></div></div>",

Busting banks and cashing in on her loyal fans is one thing, but when you're given a gift as great as a Pint Puncher that's at your mercy you make time. Besides, it would give those dumb humans a chance to collect all the money they owed her. A good night's rest was uplifted by the pathetic squirming of the hero in her ass. Helen woke up ready to get to work. No superheroes left to stop her today. With a confident stride she walked to the same bank she tried to rob before. Construction equipment marred the stately appearance of the building, but that didn't bother the hippo one bit. She picked out a piece of untarnished wall and swung herself butt-first against it. What was little more then a small bump to Helen packed enough destructive force to smash a huge hole in the wall, easily big enough for her to step through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"Did ya miss me?\"</span></b> She said, bellowing with villainous laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost bank tellers were visibly shaking, moreso when the hippo slowly stomped towards them. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"You know the drill people, all the money in the bag please.\"</span></b> She said, throwing a large sports bag over the counter.<b> <span class=\"cnavy\">\"And be quick about it, I'm feeling another burp come up.\"</span></b> Any hint of resistance from the bank personnel was gone. They scurried back and forth, loading huge sums of wealth into the hippo's loot bag. When it was about three quarters full the money suddenly stopped. Helen frowned and stared daggers at the terrified tellers. \"I'm sorry Miss Helen, but that's all the money we have. We even emptied our own wallets in there.\" Helen simply sighs.<b> <span class=\"cnavy\">\"They don't build banks like they used to...\"</span></b> Maybe the teller was lying, maybe not. The hippo didn't care. This town had plenty more banks. She leaned onto the counter, crushing it a little, and grabbed her bag. It was satisfyingly heavy with stolen cash. Victoriously Helen clenched her butt over the hero turned underwear. She hummed a little melody and stepped through the hole again. Outside she was greeted by a most unexpected sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth sides of the street were blocked completely with huge masses of people. They held banners and signs, protesting the hippo's villainous ways. A good number of them had baseball bats and other crude weapons.<b> \"Down with Helen!\"</b> They all chanted. The hippo stayed calm and dropped her bag. She reached between her cheeks and fished out the Pint Puncher from that wretched abyss. She held him up for all to see.<b><span class=\"cnavy\"> \"This one has superpowers, look what happened to him. Imagine what I could do to you...\"</span></b> Her loud voice snapped the hero to attention. He saw the hordes around him and he knew this could only end one way. None of the columns of angry citizens backed down, leaving Helen with a huge evil smirk on her face. She strapped the hero onto her chest like an improvised bra, his body stuck between her bulky tits. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"Don't you look cute in there.\"</span></b> She cooed.<b> <span class=\"cnavy\">\"Now you have a front row seat to the show.\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen faced one of the crowd and stomped into position much like a sumo wrestler. She closed her eyes and conjured a mighty rumble from her belly. The hippo villain took a deep breath and let out a humongous belch. It rolled down the street with terrifying force, slamming into the protesters. Signs were ripped from their hands and scattered in the foul winds. The front lines were knocked over from the sheer impact. But impact was only the beginning. People began to cough and choke on the stinking fumes, dropping unconscious in the street. Like flies they fell until only a handful were still standing. Helen looked over her shoulder. Those confident angry glares suddenly look a lot more frightful. Maybe they knew that the others got off lightly. Maybe they understood the moment she bent over a little and parted her cheeks. An unreasonably loud fart erupted from her smelly pucker, leaving an eerily similar wave of devastation. No more then a dozen people in either crowd were still on their feet. Any sensible soul that brought a mask had already run off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one madman was still on the offensive. Baseball bat to hand he charged towards Helen and swung right at her large belly. A wave of fat rippled briefly as the hippo just stared the man down. She grabbed the bat out of his hands and crushed it to splinters in her powerful grip. Helen then grabs the man by his collar and slams him into the ground. Before he can recover he is buried under the hippo's huge ass. He panics, feeling the unmistakable warm grasp of her pucker sliding around his legs. Helen stood up to reveal the screaming man slowly disappearing between her cheeks. She reached around and helped her butt out with a quick push, sealing the man into her body forever. His weak struggles were a delight, easily as much fun as knocking out those crowds.<b><span class=\"cnavy\"> \"That was wonderful. But now it's time to go.\"</span></b> Helen announces to herself. Then again, there was still room for more money in the bag. And not all of the survivors in the crowd had fled. The hippo was faced with a serious dilemma. Play with the weaklings or rob another bank?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cruel hippo made up her mind. Banks wouldn't go anywhere, but these weaklings might actually get some common sense and flee. Pint Puncher is still firmly in place between her large boobs, something she confirms by mooshing them together. His elastic limbs were tied together into a makeshift bra, nullifying any chance of escape. He was stuck as a spectator, catching glimpses of the devastation before him whenever Helen's large rack wobbled out of the way. He saw the lingering green miasma from her belch and the droves of people on the ground. Coughing and groaning filled the air, music to the hippo's ears. She casually began to step towards the masses, her eyes on the few stubborn souls who hadn't dropped to the floor. Many of those who had passed out from her stench began to come to. Without a care for anyone on the floor the hippo stepped on them. They wheezed as her foot squashed their bodies flat in one heavy step. It would take some time for those unfortunate souls to get up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen reached her first target and tapped on the disoriented man's shoulder. He turned around and went completely pale. The hippo leaned down, snorting warm breath over his face. He blubbered out a weak apology but didn't get beyond the first sentence. She opened her terrifying maw and dipped down before scooping up his entire body. With ease she gracefully stood back up, offering the man one last glimpse of daylight before sending him to his end in her belly. Pint Puncher heard the loud gulp and felt something pass down her body into that jiggling mass. She had not a care in the world as she trudged across the carpet of unconscious protesters to her next victim. He was wearing a mask, but it had malfunctioned and fogged up. With a disappointed sigh she grabbed him by the throat and violently pulled the mask off his face. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">Were you trying to escape my lovely belch? Here, have a private sample.</span></b> She followed up on her offer and blew a small but excruciatingly smelly burp in his face. He immediately dropped to the ground, unconscious along with the rest. Helen seemed insulted by his reaction. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"And here I thought he was a man of taste. Oh well, at least he can be a man to sate my tastes.</span></b> She picked him up by his ankle and dropped him into her open mouth. Again she swallowed her victim, contently patting her round belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small fart informed her that her butt was hungry for more too. She looked over to a nearby shop front and saw her next target in the reflection of the store window. A man brandishing a knife had snuck up behind her and was about to attack. She pre-empted his assault by hopping backwards, throwing out her butt to meet him head-on. He yelped in surprise as the huge hippo bottom connected with him. He was knocked onto his back and flattened beneath her in an instant. Several more wailing moans could be heard from the barely conscious people littering the floor. Helen's attacker quickly felt the constricting grip of her pucker around his legs. Much like one would slurp of a piece of spaghetti the hippo butt sucked him inside. His pleas fell silent and she moaned at the blissful sensation of four others writhing inside of her. It might only be a temporary thing, but the joy she got was worth all the effort. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"One more...\"</span></b> she murmured to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached her final victim the hippo had a flash of inspiration. Pint Puncher had been defeated so easily she couldn't give him one of her patented smelly hippo kisses. And sticking her tongue in him now would be like french kissing a balloon. Someone else was going to have to endure her love. Her last victim looked tall and muscular. He made her superhero bra look puny by comparison. When he hears the wheezing and wailing caused by the hippo's footsteps he tries to run. But Helen is faster and quickly grabs him, lifting the strong man off the ground. He tries to run in the air and attack her, but neither accomplish anything. He is undeterred and ready to fight until he sees the hippo purse her lips and pull him closer. Her hefty hippo tongue is almost the size of her superhero nemesis, but that wouldn't stop her. She pressed her lips onto the man and pushed. His head quickly disappeared behind those lips and the most unsettling slurping could be heard. Slowly more and more of the man was sucked past Helen's lips. He struggled violently as the hippo not only drew him into her mouth but spent every second locking him into the world's most awful kiss. Her stinky, thick slobber soaked most of his head and her tongue, tired of filling his mouth with just the tip, coiled around him and squeezed. When his whole body had been slurped into her maw she simply tilted her head back and swallowed him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree men in her belly, two in her butt and one trapped superhero being squashed by her rack. It sounded like the end of a productive day to Helen. She wandered casually back to her hideout where she threw the contents of the sports bag into her bed and fell asleep atop her mountain of money. Pint Puncher is taken off and thrown into a corner. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"Don't worry Punchy, I know you missed by butt. Tomorrow you'll go back to sniffing it all day long, I promise.\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Helen wakes up refreshed, feeling a hundred feet tall. Her bed of money was very nice and today she would add to it substantially. First though she looked at her most treasured prize. Discarded in a corner and still asleep was the Pint Puncher. His arms and legs were tied together and his face looked distressed. Clearly he wasn't having the best of dreams. The hippo thought about waking him up and starting the day proper, with him as a thong once again. But she had bigger plans. The five people she ate yesterday added an appreciable amount of heft to her step, but she wanted more. just five humans should not satisfy her greedy belly. It needed to be bigger. Everything needed to be bigger. She grabbed a large sum of money and headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPint Puncher woke up to an empty room. He was still tied together thanks to Helen's elastic formula. Part of him was relieved she hadn't made good on the threat that he'd be wedged between her cheeks all day long. Though it did make him wonder what she was up to. With her gone, thoughts of escape began to flourish. He could seek help for the unwilling elasticity he'd acquired, but for that he'd need to get out of here first. Like a caterpillar the bound hero scooted himself along the floor. He reached up to the large bedroom door and found it to be unlocked. Another step towards freedom. He shuffled on, trying to navigate the hideout of the evil hippo. Stolen art and luxuries in every room and plenty of locked doors. Eventually he found himself in a kitchen of sorts. It was at that time a heavy stomping shook the floor. Helen was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo had a small container with her that looked medical in nature. Very clean and high-tech for a crook of her caliber. She walked into the kitchen and saw the superhero pathetically squirming on the floor. There were no hiding places, he was caught red-handed. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"I'm so sorry Punchy, I know I promised to wear you all day. But I had some very important business to attend to. Here, let me show you.\"</span></b> She hoisted the hero over her shoulder and took him to her garage. The warehouse was big enough to house several large trucks and other assorted vehicles. There was a large empty space and the hero was flopped onto the floor. Helen pushed a button on the container and a needle poked out. Pint Puncher feared he was going to get another shot of horrible science to make him even more powerless. But the hippo jammed the needle in her own neck and injected the serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing seemed to happen and Helen grew a little annoyed. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"What the hell? Fiona said this would work almost instantly. I paid good money for this stuff! If I see her again I'm going to...\"</span></b> Her tirade was cut off by a sudden spasm. The hippo meeped in surprise as she suddenly grew. She smiled broadly. This was what she was hoping for. The Pint Puncher's eyes widened with fear. Regular Helen was already a handful, now she'd doubled in size. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"There we go, much better. Now I can really sate my hunger for weaklings and money.\"</span></b> A large hand reached down and grabbed him. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"Don't worry Punchy, I haven't forgotten about you. In fact, this is good for you too! Now you have so much more ass to sniff. Let's get you comfortable.\"</span></b> His stretchy limbs proved well able to handle the much wider rear of the hippo. Once more he was shoved deep between Helen's smelly buttcheeks. She picked up her extra large loot bag she had lying around for just this occasion. With a push of a button the garage doors opened. It was a good thing the growth only lasted a day or Helen would need a new house too. The garage was the only part of her hideout with doors big enough to fit her now. Helen smelled the fresh air and smiled. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"It's a good day to get rich.\"</span></b> She clenched her cheeks together, mashing the trapped hero and set out on her criminal adventure. Where would her greed take her first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Each of the hippo's heavy steps cracked the pavement as she wandered down the street. People were terrified and quickly dove out of the way. She paid them no mind, choosing instead to focus on the task at hand. Down the street was the central bank, housing enough cash to fill her monetary desires at least for now. With a light spring in her step she hummed a happy tune. A poorly parked car found itself in her way and without breaking her stride Helen flattened it. If her size and crushing displays of strength weren't enough to ward people off her belly certainly would. It rumbled and roared, loudly voicing its displeasure. The hippo eyed everyone nearby hungrily, ready to grab and swallow anyone stupid enough to get in her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, ahead of the hippo was a full-bearded hipster wearing an old headset, listening to his music. He walked down the street at a much slower pace, completely oblivious to the approaching supervillain. Even the small shudder every quaking step sent through him didn't alert him. Bystanders witnessed the world's calmest chase as Helen slowly gained on him. When he finally noticed her looming shadow creep up on him it was much too late. A large hand grabbed him by the collar and before he fully grasped what was happening the hippo's huge maw already closed again. A loud gulp sent him to his gurgling destination. Helen had been sated for now, her gut much less talkative. The Pint Puncher, still solidly wedged inbetween her cheeks, caught very little of the whole incident. His world was still completed absorbed by the utter stench trapped in here with him. The odd clench compressing him flatter and flatter were the only break from the horrid reality that was his prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one more snack presents itself along the way. A distracted young woman almost bumps into Helen, who immediately scoops her off the floor and swallows her down. With at least something in her belly the hippo contently stops before the Central Bank. The building looked grand and imposing, a miracle of architecture and technology. Signs proudly boasted of it's impenetrable walls and vault. That sounded like the kind of claims Helen loved to test. She took a few steps away from the way and reared back. Her belly began to rumble louder than it had all day today. A deep and heavy belch rolled forth from her maw, shaking the building and slamming a large hole in the wall. Helen fit through with room to spare. She immediately appreciated the grand and imposing entranceway and main desk. The greatly raised ceiling left plenty of room for her looming stature. The moment she stepped in armed security guards charged her. The closest were dispatched by grabbing them and flinging them into eachother. Whilst the others tried to set up a plan to take Helen down she rid her two victims of their utility belts. The remaining securities began to panic as she held a captive guard in each hand, raising the first to her maw. Two big gulps later her hands were free and her ravenous leer fixated on a new victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn under a minute the remaining security guards were either eaten or fleeing. Helen happily patted her freshly filled belly. She hoisted her extra large loot bag over her shoulder and towards the tellers. <span class=\"cnavy\"><b>\"I'm sure you boys and girls already know me and what I want. If anyone has a problem with that, I'm sure my belly would love to hear about those problems. And if you're worried about capacity, rest assured I have enough room to shove every last one of you up my ass instead. Now get the lead out and make me rich!\"</b></span> Quickly they scurried back and forth. There was no doubt in their minds this twisted hippo was ready to do exactly as she promised. Helen simply smiled as she watched her loot bag slowly fill with all the money this town could offer. It's a good thing she went out and bought Fiona's growth elixir. She could carry ten times more loot like this. Judging by the steadily growing loot pile that was definitely going to be needed. The other immensely satisfying feeling coursing through Helen right now was the futile struggles of those in her belly. Soon enough they'd be adding to her glorious body, but for now they were quite entertaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loot bag bulging with wealth the path was clear for the hippo. She'd bring her new ill-gotten gains to the hideout. Already her gut felt completely empty again and Helen let out a stinky fart on Pint Puncher to bemoan that fact.

She glanced almost amorously at the giant bag filled with cash she just hauled away. The hippo's smile only grew when she felt the pathetic wiggling of her nemesis deep between her buttcheeks. A small victorious fart escaped her, followed by a lot of strained coughing from the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hunger for money was sated for a little while, but the hippo felt restless. She wanted to go out there again, to show her utter domination to these weak little city people. Her belly rumbled in agreement. Her new size seems to have come with a new appetite too. An appetite that seemed to veer away from the heavily stocked larder in her house. The taste of people was all she could think of. Their puny squirms as they slid down her throat and tried to escape her stomach. It was settled. Helen was going out for a nice big dinner and the city would provide it. The pinned Pint Puncher didn't catch any of her plan. All he heard was her musing about getting something to eat before his world began moving again. The titanic buttcheeks ground against eachother with each step, mercilessly squashing his malleable body. The odd fart added the cherry on top of this nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen marched down main street, hungrily looking around for oblivious little humans to pick off. Every few steps she flattened a car underfoot, the occupants having long since abandoned it and hiding out of sight. Her trip to the city bank seems to have instilled a lot of fear in these people. Or maybe the fact that she was menacingly licking her chops a lot. Suddenly a familiar sound echoed through the streets. <b>\"Down with Helen! Down with Helen!</b> The hippo's heart fluttered with anticipation. Did they really organize a huge buffet for her? With a spring in her step she moved to the source of the noise. She turned the corner and her jaw nearly hit the floor. A huge column of rioting protesters stretched out before her. Many of them held signs and banners with all manner of vicious threats. Plenty of them had baseball bats or other crude weapons. The moment they saw her the column halted and the chanting weakened. The intimidating extra large hippo smiled, saliva practically leaking from her maw. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"You all got together? For me?! Thank you so much! This is a buffet I will remember for a long time.\"</span></b> This mass of people was big enough to sate even her massive belly. With a smile she began to slowly walk towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first rock flew towards her but missed completely. But it gave more people the courage to start throwing all manner of debris at Helen. She just giggled, the rocks bouncing off her thick leather skin. One molotov cocktail flew her way, but she simply caught it and chucked it over her shoulder. Only when a rock bopped her on the nose did she get annoyed. A guy with a sword broke the line and charged her. This was getting too much, she needed to make an example. She didn't grab him or even slow down. The moment he was close enough she simply raised her foot and stomped him flat. With nothing but disdain in her eyes she left he human pancake to groan in pain and rethink his actions. Again the chanting softened, seeing one of their own dispatched so easily. But there were many and together they felt strong. Their bravery lasted right up to the moment Helen reached their line and picked two people up. Her large maw opened and its first victim entered. In a flash she hand him halfway down her throat and a quick gulp sealed the deal. The first man hadn't even landed in her stomach before the second one found himself in the humid cavern of her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith new meals already in hand the hungry hippo paid no mind to the shocked silence. Panic broke out in the front, people desperate to flee the monstrous hippo who was gorging herself on their number. She managed to stuff nearly a dozen protesters down her throat before they got smart and started running. The big belly gurgled contently, but Helen was hungering for more. She began to pursue the fleeing people. Her large form meant walking pace was enough to keep up with them. With almost every step she reached down and snatched another screaming human off the street. They yelled, begged and pleaded but she was deaf to it all. The only thing she cared about was their lovely taste as they slid along her huge tongue into the waiting gullet. Her belly steadily filled with people and after a hundred meals she sat down. The Pint Puncher was crushed hard between her flabby cheeks as she sat and pondered what to do next. With a big shrug Helen patted her belly and lay down on her back. She needed a little nap after such a grand buffet. The hero was buried under a mountain of hippo fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little beauty sleep of two hours, Helen finds herself...</span></div></div>",

She delicately pulled it out and released it, letting the hero's body snap back against her wide hips. As much as she enjoyed the sensation of the Pint Puncher trapped and squirming deep between her cheeks, she had bigger plans for the day. Especially with her greatest adversary out of the way. Helen pulled herself to her feet. She had an unscheduled appointment to keep in the nation's capital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confident hippo strode out of her hideout, not caring about keeping to the shadows. She was on her way to the White House for an audience with the most powerful man in the world. She thought about the sheer length of the walk, but Helen wasn't worried about that. As she took step after step, her hand went to her crotch. She had all the company she needed for the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo shuddered in pleasure as she pushed the Pint Puncher's body into her crotch. She expected to enjoy it, but she felt an unexpected surge of pleasure as his body made impact. Her pace slowed to a stop as the villainess paused to investigate. As she explored her squirming thong, her eyes grew wide as she realized that not <i>every</i> part of the hero's body had remained squashed and stretched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecifically, the Pint Puncher's crotch had sprung to life from constant pressure and rubbing against Helen's flesh. And in his position as human thong, his erection was pinned helplessly directly against the hippo's pussy, which was growing wetter and hungrier by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen's constant smirk grew into a broad grin. She left her headquarters with a plan and a destination in mind, but she was far from in a hurry. It wasn't too early to take a little detour and enjoy the pleasant surprise the hero had presented her with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen barreled her way into a nearby hotel, the occupants of the lobby streamed out screaming at the sight of one of the most terrifying villains in the city. She was hungry for more of the hero, and panted in anticipation of getting it. She quickly stomped to a large couch in the corner of the lobby and plopped down on her large ass. The couch gave way immediately, sending Helen crashing to the floor, but the villain didn't mind. What she really wanted was a secluded place to enjoy herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every step the villain took, the Pint Puncher moaned in a mixture of pain and pleasure as his cock was rubbed against the hippo's crotch and his body was ground and punished between her incredibly massive cheeks. His mind was all over the place, and his body couldn't even agree with itself. With one strained breath he longed for escape, while with the next he strained for release, going as far as trying to push his erection further into Helen's flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen felt the hero's desperate lunges and his pathetic squirming and whimpering as his stretched and knotted body prevented him from moving enough to get the relief he desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, poor Punchy,\" Helen cooed with a chuckle, patting her crotch and pounding the hero's erection against her pussy, \"Momma knows what you want. Don't worry hun, it's coming. But first...\" Helen paused for dramatic effect before releasing a nasty fart at point blank range that caused her cheeks to bounce and jiggle over the hero's trapped body. She couldn't have him enjoying himself <i>too</i> much, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe enjoyed tormenting her greatest rival, but had more...pressing concerns. She again wedged her fingers between the straps of her human thong and pulled. Hard. The force of her tug sent the hero's body squarely up against her anus, but that wasn't what she was focused on. Helen's legs kicked out on impulse as she felt the hero's erection forced deep within her hungry snatch. The hippo clamped her legs shut over his body, somehow driving his body deeper. Despite the agony and misery he was in, the Pint Puncher was still somehow enjoying himself. He writhed in pleasure as Helen's body sucked and puled at his erection. His back twisted as he climaxed and moaned directly into Helen's anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo laughed as she felt the battered hero yield to her overwhelming body. As much as she enjoyed his erection attempt to fill up her crotch, the sensation of his moans of pleasure into her rear entry sent her to another level. She bounced and ground her ass over the hero's body, finally reaching her hand between her massive cheeks to push his head and neck fully into her anus. With both of her cavities filled by the so-calledh hero, Helen was truly happy. It didn't take long until she, too, climaxed. Her wet crotch erupted, forcing the Pint Puncher's crotch out of her body, although her anus still held his head tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew...that was better than I expected Punchy. We might have to try that again sometime,\" she cooed, rubbing her crotch satisfied. </span></div></div>",

She knew what she wanted to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I would love to feel your body wrapped helplessly around my sexy curves, you'd be a little hard to recognize Puncher. A hero of your caliber must be displayed with pride!\" she grinned. \"And what could be a more appropriate place for your display than my perfect ass?\" she asked, not expecting an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fought against your bonds as best you could. You pulled and pushed, you tried to use the elastic \"gifts\" that Helen had forced on you, but nothing worked. You were stuck. Helen stood to her full height as you laid flat on your back squirming, unable to free yourself. She grinned in victory. Helen turned and let her huge ass hang over your undersized body and stood silently, letting the size of her ass do her talking for her. She slapped one cheek and let it jiggle overhead. She looked over her shoulder and shot you a wink before bending at the knees and launching herself into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came down on your defenseless body hard with her full weight and a sickening smack. Beneath her, you heard her cackling in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have seen the look on your face! Even beneath that mask, your eyes were wide with terror! I love it!\" she said wiggling over your body gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen stood again, seeing that your body had compressed significantly, but was already beginning to reform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, it looks like this will require some tenderizing.\" she said with a chuckle. With that, she launched herself onto your body again. This time, she remained seated and sat on top of your flattening form for several minutes, bouncing on top of you to pass the time. \"Still with me Punchy? I want you awake for this! This is great, I don't even have to gas you and you're helpless!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she released a loud, disgusting fart over your body before rolling off the table you were on in hysterical laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I didn't have to gas you, never said I wouldn't though!\" she said joyfully as you gasped for air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the pounding, your body was still reforming quicker than she'd like. Helen lowered the table you were on to the floor and looked for higher ground. She climbed a ladder that groaned beneath her weight, but somehow held. The dominant hippo, ensuring she was torturing you mentally as much as she was physically, blew you a kiss before leaping ass first off the ladder and landing with a room rattling SLAM on top of your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dipped in and out of consciousness after that last impact. You felt movement as Helen stood and this time you went with her. She jumped gleefully that she finally had you flattened to the point that you wouldn't reform and that you were stuck to her ass. Unfortunately, you were face first. That just wouldn't do for her display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeling your body off of her ass, Helen applied a thick layer of super glue to the back of your white costume and put you face down on the floor. Wasting no time, she executed a perfect hip drop over your defenseless body and ground her hips across the floor. She stood and felt you remain with her ass once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to look at her ass in a full length mirror and smiled as she saw her handiwork. The Pint Puncher, superhero, was now flattened against her large ass for all to see. A fitting ribbon for the victor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would she do now? Who would be the first to see her new prize?</span></div></div>",

While he was still flat due to the villainous hippo's mad science and multiple ass attacks, he was at least free from her. His sigh drew the attention of just about everyone in the bank - accountants and customers alike. When they spotted the hero's flat form in the center of the dent Helen left in the bank floor, they gasped loudly in unison. But no one moved, frozen in shock and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one, that is, except for one woman. A wealthy, curvaceous patron lunged forward toward the flattened hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy!\" she screamed. \"We need to get him some help, quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe easily peeled him off the floor of the bank and held him closely to her full chest. The strength of her hug left him still unable to struggle or reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Pint Puncher, I'll get you to the hospital....stat!\" she exclaimed dramatically and rushed out the doors of the bank while everyone else stared in slack jawed shock at everything they had just witnessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding the corner from the bank, and sure that she was out of sight of any witnesses, the Pint Puncher's well endowed red headed rescuer finally pulled him away from her massive chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....my....God...\" she said in a stunned voice before dropping into silence. The hero could only look up, as his flat lungs and flat features wouldn't allow him to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it's just the two of us, all alone,\" the woman finally continued, breaking the silence. \"I have to say, I'm your biggest fan. And I don't just mean because of the girls here,\" she laughed, cupping her breasts without bothering to hide the hero from the impact of her flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh...the Pint Puncher thinks. This woman is starting to sound more and more like Annie. And in his condition, he was in no state to withstand an over zealous super fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way you constantly protect the city from those wicked anthros, without a thought of your own safety, it just leaves me breathless,\" she continues, pushing him deeper into her heaving cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I never thought I'd have a chance like this, I never wanted to get anywhere near those disgusting anthros,\" she said dramatically. The hero could feel her heart rate increasing as she spoke. This was authentic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't have to worry about that anymore little guy. After seeing what Helen had done to you, I'm just so glad I could have this opportunity. I'm going to keep you safe from them forever. Don't you fret, Jessie's got you now,\" she said anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we can't just stand here in the alley talking and dawdling or we're bound to attract a crowd. Let me put you somewhere safe and get you home sweety,\" she said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pulled him away from her massive chest and moved him to her back, the hero's eyes grew wide. He saw the \"safe\" destination she had in mind and realized that his comparison to Annie was likely more right than he could have anticipated. He tried to will his body back to normal, but there was no hope. He was still flattened beyond repair. He screamed internally as he saw Jessie pull back the waistband of her workout pants and of her tight panties, revealing her round, soft, pale flesh to him for a moment before finally releasing her grip on his body. She bit her lip as she felt him free fall and impact her ass, squealing in delight as she let her waistband snap back into position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both knew that there was no way she could do this if Helen hadn't flattened him out first. It was fate in Jessie's mind, some kind of hellish torture to the Pint Puncher. Either way, it didn't matter as the woman confidently strutted to her car, swinging her hips with each step before plopping her large ass into the driver's seat and giving a happy little wiggle. She whooped in joy as she stepped on the gas and heard the engine roar to life before speeding off to her private estate. She was going home with a special guest. </span></div></div>",

This fart was so powerful, he was sent flying away from the villain as if he was shot out of a cannon. He went straight through the wall on the other side of the bank. That impact at his already weakened state was enough to finally knock the hero unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen pulled her panties back up and swung herself back into the bank through the hole she had been occupying.

He didn't have much time left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was agonizing, but brief. Helen sat back and enjoyed his struggles as her body did it's work. From time to time she rubbed her stomach, basking in the glory of her victory. Finally feeling his struggles cease, she stood up. The hippo rubbed her large ass, as she was certain the fallen hero would soon add to it's glory and power. She turned her full attention to the bankers and dropped her empty money sacks on the counter with a wordless grin. Without a hero to save them, the tellers quickly emptied their vaults and Helen exited the bank with her largest score to date, not even including the Pint Puncher. She slept soundly that night, enjoying her greatest victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Helen woke up and admired her curves in her full body mirror. She noticed, to no surprise, that her ass was a bit more plump than usual. \"Thanks for that parting gift Punchy,\" she said, groping her cheeks as she laughed in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a hero to stand in her way, Helen went on a crime spree like none other the city had ever seen. She eventually stopped wearing her purple panties and got a tattoo of a wrestler, clad in white with a white mask, on one of her massive cheeks. It became her trademark, and often it was the last thing her victims would see.  Instead of celebration, the symbol of the Pint Puncher struck terror and dread anywhere it was seen. </span></div></div>",

She looks around her point of impact, not seeing even a bit of her opponent poking out from under her. She lifts a cheek until she's able to see the boy pinned under her.

Citizens fed birds, enjoy the sounds of trees blowing in the wind and birds chirping and dogs barking. One couple's tossing bread crumbs for a couple of birds. The wife thinks she hears something. She looks to the side, then quickly grabs her husband out of the bench and away as an orange fist attached to an extra long arm shoots towards the bench they sat on, splintering it into pieces. They look at the source and see a cruel vixen coming into view. A female fox, standing upright and bearing incredible breasts and a lovely butt, with an arm stretched out to super lengths. This is Felicia, a fox that's become elastic. She can extend her limbs and expand body parts. She's also a huge bully. The crowd runs far from her, but she starts to give chase. Her arm retreats to its original position and she stretches out one leg, then the other, then the other, quickly closing in on the crowd. Fortunately, a white clad flying being comes in like a comet, grabbing her upper body and tossing her back. She slams onto her back and quickly retracts her legs before leaping back up to her feet. She glares at the hero before her: the Pint Puncher, dressed in white spandex, white wrestling max, and a blue cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I need to put you in another knot?\" The Pint Puncher assumes a fighting stance.

But every fiber in his body knew he had to get out of there. He needed some distance from those legs. But before he could fly off a relatively small hand pushed him back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't. Don't you dare try and leave me like this.\" She said, her voice growing thicker with lust each syllable. The rest of her body had lagged a bit behind in the growing department, but she quickly pumped up just her hand to press down harder on the struggling hero. When it was big enough for her tastes she grabbed him, her thick fingers wrapping around him tightly and leaving only his head exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crushing grip, the powerful feminine stink. All of this was beginning to feel awfully familiar to the superhero. Suddenly he realized why. This whole scenario reminded him of his fights with Shenny. The lusty wolfess had tried to cram him into her pussy just about every single time she got her hands on him. The hero looked up at his captor to see a disturbingly similar aroused smile. He prayed to whoever would listen that this wasn't going to become a thing with Felicia too. Of all the places she could stick him, why did it have to be her love tunnel? The gargantuan snatch came close, warmth radiating off it along with a musk powerful enough to numb even his superpowered mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... don't... d-\" His plea was interrupted when Felicia pushed forward, plunging his head between the two slickened lips. The squelch it made sent a shiver down the hero's spine, but the vixen couldn't have a bigger smile. She responded with a gleeful tone. \"Don't hold back? You got it, Punchy. Now make this feel good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one her fingers unfurled, only to feed more of his squirming body into her depths. The walls were thickly coated in pungent slime, the hero receiving a generous helping of her arousal with each push. When he wasn't being inserted even deeper, the walls around him bore down with a strength normally reserved for car crushers. His whole body would be immobilized and he could feel it compress even further. The only thing worse than the torturous pressure were the loud moans echoing overhead. Felicia wasn't just beating him, she was getting off on it too. And he would be right in the blast zone if she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as his feet were about to be sucked up into her pussy the vixen couldn't contain herself any longer. Her moans shattered all nearby windows as she felt her orgasm crashing through her. The hot, slimy liquid washed over the Pint Puncher, mercifully dislodging him from Felicia's love tunnel. He fell to the ground, too overwhelmed by the ferocious crushing he endured along with the piercing stench of her climax. He was given a brief moment of respite as the vixen leaned back on a building to catch her breath. After such an explosive climax her mind had gone blank. She didn't even know what she was doing before the superhero showed up.  As she slowly came to her senses once more, there was only one recurring thought in her head. What else could she do to him?</span></div></div>",

He squirmed a little for good measure, but he was too worn out from the horrid torments he'd endured just a moment ago. Her pussy had crushed the fight right out of him and the vixen smiled at her accomplishments. She sat up and turned around, sitting on her knees and arching her back. Her legs were still disproportionally tall, but the rest of her was slowly catching up. The wracked hero got a tour of all her curves before finally being taken to his final destination. Before him was an ass the size of a bus. He gulped a little as the towering Felicia put her free hand on her buttcheek with a loud slap, pulling it aside to reveal her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween those massive cheeks lay a twitching hole, ready to get intimate with the superhero. She had him at her mercy, and the best he could offer was pathetic whimpering. Feeling a sense of impending victory, the vixen taunted her prey more. \"Oh yes, that's right. That's the place a 'hero' like you deserves. You can die like you lived, a pain in my ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the hero could call for help or hurl abuse at his tormentor he was swung towards her large buttcrack. She stopped just short, letting his momentum carry him further and slamming him against her hungering butt. The pain and humiliation both stung deep, but the hero wouldn't relent. He tried punching the sensitive ring, but the moment his fist was about to connect the pucker opened a little, swallowing up his hand and most of his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, eager aren't we? Well, don't let me keep you.\" Felicia said, her voice a mix of annoyed and gleeful. Her rear opened as wide as it could and with little subtlety or mercy she pressed his little body in. Soon only his legs were still sticking out. The vixen quickly sorted those out by plunging her finger deep in her ass. She felt the superhero's dick brush against her fingertip and pushed down on it just to add further insult to injury. He cried out in pain as the large digit squashed his manhood flat, but his screams were lost to the vixen's depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe narrow passage was painfully constricting, forcing the hero to breathe the fetid gas inside. Felicia helpfully added more by unleashing small farts every so often. The stink was pure, unfiltered horror, coming in straight from her guts. With each passing second the smelly tunnel seemed to bear down on him even harder. All he could do was wiggle helplessly in the hope he might find a way to push out of her butt when she was asleep or something. For now he would have to wait and endure the horrors of Felicia's bowels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen danced around triumphantly. Finally she had dealt with that superhero for good. There was no way he'd be able to escape her butt. In her reverie she smashed several cars and houses, but she didn't care. Who was going to stop her? The only one with the strength to stand against her was currently getting gassed in her butt. What does she do with this wondrous opportunity?</span></div></div>",

Around him, the Puncher realizes he's no longer in the park he was before, but in very large room on a large bed. He rubbed his eyes to see if what he was looking was was real. It was confirmed when he bounced himself a bit on the mattress he was kneeling on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brushed off his outfit and stood up only to notice a massive shadow casting over him. \"Nice to see you're awake, punk.\" a booming voice says to the Pint Puncher.

Her breasts bulged out from her chest looking similar to  large hills and partially covering her face from the boy's view and her hips matched her shoulder in width, but her butt looked like the size of mountains! The Puncher backs up and attempts to fly off away from her, but unfortunately she anticipated this move. She stretched her arm and grabbed the brat in mid-air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia brought the bug sized boy up to her face to meet her glaring green eyes and snaring teeth. He was almost as small as one of her eyes and couldn't believe it! \"Let me go, fiend!\" the Pint Puncher cried out. Felicia squeezed her hand over the hero slightly crushing his form, \"Don't tell me what to do you little brat!\" she yelled at him. \"I'm going to enjoy this.\" Felicia brings the Pint Puncher to her...</span></div></div>",

It wrapped around the upper half of his body, and slowly retracted the wet muscle towards her mouth, the young hero thrashing about in absolute fear. She wrapped her lips around his midsection, his legs flailing wildly while she held him in place. She took the time to lick up the hero's lower half, just to add to his discomfort. After a quick bit of licking, she sucked him up like a strand of spaghetti. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young hero was stuck in the mouth of a vicious vixen.

Plus, the hero was still sore from his time in the posterior prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen gave a little \"heh\" at her tongue sucker punching the brat. While the Pint Puncher shook off the initial strike, the stretched tongue swept his feet out from under him, causing him to fall onto his back.

The muscular appendage lunged at the hero like a powerful snake, coiling around his prone body. In an instant he was wrapped up in the constricting mass. Felicia bears down on her nemesis with savage strength, squeezing his puny body with her stretchy tongue. Thick saliva kept everything lubricated as she enjoyed his pathetic squirming in between brutal squeezes. Finally even this intense approach started to bore her. It was time to make good on her initial threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'bye tashty morshel.\" She said with her mouth full, letting her tongue thin out but keeping it wrapped around the hero to drag him back to her gullet. His legs were the first to feel its strong embrace. The Pint Puncher wanted to fight back, but all the torment Felicia had put him through sapped him of the strength he needed to resist. The vixen felt her helpless little morsel slide down her throat and eagerly assisted him with several strong gulps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero felt his body fall into the slippery embrace of her neck and soon he was swallowed completely, pushed down her esophagus on a short trip to her belly. Her could hear her heart racing with excitement. The hero wanted to believe her heartbeat was this fast because she had to fight hard to get him, but he knew the truth. She managed to catch him off-guard and this was the price to pay. But if she thought he would go down this easy, she'd be sorely mistaken. With vengeance on his mind the Pint Puncher dropped in to her stomach, landing in a puddle of pungent slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia patted her belly and took a seat on someone's house. She'd get back to villainy in a moment, but for now she was overwhelmed by her accomplishment. The town superhero was trapped in her gut. She smiled maliciously as she thought back to the horrors she put him through. The vixen couldn't wait to inflict that stuff onto the citizens of Glam City now that nobody could hope to stop her. Suddenly she felt a sharp push inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, nice try, hero. But you're not getting out that easily.\" She mused. Her insides were as elastic as the rest of her body, as the Pint Puncher just discovered. Even his fiercest blow would be absorbed with little effect to the vixen. \"Now just sit back and digest. Or if you're too tough for that, just enjoy the knowledge that I'm going to rampage through your pretty little town and nobody's gonna stop me. Maybe I'll even eat a few people to keep you company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother heavy punch followed, but the towering vixen didn't budge. Felicia simply got onto her feet and scanned her surroundings. The park was deserted now, everyone seeking cover to avoid getting caught up in the fighting. But it didn't take long for the first few curious heads to emerge from their hiding spots now that silence had fallen. Felicia eagerly rubbed her hands.</span></div></div>",

A group of standard cubicle workers are riding an elevator up to their floor, refraining to speak. A calm, orderly aura coated the elevator. The elevator stops, and a terrible evil appears on the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What up, bitches?\" says a noisy and rude bipedal honey badger. He sports a black thong (showing of quite the bulge), and worse yet, bore a horrible stench. The employees in the back had time to cover their noses before they could get a whiff, but those out in front were struck by his terrible body odor. What make his stench even worse is that, with a single whiff, most citizens become completely subservient to him, as shown by the employees that sniffed him got a glazed look in their eyes and slumped over. These workers have unfortunately run into the pheromone monster himself, Hank the honey badger. \"Goin' up?\" Hank squeezes between some of the dazed workers and presses the uppermost button on the elevator floor panel, the roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining workers cover their noses, but they're running out of breath. Unless they get off soon, they'll be forced to breath in that stench. Thankfully, they see they're floor is coming up. Unfortunately, Hank notices too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wall,\" Hank commands. The workers he controls step in front of Hank and form a wall of men in front of the elevator doors. The other workers struggle past Hank and try to wrench the wall of workers out of place while still holding their breath. Unfortunately, they can only watch in horror as the doors open in front of their floor, then close as the elevator continues upwards. Hank's grin grows as the elevator continues upwards. By the time they reached the floor Hank selected, the last worker couldn't hold their breath any more. They're forced to breath in Hank's scent and become completely subservient. \"Out.\" All of the workers in the elevator walk out onto the roof like zombies. Hank follows suit, grinning at his handiwork. However, he knew victory won't come this easy. He looks around the skies, waiting to see a certain white spandex, blue caped, wrestling mask clad brat of a hero fly in from the sky. He eventually sees a silhouette coming in, poised to land in front of him on the roof. He sees the hero of the town, the Pint Puncher, land fist down onto the roof, before turning up and revealing his gas masked face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so tough without your funk, eh?\" the boy mocks. Hank sneers, rolling his eyes at the kids confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get somewhere safe.\" The workers all crowd around into a corner of the roof, far from the hero and villain. \"Please, you're just delaying the inevitable, brat. Soon you'll all eat out of the palm of my hands.\" Hank stretches his head to either side, working out a crick in his neck. He stares at the Puncher with a confident smirk, extending an arm and taunting him with a contraction and extension of his index finger \"C'mon, shorty.\" </span></div></div>",

Almost immediately the people that Hank had under his control huddled up together with their arms outstretched for Hank to land on them. Who in turned landed as roughly as he could on top of the people while keeping the damage to himself to a bare minimal. \"Woo, wasn't sure if that was gonna work or not.\" Hank grabbed hold of one of the people from underneath him and used him as a towel to wipe up his sweat from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...!? What did you?\" Pint Puncher asked in surprise as he watched as Hank rubbed the man's face under his hairy armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? Isn't it obvious? Jeez, this is why I hate dealing with squirts like you,\" Hank replied as pulled open the front of his thong to rub the man's face into his groin. \"Man it's hot today. Didn't think I'd get this sweaty.\" The honey badger continued to rub the man into his groin thoroughly before finally finishing and tossing him aside. \"Phew all done. Anyway, why would I go and just land on the hard surface like that kid. I'd get myself hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're gonna use those people as some kind of pillow.\" Puncher shouted. \"And take the brunt of the fall for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better them then me,\" Hank smirked as he finally got of his pile of humans. \"And no matter how hurt they are. They'll always follow my order my orders to the T and always immediately.\"</span></div></div>",

Rhanier moves his foot back just enough for the boy to see Hank. His looks on in terror as the honey badger turns around and lifts his tail. \"For being the squirt he is, I made sure to cook up an extra special smell for him!\" Rhanier leaps away from the blast zone, the Pint Puncher tries to fly off, but he's too late. Hank unleashes a horrid, cheesy fart at the Puncher. Despite his attempts at trying to hold his breath, Hank's flatulence rushes into his nose. He breathed in Hank's hypnotic stench. Meanwhile, Rhanier chuckles as the boy gags on Hank's horrible fart, for only a second before he gets that familiar glazed look. Hank's grin widens upon noticing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kneel,\" Hank commands. The Pint Puncher gets up and gets onto his knees in front of Hank.

He grabs the Pint Puncher's wrestling mask and peels it off, exposing his true face to the smelly duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thinking. I don't want him to ever forget my smell.\" He shoves the boy's face into his armpit, rubbing and grinding him into his sweaty pit. \"For as much as they say they despise my smell, everyone that sniffs me wants to come back. Ha!\" He rubs the boy's face under his other armpit. He then grabs each end of the boy and rubs his entire body against the back of his neck. He then rubs him across his back, moving him downwards and downwards until he was grinding his butt into the boy's body, coating him in both sweat and gas. He makes sure to move the boy's face in between his cheeks, letting out another fart. \"You all love my scent, don't ya?\" He places the Pint Puncher between him and Rhanier, kneeling him down far enough so that his groin was level with the boy's head. He stands over one shoulder, then motions Rhanier over. \"Don't be a stranger, Rhanier.\" Rhanier stands over the Puncher's other shoulder, lowering his G-string and exposing his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoo-wee!\" Rhanier fans in front of his nose. \"Thank's for the wrag, Hank! I need this!\" The two lean their hip back, then thrust against each side of the boy's head, rubbing their dicks against the boy's hair. They grind their junks against him, each alternating between who rubs against the Pint Puncher's face, coating his face in gross groin sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This boy's not making things easier. Hey brat, get yourself some leverage,\" Hank commands. The Pint Puncher wraps his arms around each of his tormentors' legs, keeping him steady as they grind their musk into him. To make matter worse, the two were getting erect as they ground into him, both grinning even more wildly as they ran ideas through their heads. </span></div></div>",

His iron will was pushed to the very limit as he resisted the urge to submit, his body trembling and his knees buckling from the mental strain. His resistance didn't fetter Hank in the slightest as he continued to swing his cock to and fro. The hero's endurance was admirable, but none could deny Hank no matter how hard they tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher winced as the fiendish badger began to advance forward, his massive cock slapping against his thighs with each step he took. The closer he got, the stronger the effect became as the Pint Puncher's nose began to burn from the intense musky odor. What was more frightening was the lack of any urgency on the hero's face as Hank approached him. His subconscious was screaming at him to either create some distance or charge in for an attack, but all he could do was sit there and stare at the badger's enormous dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was only a matter of seconds before Hank was upon him with a smug grin. The hero was completely in his thrall and it showed by the wide eyed look of wonder on his face. He placed his hands on the hero's shoulder's, gently pushing down on the hero until he was eye level with his junk. If he wasn't enraptured before, that one act pretty much sealed it as the Pint Puncher was forced to breath in his musk directly. Any thoughts of escaping or fighting back were cast aside as the hero stared up at Hank's meat in awe. <i>How can he fit something</i> that <i>big in such a small thong?</i> he wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love my dick, don't you?\" Hank asked. When the hero failed to respond, he pumped his hips up and down, making the Pint Puncher nod as he followed every movement the badger's cock made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you do.  I gotta say though, you talked a real big game and for a minute I actually started to think that you were the ONE person in Glam City who wasn't interested in me. Looks like I was wrong\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher blinked and for a fleeting moment a sliver of reason began to creep into his mind. Hank was quick to take notice as he grabbed onto the back of the hero's head and yanked his mask off before mashing his exposed face into his fat, sweaty balls. The hero struggled against the villainous badger, the intense stench inciting his fight-or-flight response, but it didn't take long for the villain's musk to take hold of his mind. Slowly but surely, his arms eased up and fell to his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why? </i>the enthralled hero thought as Hank used his face to wipe away the sweat from his package.<i> Why am I fighting him? I should be listening to everything he tells me! He's so strong and... he smells so good...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once Hank was certain that his slave was properly under his control, he removed his hand from the back of the hero's head. He laughed as the Pint Puncher remained stuck to his crotch, his eyes shut tight as he breathed in his intoxicating aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I like to see. Now, how's about we get down to business?\"</span></div></div>",

The farmers at first thought it was a wild fire, but it wasn't hot enough to cause such a blaze. They started pondering about it until one of the farmer's workers spotted a cougar in the crop field.

Rowland throws both hands out in front of him like a familiar street fighter, which the Pint Puncher manages to duck under. Unfortunately, Rowland saw that coming. The next thing he knew, the cougar thrust his speedo covered bulge at the boy's face. He's swept off his feet as Rowland launches himself groin first onto the kids face, slamming him down onto the crop field, sitting on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I give you a preview of what's in your future,\" Rowland says. He wiggles his hips side to side, rubbing his groin over the boy's nose, forcing his musk into his nostrils. The boy struggles underneath the cougar as the stench is ground into his face. Rowland then starts rubbing himself back and forth on top of the Puncher's face, spreading the stench from his forehead to his lip. Eventually, the Puncher could swear there was more moisture on his face than in the muscled menace's speedo. The Pint Puncher can only smell cougar sweat now. Rowland grins upon thinking what else he'd do with the boy.</span></div></div>",

The feline's buff cheeks spread out a bit as he sits down, purring more loudly as he felt the kid's nose push at his sweaty pucker. The feline then started to grind his ass against the boy's face, getting more of his musky sweat off. \"Oh yeah, you would make a fine, sweat rag...\" the feline purrs out. The feline then felt a familiar pressure in his gut and smirks before a wet and loud fart is heard over the boy's face. \"Mmmff, sorry, my last meal gave me cramps\" The feline says with a chuckle as he keeps grinding the boy's face against his pucker.

The Pint Puncher cannot begin to describe the smell, or maybe he doesn't want to, knowing exactly how it would smell inside the cougar's ass. Another moan from Rowland marked the final second the Pint Puncher's feet were visible before being completely devoured by two muscular glutes. Growing his muscles caused Rowland to stand more than 30 feet tall now, believing to have won the battle, he pulled up his speedos. \"Is it comfy in there?\" He laughed as he went back to terrorize the crop fields, starting his fire once again and maybe keeping an eye out for a bystander that could give the Pint Puncher some company. After everything he went through, the Pint Puncher would be too weak to escape, and Rowland buttcheeks were bigger than ever, there was no way the hero could come out the way he came, and the putrid warm stink inside Rowland would make the hero weaker and weaker, it was just a matter of time before the only one who could stop Rowland right now were defeated for good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Pint Puncher wasn't giving up just yet, meanwhile, inside Rowland's bowels, the Pint Puncher was having the worst time of his life, he had fight Rowland before, but this time he was a lot quicker to get the upper hand on the hero, and this was his punishment. The air was thick and hot, making the Pint Puncher even more uncomfortable, also, the space was tight and every inch of stink was practically forced inside the hero's nose and mouth. He struggled the best he could, trying to slip his way back out, but it was useless, for Rowland, his weak struggles only aroused him, and made him chuckle, thinking about how much fun he was going to have his new little butt toy. Rowland was clenching his ass cheeks, preventing the Puncher from going that way, and also forcing more gas to be stored where the Pint Puncher was being held captive, every second meant another wave of gas coming his way and assaulting his nose. The only thing the Pint Puncher could think of was to try and fly from within Rowland's body towards his mouth, the villain would probably be caught off guard but... Would he be able to endure whatever Rowland's insides had in store for him? It was risky, but it could work. Another idea was to try to use his super strength to force his way out of Rowland's butt, a quicker way out, but it may just waste the last of the Puncher strengths and have him defeated completely. The somewhat muffled sound of outside fire and farm workers screaming in terror awoke a newfound strength from within the Pint Puncher, he had to get out, he was not going to be defeated this way!</span></div></div>",

Rowland was feeling a damn near erotic high from this. Even he didn't expect to be this turned on by tormenting the hero. It made an already impossible escape for the hero even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA touch of doubt washes over the cougar. Was he big enough for this? Of course he was. With nothing but his manhood he had pinned the hero down and was now casually tormenting him. But what if it was bigger? Once the thought had found its way into Rowland's mind he couldn't shake it anymore. Just to be sure, a little more wouldn't hurt, right? The cougar growled softly, the struggling hero stimulating him. It shook his focus, yet when the growth began it seemed to ease the process. Growls turned into grumbling moans as his growing member squashed and rubbed against the increasingly outmatched hero. Only when the domineering cock doubled the hero's body in size did he feel satisfied with his growth spurt. Maybe a little over the top, but without a doubt a perfect place for pesky superheroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowland reached down and pinched the trapped hero between two large fingers, pulling him free from the musky prison. The cougar got back onto his feet and pulled open his speedo with his free hand. The hero looked on in horror as he was moved over the gap. He saw the imposing meat-spire resting within the tight confines. It looked engorged, though not fully erect. The Pint Puncher screamed as he was lowered towards that enormous flaccid rod. Any attempt to fly away was shot down by a crushing pinch from the fingers holding him. The cougar laughed mercilessly as he stuffed his nemesis in his speedo. The hero's body was shoved as deep as possible, his face pressed into the coarse surface of Rowland's musky balls. A loud snap signaled his only escape route being cut off.

Rowland's massive member pulses and grows a little with each stimulating struggle. Space is scarcely available in the tight speedo and the hero feels himself get crushed between the unyielding fabric and the mercilessly growing cock. To the cougar he is becoming an increasingly clear little bulge in his pants. Only when his cock cannot be contained anymore and the tight confines begin to hurt it does Rowland intervene. He hums a little to himself, pleased with the hero's efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large finger reaches in and hooks around the growing shaft, pulling it out for all the city to see. Pint Puncher was left in the tight fabric of the speedo, now squashed beneath the cougar's balls. The towering villain looked at all the nearby people staring in awe and spoke to them. \"Your hero is currently struggling in here. When I'm done with him I expect your unwavering loyalty or you will find yourself squirming for mercy too.\" Already the huge cougar was proclaiming himself victorious. Pint Puncher seethed with righteous fury, determined to teach this arrogant evildoer a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowland grabbed his crotch, pressing the hero against his ballsack even firmer. Each of the swollen testicles was big enough to house several people, a fact the cougar was chillingly aware of. His pent up pleasure would probably fill a swimming pool by now, but the villain wasn't unloading just yet. He still had plans for the Pint Puncher, but the pathetic hero would need to be weaker first. Grinding him against his balls seemed to do the trick whilst providing plenty of powerful stimulation. Finally Rowland deemed his beaten opponent ready for the finishing blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo large fingers slide in and retrieve the battered hero. The brutal squeezing he'd endured in the speedo was a fate he wouldn't wish on his worst enemy. Slowly the Pint Puncher was lifted alongside a throbbing member several times his height. The cougar was nothing if not dramatic, taking his time to milk the hero's humiliating position. Slowly the monstrous cock comes into view below the dangling hero. The slit had already parted a little, disgorging a few large drops of pre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowland carefully lowered the hero to meet his tip, dipping his face in the pungent slimy pre for good measure.

It rose up, the slit sliding around the Pint Puncher's head. Rowland felt the extremely stimulating entry and knew immediately how he would have the hero meet his demise. A large hand took hold of the cock and began to slowly rub it up and down. The gentle massage Rowland was giving himself served mostly to stabilize the twitching tip. It spewed forth another wave of slimy pre, threatening to drown the hero. The cougar showed mercy and lifted the hero up, letting him sputter and cough whilst wiping away the pre in preparation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to feel so good going down my shaft...\" The cougar said, his voice heavy with malice and lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more the battered hero is lowered onto the slit, which hungrily opens up to accept his head inside. The huge cougar slowly lowered the hero further, gently stroking himself in the process. With each stroke a little more of the Pint Puncher vanished into the endless depths of Rowland's urethra. Even in a cock this enormous the passage was incredibly tight. Squeezing mass pressed down onto his body from all sides. But none of it was as scary as the vague notion that he was being pulled in. Against all odds the cougar's huge manhood had the power to perform some rudimentary swallowing motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowland simply held on to the hero's legs as his cock slowly devoured more of his body. Soon not even that was needed. The hero was stuck inside the sensitive head. Everything up to his waist being gripped by the immense surroundings. When his legs began to enter the cougar let go of them. \"Oh yes, that's the spirit. Wiggle for me, Puncher. Squirm all the way to my balls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgonizingly slowly the hero was pulled in deeper, his spandex-clad legs sinking down into the nightmarish tunnel. The feeling of the broken hero probing into his member was arousing on a level Rowland rarely if ever got to experience. His vision was blurry and his tongue hung out of his mouth. His legs felt shaky but he didn't want to move a muscle. Every part of this was perfect just the way it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero's descent was monotonous and slimy, the inner passage of Rowland's balls holding patches of pre and thick white cum. The walls constricted around him every time the cougar's hand passed by. He hurt all over from the beating he took, but his shame burned brightest of all. Not only was he defeated by a giant cock, the whole city got to see it. Even if by some miracle he survives this ordeal, the slimy insides of Rowland's manhood were going to haunt him forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tunnel split off and the passage suddenly widened. The hero slid headfirst into the cougar's balls, painfully swollen with pent up release. The Pint Puncher was fully submerged in the thick goop, punching the walls of his prison. Sadly all that did was send a wave of pleasure through Rowland. The enormous cougar couldn't hold back any longer. His legs buckled and he sat down, crushing several buildings to dust beneath his muscular ass. His masculine rod twitched and with a loud echoing roar he released the flood. Large strands of white slime shot far down the street, staining cars and people alike. The torrent continued until there was nothing left inside the cougar's sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing but the trapped Pint Puncher.</span></div></div>",

Already a small puddle of fresh cum was forming at the base of the squishy balls. The hero felt light-headed in the oppressive heat. Just standing up was an ordeal. He saw the tight passage above and the possibilities of escape it held. Though he was beaten to all hell, the hero tried to fly up and climb back out of this nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowland sat triumphantly, dazed by the sheer intensity of his orgasm. Thick ropes of cum were laid out before him, running down the street as far as the eye could see. Many cars were soaked and probably unsellable now. Even more amusing were the tiny people caught in the blast zone. It took them considerable effort to push themselves out of the sticky slime. A wide grin formed on the villain's face. He felt a very distinct feeling between his legs. He realized that the hero he fed to his enormous cock was still inside his balls. Exactly how he didn't flush him out didn't matter to the cougar. He was going to have fun with this. He reached down and fondled his balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher was wiggling himself out of the pungent room and into the length of Rowland's member when it hit. Everything around him shook violently and he was flung back into the spacious sack. The cougar playing with himself felt like an earthquake to the puny hero. The steadily growing pool of cum he shared his prison with was sloshing back and forth, washing over him. The warm slime sapped what strength he had left. Soon the potent stink of Rowland's musk began to assail the hero's mind as well as his lungs. He felt himself go more and more numb. He barely even registered the cougar shrinking down a little, the walls of his slimy prison closing in. The level of cum rose quickly and in just over a minute he was completely submerged again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the cougar did not give in to his basest urges immediately. He felt the hero's energy becoming one with his own. The defiant struggles had long seized but now he could feel his balls working their magic. He bit his lip, his loins were on fire. His manhood stood more erect then he'd ever thought possible, rock hard and painfully sensitive to the touch. Any people left in the street saw what was about to happen and ran for shelter in the shops and houses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mere touch the cougar exploded, his second orgasm in minutes launching another volley of cum down the street. The creamy white slime splattered onto cars, buildings and people alike. Their puny struggles were ever amusing to watch, but he was looking for something far more pleasing. Amidst the thickest trail of slime laid out before him the cougar spotted the sign of his victory. The people emerging fearfully from their shelters looked at the empty white spandex suit and fell to their knees. They were at Rowland's mercy now. He let out a bellowing guttural laugh. The cougar lived the rest of his days in pure bliss, filling all his time with tormenting and/or devouring the townspeople. Though he fed many more to his cock, the Pint Puncher would always hold a special place in the Rowland's depraved mind as he lived happily ever after.</span></div></div>",

No need to beg.\"  With a hardy grunt Rowland sprang to is feet.  Before Puncher could even remember how to breathe he grabbed the kid and dragged his musk stained face to the cat's repulsive left pit.  The burning menace lifted up his arm and let a splash of awful sweat drip out.  \"Well, here you go kid.  Just like you asked.  I hope you can swim, heheh.\"  He laughed as he slammed the poor child's face into his hairy, swampy armpit with a sickening squelch.  The struggles came immediately, but Rowland just loved it.

It was terrible!  It tasted like... Protein!  So much protein was in the cat's diet that the child would probably build some muscle just choking down the repulsive gastric fumes.

He then swung the little guy around, before throwing him into the ground. The Pint Puncher was struck against the ground, suddenly dazed on impact. He lied down on the floor, horribly dazed, unable to see straight. While he was dazed, he felt his arms lifted, something wrap around his arms, and then something spread his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision came back into normal stuff, and the next thing he saw was Muro's face. The fox was bent over, level with his face, wearing that same grin. Before the hero could even question his position, the fox leaned forward, and planted his lips on the hero. He felt the villain's nasty breath invade his airway. He tried to wrench himself free, but something was holding him down. He looked around, and saw Rhanier's arms wrapped around his arms, pinning them, as well as his legs over the Pint Puncher's, pinning them. The hero was stuck! He could only lie their and take the kiss from the villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe broke the kiss, and leaned back, admiring the trapped hero. Rhanier had him positioned such that he was forced into a sitting position, legs spread apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how resilient do you think this little guy is?\" Muro asked Rhanier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he looks like a wimp to be sure,\" Rhanier taunted. \"Probably wouldn't even last 15 strokes!\" The Pint Puncher had no idea what they were talking about. Strokes? What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's find out then,\" Muro said before licking his lips. \"If you don't hold it until 15 strokes, kid, we'll stink you allllllll over.\" With that, he lifted his foot, and placed it on the hero's groin. He gasped out, horrified at the feeling. Why was it feeling stiff down there? Unfortunately, Muro seemed to want just that. \"Let's count how many strokes it takes to beat the Pint Puncher~\" he cooed. \"1!\" He rubbed up the clothed length of the Pint Puncher's groin, and the hero squirmed at his touch. The amount of weight he applied was nowhere near enough to be painful. However, there was enough for him to press into his phallus. The pressure was unreal, it felt like a jolt of electricity ran up the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2!\" Muro rubbed up the length again, and the Pint Puncher felt the pressure again. \"3!\" He kept stroking and stroking, each stroke making the hero feel just dirty. He tried to pry himself free, but Rhanier made sure he was held tightly. His warning from before suddenly came into mind, can't hold it until 15 strokes. They'll gas him if he can't last until Muro counts 15? He kept struggling in the grip. He didn't know how he could hold it if Muro kept stroking him like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3! 4! 5! 6! 7!\" The hero was already up to 7, and he felt something beginning to leak. This must be what he meant about can't hold back. If he let's all of that out too soon, he was a goner!</span></div></div>",

They're all playing around, when they hear something rustling nearby. The group nearby all look towards the source of the sound. Suddenly, a great big German Shepard, walking towards them on all fours. The kids crowd towards him, cooing and giggling at the dog approaching them. They all pet him, and he pants and wags his tail in response. The dog leaps onto one of the children, cuddling him and getting cuddles from the boy. The dog licks his cheek, and the child gets a glazed look in his eye before getting up on fours a copying the dog's panting. The dog licks the other nearby children, and they all get that same glazed look and all copy the dog's stance. They've all become victims to the monstrous mutt himself, Charles, and his hypnotic saliva, with which he can render his victims to a state similar to his pups. Charles finally drops his fa\u00e7ade and stands upright, exposing a set of incredible muscles and size to rival a body builder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, kiddos. I've got lunch prepped at home,\" the dog coos at the hypnotized kids, still on fours, some yipping in response. Charles' grin fades as he picks up an all to familiar scent on the wind. A scent belonging to a certain boy clad in white spandex, blue cape, and white wrestling mask. A certain hero set on stealing his pups away. Charles growls in response. \"Get back, pups. Daddy's gotta deal with a bad man.\" He pops his knuckles, stretching his neck to either side, and looks towards the source of the smell. He finally sees the silhouette come into view, eventually slamming in front of him, revealing him to be the Pint Puncher. He stands upright and crosses his arms, glaring at the super sized dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe those are yours,\" the boy says.

The cause of the shaking was the aptly named Quaker, a huge bi-pedal elephant strode confidently after them with a huge smile on her face. She enjoyed the chase, but it was the anticipation of what was yet to come that was her real cause for excitement. She was taller than a house and loved to throw her weight around. Being an elephant, she had plenty of it to throw. She had a round belly and large breasts which she displayed proudly, but really enjoyed applying her full weight on anything smaller than her under her feet or her massive, round ass. At her size, anything smaller than her meant pretty much anything at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what she felt was a suitable amount of time, Quaker grew tired of the chase. The screams of the humans grew louder as an impossibly tall wall of earth suddenly shot out on all sides of them, trapping them.

She sighed deeply in satisfaction as she felt her rough sole make contact with his small body. She pressed her foot down enough to smother him and to ensure that he felt the pressure, but not enough to flatten him. A flattened body doesn't provide very good massages, she learned that long before getting her powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Puncher gasped for air as Quaker's foot covered his body and pressed. In his battles with previous villains, he would have expected this to be the end of him. But he learned that Quaker was not like other villains. She pressed her advantage, but only to a point. He felt the earth cave in around him, freeing his arms and legs. He tried to push  the huge elephant off of him, but she just responded by applying more pressure. He wasn't going anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard her muffled moans and sighs from high above as she rubbed her foot forward and backward across his defenseless body. He must have covered every inch of her foot. He thought his best hope might be to wait it out, that she would eventually get bored and leave, but the smell was horrid! Without access to showers and spending all day stomping around in mud and in the hot African sun, Quaker's foot had developed several layers of sweat. Each layer had dried and hardened, only to be covered by a new layer. He wasn't even sure if, after covering all that foot, if he had actually touched any physical flesh through the layers of dried, hardened sweat and mud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're not going to move and struggle, this just isn't as fun for me Puny.\" Quaker mocked from above. \"Lucky for you I know how you can make it worlds better. You might have noticed that I have a teensy amount of sweat and mud built up on my pretty little foot. Be a good little boy and use your super powered tongue to lick it clean for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout feeling a reaction or a response from the hero, Quaker gets agitated. \"I said lick you wanna be hero. Otherwise, I'll make you a permanent part of the terrain! I might not end up being the only elephant that tramples you today!\" she threatens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Puncher swallows hard.

Slowly at first,  but enough to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe added pressure makes the Pint Puncher's decision much easier. He decides that it's better to swallow his pride and live to fight another day than to end up buried in the middle of the African Savannah. He finds the strength to stick his tongue out and begins to lick. Quaker feels his surrender immediately and he feels the pressure subside. Not enough to lift her off, but back to a point where he wasn't worried about becoming a permanent feature of the turf. He knew the situation could, and likely would, revert if he stopped, so he continued to lick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each lick, the hero gagged. The only benefit was that with his mouth open, he wasn't forced to breathe through his nose and deal with the brutal smell of her sole. Quaker's foot was covered with salty, dry sweat and mud. He licked and licked, filling his belly with salt and grime. As he licked, the hardened sweat and mud loosened and fell into his mouth. He was forced to swallow each mouthful in order to continue licking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house sized elephant went back to moving her foot all over his body, making sure that he was unable to dwell on a single spot for too long.

Between the feelings of power and dominance that welled up from within her and the physical pleasure his licking gave her, Quaker wanted to ensure these moments lasted for an eternity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she shook with pleasure and power, the pressure she was applying weakened. She was subconsciously letting up on the Pint Puncher, giving him a chance to exhale even a little bit of clean oxygen and not the rancid air beneath her foot. What does the hero do with this new found space to maneuver? </span></div></div>",

He continues licking for now, and even amps it up a bit. He puts more force behind each lick. Despite his own disgust at the mouthfuls of sweat and mud he was continuing to swallow, he kept his mind focused on his end goal of escape in order to push on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he licked more eagerly, Quaker thought she may have broken the small hero. This made her feel even more powerful. The stronger licks enhanced the pleasure she was feeling until her whole body shook involuntarily, including her leg and foot that was keeping the Puncher pinned. Finally, Pint Puncher felt he had the right window of opportunity. He swallowed hard and pushed up on the elephant's foot with all his might. Finally, he forced the surprised Quaker to topple over onto her round rump. She looked up in shock as the masked hero flew up in the air to safety, out of range of her earth controlling powers. Or so he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuaker gave Pint Puncher an angry glare. She was not happy that this puny human had once again interrupted her play time. But her glare turned to a sadistic smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how you managed to get me off of you small fry. But in a few minutes, you'll really get me off.\" she threatened, still lying on her backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so Quaker. Your days of torturing people and roaming the savannah are through. I'll make sure of that.\" Puncher promised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuaker was unfazed. \"You should really try to keep that white uniform of yours a little cleaner Puny.\" she mocked. \"It has dirt and mud all over it. And what's that? I get the feeling that you may have recently been mixing some mud into your balanced breakfast. Come here and let me see if I can clean that off for you.\" she said with a smile.  Her gaze was locked on the flying hero, when something happened that shocked him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt himself being pulled toward Quaker at a rapid speed! Apparently her earth and mud control powers were not limited to mud on the ground. She was using her powers to manipulate all the mud that had been ground into his suit while he was buried beneath her foot! Even the mud he swallowed while licking her foot was under her control! He was helpless! Pint Puncher tried to fly away with all his strength, but it was like crawling up the fastest downward escalator in the world. He wasn't strong enough to avoid getting pulled in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his head to face her, and was hit immediately by her massive fist. It rocked him and sent him flying. Before he was able to put much distance between him and her, he was being drawn in again, only to be punched back again! Quaker packed a huge wallop, and it was all the Pint Puncher could do to stay conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was pulled back a third time, he braced for another punch, but none came. He felt his body slow down slightly. His eyes focused on his nude adversary and saw she had rolled onto her side and spread her massive _____, revealing her ______, which he was being pulled straight towards!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She glared at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had your shot at playing nice with me pipsqueak. But you didn't know how to mind your place. I'm going to show it to you and put you in it. Then we'll really have some fun,\" Quaker fumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he felt his body pull back from hers for a moment and he was turned in mid air. He again tried to fly away, but Quaker's powers held him steady. His head was aimed directly at the apex of her legs, showing him exactly what was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, his body was shot forward as if fired from a cannon. He was plunged directly into Quaker's waiting pussy with a fury. He felt her moans of pleasure as her muscles clamped down on him from all angles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm. You may have been right Puny,\" she moaned, still manipulating his body within her larger one, \"It was time for play time to end. I didn't know what I was missing. Thank you for showing me the light and for volunteering to upgrade yourself from toy to sex toy!\" she taunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, the Pint Puncher was not going to take this without a fight. He scratched and clawed to try to fight his way back outside. But Quaker's body was just to overpowering. He didn't feel as if he was making any progress, but he felt her body shudder every time he made impact. Suddenly, he felt his body surge downward and he slipped, feet first, outside of Quaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant leaned forward with an evil, but deliriously happy, smirk on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your few breaths of oxygen puny, because they will be you last for a long, long time,\" she said ominously before sending him plunging back within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis felt like a near hopeless position for the Pint Puncher.

Her vagina felt white hot with lust, but she didn't want to release her prey so easily. She slowed to a crawl as she paid less and less attention to the frightened people cowering all around her. She only had attention for the hero now. He felt the effect of this attention when her inner walls began to bear down on him. Their slimy surfaces no longer freely quaking and mashing him but putting in concerted effort to crush him. He screamed in pain as the elephant demonstrated the immense strength even her pussy had. The puny screams were music to her ears, muffled as they might be. These were her favorite moments in their lengthy and ongoing rivalry. It made dealing with this spandex-clad pest worth it. Her desire to crush him brought forth an earthshaking climax as both a flood of her release and a slime-sodden hero gushed out of her snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant was quick to secure her toy again. A column of rock rose up beneath him, delivering a punch to his gut and leaving him draped over it. He tried to regain his bearings but Quaker didn't give him a second. She brought her pussy down on top of the hero whilst extending the pillar he was on further. In an instant he is plunged back into her pungent depths. With her lust only slightly tempered by her first outburst, the elephant began to have eyes for her surroundings again. Most notably all those quivering humans awaiting her gentle touch. She moved towards them confidently, her inner walls grinding against the hero with each step. None of her victims dared to move as she hoisted her foot over them and brought it down. Their wails were music to her ears as she took great care not to outright squash them flat but rather squeeze them painfully. When their voices turned hoarse she stepped back and seized one of them in her trunk. The man was crying, begging for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn't have any of it as she opened her maw wide and threw him in. Quaker suckled on her new plaything, tormenting him with her awful breath and smelly saliva. After a few seconds she spat out the drool-soaked man and picked up another. She kept going from person to person, smothering them underfoot before exposing them to her foul mouth. A trail of people coated in sticky elephant slobber was left behind. All the while she kept kneading, squeezing and crushing the hero trapped in her nethers. She even hit a second orgasm, being every bit as quick to reinsert the hero before he could think of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after an hour of ongoing torment did she deem him too weak to pleasure her any further. One last time she used her powerful inner walls to nearly pulverize him, pushing him out with a third and most powerful climax. She was tempted to replace the barely moving wreck of a hero with a civilian, but she knew all too well how short those tended to last. Quaker was not in the mood to be dealing with any of that for a while. She looked down at the Pint Puncher with disdain, hoisting her foot over his body. Without mercy she brought it down as hard as she could, stomping the hero's torso almost perfectly flat. When she stepped back she snorted a little at the sight of the flattened superhero and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun while it lasted, Punchy. But since you're now so pathetic even squirming for my pleasure isn't happening anymore, I'll just leave you here. Who knows, maybe some other villain can still find something fun to do with you. As for me, I've got a busy schedule of tormenting puny humans whenever I want to. Bye Bye.\" She waved a little with her trunk before walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the background the beaten hero could hear more people being exposed to the horrors of her feet and bad breath, but he was powerless to act. He'd need some time to piece himself back together after this defeat. Does he get to limp away and recover, or will he be found by another supervillain as Quaker predicted?</span></div></div>",

He heard her laugh loudly at his panicked attempts to flee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few moments that felt like an eternity, the small hero felt his legs hit one of the elephant's massive cheeks. He was pulled deeper and then felt his body pressed up against her flesh by an unseen force. Quaker's laughter continued, but her face was hidden from view. All he could see was the inside of her round backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never had a massage from inside my ass before hero. You're making history!\" she said through her laughter. Without another word, she released her cheeks and clamped them closed on the puncher's small body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might decide to pull you in deeper eventually, but this will do for now.\" Quaker said. Pint Puncher could hear her muffled voice through the layers of thick fat that surrounded him.

Realizing that squeezing him flat wouldn't provide her the joy she desired, she chose a different course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to have made your decision hero. Let me see if I can change your mind,\" she threatened. \"If you're not going to give me any fun, I'll just have to do it myself!\" she pouted loudly.

He pushed himself away from the elephant's massive booty, only to be pulled back and roughly slammed against her meaty cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah. Playtime isn't over yet,\" she laughed, still manipulating his body with all of the mud and dirt on his outfit and in his stomach. She willed him away and flipped him horizontally, so that he was parallel with the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo!\" the Puncher screamed in useless protest as he felt himself lurch forward suddenly as if he was shot from a cannon toward Quaker's again exposed crack. This time, he didn't stop between her cheeks as she propelled him further until his head was pressed up against her rank anus. He didn't stop there. With a disgusting sucking sound, his head squeezed through her backdoor and Quaker moaned and shook in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have another choice Puncher.

Secretly, she wished he wouldn't have given up so quickly so she could enjoy all of his body inside of her. She knew she'd manage to get him there eventually though. For all of his \"super\" powers, he was still puny and weak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant fought the urge to lie in the middle of the savannah and enjoy the feelings of pleasure shooting up and down her body, originating from her ass, but she wanted more. She started to walk, swinging her ass with each step. The Puncher felt his face pressed deeply into Quaker's slimy inner flesh as she walked and wanted to scream in agony as her mighty ass cheeks compressed his body between them with every confident stride she took. He wanted to push away and free himself, but she was far too aware of his presence to create much distance yet. He needed to bide his time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the villain found a group of tourists taking photos and smiled. She always enjoyed the feeling of a foot massage, and she wondered how much better it would feel with the puny hero kissing one of her most sensitive areas. She needed to find out. With a sinister grin, the elephant lifted up a wall of earth to surround the civilians and lifted her foot over them before pressing down gently and rubbing her rough sole over their terrified bodies. As much as she enjoyed the feeling of dominance they gave her by being underfoot, their screams made it so much better. She tightened her anus around the Puncher as she manipulated her foot over the tourists. She was in pure ecstasy. </span></div></div>",

She was taking out her anger on his interruption of her play time. To make matters worse, she had manipulated the solid earth beneath him, turning into very goopy mud. Instead of flattening him into solid ground, the elephant was burying him beneath her weight as she sunk into the liquified turf. She smiled and laughed to herself as she sat atop the Puncher confidently. Her confident posture exuded a royal feel, as if she were sitting upon a throne. She may as well have been, she had the hero about as defeated as he had ever been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawing out her victory, she shifted her weight from side to side, grinding her ass deeper into the mud. The Puncher's nose and mouth were filled with the moist earth, and if he could get his lungs inflated enough to summon a breath all he would inhale would be more mud. He groaned beneath her weight, but the sound was absorbed fully by the layers of fat that sat immovable on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuaker sighed and lifted herself back onto her feet. She looked back over her shoulder at the battered body of the super hero. He groaned as he lay helpless in the deep crater her booty had created. He tried to summon the strength to escape, to fight back, or to even move, but he could not. All he could do was look up helplessly at the villain. Although he saw mostly the round form of her ass which stuck out like a shelf, yards away from the rest of her thick, muscular body. She locked eyes with him and blew him a kiss before leaping into the air once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooo!\" was all Pint Puncher could scream before he was again silenced by her earth shaking rear. Quaker was enjoying herself, but she felt the anger had been drained from her body. She was ready to play again. Those toys that the Puncher had let escape couldn't have gotten far, she thought, as she sat on top of her foe in stillness. She decided it was time for play time to begin again. She released a disgusting fart over the Puncher's beaten body before she moved. The force of it was enough to shatter the mud that had formed in his nose and the scent filled his nostrils. But he was too weak to fight back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she strode confidently away in the distance, she allowed the mud to reform into hardened clay. It locked the Puncher into place, buried in a deep ass-shaped crater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----An hour or two later----</span></div></div>",

The two are twin lorikeets, who were targets of poaching, scared for their lives every day. Eventually, the phenomenon occurred, and they became 10 foot amazon-like warriors. They were equally curvy, liked using their legs, and liked using their breasts and butt to finish off a foe. They also liked to use their curvaceous appeal to lower their opponents guard. They can fly with their wings, and they have an interesting ability. When they fist bump and say their chant, the two can transform. Lana usually transforms into something big to squash enemies, while Lois usually transforms into something fast to compensate for her sister. Both forms retain their wings. Their chant: \"Super Twin Powers, Activate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona - an anthro flamingo known for dancing. Before she transformed, her pack was forced away from their habitat. After she transformed, she's been gathering up her group and getting ready to storm the hotel built over her habitat. She intends on eating anyone that stands between her and her home. She stands at 12'9'', boasts D cup breasts, and a butt that can snap a tree in two. Her legs are thin, but powerful to dent steel. In addition to her powerful body, her dancing can cause a wide variety of things to happen. One dance can cause prey to become enticed with her long enough for her to gobble them up, one dance can shrink down her prey, and another dance could cause her fellow flamingos to swarm her prey and leave them open for an attack.</span></div></div>",

He was in the middle of the wilderness in Africa with no friends, no allies, no home base. But there was one thing that was universal, something he knew he could find and turn to in his time of need. He needed to blow off some steam and aggression, there was one place he was certain he could depend on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked hero took off like a rocket, soaring overhead until his eyes landed on an old building with boxing gloves and weights on the exterior. The universal sign for a gym. With a relaxed sigh, the Puncher landed and approached the doors. He paused before entering. Instead of the expected sound of weights clanging and metal on metal, he heard a variety of painful, distressed cries. Apparently, there would be no chance to relax, but at least he would be able to blow off some aggression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shoved the doors open with enough force they nearly flew off their hinges. Standing in the middle of the destroyed gym was a pair of tall, feathered amazons. They were 10 feet tall and covered head to tail with incredibly brightly colored feathers. As well covered as their bodies were, the feathers could not hide their thick, full curves. The bird's piercing eyes fell upon him immediately and their beaks curved into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Pint Puncher I presume?\" the girl on the right asked, her smile never leaving her face. The hero nodded, taking on a fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Lana, this is my twin sister Lois,\" the girl on the left continued. \"Welcome to our gym.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher lept into the air to start the fight, but the girls responded in kind, knocking him out of the air onto the floor! He realized he hadn't battled a villain who could match his flight powers yet. Before he could formulate a new strategy, the girls were upon him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana wrapped her body around his, forcing his gaze straight ahead at her sister. Much to the hero's surprise, instead of attacking, Lois started to dance. Her long wings, bright feathers, and curvaceous body allowed her to put on quite a show. She gyrated her hips and brought her chest close to his face only to withdraw. The hero found himself in a trance, unable to tear his eyes off of Lois. Even if he wanted to, Lana had him wrapped up tightly. He wasn't even trying to fight anymore, he let his body relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lana felt his muscles relaxed, her smile broadened and she released her hold over the Puncher, only to shove him forward into her sister's crushing cleavage. Laughing, the sisters stood to their full 10 foot height and embraced, smothering the hero between their massive breasts. Still, he was unable to fight back. His head was spinning from the bright colors and soft flesh that surrounded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey separated and let him fall to the floor in a heap. The girls lifted into the air and hovered over his body until he was lying on his back, looking up in awe. In unison, the girls dropped out of the air, Lana landing ass first on his face and Lois landing her booty on his crotch. The twins ground their firm backsides across his defenseless body. They lock eyes with each other and their dominant smiles grow broader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do they decide to press their advantage?</span></div></div>",

Unlike normal elephant and cheetahs, both of the transformations had large lorikeet wings on their shoulder blades, each pair large enough to accommodate each other.

The only other thing the Pint Puncher could recognize was the dominant smiles the transformed pair had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana the transformed elephant spread her wings and flapped, ending herself into the air, flying towards the Pint Puncher. The hero tried to run away, but Lois the transformed cheetah was faster. She ran in a curved path set to intercept the hero. Upon getting close enough, she flicked her legs outwards, locking them around his ankles like a pair of scissors. She tripped the Pint Puncher, causing him to face plant. Lois quickly ran away as her sister approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to get to his feet, but Lana was too close. She retracted her wings, and let herself fall towards the hero. He turned around just in time to see several tons of blubber heading right for him. He didn't have enough time to fly away as Lana belly flopped onto him. A thunderous boom echoed throughout the gym as Lana slammed onto the Pint Puncher, significantly denting the ground. She began to roll back and forth, grinding the hero underneath her newly massive girth, laughing all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got off of him, stood up, and looked down at the writhing hero, lying in the epicenter of the newly formed crater. She reached down with her trunk, wrapped them around his legs, and lifted him up, bringing him eye level.

But you, hero,\" she continued, her fingers running up his small body, \"You can take it, right?\" Lana cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, the lorikeet turned elephant anthro used her strong trunk to slowly rub the hero across her full breasts. She squeezes them over his prone body with her hands and laughs as he tries to struggle free, too beat up to put up much of a fight. Then, still holding him securely, she flaps her wins and takes flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana flies straight up into the air. The ceiling on the gym is fairly high, but Lana just powers through it as if it were made of paper. Her sister easily avoids the falling rubble and watches in anticipation of what was coming. Once she had reached a satisfactory height yards above the gym, Lana uses her massive trunk to slam the Pint Puncher straight down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe falls quickly, much faster than he made his ascent with Lana, and landed hard on the unforgiving floor of the gym. If his mind weren't wrecked with pain, he would have marveled at Lana's ability to throw him so hard and to avoid any of the debris from the shattered ceiling. The hero groaned and rolled over onto his back. Seeing this, the villain smiled wickedly and withdrew her massive wings back to her body to allow herself to free fall as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped like a rock, but maneuvered her body so that her immense, round ass was aimed directly at the defenseless hero! Her fall seemed to happen in slow motion for the Pint Puncher, who watched as her brightly colored backside seemed to grow larger and larger as she fell. He got flashbacks to his battle with Quaker, another elephant, and how he was badly outmatched until he could surprise her. But with Lana's wings, that strategy was useless here! Plus, there was still Lois lurking to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could formulate much in the way of rational thought, Lana landed with an incredible impact! Because of the height she dropped from and the speed she picked up on her descent, she didn't stop when she hit the ground. Her huge ass kept going until the her found himself in a deep crater, surrounded and buried by Lana's flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact was unlike anything Quaker had delivered. Lana was truly testing the limits of his strength, durability, and powers. She laughed loudly  once she finally settled to a stop. The Puncher could hear her muffled laughter through layers of ass fat and girth. She truly enjoyed being as dominant as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still in one piece little hero?\" She cackled as she began grinding her backside across his squashed body. \"I can still feel you down there, as flat and as small as you are, so you must be. I hope you're enjoying this as much as I am! No human has survived long enough to be pressed beneath my glorious ass in this form before.\" she said gleefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana pulled herself out of the crater she had created and was greeted by the sound of Lois laughing. Lana spun around quickly to face her sister, when she realized the Pint Puncher was no longer in the crater. He had been flattened and stuck to her elephant size rump!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not ready to part ways just yet huh?\" she taunts, shaking her hips and taking the hero along for the ride. \"I suppose we can have some more fun then...\" she finishes, suddenly unsure of how to continue her fun.</span></div></div>",

He tried to struggle, to lift a single arm, but he was too weak. The two had completely dominated him since he walked into the gym, and now Lana was gonna use him like a toy. Lana gave the hero a few seconds to take in the sight before him, to know exactly what the hero's fate was. Her trunk brought the Pint Puncher closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made sure her approach was slow, torturously slow. The Pint Puncher was forced to endure every moment he was brought close to the awaiting backdoor. After what felt like ages for the hero, he was stuffed head first into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo~\" Lana moaned out as his head entered. She continued to stuff him in, him too weak to so much as flail his legs.

The narrow passage seemed to move slowly, giving the superhero the vaguest sense that he was still sinking in deeper. The slimy tunnel slowly got tighter and tighter until he simply couldn't slide any further. Lana's response to this was to bear down on him with all her might. The obliterating force pressing on him paired with the inhuman stench found deep in her bowels finally became too much. Pint Puncher's struggles seized and he slipped into unconsciousness. No amount of further squeezing seemed to jar him awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana almost felt sad. When she taunted him she'd hoped for a few more rounds of humiliation before finally sealing the deal. But apparently the mighty Pint Puncher wasn't that much of a hero as they were led to believe.

Lana followed suit, staying in her elephantine form to maximize the enjoyment she would feel from adding the unconscious superhero to her mighty butt. That glorious satisfaction was all she needed. Lois could take every other human for now. They dropped into a part of town not yet disturbed by supervillain attacks. Lana sat herself down, accidentally flattening a few humans. Lois landed in the street and looked at her current leopard form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many people! I'm going to need something with a little more... capacity.\" She said as she skipped over to her sister and bumped her fist. \"Super Twin Powers, Activate!\" they cheered in unison and Lois took on the shape of a large, pudgy hippo. Immediately she tore off after the panicking humans, gobbling them up like it was going out of style. Lana simply sat there, patting her humongous gut. She didn't need to eat another bite. The sensation of the superhero slowly becoming one with her was all she'd need. The brightly colored elephant just lay on her back, basking in the afternoon sun and going for a very satisfied nap.</span></div></div>",

I think we've found our perfect test subject Lana,\" she responds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Lois speeds out of the gym. The hero has no idea where she ran off to and Lana is not in the mood to explain. Instead, she runs her hands over her ass, massaging the Puncher deeper into the flesh of her fat backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're enjoying yourself with my ass hero,\" Lana taunts \"We're going to make sure you become <i>veeeerry</i> familiar with it,\" she finishes with a laugh. She struts around the room, but soon tires of waiting for her sister to return. Her eyes fall on the crater she made when she originally landed on the hero and her smile grows broader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" she says quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Lana turns and slowly lowers herself back into her own ass shaped crater. Finally figuring out what was about to happen, the Pint Puncher used all of his reserve strength to push himself off of Lana's elephant shaped ass. Unfortunately, collecting the necessary strength after his battle with the twins and his battles with Quaker took too long. He ended up launching himself directly into the crater! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana gasped when she felt the hero dislodge himself, but was able to spot his landing without stopping her own descent. She simply chuckled and continued on her current trajectory, quickly cutting off any available escape routes the hero had. The Puncher's response was much less enthusiastic, as he looked up to once again see a brightly colored ass heading straight for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was able to make out the sounds of Lana's muffled moans of joy and pleasure as her ass made contact with his much smaller body. He tried to hold her up or push her off, but he simply didn't have the strength. As Lana applied more and more of her weight, he collapsed in a heap beneath her. The lorikeet turned elephant anthro sighed happily as she sat atop the fallen hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she got comfortable, Lois returned. She held a syringe filled with a bright orange liquid. The twins were gifted in more ways than one. They had managed to develop a formula that, if the subject it was injected into was strong enough to survive it, would give their body a putty like state. For two girls who thrived on squashing and smothering their victims, there was no greater joy than what this formula could bring them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her sister's arrival, Lana quickly stood, revealing the Pint Puncher's defeated form in the crater. Lois shot her sister an annoyed look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'd better still have the strength to survive the serum Lana!\" she seethed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana just shrugged. \"At least we won't need to worry about subduing him to inject him!\" she said cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois sighed as Lana wrapped her trunk around the Puncher, presenting his unconscious form to her sister. Lois injected the serum and stood back and watched. The hero's body seized instantly and his eyes shot open in shock. He looked at the twins, who had evil grins on their faces. He didn't know what they did to him, but he knew it wouldn't be good. His muscles all tense up at once and he burst free from Lana's grip. He tried to prepare a fighting stance, but found he had little control over his muscles. They tensed and relaxed at a rapid rate, sending his mind into a confused frenzy. Finally, exhausted, he passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters grew closer and saw that he was breathing. They looked at each other gleefully. He survived! Now the only question was, how would they play with him first? </span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, underneath, the young hero was starting to recover from that show Lois gave him earlier. He started to realize these two were slowly, but surely beating him. And what a humiliating way to beat him. The combination of their flirtatious tones and butts on him started to stir something in the Puncher. And Lois' rubbing wasn't helping.

She lifted herself up off of his groin, showing off a bit of bulge around his groin area. The Pint Puncher heard Lana chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they are, are they?\" Lana said a sultry, borderline taunting tone. She turned towards Lois. \"Well, why don't you treat that excitement?\" Lois nodded, a wide grin on her face. She sat down on the Pint Puncher's legs, and circled the bulge with her index finger, getting him more and more excited. With just a few circles, his bulge grew to its full length. Giggling, Lois positioned herself, and sat down, planting her curvy buttocks around the bulge, issuing a sharp gasp from the Pint Puncher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to thrash about, which only managed to rub his groin around Lois' buttocks. The two laughed loudly at his panic. What's even worse was that Lana's butt was smothering him, slowly driving him into unconsciousness due to air loss. He started to struggle less and less, and the two got a mean idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Puncher, I'm gonna let go of your arms real quick. You can push one of us, then the remaining one will grab your wrists. Y'know what that means?\" Lana started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means you can only get rid of one of us!\" Lois chirped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me?\" She rubbed her butt to emphasize her next point. \"Do you like being a seat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois clenched her buttocks around the Pint Puncher's erection to emphasize her point. \"Or do you need someone to milk you?\" The Pint Puncher had to decide fast. For a brief moment, he'd be able to get rid of one of the lorikeets.

Lana grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is, is he?\" she said. \"You're not really a hero, are you?\" she asked the Puncher. The hero was taken aback by that question, of course he was a hero, that's why he was fighting Lana and Lois. \"You may tell everyone you're a hero, but you're just lonely, aren't you? You want a big, strong creature to rule over you and make you feel weak at the knees, don't you? That's why you play dress up: so you can find someone to bully you until you can wank one out, isn't that it?\" Lana said.

In fact, his hands and legs were restrained! Ordinarily, he'd be able to break these restraints, but Carol was nearby. He was helpless, he could only watch as he was stripped naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was restrained against a heart shaped board, lifted a couple of feet off the ground. Multiple cameras were on him. He realized the twins commandeered a game show for their event tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a while, the dear hero of the town fought for the good of humanity!\" Lana continued. \"Or did he? We're his heroics just a cry for love? How else do you explain how a 'superhero' finds himself squashed up against so much bad guy dick and bad girl booties?\" The Pint Puncher felt livid. Not only were they making fun of him, but they had the gall to make him out to be some sort of pervert! Unfortunately, he could do nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking upwards, he noticed a screen with a swirl spinning in the center and everything Lana was saying fly across the screen. Were they trying to brainwash him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, tonight, dear villains, let me beseech you! Come tonight to show our poor, lonely guy that we're here to show him some love!\" Lana continued. She backed up towards the hero, and began to rub her butt against his dick, illiciting some moans and squirms from the captive hero. \"I mean, how can you say 'no' to a cry for help like this?\" Off stage, footsteps could be heard. \"And speak of the devil, the first lover for tonight just showed up!\" A spotlight pointed towards where the villain would show up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher began to understand. If he isn't careful, these twins are going to hypnotize him into acting as some sex-hungry human that'll beg for favors.

The boar stared down at him with a grin that made the hero shiver to his core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Borris!\" Lana exclaimed. \"So glad to see you made it here! Are you ready to show this l'il perv some lovin'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You could say that,\" Borris said. The Pint Puncher saw him lean down to Lana's ear and whisper into her ear. He also distinctly heard Lana whisper \"You can't eat him.\" He didn't know how the next few moments with Borris were gonna play out, but none of the options looked good. Borris eventually turned around and grinned at the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of respect for the hosts, I'm not gonna eat you... yet,\" Borris said. The Pint Puncher's fears failed to quell, for the boar's hands were already pulling down his shorts, which already sported a tent. He eventually kicked off his shorts, revealing a member even bigger than the hero's body. He squirmed and shook harder than before, but Carol's powers were at full effect.</span></div></div>",

He smiled at the puns he made in his head as his smelly rod came closer and closer to the trapped hero. The boar barely needed to touch it to keep it standing fully erect. He couldn't resist it any longer. One quick cheeky lick then. His large slobbery tongue dragged over the Pint Puncher's body, who could only squirm in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmmm... one day you'll be mine and mine alone. But for now, I'll settle for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hungry Hog stood up and stepped forward, the stench of his approaching cock growing a hundredfold. The huge rod throbbed with unrestrained anticipation as it first touched the hero. Immediately Pint Puncher felt dirty in a way not a dozen showers could clear up. Feeling the boar's heat on his bare skin was uniquely terrifying. His delighted snort and grunt only sending more shivers down the hero's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another step the full length of Borris' cock was pressed against the trapped hero. He could now clearly feel the boar's excited pulsing member. It's weight was incredible, no doubt backed by the boar leaning slightly into him. The board holding the Pint Puncher creaked a little, but held on. It was made for far more intense loving it seems. Something the boar was all too eager to start with. His cock began to slowly ride up the superhero's body, its head moving up and onto his face. Slowly the boar alternated between squatting down and standing up. His cock ground against the hero heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Pathetic Puncher, I know you love this too. Just put your hands on it and... oh... hehehehe\" Borris chuckled darkly, loving the unrestrained punishment he laid upon the hero. Stroking his cock over his puny body wasn't a first, but the absence of his clothes made for something much more intimate than even the boar had expected. To him he was merely stroking his erection against the Pint Puncher, but for the hero things were much more dire. His super endurance was only somewhat effective. Not even Carol could completely shut that down. He needed it too. It felt like the boar leant into him more and more, pressing his dick down with his belly. The hero wanted to scream and cry, but he wouldn't let those damn lorikeets have the satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panting boar rubbed himself against his victim harder and harder, building speed and squeezing the body beneath his erect rod. Pre leaked out, dripping onto the Pint Puncher's face and smearing itself between the two for some much needed lubrication. The rubbing became accompanied by a wet slapping sound as a result. Borris could not hold himself much longer. His balls ached for release. </span></div></div>",

Neither of them had ever even considered it possible. Borris looked down at the trapped hero and simply said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Punchy, spread em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPint Puncher's eyes widened with shock. What on Earth did that sadistic boar just ask? Did he really want to try and fuck him? Borris' cock is as big as the hero's whole body, there's no way that's going to fit. What was he playing at? Why didn't Lana or Lois interfere? This mad hog was surely going to kill him. Borris grew impatient with the trapped superhero and put a heavy hand on each of his thighs. Pint Puncher bucked and wiggled, but those filthy hands just slid up to his waist. With an uncaring grip he grabbed the hero's buttcheeks and pulled them apart. It was one of the most disturbing things a supervillain had done to him recently. He quietly began to wish he was just being mashed by the boar's cock again. But said cock was needed elsewhere. Its heat was suddenly felt between the hero's legs. The cock head was pressed as far as possible, pushed tightly against the superhero's ass. But what would happen now? The superhero felt a very uncharacteristic shiver run up his spine.He looked up at Borris, who was too giddy to even taunt him. Questions still plagued the hero when the boar's balls, filled to the brim, released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe length of the boar's member seemed to widen slightly as the surge of cum rose up. His grip on the hero's waist became even tighter as he pushed his dick against Pint Puncher's butt. A tiny jet of cum shot up, more came down but this flood was trapped right out of the gate with nowhere to go. Nowhere but in. The trapped superhero shrieked in surprise when he felt the hot spunk touch his rear. His screams turned to horror when he felt the warm goop push inwards. His pucker wasn't able to hold of the pressure and boar cum began to pour in. With disturbing detail the squirming hero could feel the flow of hot boar juice in his bowels. It was uniquely disgusting, but he was completely helpless to stop it. More and more of his digestive tract was overwhelmed by the surge of Borris' release. It reached his stomach and began to rapidly fill it. The Pint Puncher felt his belly bloat a little before his stomach had reached capacity. The boar looked almost at the end of his climax as the warm slime ran up Pint Puncher's throat. The hero hacked and coughed, spitting out some of the stuff on to his chest. The boar looked down at the hero with smug satisfaction. A large hand petted the bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there Punchy, wasn't that fun? Now I'm going to sit in the audience and watch the next contestants. And when they declare me the winner, I'll eat you on national TV. Maybe I'll even give you a bit more special sauce beforehand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boar pulled his boxers back up, concealing his deflated rod. He walked over to the audience section, filled up with little chairs and simply plopped himself down on a dozen of them. His big butt easily crushed them all flat as he kept shooting sultry looks at the trapped hero. Lana and Lois flew in to examine their victim. Through the magic of a commercial break they whipped him back into shape, ready for the next round. The taste of Borris' cum was still in his mouth when the hero looked at the door. His next tormentor was...</span></div></div>",

He flexed to the camera, showing off his muscles. Lana walked up to him and whispered in his ear, presumably explaining the situation to him like she did with Borris. Rowland grinned and turned towards the Pint Puncher. He then walked forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what you look like without the mask,\" he said, a disturbing grin on his face. He got close to you, and began to hook his thumbs around his speedos. He pulled them down, revealing his thick member. He might've been 13 inches long! He licked his lips while you stared down at him. \"Like what you see? You seem to be looking awfully hard at it.\" You blushed madly at his statement, and you were about to object. However, he got too close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowland shoved his hips between the hero's legs, not penetrating him. He kept up his grin, which, for some reason, made the hero feel hot. He began to chuckle. \"You seem to be growing, loner,\" he said. The hero didn't even want to look down. \"Don't worry, I'll only hurt you in all the right ways.\" He leaned forward and began to lick at the Puncher's neck, forcing a moan from him.

Perhaps a side effect of the cougar's control of fire. He leant his whole body over the superhero's trapped frame. The licking went on unabated and soon the villain felt Pint Puncher prod him in the belly. He stood up a little and observed the hero standing at full mast. Every fiber in the superhero's body wanted it to stop, to stop giving Rowland reasons to think he was into this. But it was to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, you must be thirsting for a piece of me. Alright then.\" He said, rubbing his hands together. He grabbed hold of the hero's erection. Pint Puncher yelped in surprise when the furred hand squeezed and pumped a little. He'd never felt this pent up before, where was it coming from? He'd been up against half a dozen supervillains today alone. Maybe one of them had a power he'd not registered before. Rowland couldn't give less of a shit as he continued playing with the pinned hero. A single large hand was plenty to work the entire length. He almost felt pity for the puny hero. But his own cock throbbed in anticipation. A curious spark hit him and he opened his hand, letting the hero breathe a little easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis comfort came to a quick end when the warm rod of Rowland was added to the party. He slapped it against the hero's paltry offering and closed his hand again. Rowland's offering humiliated the Pint Puncher's. Perhaps not too crazy though, since the cougar was a few feet taller. Then there was his ability to grow even bigger and the hero alltogether couldn't feel too bad about himself. He was concentrated more on the heat radiating of the large member pressed against his own. Rowland's tongue hung out as he slowly pumped his hand up and down. He massaged two cocks at once and his able hands worked magic. In no time he was really to blow. Judging by the state of the hero, he wasn't far behind. Pint Puncher twisted and turned his head, disgusted and horrified. He had no control over what was happening downstairs. His shame felt intense enough to burn straight through his bindings. With his cock primed and ready, Rowland breathes heavily in the hero's face before...</span></div></div>",

Be a champ and cum for me when I finish all over you, 'kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero shuddered a little at the thought of the cougar getting to abuse him for another round should he win this twisted tv show. The mere thought of that oversized member trying to squeeze inside of him was painful already. For this round Rowland merely took a step back. The glowing warmth radiating of his member dissipated but the hero felt anything but relaxed. He knew the muscular cougar still had a trick up his sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorris sat in the stands, chuckling at the cougar's attempts to humiliate the hero. His own cock twitched a little seeing Rowland rubbing against the Pint Puncher. He could appreciate the effort, even though the boar was still quite confident he would win this. He salivated a little at the idea of eating the hero live on tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowland grabbed his own manhood with both hands, pointing it at the trapped hero and pumping fiercely. The full length of his rod throbbed visibly, yearning for release. The only thing the Pint Puncher could do was look away. \"Hngghh, here... it... comes!\" the cougar had a hard time announcing his final blow through his own pent up lust. A powerful and loud <i>SPLRT</i> announced the first slimy volley. It easily bridged the gap between villain and hero and splattered all over the chest of the Pint Puncher. The second shot hit him there again, soaking most of his body in cum. The surge of pleasure made it hard for the cougar to do anything, but with all his willpower he pulled his member up just a little for the third and final round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thick lance of cum shot forth and landed squarely in the hero's face. It was voluminous enough to completely drench the Pint Puncher's head, leaving it dripping with warm slime. The uncomfortable heat of the dripping goo now coating the hero was beginning to have its effect. The potent musk was sprayed just about right up his nose and the hero lost the last vestiges of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe puny manhood of the Pint Puncher dribbled out a small offering, barely even noticeable compared to the intense hosing down he'd just received. Rowland let out a bellowing supervillain laugh. The boar in the stands applauded him and his beautiful work. No part of the hero was left unattended, his whole body dripping with the steaming release of the muscular cougar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahahaha, that was awesome. Rest assured, hero, that there will be plenty more where that 'came' from if I win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorris jokingly booed the cougar for his shitty pun and the laughing Rowland took a seat on the floor next to the boar. The two chuckled at the hero's misfortune together. The Hungry Hog added onto his laughter. \"Y'know, If I win, I've got to see if they'll let me have help in my final humiliation of that pesky brat. 'Cause while he belongs in this belly I kinda wanna see the look on his face when you pump him full.\" The cougar laughed in response. \"If you win, I'll gladly provide your hero snack with some cream filling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their two audience members kept giggling back and forth Lana and Lois hired an intern to clean the worst of the cougar's cum off the hero. Though perhaps it was less hiring an intern and more threatening to eat some of the cowering tv studio personnel if they didn't help them. Several minutes of tv magic passed and the hero was cleaned up and ready for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cameras turn to the pair of lorikeets as they announce...</span></div></div>",

Like a kid on Christmas she bounces towards him. Both lorikeets look at eachother with a satisfied smirk. This was the right contender to introduce to the show. The amazonian wolfess swells with lust almost literally. Seeing the Pint Puncher in his current state causes her to grow bigger. Lana and Lois urge her not to break the studio and Shenny concentrates hard on retaining the optimal size. Even Borris and Rowland shuffle a little backwards, just in case. Sitting on hands and knees before the trembling hero is a lusty wolfess with a serious temper problem. But with the hero unable to resist her, anger is hard to come by. Instead she feels mostly... playful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know who you pissed off to end up like this, but trust me Punchy, you're going to be in for the show of a lifetime.\" She turns her attention to one of the cameras and addresses the people in the city. \"And if I win, you all get to watch as I suck your mighty superhero into my pussy. You'll agree it's an experience to <i>die</i> for\" Shenny's grin was ever so smug, pleased with her bad pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But let's not talk about just the climax, there's some foreplay to be had...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vast wolfess leaned in close and sniffed loudly. The fear permeating the air was only slightly overshadowed by an uncomfortable air of lust. Unsurprisingly she was getting aroused at the idea of having him at her mercy. But it wasn't just her arousal she smelled. Faint hints of boar and cougar spunk masked a most distant smell. It seemed to originate from the hero's crotch. She sniffed his privates so fiercely his exposed floppy member got pulled into the large nostril. Shenny barely even noticed, but the Pint Puncher felt tainted in ways he didn't think possible. The tiny amount of snot now clinging to his member was stomach-churningly disgusting. But he'd faced worse before, he would not give in so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, some part of you is into this, isn't it Punchy? I can't blame you, there's so much of me to admire you must be going out of your mind. But allow me to focus your thoughts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hefty dangling bosoms filled the hero's vision as she draped herself over him, smothering his head between her tits. Shenny loved the near complete lack of fight beneath her but soon she was reminded that she didn't have the entire day to torment the hero. Not a problem. She would show everyone why she should have the honor of ending the menace called the Pint Puncher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoisted herself up, sitting on her muscular knees and spreading her legs a little. Only the superhero had the right perspective to see between them. To see the tiny dribble of arousal leaking from her nethers as she shuffled closer. The stench of her lust built up as she got closer and closer, her man-sized pussy approaching the trapped hero. As she neared her victim she spread her legs further, the fuzzy periphery parting to reveal the glistening pink insides of her sex. In the middle of it he saw the fearsome passage into the depths of her love canal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't tell you how long I've waited for this moment. Here I come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny moans as she closes the final gap, mashing her pussy against the board holding the pinned hero. He is flattened between the unmoving board and the overwhelming wall of glistening flesh. pungent slime is rubbed onto his body and into his nose. Lana and Lois watch with rapt attention as the wolfess goes to town, slowly humping and grinding against the board. They were happy they arranged for such a sturdy construction. Even Shenny did not have to hold back a thing. She happily abused this blessing by grinding down on the hero with all her pent up desire. He screamed in pain and disgust, but all he achieved was having more feminine slime rubbed into his mouth. Without skipping a beat she beckoned over one of the lorikeets and whispered in her ear. The brightly colored bird woman nodded in agreement and finally the hero was given a reprieve. He was slathered in her arousal from head to toe, his member semi-erect from the thick musk hanging in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, that was good...\" The wolfess wanted to add more, but she simply didn't have the words to describe the satisfaction flowing through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immense she-wolf wanted to finish with some spectacle. She'd confirmed with the lorikeets the board could handle it. With that final reassurance in the bag Shenny only has to pick her preferred finish. She could give him a little sample of what's to come. A brief taste of the heaven that is her innermost sanctum. She could slide him, board and all, into her pussy. She would straddle him and lower herself, plunging him into her depths. Or maybe she could subject one of the human 'interns' to some quick fun in her pussy. Forcing the hero to watch, powerless to act, breaking his spirit for all to see. The wolfess gloated at her own devious mind. </span></div></div>",

He would get to experience her love tunnel soon enough. A little human 'intern' on the other hand? He or she wouldn't last long enough for a full show. Perfect for a quick tease.

Oh who cares, what matters is how good you're going to make me feel. Just remember, if you're not squirming I start squeezing.\" The man gasped a little and immediately began to wiggle in her hand. The wolfess had to suppress a giggle at his misunderstanding, but she could admire his obedience. Time was of the essence so she quickly lowered him to her waiting pussy. The man-sized netherlips quaked with delight, parting enough to reveal her most intimate parts to him. The dark tunnel before him got closer as his head was pushed between the slippery lips. He was pushed inside almost without resistance. Shenny moaned loudly as she felt the squirming human stimulate her innermost pleasure centers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero shook with rage. The wolfess was using an innocent man as her personal sex toy, plunging him deep into herself. The man was pulled out for a breather now and then, but only so she could enjoy the pleasures of inserting him all over again. Everyone was watching with quiet attention. Borris and Rowland both feeling their member stir with enthusiasm. They didn't know what aroused them more. The wolfess playing with her volunteer or the impotent rage of the trapped superhero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny was surprised by the human volunteer the lorikeets had given her. She didn't have to squeeze or coerce him to action at all. He just kept going inside of her. Even when his feet slipped from her fingers and her ravenous pussy slurped him in completely. His spirited squirming almost gave her the impression he liked to pleasure her. She gritted her teeth and tried pushing him out. When a slime-soaked foot popped back out she quickly took hold of it and pulled her little man-toy out. The volunteer was drenched from head to toe in pungent juices, but his smile couldn't be bigger. The intense exposure to her sex had broken his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just look how happy he is, Puny Puncher. Don't you want to experience pleasure like that? When you're finally mine I'll show you all the joys only a woman of my stature can offer you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled on all fours towards the stands. The large wolfess was too big to stand upright, but she didn't need to. A few powerful kicks reduced some of the empty stands to splinters and created enough room for her to sit down. She took her human volunteer with her to provide pleasure whilst she sat waiting for the remaining acts. Shenny even promised the lorikeets to keep the moaning down so she wouldn't disrupt the other contestants. With the man in her hand she rubbed herself, grinding him gently against her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lorikeets quickly ordered their remaining interns to wipe Shenny's arousal off the hero and the stage and within minutes he was ready to receive the next contender. The doors opened once again to reveal...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a loud belch the doors fly open to reveal Helen, the plump, gassy and greedy hippo. She shuffles inside, barely fitting through the oversized doorway. Her van-sized body sloshed and jiggled, her immense butt swaying with grace as she took her place on the stage. Her hungry gaze scanned every inch of the exposed hero, thinking of the best way to use her time on air with him. It was all so very enticing. Just her, the Pint Puncher and not a thread of clothing on either of them. The board he was attached to was an interesting contraption too. Able to hold down the hero and keep him subdued. The hippo was impressed. Before her time started she found a moment to quickly ask the lorikeets a pair of questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, where can I buy one of those boards?\" Lana giggled loudly, looking at the hero. \"We'll talk after the show.\" Lois reassures her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, second, can that platform slide down so he's flat on the ground? My butt is itching to test him out as a cushion. It can take that, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just signal us and we'll drop him. And yes, it can handle even the biggest villains, don't hold back.\" The three villains smiled and Helen walked on to the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher kept squirming. No matter how futile it was, he wouldn't let these villains break him. He would resist it all, break free and punch every single one of them right in their stupid faces. Then maybe punch Shenny a few extra times for tormenting that poor man just to get a rise out of him. These monsters would pay for humiliating him publicly. With a bitter scowl he looked at Helen, who offered him nothing but smiles in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my Punchy, you seem to be all tied up. Too busy to come and stop me from robbing every bank in the city?\" His eyes widened in shock. \"Haha, don't worry, I'm only joking. The robberies will start after I deal with you on live TV. I don't even have to win this contest for my dreams of wealth to come true. But if I do, oh what to do with you? I'd love to go and claim this city's wealth with you by my side. But I wouldn't want you to get in my way.\" The hero rolls his eyes. This wasn't the first villain monologue he'd endured and it won't be the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it!\" The hippo exclaimed, turned to face one of the camera's. \"Maybe we can get you at home to help me with this.\" Next she looks at the lorikeets. \"Can we set up that phone line thing for this show so the audience can call in?\" Lana and Lois look at eachother nervously, then at the studio personnel. The frightened humans don't give any useful solutions. The two lorikeets just nod awkwardly at the hippo and murmur among themselves about rigging something together. Helen keeps her warm smile and announces her idea to the audience at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, whilst they set something up, I'll run you through your two choices. You can vote for whichever you think will fit this failure of a hero better. Keep in mind he's not stopped any of this from happening, nor will he stop me from taking all your money, so don't feel like you owe him any mercy. I know I won't. Your choice is a simple one: Do I eat him or do I stuff him up my butt? Either way he'll be with me, squirming and begging for his life whilst I do what I love most, taking all your valuables!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything in order the hippo turns to her victim. She knows time is against her and her talking did not help things. Not a word is wasted to taunt the trapped hero. Instead she chooses action, walking up to the board and leaning down to bring her eye to eye with the defiant superhero. She would need to impress everyone on set and she knew just how to do it. Her maw opened wide enough to engulf the Pint Puncher whole but she settled for just taking in his head. Her belly rumbled before a suppressed burp made the hero's limbs twitch in panic and disgust. She made sure none of the noxious hot fumes escaped her. They were all for the Pint Puncher and he would breathe every last foul bit of it. His loud coughing was silenced by her enveloping maw, but the erratic twitching of his body told a story of its own. With a loud smack her lips parted, revealing a pale looking hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one for mercy, the hippo immediately walks forward, her hefty gut colliding with the Pint Puncher. The rigid board didn't move a millimeter as her large belly pressed against it. The only thing buckling under the rapidly growing pressure was him. He screamed in pain as she flattened him against he unmoving trap. Soon his screams were cut off as the soft mass enveloped the entire hero, muffling his noise. Helen casually leaned against the platform and signaled the lorikeets to lower it. Heavy mechanical whirring and humming shook the board into motion and slowly it tilted backwards, a matching hole in the stage opening up to accommodate it. The hippo rode the contraption on its way down, ensuring the hero wasn't spared a moment of her crushing weight. Only when it clicked into place did she get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look even punier down there, Pathetic Puncher. Don't worry, this next part will only hurt a lot.\"</span></div></div>",

Her eyes gleamed with malicious pleasure. She had plans for the hero and he was not going to like any of them. One of the lorikeets demanded her attention and they quietly whispered back and forth. The Pint Puncher barely caught a word of it, but he saw the elephant point at her pussy and her ass more then once. That part was going to be pretty inevitable. At least he was tightly secured, so a trip inside was probably not going to happen. The lorikeet sternly told the elephant too. \"No swallowing him.\" Quaker looked a little disappointed, but understood. The superhero breathed a small sigh of relief. But there was still that little 'incident' that happened earlier today between them. He'd beaten her and sent her off to prison. The unmistakable sense of dread hung over him as he knew there was going to be some payback for that. Finally their little chat finished and Quaker turned her attention to the main attraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news Punchy, those clever little birdies made sure that board you're chained to can handle even my weight. But just to make things a little bit easier... Ladies, if you'd please...\" The Pint Puncher couldn't see what was happening. Lana was hidden behind the board and strange mechanical sounds could be heard. Slowly the board lowered until the superhero was lying flat on the ground. From this adjusted perspective the elephant looked even more terrifying. The large columns that were her legs. The huge, swaying belly and monstrous mammaries. She looked down her trunk and gave him the most evil glare he'd ever seen. A pervasive, horrible stench began to fill the air. The elephant was feeling the beginnings of arousal just imagining all the things she'd do to the trapped superhero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she loved to tease and slowly torment the hero, the lorikeets made clear there was no time for that. Other contestants would want a turn too. So slowly smothering him underfoot would have to be saved for later. On the flipside, if she won this contest she'd get to humiliate him on national TV. It was worth it. The Pint Puncher gulped as the underside of Quaker's foot filled his view. Like a meteor it came crashing down, stomping on his chest with brutal weight. The hero felt himself flatten beneath the immense pressure. The elephant was merciless, lifting up her foot only to bring it down again with even more vigor. The ground shuddered a little with each stomp, Quaker was living up to her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPint Puncher was in great pain. The large elephant foot didn't leave any part of him unscathed. Most of all his dick felt like it was on fire. The cruel elephant made sure to step on it as often as possible. Beyond the pain there was something else plaguing his mind. Whenever his nose wasn't pressed back into his face, he picked up on that horrid stench again. Each time it seemed to grow stronger. Only when Quaker stopped her onslaught did he see the disgusting origin. With a heavy foot on each of his sides, the Pint Puncher was given a clear view of the elephant's pussy. Trampling him was getting her off. As if to illustrate this point, a glob of her love juices leaked down onto his chest. The warm slime sent shocks of utter disgust through the hero, touching against his bare skin. Futile as it may be, he fought and struggled against his bindings. Never had he been more determined to flee than now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Carol's powers canceled his strength and Quaker only seemed to get more aroused by his panic. She squatted down to get a close look at this pathetic little man. It was time for the finishing blow. \"This one is for trying to have me locked up like some monster!\" Her body came down further and the evil elephant smothered the Pint Puncher beneath her...</span></div></div>",

So, when she descended, the evil elephant made sure that she placed her enormous, round ass cheek squarely on his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe treated the board he was strapped to as if it was a bullseye, and her aim was true. Though he was already flattened from her stomping, the hero's eyes shot wide open as he saw her full ass fall towards him like a cannonball. He had no way to protect or defend himself and somehow was pressed even thinner beneath Quaker's unbearable weight. The villain felt her rage slip away and melt into joy as she sat in still ecstasy atop her flattened foe. With a delighted smile on her face, she bounce in place several times, hoping to flatten the hero beyond repair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villain finally concluded her bouncing and shifted to a new method of punishment, mental. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you really love being pressed up against round booties Punchy,\" she cooed mockingly to her foe, \"Why don't you show your appreciation for one of the biggest and baddest by giving mine a super hero kiss?\" Lois and Lana laughed as Quaker played along with their game, adding humiliation to the physical torment she was already forcing the hero to endure. Not feeling a response, and knowing that he was physically unable to even if he wanted to, the elephant decided to move for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted and shimmied and ground her ass against the floor, dragging her smooth flesh against the hero's body. Somehow, his bonds held up against her massive grinding force. She finally came to a stop with the Pint Puncher staring up between her slightly parted cheeks. Just enough light made it to him to allow him to see her incredibly large, intimidating anus. It pulsed hungrily, eager for some time with the hero itself. He tried to recoil and create some distance, but he had nowhere to go as Quaker spread cheeks with her hands and pushed herself lower to the floor. Her huge, round ass didn't allow for her to move much, but it was just enough to cause the Puncher to brush against her puckering anus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at the lorikeets and gave them a nod. Lois pulled another lever and the machinery behind the platform the hero was strapped to moaned and groaned, but somehow pushed itself up off the ground. The movement was slow as it fought its way through Quaker's yielding flesh, but it didn't need to move much to push the hero into direct contact with the elephant's pucker. He tried to scream in protest and agony, but he just got a mouthful of ass for his trouble. The villains smiled at the weak buzzing sound that escaped from between the elephant's cheeks, but Quaker's grin was by far the broadest. </span></div></div>",

Being able to withstand Quaker's powerful butt was a feat of engineering few machines could boast. The Pint Puncher got to experience every agonizing second between the elephantine cheeks with the full knowledge that his trap was built to last. With unyielding strength he was pressed against the twitching pucker of Quaker. She was enjoying his humiliation, a warm glow overwhelming her. It wasn't often she had the hero in such a position. His destination was set. Though she much relished the thought of him squirming and screaming in her love tunnel, this round is to set an example. If she won, she'd let the whole world watch as their hero would slowly be sucked into her pussy. Maybe then they'll be a little more submissive when she wants to play with them. In her excitement the elephant farted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot gas pushed out of her stinking pucker and into the hero's lungs. He coughed and heaved, disgusted by the stench assaulting him. The surface of Quaker's butt was rarely given anything more than a mudbath, but the insides smelled much worse. The powerful machine had pushed the hero back into an upright position. Quaker's huge elephant body was well-suited for the next step. The trapped hero looked up to see her rest her big butt on the platform. What he couldn't see was the elephant breathing quickly in and out whilst flexing her pucker. She got ready for her final act. With a loud moan and trumpet she sat herself down. The platform stood strong, but the elephant's pucker did not. It opened wide and engulfed the platform and the hero all in one fell swoop. She'd treated the standing platform like a dildo ready to enter her butt. And enter it did. The elephant panted loudly as she felt the squirming hero writhe against her insides. The platform stretched her bowels to new widths, but the hero stole the show. His muffled screaming was music to her large elephant ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe occasion was celebrated by more farting. Piping hot air surged past the hero as each fart robbed him of his stamina. The horrid miasma of farts and stale internal smell could barely be described. Rotten animal crap didn't come close to covering the hellish aroma surrounding him. He felt himself get a little faint from the utter torment his nose was enduring. The disorienting effect was so powerful he could no longer tell how long he'd been in there. After a few minutes of enjoying the hero inside of her, Quaker must concede the spotlight to the next villain. With a loud, wet <i>shlorp</i> The platform and hero re-appear. both seem a little worse for wear but the Pint Puncher had definitely taken the worst of it. He looked pale and sickly, struggling to shake off the sickening stench he was forced to endure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuaker crashes down in the audience area, swiping away the plastic chairs with a wave of earth and creating a form-fitting earthen chair for herself. The lorikeets swoop in to inspect the superhero. With a little bit of television magic and a five minute commercial break the hero is back up to his regular state. It was time for the next contender, but who would step through those doors?</span></div></div>",

He didn't like what Lana was doing, but whatever Lois was doing to him, it made him more uncomfortable than Lana was. Lois was thrown off of his groin, and Lana grinned more widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you like being my cushion, eh?\" Lana taunted. Before the Pint Puncher could push her, she grabbed his wrists and stretched them out to the sides, stopping him from pushing her. She rubbed down more, and the Pint Puncher slowly got closer and closer to the brink of unconsciousness. He thrashed about, kicking wildly, and accidentally rubbing himself into Lana's butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, hun. Sleep~\" Lana taunted. The last thing the Pint Puncher heard before fainting was the laughter of the two lorikeets...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake-y wake-y~\" the Pint Puncher heard. He wasn't too sure, but that voice sounded like it belonged to Lois. He started to regain his senses, slowly opening his eyes. His vision was blurry at first, but when it returned to normal, the first thing he saw was the lorikeet rack he was resting his head on. He then noticed the hand caressing his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing madly, he whipped himself off of her chest, backing away from the flirtatious villain. As he backed up, the other lorikeet wrapped her arms around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, hun~\" Lana said from behind him. The Pint Puncher froze up in her grip. As his senses returned to him, he noticed a bit more about himself. His mask was gone, and his suit was torn up. All that was left of it was everything between his waist and his thighs. Furthermore, he wasn't in the gym. It looked like he was in some abandoned warehouse, a large wresting arena off to the side with a chalkboard near by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got a special surprise for you~\" Lois came over, and the two turned the hero around to a corner of the room. The Pint Puncher was forced to look at a strange chair. It looked like a lounge chair, but it had clamps where the legs and arms would go. Waiting behind it was a weird, muscular crocodile. He didn't know it, but this was Carol, an infamous villainess with the ability to mute anyone super powers. Maybe she was their so he wouldn't be able to escape the chair? Above the chair was a neon sign with \"Lover's Chair\" written on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lois and I were so disappointed with how quickly you lost back in the gym, so we thought up a little game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You undoubtedly noticed the wrestling ring, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna wrestle with you. If we can pin you for a three count or force you to tap out, you have to stay in that chair for a minute. Each subsequent submission earns you another minute in the chair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, depending on how long you stay in there, we just might... persuade you to love- nay, praise us.\" The Pint Puncher struggled in their grip, wincing in fear at their threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, if you can pin us both for a three count, or force us both to tap out, just once, you're free to leave. And we can fight each other again another day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's 10 minutes for the match~\" They didn't even wait for the hero to respond before the started directing him to the wrestling mat. They plopped him onto it, and Lana climbed over the wires, marching over to the corner opposite of the hero. Meanwhile, Lois hung out on the edge of the arena, positioning herself behind the Pint Puncher. Meanwhile, Carol marched over to an electronic timer, next to the chalkboard, with \"10:00\" displayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaand... begin!\" Carol shouted as she pressed the button on it. The timer started to count, and Lana started to march towards the Pint Puncher, swaying her hips. \"One thing I forgot to mention: a knockout is an immediate hour in the chair.\"</span></div></div>",

But Lana simply stood there, now that she saw the hero running. The Pint Puncher didn't seem to pay any attention to her stopping, and just ran towards her. When he was sure he could rocket into her and knock her down, he leapt upwards, and moved such that his body was parallel to the ground, as if he were sailing towards her. However, that didn't happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally he'd lift up, sailing towards her. Normally, he should tackle into her, knocking her off her feet and tackling her into the canvas. However, instead, he belly flopped, tumbled, and skidded to a stop. He felt pain and humiliation through his body as he skidded to a stop, having essentially tripped when he should've flown. He'd skidded right before Lana's feet, who broke out into laughter at the display before her. The Pint Puncher groaned, glaring at the feet before him as he tried to get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he noticed Lana kneel down, her legs on either side of his head. He looked up, just in time for her rump to come down, seating on the back of his head, and shoving his face against the canvas. She leaned down, still pressing the Pint Puncher down with her butt, before spreading her arms over him, and pinning down the rest of his body. The Pint Puncher then hears Lois.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1! 2! 3!\" she said, punctuating each number with a smack to the canvas. That must've been the first pin. Carol marked it by drawing a tick mark on the chalkboard, marking one pin. Lana grinned, and wrapped her arms down, hugging them around his midsection. Then, she stood up, holding the Pint Puncher up, the hero beginning to squirm in her grip. She held him close, grinning at the struggles, before walking over to one of the turnbuckles. She climbed up onto it, stilll keeping the hero, before getting upon it. She then leaps, before dropping into a bodyslam. The Pint Puncher felt himself pancaked ontot he canvas, pressed down by Lana's bodyslam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher was rendered dizzy, struggling to look straight. Then, Lana sat on top of the middle of his back, draping her legs across his back and pinning him again. The Pint Puncher heard another 3 count, and another pin was called. Lana moved herself around such that her own groin was upon his, and he felt the weridest sensation. It felt like his clothed groin was slipped between a pair of lips. He looked down, and realized he was penetrating her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, and then moved her legs in a scissoring motion, squeezing her legs around him, and forcing her groin down on him. The Pint Puncher suddenly felt hot and bothered, feeling an intense sensation at her leg motions. He tried to free himself from her, but he realized why she used this very grip. The way her legs wrapped around him, she'd essentially kept him pinned, ensnared in her leg trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, feels like you're getting awfully excited, bud~\" she taunted, still maintining that scissoring motion. \"A place like this is no place to get all horny like that. Do you usually get hard in a fight? Are you gonna cum before we get in the lover's chair?\" She kept scissoring and scissoring, keeping up the pressure. The Pint Puncher felt terror as she kept screwing him. He knew that if he were to cum here, he'd be in trouble. He might even lose the strength to fight back! He needs to fight her, he needs to make sure he doesn't orgasm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two pins already, eh?\" she taunts. \"Tsk, tsk, hun~\" The Pint Puncher groaned at the taunts, tryring to push himself up. But then he felt himself spun around, back onto his back. Next thing he knew, her legs were scissoring him at the groin, one leg running under his butt and back, and one leg running over his groin and torso. He had no idea what she had in mind, and that made him more terrified.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher readies himself for a one on one battle against Lana. He may not have fared well against the twins together, but he was certain he could take them one on one. As he takes a step forward, he gasps as he finds himself held securely and lifted from behind by his waist! He tried to pull himself away and free himself, but found himself much weaker than normal. The lorikeets laughed at the look of confusion on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling a little weak hero?\" Lana teased from across the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois carelessly tossed him in front of her and he scrambled to his feet, but she seemed unfazed. \"You must not be familiar with our friend Carol over there,\" she said with a laugh. \"She mutes super powers. Yours and ours. So this will be a...fair fight.\" Lois could hardly keep a straight face as she said the final two words and Lana didn't even try, breaking down into hysterical laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Puncher looks over to the crocodile whose toothy mouth is displaying a broad, proud grin. A fair fight? But...this looked to be two on one. And they towered over him! The lorikeets didn't give him a chance to protest as Lois strode toward him with confidence. She turned him around and lifted him by his arms in a half nelson, a hold he normally would have been able to break out of with ease, but without his super strength had him secured tightly. His eyes widened as he looked at Lana across the ring preparing to charge at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana ran full speed at her sister's position and wrapped her tightly in a hug, the Pint Puncher was trapped helplessly in the middle! The girls laughed as their breasts smothered him from all sides. Their tits were so large they easily flowed past his head and rubbed against each other, pressing them down and forcing them together. He was rapidly running out of oxygen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tough time breathing down there little guy? Feel free to tap out and we'll be happy to give you some air,\" Lois laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe may not have his super powers with Carol around, but if his time fighting villains had given him anything it was a strong will. He was not about to let these villains get the best of him so quickly. The Pint Puncher refused to submit. Exasperated and bored, Lana released the hug hold and Lois let him fall helplessly to the mat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he won't tap, let's just pin him,\" Lana suggested, and Lois agreed. Lana placed a large foot on the hero's chest as Lois quickly counted, but before she could reach three, the Pint Puncher managed to squirm free! The women were getting frustrated and looked at the clock, which now read just 7 minutes. They expected to easily have wracked up several victories by this point, but were still being shut out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you want to play hard to get hero? We can play rough too,\" Lois seethed, grabbing the Pint Puncher by his hair and lifting him up as Lana again returned to the corner. Lois began a lariat to throw the powerless hero into the corner opposite her sister, but quickly reversed course and flung him as hard as she could toward Lana. He slammed into her large colorful body at rapid speed, but she was unmoved. Before he could bounce off of her to try to recover from the blow, she wrapped her arms around him and turned him to face Lois, who had picked up a head of steam moving in his direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois lept into the air and Lana ducked away at the last minute, leaving the Puncher prone against the turnbuckle as her sister landed a massive impact. He saw stars and expected to be knocked out by the blow, but was held up by Lois' amazonian body. She squeezed her large breasts over his head for several  moments before turning and falling into a belly flop directly onto him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovered by Lois' curvy, heavy body, the Pint Puncher had no hope of escape as Lana quickly counted to three. That was the first pin. The women weren't satisfied with just one though, they wanted as much time as possible to torment the hero in their \"Lover's Chair.\" As Lois stood, she revealed her sister Lana had soared into the air above the hero's prone body. She gave him no time to recover as she dropped into a free fall directly onto his head and shoulders. Her large ass completely swallowed up his face and cascaded down onto his chest. This time, Lana counted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1, 2, 3. That was the second pin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lorikeets continued their relentless attack using their numbers, their size, strength, and ability to fly to their advantage. Lana clenched her cheeks as she stood, taking the hero up with her as she went. Lois quickly wrapped up his legs as her sister released his head. She swung him around with ease before tossing him into the air. Lana was ready to make the cover as soon as the hero landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1, 2, 3. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana lifted him by the air and tossed him to her sister, who was flying a few feet overhead at that point. She carried the small hero and prepared to deliver a massive power bomb from several feet above the top of the ring ropes. The threat of that massive attack was about all the Pint Puncher's will could bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Please stop! I can't take this anymore. I submit! I quit!\" the proud hero cried for mercy, powerless with Carol in the vicinity. He still had some strength left in his body, but knew he would need to find a way to take Carol out of the equation if he would be able to take out the twins. He was sacrificing the battle to win the war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois smiled at his begging. \"That's a first submission!\" she said gleefully, \"That means 4 minutes in the chair, but I think we can do better, there's still about 5 minutes left on the clock,\" she sang, delivering the power bomb, which was of course immediately followed by another pin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lorikeets were rolling at this point. They had the Pint Puncher at their mercy. Now they wanted to deliver a knockout to secure that extra hour. Can they get it in the remaining 5 minutes? The hero had managed to stay conscious this long, but how much more punishment could he withstand? </span></div></div>",

Lana and Lois, however, had a different idea in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois got behind the Pint Puncher's back while Lana ran to the other end of the arena, ready for a devastating double team. Lois wrapped her arms around the hero's midsection, and leaned backwards, throwing the hero towards Lana. When the hero got close enough, Lana snatched him out of the air in a half nelson, before spinning around and throwing the hero high into the air. The two villains ran to where the Pint Puncher was about to land. They leapt into the air, butts aiming for the hero, before both of their asses slammed into both sides of his head, completely enveloping it. They fell down, butt slamming the ground and smashing the hero's head against the canvas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing the hero saw was stars. Lots and lots of stars. His body flopped onto the canvas, and the villains went for another pin, just in case. After the 3 count, they got off. They were about to grab him, only to realize he wasn't reacting. They checked the Pint Puncher, realizing he was unconscious. The villainess trio began to laugh uproariously at this. They  successfully knocked out the Pint Puncher!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should stop making us waking you up a habit,\" Lois said in a playful tone. That was the first thing the Pint Puncher heard as he started to return from unconsciousness. He opened his eyes, his head completely sore from the beating the villains gave him. He instinctively went to rub the sore head, only to realize he couldn't move his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at his hands, realizing they were strapped down to a certain chair. Looking further, he realized his last piece of cloth was gone, and he was completely naked. He attempted to cross his legs to cover up, but his ankles were strapped down too. He suddenly felt a pair of reptilian hands grasp his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta admit, I was expecting a better fight from a super hero,\" Carol taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he should rename himself 'Pint Punching Bag,'\" Lana taunted. He looked straight ahead towards the lorikeets, only to be greeted by their breasts. He looked further upwards, seeing the dominant smiles of his tormentors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betch'ya know where you are now, dontch'ya?\" Lois said. Of course, it could be none other than the Lover's Chair. \"And I do believe you owe us an hour and five minutes!\"</span></div></div>",

The Pint Puncher tried to yank his arms free of the chair, but the shackles refused to budge. Ordinarily, the hero would've easily broken such shackles with his super strength, but with Carol in the area, there was no effect. He was as weak as any mortal before these towering ladies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw Lana lift a leg and plant her foot on the chair, just underneath his groin. He heard her toes rap on the chair, as if anticipating whatever Lana was planning. The Pint Puncher, meanwhile, was practically shaking in fear. After how easily Lana and Lois conquered him, he couldn't imagine what the bird had in story for him. She lifted her foot, and started to inch it closer to the hero's groin. He sharply gasped out as he felt Lana's foot pressing against the underside of his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began shuffling her foot back and forth, rubbing his organ. He shuddered at the feeling <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying yourself, perv?\" Lana taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" the Pint Puncher shouted. He continued to try and thrash about, but Lana only pressed down harder. It hurt like hell, and he stopped thrashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a real glutton for punishment, aren't you?\" Lana continued to taunt as she continued to rub. Lana stopped rubbing his groin, and began to climb onto the chair. When Lana stood over him was when the Pint Puncher felt smaller than ever. \"That's probably why you go out playing hero, isn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-?\" the Pint Puncher tried to object, but he was swiftly interrupted when Lana stomped down on his groin. She continued to rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't deny it. Did you honestly think a squirt like you could actually play hero? Especially after your recent performance?\" Lana ground her foot into the Pint Puncher's groin, who could only shudder in response. \"You probably play hero just so you could find some big, strong fighter like Lois or me to bully you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're wrong!\" the Pint Puncher tried to squeak out. He believed he was a force for good, that he could make a difference. When he got his powers, he believed he could defeat all matter of villains. He groaned out as Lana gave another grinding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I am,\" Lana taunted. \"I can feel your friend here growing as I trample it.\" She removed her foot to show her point. Unfortunately for the Pint Puncher, she was right. He didn't know why, but Lana's foot got him erect. He heard Lois and Carol chuckle in response. \"It's fine to admit it. It'll be our little secret, weakling!\"</span></div></div>",

He didn't know what she had planned, but it was certain to end badly for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crocodile turned silently, letting the Puncher take in the view of her massively thick legs and her incredibly round ass. She backed toward him and stretched a long leg up and over his head. The hero struggled, but Carol's powers were in full effect. He had no super strength to break free. Supporting herself with her hands, Carol lifted her other leg and placed it on the other side of the hero's head. She looked up over her shoulder at him with her wide smile still plastered to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a deep breath,\" she warned, before locking her ankles together and clamping her thick thighs across the hero's head. Her scissor hold was tighter than any of the bonds that held him to the chair and he started to turn purple from lack of oxygen. She was crushing him and suffocating him with a single move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe relaxed her legs for a moment but pushed her ass closer to the hero's face. She wrapped one leg around his neck and flexed, forcing his head down, just inches from her green, barely covered backside. He could breathe a bit better in this hold, but found his oxygen tainted by Carol's sent. At thistles proximity, he could tell she was growing more and more excited by her ability to dominate him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe croc released the hold and stood to face the hero, who was again gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The twins and I share a love of wrestling,\" she said with a smile, lifting her legs up so that she was sharing the same small space on the chair as the Pint Puncher. \"But I prefer a slower, more intimate approach than theirs,\" she finished, before pressing her thighs around his midsection, nearly crushing his ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe released the hold and moved so that her chest was less than an inch away from the Puncher's face. \"Tell me, which style do you prefer?\" she asked seductively, forcing his head into her vast cleavage, smothering him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol laughed and held the hold as the hero desperately pulled against the restraints.

She had a devious smile on her face. After his embarrassing display in their \"match\", the hero trembled in nervousness over what her plans for him could be with him completely subdued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so frightened little guy,\" Lois cooed, bending at the waist and letting her brightly colored chest hang inches away from the Puncher's face. He tried to look away, but the sheer size of her breasts made it impossible for him to turn his gaze anywhere else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already got the fighting out of the way. Remember, this is the <i>Lover's</i> Chair. And you're going to <i>loooooove</i> what I have planned for you,\" she said flirtatiously, rubbing a finger down the side of his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero swallowed hard, not really trusting Lois, but not really having any other choice but to sit and wait for her to reveal her plans. The lorikeet lifted one long leg up and over his head, giving him a close up view at her thick thigh as she did it, before planting it on the floor outside of the armrest of the chair that held his right wrist in place. She then repeated the motion with her other leg on his left side. This brought her into close proximity with the Pint Puncher, who was nervously sweating as Lois' breasts continued to hang just millimeters from his face, taunting him. He felt a stirring in his groin, brought on by the site of the anthro's bare chest just out of reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lois planted herself on the hero's lap, straddling him, his newly formed erection, and the chair. She wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him to her, burying his face between her massive tits. She laughed as he gasped in surprise and struggled for air. She didn't care about his ability to breathe though, and she responded by simply burying him deeper. She felt his erection beneath her and laughed heartily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I told you you'd like it!\" Lois squealed joyfully, shifting her large hips in the defenseless hero's lap. She released her grip on the Puncher's head and allowed him to suck in oxygen. But she wasn't done with him yet. Lois spun around in her seat without lifting herself off of the Puncher's groin, swinging her legs to the front. Her large, round ass was now planted squarely on his erection. She toyed with it by flexing her strong glutes one at a time, bouncing his firm shaft from side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero lost all will to fight back at this point, and had given in to the feelings of pleasure that Lois was sending throughout his body. Without warning though, he felt a sudden burst of cold. The lorikeet spread her large wings and flew up into the sky, leaving the nude hero exposed. His eyes tracked her sexy body as she flew. In turn, she kept her eyes locked on him and her smile grew broader as he arched his neck back to follow her as she flew overhead. That was exactly what she wanted him to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois stopped her flight suddenly and planted her bare ass on top of the Pint Puncher's face while he was looking straight up! He felt his face sinking between her thick cheeks. The villain shifted her weight from side to side, appearing to try to get comfortable until she was seated fully on his small shoulders. His entire head had been swallowed up by her ass! Lois squealed in pleasure as she felt his muffled complaints buzzing against her backside and as she felt his warm breath hit her backdoor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe planted her feet on the hero's groin and started to toy with his still erect shaft. Again, the Puncher felt chills as pleasure coursed through his body, but he strained mentally at the desire to push her off of his face. Of course, with his wrists still restrained, he was still completely at her mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois looks up at the clock on the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! 5 minutes already? It's a good thing we still have an hour left!\" she said as she bounced in place happily.</span></div></div>",

It made a delightful buzzing sensation for Lois, who squealed in delight. She continued toying with the Pint Puncher's erection with her feet as she gently clenched her cheeks over his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know Punchy, this is everything you ever dreamed of. Don't you wish you would have just submitted to us in the first place?\" Lois cooed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe greatly enjoyed the sensation of the hero's head trapped between her cheeks. Every difficult breath he took sent a warm gust of air along her sensitive crack. She shivered in delight and pleasure as he breathed, but she knew that without his powers, there was definitely a limit to how much of this particular game the hero could withstand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Lois separated her cheeks and slowly, very slowly, lifted her ass off of the hero's head. Now free, the Pint Puncher sucked down oxygen. His unmasked face was disheveled, his hair was a mess, and his skin was red from the rubbing and grinding Lois had put him through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let....me.....go.....\" the hero begged between gasps of air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, still trying to pretend you don't like this Punchy?\" Lois cooed. \"Your little friend down here would beg to differ...\" she sang, kneeling over his body and caressing his very present erection with her massive tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois gently rubbed and massaged her breasts together, creating a soft, constant pressure over the hero's groin. Despite himself, the Pint Puncher couldn't help but moan in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Lois said, looking up at his face with a deviant smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois' smile soon disappeared from view as she planted her feet on the arms of the chair yet again, presenting her ass to the hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now remember hero, this is the <i>Lover's</i> Chair,\" she started. \"We all know how much you're <i>loving</i> this, so it's time for you to prove your love with a kiss!\" she said, her voice filled with excitement as she slowly pressed her thick backside against the hero's face. </span></div></div>",

That's the first pin!\" she shouted, loud enough for the Pint Puncher to hear under Carol's devastating mass. The villainess trio grinned widely at the first pin. Carol got off of the hero, who was writhing in pain. Lois wrapped both arms around his midsection, lugged him over her shoulder, and walked towards the ring, Lana awaiting. Lana swiftly picked him up and held him overhead, as if to show him off to an invisible crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-doesn't work?\" the Pint Puncher stuttered out. \"Wh-why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't notice?\" Lana asked. \"You clearly haven't done your homework.\" She turned him towards Carol, who was writing one tally mark on the board, marking his first defeat. \"When she's around, nobody's power works. Not yours, not mine, nobody's.\" The Pint Puncher realized how deep in it he was. These two easily railed him when he had powers, but now the towering amazons had him at his weakest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't think about it anymore. He felt Lana wind up for a throw, before she threw the hero hard against the wrestling mat. The Pint Puncher was writhing with pain. While he was trying to recover from the attack, Lana belly flopped onto him, pinning him again. Lois slid down towards the two, ready for the count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1! 2! 3! Second pin!\" Lois shouted. Lana got off of the writhing hero, before stepping onto the Pint Puncher dominantly, flexing for that invisible crowd. Carol wrote down a second tally mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two pins before the 9 minute mark?\" Lana taunted. \"Tsk tsk tsk. I'd expect some hero to put up a better fight.\" The Pint Puncher looked towards the clock. 9:29. That's how much time it took for them to leave him writhing and pinned twice. This was gonna be a rough battle.</span></div></div>",

She plopped her body on top of his as Lana counted the pin. \"1....2....3!\" she sang. \"That's our third pin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lois stood up, the Pint Puncher struggled to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two....gasp.....two on....one.....gasp.....isn't.....fair....\" he protested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins frowned down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who said this would be a fair fight?\" Lana laughed as she grabbed the hero by his head and easily threw him toward her sister.

Lana cradled his head between her soft thighs while Lois secured his legs and ankles between her own. They squeezed just enough for the Pint Puncher to squirm, which caused the villains to squeal with pleasure. They smiled and nodded at each other. Lois released her hold as Lana crashed to the mat, her crotch landing squarely on his face. The hero felt his nose slip up inside of Lana, who moaned so loud she could hardly hear her sister count the 5th pinball. As Lana stood up, Carol called out the 9 minute mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 pins in just one minute! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana and Lois sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a supposed super hero, you're really kinda pathetic, you know?\" Lana whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois continued. \"If you want to spend time beneath us so badly, you can just submit now and we promise you'll enjoy what comes next...\" she said with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Pint Puncher was stubborn, even without his powers.

The \"scene,\" in question, consisted of a bunch of humans, left in a trance, while a terrifyingly tall flamingo's head was lifted high in the air. The hero could only watch as someone's feet disappeared down her beak and formed a bulge in her long neck as it disappeared into her stomach. She turned around and spotted the hero, keeping a sultry look on her face.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Word had spread fast across the savannah of the small but powerful hero who had defeated the mighty Quaker. Fiona knew of her capture long before the Pint Puncher's arrival. Now that she had this so called \"powerful hero\" at her mercy, a smile crept across her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew it was a risk. She had to trust that the power of his entrancement would hold, even over a great distance. Even if it worked, there was no guarantee that she would get her little super play thing back. But Quaker was a good friend. They had spent days tormenting humans together after developing their powers. She had to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona gently lifted the hero to her face. He showed no nerves at all as he stood in the palm of her hand. She resolved to give the command before the desire to keep or swallow him overwhelmed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little servant, I have a friend who is being unjustly held at a prison a great distance from here,\" she whispered firmly. The Pint Puncher nodded his understanding, with an absent look in his eyes. Fiona smiled as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is something only you can do. I want you to fly to that prison and free my friend Quaker. She may not take kindly to your arrival, but if you can, tell her I sent you,\" she said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero nodded and kneeled. \"Yes Mistress Fiona,\" he said emotionlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, the small hero, no more than a couple of inches tall, flew off like a miniature rocket. He was on a mission to free the villain he was responsible for imprisoning. As he gained more distance from the resort, the small voice in the back of his mind grew slightly louder and slightly stronger. It pushed on him to resist, to turn back, to do anything but what Fiona ordered. But every time he felt a bit of doubt in his mission begin to well up within him, his mind flashed back to the sight of the beautiful dancing flamingo towering over him and he fell deeper into his trance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was his smaller size that allowed the trance to take such a hold over him. Maybe it was his weakened physical and mental state from the battles with Quaker and Fiona. But whatever it was, he flew on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fiona's powerful trance kept the Pint Puncher pressing on toward his destination. At his super speed, he reached it quickly. Due to his small size, he was able to zoom in and around the passage ways and vents of the prison without detection. The unfortunate guards who did see him were disarmed and disabled quickly before they could interfere with his mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe may have had a difficult time with a super powered elephant and amazonian flamingo, but a few normal humans were still child's play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes of arriving at the prison, he found Quaker's cell. He disabled the security surrounding the cell and entered. The elephant felt something off and spotted him, even at his small size, quickly. Her eyes shot open wide. Seeing the absent look in his eyes and his small size, she knew the hero must have met her friend Fiona. She wriggled in anticipation of what was coming and in eagerness to have her way with the newly shrunken hero. But she was still muzzled and depowered. She would have to wait patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher approached and bowed regally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress Quaker, my mistress Fiona informs me that you are being held here under false pretenses. She sent me to right that wrong and invites you to join her at her resort,\" he says without emotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant nods in understanding. Her heart is beating faster, wishing the little man would get on with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mindless hero makes quick work of the locks that surround the elephant and finally removes the muzzle that keeps her powers in check. With a mighty trumpet, Quaker stands and shouts in victory. She looks down at the Pint Puncher with a hungry smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you did just set me free hero, so I'm going to keep you safe while I make my escape. But I can't promise you'll like it,\" she said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout his usual awareness, the Pint Puncher did not attempt to evade Quaker as she wrapped him up in her fist. She licked her lips as she drew him around to her massive ass. When the elephant's backside came into view, the hero's memories of their battle came rushing back. It was enough to finally shock him awake from his trance. But at only a couple of inches tall and already held firmly in Quaker's fist, his super strength wasn't enough to fight his way free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, there are the struggles that I love Punchy,\" she cooed. \"Keep it up, that'll make this all the more fun for me,\" she commanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggle he did, but it was fruitless as the elephant spread her massive cheeks and revealed an anus large enough to fit him in even before his encounter with Fiona. He shuddered to think where he would end up at his current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to wonder long, as Quaker was not in the mood to take her time. She quickly shoved the struggling hero up her ass and used her finger to push him in as deep as she could. As the massive digit retreated, the Pint Puncher tried to follow it, but found himself encased in darkness as Quaker's massive ass closed up around him, sealing off the exits. He squirmed and struggled, looking trying to gain a sense of direction to identify the way out. He heard a massive moan from above him. To his dismay, he was doing exactly what Quaker wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moan was followed by the muffled sound of cascading rocks. The villainous elephant was using her powers to cause a massive earthquake all around the prison facility. It was flattened and a pile of rubble in no time. All except for the formerly secure room she, and her booty buddy, were occupying. Quaker smiled as she surveyed the damage and walked out. Even the largest boulders were reduced to rubble beneath her feet. The Pint Puncher cursed her, Fiona, and even himself as he felt his body sway within he ass with every step she took. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher felt his prison squeeze and clench with the elephant's steady gait. She was walking around town, terrorizing all before her with her earthen powers. Cars were pushed aside to make way. Anyone foolish enough to leave their vehicle was swept up along with the pedestrians that hadn't hidden themselves away. Earthen hands shoved them onto the road, right in Quaker's path. The road surface shifted and moved, aligning the stumbling people with her steps. Nobody was spared her attention as they lay in groups of two or three, a pattern of victims neatly laid out before the elephant. Rocky bindings kept them in place, forcing them to look up and see their fate approaching. Her large ears were soon filled with the wailing and screaming of those she stepped on, along with the pained groans of those behind her recovering from her assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is the kind of treatment a lady of my stature deserves, don't you think Punchy?\" the hero trapped in her ass struggled unabated, earning him a potent clench. He wasn't sure what would get to him first, the pressure or the stench. Fiercely he kept resisting, but to the supervillain it all felt like a relaxing massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so too. But these little wretches can hardly keep up with my tastes. You, on the other hand, are much more durable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerily the elephant continued her horrid march, laying out a carpet of citizens for each of her heavy steps. When she reached a large crossing she stopped something very interesting. A van, adorned with some distinct equipment. Quaker knew a news van when she saw one. Her normal attacks always drew them in like flies to honey. Better yet, cowering inside the van were people, no doubt a news crew. She kept her pace and walked up to the van. Once she stood right next to it she turned her attention to the shivering humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to get your cameras ready, because you're about to witness the end of the Pint Puncher.\" The crew scrambled to get their gear as the elephant used her powers to clear all other vehicles out of the way. With a ring of busted up cars forming a crude stage the supervillain was all set. She squatted down a little and began to squeeze the hero even harder. The oppressive pressure hurt like nothing he'd ever imagined. How was the inside of her butt able to crush him like this? Slowly he felt himself pass the muscular ring of flesh that sealed him away. The stench and murderous squeezing had taken their toll. Flying seemed downright impossible and he flopped down on the hard road below. Whilst the elephant began fantasizing about all the ways she could publicly humiliate the hero the news crew got in position. The cameraman and sound guy gave the reporter the green light and began their broadcast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, I come here from Smith and Westerlane crossing to show you the infamous Quaker beating down our hero, the Pint Puncher. He looks to have been shrunken by some unknown force and has spent far too long held close to her huge butt. We all hope he can endure whatever is in stock for him. What will this monster do next? Find out aaaaaaah!\" The reporter shrieked in surprise as a large trunk wrapped around her waist and yanked her away from her crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Monster?!</i>\" The elephant seethed with rage. The powerful trunk squeezed its victim hard before Quaker opened her huge maw and flung the reporter inside. One last scream preceded a heavy gulp and with determination in her eye she stared at the terrified crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep rolling or you can get a one way ticket to meet her.\" With that small interruption sorted out she turned her attention back to the Pint Puncher. She had the opportunity to destroy him live on TV. Though she knew better the elephant couldn't help herself. She had to put up a bit of a show. Maybe a bit of torture will get the audience ready for the main event. How does she torment the hero?</span></div></div>",

I don't know many people that would still be standing after a trip into my ass.\" The elephant smiled and looked down between her legs. \"Now be a good sport and lie still whilst I make sure my TV debut will be one to remember.\" She didn't even have to use her earthen powers to restrain him, the brutal squeezing the shrunken hero endured was enough to reduce him to a whimpering heap. The pathetic squeaks only grew a little louder as she positioned her enormous ass over him. Gleefully Quaker sat down, smothering the hero beneath her and grinding him a little under the immense mountain of ass. When she was confident she had everything lined up, she turned to the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, you always did make a better pillow than superhero, Punchy. Any villains watching this can confirm, am I right ladies and gents? Butt... now for the main event.\" Quaker chuckled at her own pun, the camera crew trying their hardest not to roll their eyes. \"You guys might want to hold your breath for a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep rumble could be heard coursing through the elephant's immense gut. With every passing second it grew louder. The hero was slowly panicking as the rumbling came closer and closer to him. Though he was trapped completely in darkness he knew the elephant's butthole was probably directly over him. The smell was already difficult to deal with down here, stinging his nose. The thundering belly of the supervillain was practically shaking with the buildup of noxious gas. The camera crew slowly began to pace back, not wanting to be caught in what must be the mother of all farts. Even Quaker began to feel a little uncomfortable, large volumes of foul fumes racing through her bowels. Finally she felt it rushing through her large intestine, going straight for the exit. She grunted and let out the single most devastating fart of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt blew out of her with such force that even her mighty buttcheeks parted a little, letting a stream of horrid green miasma waft out from behind her. The explosive strength was something the elephant was not prepared for. She held out her arms to balance herself as she felt her butt slowly lift off the ground. Her ass briefly turned into a rocket, expelling so much gas the elephant was slowly standing up. Of course the hero was equally shocked, but for entirely different reasons. A fart strong enough to lift the elephant was applying that exact same force to crush him into the pavement. He could feel the surface of the road crack under the brutal strength of her gassy blast. Every second such huge volumes of stench were forced up his nose he'd all but lost his sense of smell. The air grew thin and everything looked a little green. Every instant felt like an eternity for the superhero. When Quaker's fart finally petered out her ass came down once more to smother him in its weighty embrace. The Pint Puncher all but welcomed the crushing flesh after the torment he'd just endured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot damn I didn't know prison food could make a girl this gassy. I hope you enjoyed that, Punchy, because I'm not doing it again.\" With a smile she turned to inspect her camera crew. The sound guy had passed out from the stench, but the camera man had stuck the microphone in some rubble to hold it up and was still shooting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive, I didn't think you'd still be recording.\" The camera man smiled. \"Worked as a sewer worker for a couple o' years.\" Both man and supervillain laugh. He then goes back to wordlessly recording the elephant whilst she tries to think up her next punishment for the superhero. But after a fart like that, is there still a superhero to be punished? She lifts her butt to check on her victim.</span></div></div>",

No matter how many times she dominated shrunken humans, she never tired of the feeling of power it gave her. This particular human showed a remarkable endurance and strength. She would enjoy breaking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final, powerful bounce, the flamingo pushes herself to her feet. She checks the ground and smiles seeing it unoccupied, knowing exactly what it means. She felt her plush ass for a moment and peeled off the flattened hero from her full cheek and brought him to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher wore a look of terror beneath his torn mask. It stood in stark contrast to the look of glee on Fiona's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you don't look like you're enjoying yourself little one,\" she cooed with mock sympathy. \"Not much of a dancer?\" she asked smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's OK hero, I can dance enough for the two of us. But what is dancing without a partner?\" she asked, not expecting an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further explanation, the hero felt himself moved rapidly as Fiona's hand returned to her massive posterior. His vision was once again filled by her soft, flamingo fanny. But this time, it wasn't her cheek that was moving closer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo!\" the Pint Puncher screamed weakly as Fiona's plans became clear. But he was helpless to do anything to prevent the flamingo from pressing his small shrunken body deep between her massive cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona pulls her empty hand out and claps happily as she clenches her ass over her rival. The hero groans as he's introduced to a new world of pain as he's engulfed by Fiona's massive and incredibly strong ass on all sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where were we before we were so rudely interrupted?\" she asked to herself. Her eyes returned to the crowd of still entranced humans, their eyes following her every move. Some drooled jealously at her ass, foolishly wishing to trade places with the trapped hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, my music please!\" she called as she returned to her platform and returned to her dancing. As she performed for the humans, she took special care to shake and shimmy her hips a little more than usual and added an extra clench to her firm ass to ensure the hero enjoyed his front row seat. Every so often, she would bend her long neck and invite a member of her adoring crowd to crawl into her mouth and slip down her throat. She couldn't possibly be happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher, on the other hand, was miserable. With every swing if her hips, the flesh on Fiona's ass rippled and pounded him with wave after wave of cascading booty. With every clench, he felt like his body would give out. But he fought and held on to consciousness, desperately looking for the opportunity to slip out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought he saw it when her cheeks parted just slightly. It happened when she was distracted swallowing a fan, enjoying the sensation of the full sized man slipping down her throat more, at least momentarily, than the super hero just a couple of inches tall trapped within her ass. When he saw light, the hero tried to fly away. But his opportunity slammed shut quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon realized that escape was hopeless. As opportunity after opportunity passed him by. He had taken such a pounding by the flamingo's cheeks that he was completely flattened. He was also helplessly stuck to the inner wall of her crack, far too battered and weak to pry himself off. He was at the villain's mercy, assuming she had any.</span></div></div>",

She knew leaving someone like this alone for too long would be a problem. So, she had to have this brat dealt with while she helped herself to a buffet. Or heck, he somehow locked up Quaker. Maybe she could help her out. In the meantime, she had to deal with this guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew he wouldn't be shrunken forever, so she figured her dear flamingoes can't contain him. Then she began to think that maybe it isn't about power, it's about putting something he wouldn't want to hurt in his way. Yes, a few humans should be able to scare him into submission. Heck, with the right humans, she can have them dominate him. So, with a wave of her wing, she summoned forth a few ladies. She scanned the group, and her eyes caught two in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first lady wore a black leather jacket, and was stripped down to red panties and a red bra. She also wore thigh high leather boots, cherry red lipstick, and some sunglasses. She also had wavy blond hair that went down to her shoulders. The other lady wore a pink tank top along with gray yoga pants. She had brunette hair done up in a pony tail and pink lipstick. They were both tan, the lady in pink slightly more tan than the other, and they both had wide hips and a sizable bust. The lady in the leather jacket must've been 29 while the lady in yoga pants must've been 27. They should do nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flamingo handed Fiona a bottle, and she fished the hero out before plopping him within. Then she signaled the two ladies to approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a special job for you two,\" she said. \"I've got business elsewhere, so I need you two to babysit this little guy. Take him up to whatever room you want, and keep him in it for as long as possible. If he tries to fly away, get in his way and wrestle him down. If he gets unruly with you, sit on him and bully him. In the meantime, I'd like this bottle filled up with whatever you can extract from him~\" At the last order, she gave the two a wink. They both nodded in understanding, and the leather-clad lady held onto the bottle holding the Pint Puncher, and the two began to go into the hotel, the hero horrified at the villainess' proposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, the two entered a room, the lady with yoga pants locking the door behind her, while the leather-clad lady pat the bottle, knocking the hero out of it. As soon as he fell out, the hero was back to his normal size. He immediately flew towards the door, but the leather clad lady wrapped her arms around his midsection and held him back. He was about to hit her out of instinct, but he remembered she was still a human. He couldn't harm him. With that, she picked him up and slammed him onto the bed. Then, she straddled his hips and looked down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our mistress says we have free reign to punish you, kiddo,\" she said. \"So, if you want your stay to be pleasant, then you better do exactly what we say. First...\" The lady in yoga pants ran over, removed her shoes, and placed her foot on the hero's chest, before bringing it close to his lips. \"Kiss my partner's foot.\"</span></div></div>",

Where am I?\" the blonde asks in bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...who are you?\" the brunette responds, clearly equally confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they take stock of their situation, their curves jiggle in place and the hero moans in pleasure under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack!\" the brunette shouts, shooting to her feet at the sensation of the Pint Puncher's voice echoing into her crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy sh....\" the blonde starts, but is too overcome in awe to even finish her sentence as she follows the path of the hero's body to where it disappears beneath her. She flexes her cheeks and feels his erection twitch in response. Her eyes somehow widen even more at the sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I was just face sitting the pint puncher!\" the brunette exclaims in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still straddling his dick!\" the blonde responds in a mix of shock and excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they look at each other in awe and confusion, their shocked expression shifts to joyous smiles. The brunette plops her round ass back onto the hero's face, her flesh is met with an \"Ooof\" but also a content sigh of relief. They introduce themselves to each other. The leather clad brunette is Heather and the yoga pants wearing blonde is Becca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He hasn't like, tried to push you off him, right? Or get away?\" Heather asks her new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" a happy and confident Becca responds while bouncing on the hero's crotch. \"All signs suggest that he's enjoying this as much as I am,\" she giggles. \"And I mean <i>all</i> signs,\" she says with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right?\" Heather continues, shifting her ass in place and grinding against the Pint Puncher's face. \"I swear he looked sad when I stood up and seemed happier when I sat back down,\" she mused. \"I mean, who would want to part from this sexy bod, but I didn't expect this from a hero!\" she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we may as well enjoy ourselves!\" Becca continued. \"No idea how we got here, but who knows when we'll get a chance like this again!\" she continued to encourage Heather as she clenched her own ass, massaging the hero's erection, which was strained against his elastic costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what now?\" Becca wondered. </span></div></div>",

These clothes only made it harder to enjoy the Pint Puncher! They'd have to allow themselves complete access to the hero's most private of parts. The hero shivered as he felt Becca's hands slither along his hips, her fingers worming into the waistband of his latex shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo~ Mister Hero allows easy access~\" she cooed. She lifted her butt a little, freeing the hero just a little bit. However, she dragged her hands down the rest of the way, and the Pint Puncher was made aware of his suddenly free genitals. He was downright paralyzed with fear as the predatory ladies dressed him down. While Becca worked his pants off, Heather had reached behind her and grabbed the hero's mask. She pulled upwards, and easily slipped it off of him, leaving his very exposed face exposed to the brunette's leather-clad ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't have to worry about this dirty thing,\" she teased. \"You've got the perfect mask riiiiiight here~\" She punctuated her point with a few butt rubs on top of the hero's face, him groaning a little as the still smelly rear smeared over him. He soon felt his pants get slid off of his legs, leaving him with just his shirt left. Fortunately for him, while Heather was more than happy to act as the new mask, Becca was content with acting as the loincloth, sitting her clothed rear on top of his cock, her curvy rump easily swallowing it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my~ I can feel his warm skin~ And I can feel him throbbing inside me~\" Becca cooed. The Pint Puncher was stunned, floored. He'd hate to let himself get used like this, but he was also afraid of using too much power against these two. However, he was also alarmed about just how... direct they were. When left alone with him, these two were more than ready to molest him! How many of his supporters were like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could scarcely ponder more as the blond babe began moving her rump forwards and back, as if stroking the hero's cock. Meanwhile, the hero could feel Heather rub side to side on him, fitting his face deeper into her crack. And at the same time, he could feel her feet work around to the back of his head, helping to push it in. Unbelievable, the hero was being accosted by a couple of powerless ladies... and they were beating him!</span></div></div>",

She stood up, leaving one foot on either side of the hero's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you just sit back and enjoy the show hero,\" she whispered seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrust me, the Pint Puncher thought, I'm not going anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Heather started to slowly shake her yoga pants clad hips. She picked up the pace moment by moment, dipping her hips close to the hero's face before standing again. The small hero was in awe at the way her flesh bounced and jiggled even in the confines of the clingy fabric. Before too long, the fabric would be gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather licked her lips and hooked her thumbs into her waistband, slowly and teasingly pulling them down inch by tantalizing inch until they covered the Pint Puncher's face. Only then did she lift her feet one at a time to peel them off. She moved to sit down, but Becca interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! If you're covering his face, he won't be able to see my striptease!\" she whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...but I will,\" Heather responded with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca smirked and pushed the brunette down toward the hero's crotch, which she was only too happy to plop down on. The Pint Puncher gasped as his firm erection was swallowed up, joining Heather's thong deep between her fleshy cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde smiled at the hero's reaction before dropping to all fours and crawling toward him. She was already in red panties, but that didn't mean she couldn't give him a show. She tore her leather jacket off and threw it aside in a passive rage. Wild eyed, she sat up tall, her crotch directly above his head. Pint Puncher could barely see her face over her large breasts and red bra. His eyes grew wider still as she started to slowly peel down the shoulder straps on her bra before letting her tits bounce free above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he's enjoying this!\" Heather said, confirming what Becca already knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if he likes this so far, he's going to love what comes next,\" she said seductively before slowly lowering her massive breasts to the hero's face and smothering him in their fleshy embrace. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher can only moan in aroused submission as Becca lowered her enormous breasts onto him, completely engulfing his head and neck as they lay there on the floor. The stimulation is enough to make his bare cock throb uncontrollably between Heather\u2019s plump asscheeks, making her squeal with delight. \u201cMmm yeah, you like that, don\u2019t you, Punchy,\u201d Becca coos, flirtatiously asking a question all three of them already know the answer to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any other circumstance, the hero would be mortified to be so completely and utterly subdued by a couple of ordinary people (if he could call their unbelievably outrageous curves \u201cordinary\u201d). But his pride as a hero has been completely smothered into submission by these amorous women, entrancing him so much that he\u2019s forgotten he could overpower them with ease. By simply burying him beneath more tits and ass than any man (super or otherwise) can handle, they\u2019ve got him completely wrapped around their little fingers. As a sign of this, Pint Puncher takes his hands and mindlessly starts groping Becca\u2019s soft chest, relishing the way copious amounts of her flesh spill between his adoring fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca purrs upon feeling this and gently rubs her chest back and forth across Pint Puncher\u2019s face, his hot breath radiating against her skin and giving her goosebumps. Meanwhile, Heather continues to toy with his cock, completely hidden from the outside world thanks to her giant squeezing asscheeks; She alternates between flexing them both at the same time and flexing them individually, driving the Pint Puncher mad with the varying stimulation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of going mad, Becca loves the feeling of the Pint Puncher so pressed up against her sensitive breasts, and she\u2019s eager to take things a step further. Lifting her enormous chest off him for a moment, she gives him just enough space to breathe while treating him to yet another breathtaking sight of her round, creamy breasts hovering above him, each one topped off with a hardened pink nipple that\u2019s begging to be sucked. \u201cOpen wide, Punchy,\u201d Becca eagerly demands, barely giving him enough time to comply before plopping her breasts back on him and shoving a huge pink nub into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the Pint Puncher feels the shot glass-sized nipple press against his tongue, his mouth ardently dotes on the feminine invader. Sucking it. Licking it. Even gently biting down on it. He ravenously adores it in a way that sends lighting up and down Becca\u2019s spine, compelling her to press more and more of her breast against his face. In her sexual fervor, she realizes that just one of her breasts is capable of smothering the Pint Puncher, which gives her a devilish idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her nipple out of his mouth (with a cartoonishly audible *pop*), Becca goes back to burying the Pint Puncher\u2019s head between her cavernously deep cleavage, but this time she uses her hands to squeeeeeeeze her breasts around his head, giving him absolutely nothing to breathe except the scent of her lavender body lotion against her smooth skin. Startled by the sudden lack of air, the hero flails his arms in surprise, but Becca refuses to budge, even as the rest of his body begins to writhe. Heather feels his hips suddenly jerk, making her squeak in surprise as her ass is briefly lifted in the air by a few millimeters before heavily bouncing back onto his crotch. She giggles, as if she just felt a buck from a mini-mechanical bull ride.\u201dWoah-ho, easy there, Becca. We don\u2019t want to break the little guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca laughs. \u201cAre you kidding!? He\u2019s the Pint Puncher. He can totally take it,\u201d she exclaims while smearing her chest against his head. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him endure worse on the news.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, fair point,\u201d Heather says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like he\u2019s not enjoying it, not if his stiff little friend here has anything to say about it,\u201d she adds while giving his cock an extra grind with her ass. \u201cSuperpowers ot not, I guess any man\u2019s weakness is his cock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight!? This is so perfect, \u201cBecca sings. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I haven\u2019t met a man yet that could handle this much woman.\u201d As emphasis, Becca gives her humongous breasts an extra firm squeeze, letting them bulge even more around the Pint Puncher\u2019s head as he winces from the sweet but suffocating pressure. \u201cBut Punchy here might just be the superpowered boy-toy I\u2019ve been looking for, taking all the \u2018punishment\u2019 I can give and practically begging for more each time.\u201d Heather giggles and nods. She 100% relates to everything Becca said, and she\u2019s just as eager to see how far they can go with the enamored hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust look.\u201d To further demonstrate, Becca finally lifts her chest off the Pint Puncher\u2019s face, giving him just enough room to breathe again. Thanks to his super powers, he was in no danger of suffocating just yet, but Becca\u2019s smothering was just enough to make another critical blow at his rational thought, leaving nothing but a dumb grin on the hero\u2019s face as these girls almost literally smothered his brains out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeking to further test his durability--and in the most teasing way possible--Becca starts shaking her shoulders, swinging her heavy breasts back and forth to repeatedly pummel the dazed hero with them. Heather laughs and cheers her friend on as she dominates the hero in such an overwhelmingly feminine way, and Heather also can\u2019t help but enjoy the way his cock throbs against her ass each time Becca\u2019s tits slap him. Becca eventually stops after a few minutes, and both women giggle at the punch-drunk look on the Pint Puncher\u2019s face, caused only by Becca\u2019s wrecking ball of a bosom. But, even after all that, he\u2019s still hopelessly aroused and compliant, which makes the women want to toy with the hero all the more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got another idea,\u201d Becca says. \u201cHelp me move him.\u201d The two dominant nymphomaniacs drag the Pint Puncher to a wall and force him to sit up against it before strutting to the other side of the room. The deliriously aroused hero has just enough wherewithal to look up and enjoy the sight of both naked women as they put on a sultry show for him. Giving him a glimpse of what\u2019s in store for him Becca fondles her bouncy, perky chest while Heather jiggles her bubble butt from side to side, occasionally spanking it to make it ripple ceaselessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word of warning, Becca suddenly sprints towards the Pint Puncher, and she jumps at the last second, hitting him with a powerful body splash that sends her soft but powerful breasts crashing against his dazed head. It was a one-two combination of force and pleasure, enough to send even the Pint Puncher reeling. Becca enjoys the way the Pint Puncher groans against her chest for a few moments before pulling back, but she isn\u2019t done with her titty assault yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe presses her palms against the wall, trapping the hero between her outstretched arms, and proceeds to repeatedly slam her pulverizing chest against his face. Loud, fleshy thuds echo through the room each time Becca shoves herself against the wall, ringing though the Pint Puncher\u2019s ears as his senses continue to be overwhelmed by Becca\u2019s feminine assets. After a few minutes, Becca finally peels herself off the hero, but, even with Becca gone, he barely has time to think, thanks to what\u2019s coming next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher\u2019s eyes widen at the sight of Heather\u2019s shelf of an ass barrelling towards his face, which slams against him like a fleshy meteor. Just as Becca moved, Heather also sprinted towards the Pint Puncher, and she turned at the last second so she could land her ass against his head. Heather gives a content sigh, happy to finally have her turn and to reunite the Puncher\u2019s cute face with her all-encompassing butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts out slow, dancing her hips back and forth in a graceful but sensual way, dragging his head along with each hypnotic gyration, but it doesn\u2019t take Heather long to get as forceful as Becca. After her \u2018warm up,\u2019 Heather rocks her hips forward before throttling them backwards, once again crushing the Pint Puncher\u2019s head with her unstoppably fleshy ass. She does this again, and again, and again, giggling at the feeling of his muffled voice groaning in dizzy arousal against her breathtaking posterior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, Heather finally stops and gets off of the Pint Puncher. As soon as she does, he crumples to the floor. Not even he could stand up to such a sexy but overwhelming onslaught of female flesh...well, a certain part of him is still standing up, at least, so eager for more attention--even after all of that--that it\u2019s beginning to leak precum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, are you feeling tired, Punchy,\u201d Becca asks teasingly, treating him to yet another glimpse of her deep cleavage as she bends over in front of him and squeezes her chest between her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you ask me, it looks like he\u2019s still raring to go,\u201d Heather says while pointing out his leaking boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, cause we\u2019re just getting started,\u201d Becca says. \u201cBut I suppose we could give him a slight break.\u201d With that, the girls decide to finally toss him onto the bed, figuring the extra cushion beneath him would help him endure all the fleshy cushion they plan to put on top of him.~ They lay him onto his back at the foot of the bed, letting his head droop over the edge of it. Like a hungry predator, Becca pounces onto the hero, dropping her immense cleavage onto his awaiting cock and making it disappear instantly. Just as the weight and stimulation from such a heavy impact begins to make the Pint Puncher yell in pleasure, Heather struts around the foot of the bed and leans back, plopping her ass onto his head so his agonized moans can reverberate through her cheeks.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n1. Roleplaying: the girls pretend to be heroes/villains that subue PP, basically a game of Sexy Cops and Robbers<br>\r\n2. Smothering game: The girls compete to see if one of them can make him cum before the other knocks him out with their TnA.<br>\r\n3.

She plopped her full, round ass on the back of the hero's masked head, forcing his face deeper between the brunette's panty covered cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph!\" he protested in surprise, but his protest turned to a moan of pleasure as Heather wrapped her massive breasts around his erection and squeezed, enjoying his new position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, yeah make sure you get him in there deep Becca,\" Heather whispered lustfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette didn't say a word in response, but the request clearly registered as she gleefully bounced and rubbed her ass along the back of the hero's head before shifting and straddling him. She too started to moan as she started to grind her crotch against him, forcing his nose somehow deeper into Heather's crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero's will to fight had completely faded, and the women were all too happy to take advantage of that. </span></div></div>",

Becca and Heather spun around with a gasp and saw the towering form of Fionna. They had just shadows of a memory from seeing her in the lobby of the hotel earlier, but they knew enough to be worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath them, the Pint Puncher had no idea what was going on. He moaned at the sudden body movement on his face and crotch, but things were very still and silent since then. It wasn't until the women slowly stood up that he saw the immediate threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Fionna's faithful flamingos had been keeping an eye on things in the hotel room and updated the villainess on the current situation. She wasn't here out of anger. Far from it. In fact, if she could, she would willingly adopt Olivia's invisibility powers and pull up a bucket of popcorn to enjoy the show. Unfortunately, her powers didn't allow for that. She had an idea of how to make the atmosphere even more entertaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the three humans waited for her to announce her purpose, she used her long arm to stick a camera on the wall behind her. Then, with a smile, she finally started to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like I'm interrupting a party!\" she said with a smile. \"Don't mind me, you'll hardly remember I was here,\" she cooed before starting a very unique dance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't attempted this move often, but it was something she had to try. She was combining two of her dances into one unique show. One that would prove to be well worth the trip if it worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her dance started, the women and the Pint Puncher fell into a trance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather and Becca, you have proven your worth as guardians. Continue your games with the small hero to your heart's content, consider him your toy. Just make sure to keep him here in the room. Of course, I'm sure you can give him several reasons to stay with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you Pint Puncher,\" she continued, turning her gaze on the hero, \"You will find yourself at complete submission to the two beautiful women in the room with you. No matter what happens, you will not attempt to escape. Further, you'll find that as they excite you, you will slowly yet steadily shrink. You will accept the shrinking as completely normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Fionna concluded her hypnotic suggestion. \"As I leave the room, you will not remember my presence, but will return to your previous...activities,\" she said arching her eyebrows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final flap of her wings, Fionna finished her dance and swiftly exited the room. The women and the hero blinked in confusion, but Heather and Becca quickly turned their attention back to the masked hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Punchy! You look so cold!\" Becca frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we had better warm him up quickly then, shouldn't we?\" Heather says, returning to her seat on top of the hero's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're absolutely right Heather,\" Becca giggles, straddling his crotch once again and lowering her chest so that it rubs against the hero's roughed up uniform.</span></div></div>",

Now that he\u2019s only at half their height, everything about them seems frighteningly bigger, especially their mind-boggling curves. They treat him to the sight of their hanging cleavage as they bend forward to likewise admire his new size, dangling four massive, tanned breasts--each one easily twice as big as his head--in front of him while squeezing them between their arms. It was a terrifyingly arousing sight, enough to make him drool a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, look at him! He\u2019s just soooo cute,\u201d Heather squeals, finding the hero\u2019s new size to be absolutely adorable. Unable to contain herself, she quickly snatches the Pint Puncher and peppers him with aggressively affectionate kisses. *Mwah* *Mwah* *MWAH* *MMMMMMWAHHH!* The Pint Puncher feels the brunettes\u2019s plump, pink lips repeatedly press and suck against various parts of his face and upper body. In just a few moments, his face was nearly painted with Heather\u2019s lipstick, and the overwhelming number of breathtaking kisses left him dizzy in her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone with kissing him (for now), she glomps the Pint Puncher into the biggest, softest hug he\u2019s ever had, and the dazed hero can\u2019t help but drop his weary head onto her awaiting bosom, resting his face on the abundantly soft pillows. \u201cAww, look! Punchy here really likes my boobs too,\u201d Heather giggles, pleased with the way his now naked cock--still stiff from all their teasing and bullying--presses against her slim stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot like I could blame him,\u201d Becca acknowledges, pleased to finally meet a beauty that\u2019s just as stacked as her. \u201cBut, if you ask me, Punchy here still looks cold, especially now that he\u2019s naked. Fortunately, I know the perfect way to warm him up, and I know he\u2019ll just looooove it.~\u201d Becca and Heather sit down along the edge of the bed and lay the Pint Puncher along their laps, facing upwards. Beneath him, the Pint Puncher feels their smooth, plump thighs shifting against his head, back, and legs. Above him, a canopy consisting of two pairs of massive tit flesh hovers just above him, barely restrained by the tight tank top or small bra used to contain them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, both women peel their constrictive tops off, freeing their mammoth boobs and amorously letting them drop onto the Pint Puncher\u2019s body. \u201cNothing like a little skinship to warm a body up, huh, Punchy,\u201d Becca coyly asks while the hero is submerged in more breast flesh than he could possibly know what to do with. His upper body is completely buried beneath Heather\u2019s breasts while Becca\u2019s breasts cover his legs, his head and feet barely managing to stick out from beneath these girls. But the most agonizing part for the hero is the way the sides of both women\u2019s jiggling bosoms converge on his crotch. His erection is fully enveloped between Heather\u2019s right breast and Becca\u2019s left breast, fully vulnerable to every stimulating little movement either woman makes with their smooth, creamy flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher moans loudly from the stimulating pressure alone, but his aroused groaning is quickly silenced by Heather placing a hand at the back of his head and shoving his face against her awaiting nipple, purring at the way his tongue anxiously dances against her pink nub. \u201cMmm, that\u2019s it, cutie. Show a lady how a hero sucks on some titty,\u201d she gleefully demands. Despite having just met, both women move in perfect sync to bring maximum, agonizing pleasure to the hero.They switch between dragging their chests left and right--smearing themselves across the rest of his body while repeatedly colliding their breasts against Pint Punchers unprotected cock--and bouncing up and down, stroking his erection to a fever pitch within their combined cavern of cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely losing himself to the pleasure, the Pint Puncher writhes and squirms adorably, making the women giggle and coo at the stimulating way he moves beneath them. He adoringly sucks on Heather\u2019s breast while draping his left arm across her bosom to fondle it, letting his arms and fingers sink deeply into its copious amounts flesh. Heather can hardly hold back a squeal from the way he adores her. \u201cYup, Punchy\u2019s definitely a boob man as much as he is an ass man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing we\u2019ve got plenty of both in spades,\u201d Becca boasts while they continue to gently tease and bully the hero with their chests. \u201cI still have no idea how we wound up like this, but I bet he\u2019s feeling awfully lucky to meet a couple of ladies like us. If we keep this up, he might never want to leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to any of them, Fiona\u2019s scheme to keep the Pint Puncher trapped continues to go off without a hitch. </span></div></div>",

Though he's very muscular, he's also notoriously shy. He'd been the kind of guy that struggled to really socialize, even before he was transformed. With the new body, he'd thought that'd give him the boost he needs, though he still struggles to talk to people. Though, seeing that everyone else was being fairly dominant with their new bodies, he felt like he'd have to do that in order to fit in. Though, he'd always struggle to get to that point. To look good for the bad guys, he'd usually hire performers to act like scared citizens, or plead with others to let him dominate them.

Those that smell his musk suddenly feel more lethargic and open to suggestion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy - an anthro eagle. He's known for his general girth. He eats a lot, though his meals always goes to \"the right places,\" filling out his belly, and filling out his rump, hips, and thighs. He takes great pride in everything below the belt area, loving how thick they were. Even before the transformation, Sammy's been a fairly prideful bird, always showing off to the birds around him. And now, now that the transformation's happened, now that he can eat anything and still look fine, he's become even more prideful. He regularly eats up anyone or anything, and even utilizes his power, the power to freeze a man solid with gas. He'd freeze them, heat them up by holding them close to his warm body, and then he'd eat them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher was heading towards a nearby town, hearing about an invading villain. He flew in, towards the source of it. He was soon upon the place citizens were said to be disappearing into, an abandoned warehouse. The Pint Puncher approached, heading towards what he was sure would be a tough fight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin, there were a few performers, dressed up like normal citizens, sitting around a storage closet, as if waiting for someone. Then, the door opened up. In came a man, wiping his face, and smelling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He asked for Thomas,\" the smelly man said, heading towards the back of the room. Then, another man stood up, apparently named Thomas. He appeared to be a well dressed office worker, but he was in fact another performer. He stepped out, and headed up the steps towards the upper level. As he traveled up, he began to hear a T.V. Judging by the voices on it, it sounded sort of like Rowland and the Pint Puncher. He got to the top of the stairs, and he saw the blue macaw, wearing a black thong and tight, black, tank top. Sure enough, there was a T.V. before him, playing one of Pint Puncher and Rowland's fights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas noticed the macaw was holding a notepad and pencil. Rowland was sitting down on the Pint Puncher's face, and, despite the blush forming on the bird's face, he was writing down something, some notes perhaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem,\" Thomas said, trying to get the bird's attention. The macaw turned towards Thomas. Then, he plucked a remote from nearby, and paused the T.V. feed, leaving it on a shot of Rowland rubbing his butt against the hero's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you must be Thomas,\" the macaw said, scrounging around for some money. \"I'm Louie, and...\" He kept searching for money, getting a few 20s. He held them out to Thomas, who pocketed them. \"...and I'm gonna... I'm gonna make things really uncomfortable.\" At the last part of his sentence, Louie tried to sound tough, though he moreso sounded childish. It was like if a kid were trying to sound like an adult. Thomas rolled his eyes, but he knew the terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please don't!\" he said, feigning horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no screaming's gonna save you!\" Louie declared, grabbing his shoulder and bringing a leg behind his legs. Then, his tone changed to one more of concern. \"Alright, easy... easy... easy...\" He used his other arm to hold Thomas' back and hold him up while his leg sweeped out Thomas'. As he spoke, he slowly lowered Thomas down on down, until the performer was left on the floor, having gently been lowered. \"Could you please, uh...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" Thomas said. He then spread out his limbs, looking as if he'd fallen on the ground rather than that he were gently lowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you see! There's no escaping Louie's grasp!\" Louie declared, trying to pose menacingly before the \"fallen\" Thomas. Then, he looked at his notepad, looking back at his notes on Rowland sitting on the Pint Puncher's face. So, methodically slow, like he were trying to recreate each movement in the notes, he placed his feet on either side of Thomas' head, squatted down onto his knees, before planting his thong-clad rump on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Thomas was originally not looking forwards to this, the moment he started taking a few whiffs, he began to feel more and more into this idea. Unbeknownst to Louie, his natrual musk could ease a man into lethargy, making it easier for Louie to sit on someone. Thomas would've held still normally, all things considered, but this smell made the idea of letting that happen become more digestible. Louie's hands were on Thomas' belly, and he used the leverage to shift his butt around on top of Thomas, rubbing into him like Rowland rubbed into the Pint Puncher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he heard the zoom of something going through the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-?\" Louie wondered. He stopped the rubbing, and looked around. Suddenly, a force plucked him, knocking him right off of Thomas, before it slammed him into a wall. Louie was suddenly greeted with the vision of the familiar whiteclad hero before him. \"P-Pint Puncher!\" he yelped out, worried. \"Wh-what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play dumb,\" the hero said. \"I saw you sitting on that guy, you're not getting away with that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He payed for that,\" Thomas said, getting up. At that, the Pint Puncher tensed up, caught off guard by what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he said, turning towards Thomas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy wanted to try out being as bad as those animals you see on the T.V, something about being just like those guys so they'd accept him?\" Thomas explained. \"Whatever, this guy wanted some guys to sit on and what not, so he payed us to come in here and let him do stuff.\" The Pint Puncher turned back towards Louie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of this, so you could be like creeps like Rowland?\" the Pint Puncher questioned him. Louie looked away, ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not really confident about talking with guys,\" Louie said. \"Especially when people started running from me. I guess animal-people like us don't have a good time with these people... So, I figured I'd only really fit in with people like Rowland, or Helen, or- or someone else like that. So, I've been trying to be like one of those 'sit-on-you' or 'fit-you-in-my-armpit' or one of those 'mess-with-your-junk' guys. I-I guess I can't really fit anything else... But, even though I've been trying here, I can't really fit in to this villain stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Louie spoke, he appeared to be getting more and more saddened. For a brief bit, the Pint Puncher began to feel pity for him. He may be seeking company with the wrong crowd, but he sounds like he's struggling to fit in anywhere else. Then again, the hero had a duty to tend to villains, and Louie had all of the signs of an up-and-coming villain if he were to continue down this path...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe it his musk or the pity the Pint Puncher felt for him, part of him felt compelled to help him with this endeavor. He wasn't a villain yet, right? He couldn't jail him like this, could he?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though, if this bird were to continue on this path, he would surely...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, something the Pint Puncher was smelling was convincing him that he should probably help Louie with his wish. Maybe... maybe he couldn't be so bad if he had the right teacher...

I think I can help.\" The Pint Puncher couldn't believe those words left his mouth. But seeing Louie's expression light up made it feel like the right thing to say. He grinned widly, jumping in place from pure glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you, thank you, thank you!\" he said between jumps, totally enthusiastic. \"Oh, we need to get started, right away!\" He ran over to the TV, and searched around on top of it. The Pint Puncher could hear the sound of CD cases being stirred around. He pulled a bunch of them off of the TV, and looked over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, let's see...\" Louie said, scanning over the labels he put on each case. \"I'm not yet comfortable with the... means these guys use. I've been trying as hard as possible to do what they do, but I don't think my heart's in it just yet.\" The Pint Puncher maneuvered around the guy to see just what he was looking at. He saw a case marked \"Rowland,\" \"Dereck,\" \"Tank,\" as well as a few cases that were obscured by others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be easier if we focused on a general area, rather than on a particular villain,\" the Pint Puncher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ok,\" Louie said, putting the CDs back. \"W-well, what do you think we should start with?\" The Pint Puncher was in a position unlike any he'd ever been in before. Actually instructing the villain on how to do stuff like this? Were it not for this smell in the air, he would've laughed at the idea.

The Pint Puncher would normally recognize this as the hunter sizing up their prey, but the macaw's movements were more akin to that of a prey looking for the chance to dart away. The Pint Puncher almost pitied this up and coming villain. Though, surely, if he struggled with this he couldn't possibly-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero's chain of thought was abruptly cut short when the villain came in from behind, one arm positioned around his back while his leg was behind the hero's legs. He then felt him sweep his leg forwards, yanking his legs away and causing him to lose his footing, now falling into the bird's arm. At that, he felt the macaw lower him before bring his other arm around his other side, it also helping his slow, careful descent, the bird's eyes full only of concern as he lowered the hero, eventually placing him on the ground. Then, he carefully placed his legs on either side, and bent down, straddling over his abdomen, though hovering slightly over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-like that?\" Louie asked as if he were getting a read on a teacher. Now it was the hero's turn to be unsure. He felt sort of urged to tell him what he was doing wrong. If he did, he could be making another villain for himself. And yet, there was something about his sincerity (and his smell) that made it hard to lie to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, villains are usually quicker and more forceful when they take a man down,\" he said. \"If this were a real fight, I could've easily flown out of your arms when we were descending.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, I guess that makes sense...\" Louie admitted. \"I just got scared about hurting you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's where some of the problem lies,\" the Pint Puncher said. \"There are few villains that care about who they hurt. Unless they're seeking out a particular mate to keep for a long time, they make sure their prey has no chance of getting away and are pinned down as soon as possible. Speaking of, you're leaving an awful lot of room for me to get unpinned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Louie said. Then, he lowered his hips, his butt now stradling his abdomen. \"Like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sort of like that,\" the hero said. \"Now, there's still a bit of face to cover up here, isn't there?\" The hero had to put in every ounce of effort hold back a laugh at seeing Louie's eyes widen as his hands snapped up to his beak in an embarassed shock. Funny, he seemed to've not expected to get this far...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouie placed his hands on the ground below, worry eminating from his face, and then he began scooting forwards. He watched as the speedos-clad form came up and up his body, his balls soon scooting over his chin... and soon his rump was on top, completely covering his face. The macaw then turned around, making sure his body was facing the rest of the hero's body while he was seated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm familiar with sitting on some guys, I'll have you know...\" Louie said. \"Though, it's only been there that I've gone. I-I've been a bit nervous about going forwards. I've seen a few variations of the follow up a-and I'm not sure which one to use...\" He lifted his butt a little, allowing the hero a moment to speak. \"Now, what do you think a villain like me would or should do now?\" Once again, the Pint Puncher felt a dilemma. Would he help teach him how to capitalize on a facesit, or would he get him to learn the wrong lessons?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Had his battle with Quaker taken such a toll on him that his mind was playing tricks on him? Maybe he really needed a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<i>SNAP</i>- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard the snap of a branch. It was almost inaudible, but it was detectible to the Pint Puncher's heightened senses. His neck cranked around quickly and saw something just a bit off in the clearing just to his side. He saw nothing, but ducked out of instinct. As he moved, he felt a <i>WHOOSH</i> over his head as if he had narrowly avoided being hit by something large and very fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" he wondered aloud. As he spoke those words, he heard a female voice cackling. As his eyes followed the sound of laughter, Olivia made herself visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few feet away stood a 12 foot tall female zebra! Where had she come from??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia's laughter continued as she walked in a slow circle around the Pint Puncher. Her thick, strong thighs rippled with each step she took and her large round breasts jiggled as she laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you supposed to be?\" she asked, continuing to circle him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the Pint Puncher, hero to all humanity. I heard cries for help in this area. Who are you and what have you done?\" the hero demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe received continued laughter as a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't need to worry about those pesky cries anymore,\" Olivia taunted, continuing to circle her prey. \"The pesky humans making them have been silenced,\" she said, rubbing her round ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do!?\" the Pint Puncher cried, launching himself at the zebra in a rage. He found himself crashing to the forest floor as the villainous zebra disappeared from sight, only to reappear behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same thing I'm going to do to you,\" she said tauntingly, launching herself into the air, preparing to fall bottom first on the costumed hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Olivia's turn to crash to the floor, as the Pint Puncher rolled to safety before Olivia could make impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to do better than that,\" the Puncher warned, taking a fighting stance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, trust me when I tell you that Olivia can do much, much better,\" the zebra said, returning to a standing position, towering over the Pint Puncher. </span></div></div>",

He found her words and her body incredibly enticing. After being battered by Quaker's feet and ass and horrible suppressed memories of Derek's stench, Olivia seemed to be offering herself to him.

She slowly, sensually circled the hero's groin, causing him to grow a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula grinned and slowly wrapped her hand around his bulge.

My gentle touch isn't good enough for you?! Fine, let's do this your way then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer latex suit tightened, restricting the hero further and filling him with fear. She just announced she wasn't going to play nice and she still has free reign of his crotch. He tried to protest, but his mouth was covered by her suit and his words were muffled into gibberish. Paula paid him no mind as she quietly seethed with malice. Her hand kept going up and down the length of his shaft until she stopped, holding on to the tip of his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a vicious smile the panther squeezed the throbbing mass in her hand. The reaction was immediate. The calm and sedated hero began squirming and screaming. Her suit was holding him down, but she couldn't deny that the sensation of his wiggling body against hers wasn't a little arousing. All the motivation she needed to slowly ratchet up the pressure. She gripped his cock with more and more strength, crushing his painfully erect manhood in her hand. The Pint Puncher was crying with pain, but the panther was merciless. She released her iron grasp only to move her hand down and squeeze the shaft. No part of his member would escape her crushing grip. Perhaps that would be rough enough for the hero's liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis squirms subsided a little as the shaft wasn't quite as sensitive as the head, but the hero was far from happy. He needed a way out. Whatever it would take. He even wished her could just tell his captor that he was right on the edge at the hands of her gentle touch. Anything to stop her from abusing his manhood. Paula seemed all too joyous about the new situation though. She lowered her hand again, resting against the base of his rod and squeezing hard once more. The subdued reaction bored her within seconds. Perhaps she should reach a little lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher nearly lost his mind when he felt her fingers wrap around his sack. Anything but that. He began to wiggle intensely, much to the pleasure of his captor. But her plan was set and she was going to do this. Slowly she gripped his balls tighter and tighter. He'd been sat on by the heaviest beings in the city and used as a punching bag a dozen times over. But this was the most pain he'd ever felt in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula was unrelenting and the coup de grace came shortly after. Her powerful grip on his balls remained when her other hand came in to join the fun. She immediately picked the second most sensitive spot on his manhood and took hold of the tip once again. She softly whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you like this, because I'm not going to stop until one of us climaxes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't think it possible for him to be in more pain, but every time she crushed his manhood a little harder it somehow managed to hurt even more. Even more unsettling was the sensation that the panther was now actively writhing with joy against his own squirming body. Lastly a deeply disturbing thought ran through his mind. How was he still hard? Was he somehow liking this rough play? Or was he just afraid that if he went flaccid she might just enrage and rip it off or something? When this was over he was going to need some time and probably a therapist. For now those thoughts could be pushed aside with some help of the mind-numbing amounts of pain he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho hits their climax first?</span></div></div>",

She was enjoying his hopeless squirms and struggles against her, but she knew she had him secure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panther sighed as she stood, now in a very relaxed state of mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I tell you Punchy?\" she mocked, pressing her hand against the back of his head, forcing his face deeper into her flesh, \"You always know just how to cheer me up. But I know a way we can have even more fun together!\" she squealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, the Pint Puncher doubted that he would enjoy whatever she was planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, small tentacles sprouted from the inside of Paula's suit. They pressed against the hero's body in a way that forced him to move. The form fitting latex gave way just enough to allow him passage. He wasn't quite sure what was happening, but as the suit forced him around the side of Paula's body, her plan became clear. His struggles intensified. Maybe with the slight give of the suit, he would be able to make an escape! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the suit only relaxed exactly where Paula wanted it to. He couldn't push his way back or fight against the direction she was prodding him toward. His struggles only pushed him closer toward his destination and her end goal. That destination was met when, as the hero assumed, the suit tightened up and pressed his body close against Paula's round ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panther looked over her shoulder and laughed at the sight of the Pint Puncher shaped lump that protruded from her ass. She again pressed her hand to the back of his head, forcing his face into the soft flesh on her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, just where you belong hero,\" she mocked, \"You've been a pain in my ass for a while now, it's about time you get more acquainted with it,\" she laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula thought about crushing him into her ass here and now, but that would be too easy. She wanted to enjoy the feeling of dominance she had over him like this. Knowing what was coming, but completely unable to do anything about it. Paula decided to take a peaceful stroll through the quiet jungle, swaying her hips and taking the Pint Puncher for a ride with each step she took. </span></div></div>",

He tried to push away from her, but she stretched the rubber such that he was plastered against her, unable to move. Paula laughed as she manipulated her rubber to create a custom slingshot for herself. She stretched upward higher and higher, and snapped downwards, butt aimed at the soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thunderous boom, Paula struck the ground, Pint Puncher plastered right between her and the ground.

But first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hero~\" she cooed. \"I feel your complaining.

His wriggling would not slow down, and Paula's discomfort rose. She sighed. \"I warned you, kid~\" She snickered, and the hero could feel more rubber tentacles press into him.

His eyes widened in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero wriggled even harder as he was forced in deeper and deeper! And all the while, Paula decided to watch. She smirked as she noticed that hero-shaped bulge glide along her buttock. And said bulge got closer and closer to her crack. And then, with a terrified cry, she licked her lips as the bulge vanished into the crack and between her massive cheeks. She sighed and adjusted her suit, before walking. The hero, meanwhile, was wriggling in his new prison.

He tried to push way, but the suit just held on too tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should really learn to relax and enjoy what's around you hero,\" Paula advised from above. \"How many humans would sacrifice anything to be pressed up close against my glorious ass like you are right now?\" she wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, even though you won't admit it, I can feel you enjoying yourself.

Let me help you relax. Just give in,\" Paula said with a smile. She enjoyed the shakes and shivers the hero reluctantly made as the small hands from her suit rubbed his body up and down.

Heroes don't typically get the luxury of vacations, but a break of some kind was exactly what he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off soaring slowly to the nearest city. He landed and casually strolled through the city streets, which were fairly vacant. No doubt due to the recent activity from Quaker, he thought. As he walked, a specific building caught his eye. It was small and unimposing compared to the rest of the skyline, but the storefront read \"Double G Massage Parlor\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massage. Yes, that's exactly what he needed.

Maybe he had misjudged them, but from his experience, every animal who gained powers had used them for evil. He took a moment to look closer at the two gazelles. They were certainly tall and curvy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them had on an outfit made out of nothing but grass, and it did very little to hide her ample breasts and her thick ass. The other was more covered, wearing a fluffy white robe. But her body pushed even that material to its limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gazelles could tell they didn't have the hero convinced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell you what, we'll give you a half price special to convince you and as thanks for saving our city from Quaker. That news spread pretty fast,\" the gazelle in the robe said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Puncher's eyes widened at hearing that. The second gazelle caught his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you think Quaker limited her abuses to just humans? Trust me, if she got her hands on me or my sister, she wouldn't give a second thought to abusing us like anyone else,\" she said matter of factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero nodded his agreement. He would take them up on their offer. The gazelles eagerly led him to the back and instructed him to lie on a massage table. They gave him the option to disrobe or to remain clothed. Still not fully trusting the two, he chose to keep his costume on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, one of the gazelles grabbed a camera and asked permission for a quick selfy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once Facebook sees the mighty Pint Puncher trusts us enough to have a massage, I'm sure we'll be drowning in customers!\" she cheered gleefully before snapping several photos. They introduced themselves as Kelly and Layla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further delay, the gazelles began their massage. They worked on him together, with one focusing on his shoulders and arms and the other starting on his legs. They slowly moved their way to meeting in his lower back. The Pint Puncher groaned happily as he started feeling his muscles relax. The Gazelle Gals smiled knowingly at each other as their super powered massage started to take affect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he felt his pains melt away, the Pint Puncher breathed deep, happy with his decision. Then, from the corner of his eye he saw a bit of Kelly's robe get pushed aside, revealing a spandex uniform and....a cape! His eyes widened as the reality of the situation hit him. He had to get away!</span></div></div>",

He tossed the two away from him, and leapt off of the massage table, before turning towards the two, fists raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, so much for our plan,\" the gazelle wearing grass said. Layla motioned towards Kelly, who nodded in understanding. She removed her robe, exposing her form-fitting spandex. She then began to levitate off the ground a little. The Pint Puncher tried to float, but was surprised to find he couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on with?\" he asked aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We told you we could communicate with nerves and sense pressure points, right?\" Kelly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We communicate so well, we can make them loosen up incredibly well,\" Layla said. \"If Kelly here didn't expose herself, then we could've massaged you into an immobile state. Though, I suppose now we can play with you~\" The two stretched, Kelly still floating as she did so. The Pint Puncher debated whether or not to handle them. However, before he could debate further, Layla suddenly wound up behind him. With a swift kick, the Pint Puncher was punted towards Kelly, who turned her back towards him. With a thrust backwards, Kelly struck the Pint Puncher in the face with her butt. The Pint Puncher fell onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it feel to be human, Punchy?\" Kelly taunted, looking over her shoulder at him, her butt filling his vision. The Pint Puncher tried to get up, but Kelly fell down, landing her butt right on top of his face. She rubbed back and forth, before getting off of the panting hero. The two then began to ponder what to do with him.</span></div></div>",

Wasting no time, Layla stepped over him and plopped her round, full ass onto his crotch. The hero groaned in both pain and excitement as she landed. The gazelle frowned at the hero's lack of an erection, but she flexed her cheeks over his crotch several times getting to work on rectifying that situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hero was occupied trying to push Layla off of him, Kelly soared overhead. She smirked as she watched the Pint Puncher's futile efforts to dethrone her sister. Without his super strength, he was unable to push Layla off with his arms, his shoves and punches registering as just playful saps and gropes to Layla's massive ass. He resorted to using his whole body to try to buck her off. All that accomplished was pushing his growing erection deeper between her firm cheeks, causing the gazelle who was twice his size to squeal with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not notice Kelly had floated her way directly above his head and was levitating in a seated position. She was nearing the limits of the small massage parlor, but with her sister having the hero pinned securely to the floor, she was a good ten feet above his face. Kelly licked her lips in anticipation of what she was about to do. She had the hero beneath her ass for a few moments, but it was not nearly enough for her to be satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any further thought or delay, Kelly allowed herself to free fall. At the last moment, the Pint Puncher saw her falling body but it was too late to do anything about it. His eyes shot open as her spandex covered ass made contact with his face. While the sisters had sapped him of his strength and flight, he fortunately still had his super powered durability. If he hadn't, the impact Kelly made may have left his skull a mess on the floor. Even with his enhanced durability, he still felt his face collapse on himself as the overwhelming gazelle landed. He felt his flattening face slip in between her cheeks, but fortunately for him her costume prevented his face from sinking in too deep. Kelly's smile grew broader as she ground down further on his defenseless body. She hopped in place happily, enjoying the sensation as her ass, which was twice as large as the hero's head, cascaded over the Pint Puncher over and over again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the joy the sisters felt, something wasn't quite right...</span></div></div>",

But it was not enough for her. She wanted to feel it throb and pulse. The Pint Puncher feels a wave of relief wash over him as the warm weight of Layla no longer presses on his member. He couldn't believe he got himself into this situation. If only he'd kept his guard up. Not only did he find himself dominated by the gazelles, he practically lied down for them and let them do it. How could he have been so stupid. His self-pity was halted by a new and troublesome feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm buttcheeks of Layla were back, but something was different. He felt so much more detail. Even with a face full of Kelly's ass he could tell Layla wasn't wearing pants anymore. With renewed vigor he tried to buck the gazelle off his lap. He needed to escape before she'd tear off his pants too. For now she seemed content merely grinding on top of his dick. He had no say in the actions of his defiant member. Kelly seemed determined to ignore her spandex pants and just presses down on his head. The soft fabric stretches further, allowing the hero's head to pass slightly inbetween the hefty buttcheeks. \"He's enjoying his human life.\" Layla giggled. She felt his cock with every smooth gyration. Her pussy grew moist and began to drool a little bit of arousal onto the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Pint Puncher felt the sticky liquid seep through his spandex he went from afraid to full blown panic. Adrenaline was surging. If he didn't act soon, that perverted gazelle would try to fuck him. He'd rather take a thousand stompings from Quaker then letting that happen. Even Kelly's butt slowly sinking down on top of his head, encapsulating more of him in her rear, didn't seem to matter as much. Laughter filled the air as the gazelles took great pleasure in making the pinned hero feel powerless. They would have no mercy. Kelly peered at her sister with envy, seeing the unfettered joy radiate off her as she dragged her crotch over the spandex-covered dick. She felt it was high time for her to lose the pants. Layla meanwhile was thinking it was Pint Puncher's turn to go pants-less. Whose idea is put into action first?</span></div></div>",

The hero began tot thrash about in fear, hoping to the powers that be that he can escape before this gazelle could screw him. However, their massage effects were still in play. He was still as weak as a normal man in their grip, and could only cry as the two lowered his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his pants lower down to his knees, and his phallus on full mast, against the hero's will. The two gazelles chuckled as Layla hung her body over his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think he likes more? Some rump in his face? Or a nice massage downstairs?\" Kelly asked, rubbing her butt on him as she said her second question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One way to find out~\" Layla said as she aimed for his dick. Then, she lowered herself onto him, and the hero instantly felt hot and bothered. Her pussy felt downright euphoric around his groin, but he didn't want to submit to these two. To admit he was enjoying sex with them would be to give up. He kicked wildly, and tried to reach up to Layla's head. However, the gazelle shoved his legs down as she continued raising and lowering herself on the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe switched between a slow, sensual pace, and a quick rough pace. Each moment made the hero feel more and more willing to give up. But he refused to. Not that his determination mattered. Both villains held him in place, Kelly holding down his upper half and Layla holding down his lower half. Without his super strength, he could only lie down and take this punishment. And he felt something building up down stairs, like he was so close to release.</span></div></div>",

His mind was burning with inner conflict. On one side his rock-hard member was clearly enjoying itself in Layla's love tunnel. On the other hand, he hadn't agreed to any of this. Primal pleasure was at odds with utter disgust. The only saving grace in all of this was nobody would be able to see his shame. His face neatly and completely buried beneath Kelly's spandex-clad cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one fully enjoying it was Layla. The hero's rod was puny, though for a human it seemed pretty alright. This was far from the first victim she'd done this to. In spite of that, her pussy felt as ravenous as the first time. Arousal flowed freely and each time she plunged him into her was accompanied by a wet slap. The hero was powerless to stop her. She was in complete control. She would determine exactly how this would end. Cruel thoughts popped into her mind. Maybe she should stop pleasuring him now that his balls were about ready to burst. But blue-balling him wasn't nearly as satisfying as robbing him of the last bit of self-control he had. He was putting up an admirable effort, but she could feel it in her loins. She pressed down harder, grabbing hold of his sides tightly. Her fingers sunk into his body, squeezing him painfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith screams of pain and despair muffled by Kelly's butt his little sausage squirted. Layla moaned loudly at the feeling of his hot spunk launched into her. She loosened her grip and slowly gyrated around the pulsing member, milking it for everything it had. Completely lost in the rush, the Pint Puncher bucked, squirting every last drop into her. It felt glorious. Shame would wash over him again, but for now he was focused singlemindedly on cumming. When his balls were so empty it ached he slowed down. His flaccid rod slid unceremoniously out of Layla and flopped onto his belly, drenched in gazelle love. Ominous laughter rose from above. The heavy butt smothering his face lifted and Kelly walked away. He finally saw light again only to have Layla lean forward, resting her crossed arms on his chest. \"That was impressive for a little human.\" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you didn't think you would get away with pleasuring just one of us, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly then walked back up to him. His eyes widened a little as her glistening nethers hovered close to his head. Layla uncrossed her arms and put a heavy hand on either side of the hero's head. She hoisted her body forward, dragging her fuzzy buttcheeks up along his torso. She kept herself leaning forward, her pussy sliding along him and leaving a thin trail behind. Even when nearly onto his head, the gazelle kept her body at a skewed angle. Where Kelly sat straight for maximum weight, Layla was adamant to keep her pussy involved in the action. Its wet lips slipped over the hero's nose, instantly getting a tiny moan out of her. Powerful feminine musk invaded his nostrils. Worst of all was that with his strength taken away, even this was too much for him to lift. A heavy hand pushed down on his gut and Kelly swung a leg over the chair, straddling the hero. She looked down on his floppy member with pity and lust. How does she try to get him hard again?</span></div></div>",

The Pin Puncher heard her smack her rear, which gave him a horrible idea of what she meant. He never dealt this scared. At least with Carol he could move. With these two, he literally couldn't feel a muscle. He never got a chance to land a punch on them. His thoughts were interrupted when Layla laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, hub, maybe,\" she said.

She straddled the massage chair, putting her impressively sized butt right in the hero's face. To his great horror her tight spandex pants were missing. A small pucker surrounded by two beautifully rounded buttocks stared at him. A loud rumble preceded a dirty fart, blowing hot rancid air in his face. He wanted to fight, to struggle, but not a muscle obeyed his command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that stinker is just the warmup, let's get things going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly maneuvered herself backwards. There was no way she could fart on him like this, but a new stench filled the air. Just above his panicking face was a gazelle pussy, slowly dripping arousal. Without mercy the gazelle sat down, mashing her privates onto the hero's face. She rubbed back and forth, grinding her slimy folds on his head. The stink of her womanhood was vile in ways no words could describe. Pint Puncher burned with disgust and humiliation. When she leaned back forwards to choke him in her farts he nearly considered it an act of mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a great measure of practice she hovered her butt just over his nose, the pulsing pucker seeming eager to deliver it's foul and gassy punishment. Several tiny poots stung his nose with their abhorrent stink, but the big one had not hit yet. Only when Kelly moaned a little did the Pint Puncher close his eyes and accept what was about to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>PFFFRRRRTTHFFFTTT</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd experienced lengthier farts from notoriously gassy villains like Helen or Quaker, but the sheer stench this gazelle produced could strip paint. His nose was lit aflame by the sheer potency. Kelly showed no mercy and pushed out as many farts as she could. The unholy barrage went straight up his nose to wreak havoc. The hero began to cough, a feat that drew the curiosity of both gazelles. Even their powerful massage couldn't suppress that one. Kelly took it as a mark of price whilst Layla remained apprehensive about the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly gives him a reprieve from the torment. Whilst she gloats in her victory she notices something. Her farts had an extra effect she didn't often witness. The hero's spandex pants left no mistake that he was pitching a tent in there. Did she really just turn him on? Or do her farts have more powers than she knows? </span></div></div>",

They told him of a 20 foot tall giraffe named Gilda who had been terrorizing the area in similar fashion to Quaker, but with very different powers. The curvaceous giraffe had the ability to expand any single body part at will, and she used the power to squash and torment the human population completely unopposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he longed for a break and though battling Gilda sounded like anything but a vacation, the hero knew he had a duty to help. He accepted the assignment and flew off in search of the giraffe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take him long to find her. She was smashing a dozen people between her expanded ass cheeks. She saw the hero approaching and allowed her backside to release its victims as it returned to its normal size. The civilians fell hard to the floor and those who were able to tried to crawl away through the pain. As he landed before her, Pint Puncher observed that even without expansion, her ass and breasts were nothing to take lightly. She was far more slender than Quaker, but still possessed the size and strength to crush most people, even a super hero like him, without the help of her abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gilda!\" the Pint Puncher called up, \"Your reign of destruction and terror is over! Leave now and /i promise you won't be hurt or face any punishment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giraffe smirked. \"I was expecting the hero who defeated my friend Quaker, and I think I hear him, but I don't see anyone,\" she mocked from high above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero was not amused at Gilda's games. \"Take me seriously villain, or you will regret it!\" he called up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the giraffe looked down. \"Oh! There you are. I was expecting someone talking of punishment to be a bit larger than my toe,\" she laughed, wiggling her bare feet in the hero's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Puncher recoiled. Reasoning and talking was going nowhere, so it was time to take action. He flew up quickly, taking aim for her face. As he rose, his eyes widened as he saw Gilda's large breasts speeding towards him rapidly with a super powered uppercut!</span></div></div>",

That was a close call. He'd have to stay very aware and keep her guessing. The direct approach may not be the smartest choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready for my punishment Mr. Hero, do you want to come over here and spank me?\" Gilda mocked, turning and shaking her ass in his direction. She leapt into the air and expanded her round backside, sending it hurtling toward him. Again, the Pint Puncher dodged successfully. She was making it difficult to get close enough for his super strength to make a difference in this fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept his distance and flew in circles around the villain. Gilda stretched and strained to turn her long neck to keep her eyes on the hero, but his wide circles were making that difficult. With a frustrated sigh, Gilda drove her foot into the dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he crossed her field of vision and circled again, the Pint Puncher found himself colliding with a firm wall of flesh. He felt like a bug who hit a car windshield! Gilda had expanded her long neck, making it incredibly wide on both sides of her body. Even if he had been prepared for the move, there was no way the hero could avoid such a massive plane of flesh. The giraffe allowed her neck to return to normal and with a groan, the hero fell to the earth in a heap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wide smile, Gilda pressed her advantage. She got down onto all fours and positioned her firm chest directly above the wounded hero. He rolled onto his back but had no chance to resist her attack as she started pummeling the hero with shots from her expanding breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout having to lower her 20 foot form to ground level, Gilda was successfully pounding the hero into the dirt. Left, right, left, right. Each blow packed incredible power as Gilda created a breast shaped crater. Every few hits, her nipple would make contact with the hero's body, eliciting a moan from the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tired gasp, Gilda let her body collapse over the Pint Puncher's battered form, burying him in the crater she had created beneath her normal sized but full, round chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she catches her breath, she decides she isn't done having fun with the hero.

In her glee, she failed to realize her mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her large backside shifted over the hero, he realized that her weight was shifting as well. He continued to squirm weakly to lull Gilda into a false sense of security and waited until most of her wait was focused on the cheek that did not have him pinned to the earth. When he felt that moment, he capitalized. Pint Puncher drew in his crushed limbs as much as he could before releasing a super powered shove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilda's eyes shot wide open as she felt herself toppling over. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw the hero soar away from the crater she thought held him trapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" she seethed, pulling herself back to her feet. That act was not an easy task for the 20 foot tall giraffe, and the hero capitalized on her moment of vulnerability to deliver a massive uppercut squarely on her chin. The impact sent Gilda summersaulting backwards several feet. As she tried to shake the cobwebs out of her mind, the hero pressed his advantage. He attempted the same move that had knocked out Quaker, but with Gilda's long neck filling in for Quaker's trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the hero, this time he lacked the element of surprise. As she felt the hero wrap his body around her neck to prepare for the throw, Gilda responded in defense. She once again expanded her neck, causing it to budge out on all sides. It was immediately well too large for the hero to grip, and he was forced to drop the villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was the Pint Puncher's turn to be on the receiving end of a surprise attack. While he was still figuring out how he lost his grip on the now normal looking Gilda, she was on her feet and towered over the hovering hero. She lifted her foot and slammed it down on him with incredible force. The durable Puncher was dazed, but not beaten. He used his super strength to again shove Gilda off of him and soared into the air to ensure that her feet were no longer a threat. One less thing to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight was on!</span></div></div>",

Before he can stand to continue to fight, Gilda is on top of him, literally. She leaps into the air and crashes back down on his body with her still enlarged ass. The added weight and bulk made this slam significantly more impactful and the hero groaned beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilda smiles, but isn't content to remain seated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You continue to find ways to get up close with my ass Mr. Hero,\" she laughed from her perch. \"Despite being in such a hurry to get away from it last time.

She wasted no time, knowing exactly what the hero's super strength was capable of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew her hand around to her massive backside and plunged it deep between her cheeks.

She clenched them tightly together, compacting his world more than he would have thought possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile growing broader, she delivered one final butt slam and created yet another crater. The impact forcing the hero even closer to the villain's backdoor. He struggled, but after the beating and smothering Gilda had been putting him through, he felt his strength disappearing and his exits were sealed. Even if he managed to break free from her cheeks, he would still be pinned to the turf. He was just about out of options, but Gilda certainly wasn't. </span></div></div>",

She brought the Pint Puncher down between her thighs, hovering inches away from her large rear. Upon seeing this, the Pint Puncher immediately began squirming and struggling. But Felicia's grip held him firmly in place despite his flailing. In fact, the fox held him in place for a little bit just to feel his weak thrashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit, Felicia unceremoniously stuffed the hero between her cheeks, which stretched to lock the Pint Puncher in place, like a great big jail cell.

The fox's body began to wrap around itself, forming into a coil, Felicia's head at the upper end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet your expanding powers can't do this!\" she tainted. Then, her body sprang like a spring, causing Felicia to soar into the air. The Pint Puncher momentarily felt like he was free falling in Felicia's booty prison. When the fox got high enough, she restretched her body into the familiar giantess form, poised to sit on something. Then, gravity took effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia began falling, but first, back to where she sprang from. Gilda saw her coming, and stepped back, just in case. A loud \"BOOM\" echoed through the city as Felicia landed, a crater formed underneath her. The fox herself didn't appear to take any damage, save for abbot of concrete dust, but the Pint Puncher was practically plastered against the inside of her butt, like a tattoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia stood, reached between her cheeks, and yanked the writhing hero out. She dangled him before Gilda, while wearing a grin that was challenging Gilda to top that. Gilda snatched the hero up, and walked away from Felicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but they can,\" Gilda cooed out. Felicia tilted her head in confusion. Gilda whipped her hand upward, and threw it down, making the hero collide with the pavement. Once again, he was seeing stars, though they cleared up just in time for him to see several pounds of giraffe butt heading right for him. He screamed out in fear, and that was all he was able to do before Gilda sat on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just takes some careful timing,\" Gilda continued. The hero felt her squat down harder, like she was preparing something. Then, she hopped up, before landing bootyfirst on him. Only, upon landing, she had her rear vbqlloon up, causing her to leap a little higher in the air. She then came back down, balloooned at the right moment, and leapt higher. She repeated this until she matched Felicia's height. When she came down from that height, she made sure to increase her rump size a lot, so that when she crashed down, she struck Puncher with the force of a falling blimp. The crater she formed was just as deep as Felicia's. She stood, and giggled as she felt the force of her drop stick the Pint Puncher to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Not bad,\" Felicia remarked. \"Though, that's only the beginning.\" The Pint Puncher knew he had to escape.</span></div></div>",

He looked small enough by comparison to be used as a screaming dildo, but Shenny spotted the Pint Puncher, immediately turning her attention to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I have some fun without YOU ruining it EVERY. SINGLE. TIME?!\" She yelled, dropping the man with those last few words and raising her foot over him. Before she got the chance to stomp him, Pint Puncher flew under her feet and snatched him out of harm's way. He was covered from head to toe in Shenny's sticky secretions. The super hero felt guilty, knowing this man was in this state because he got knocked out. He'd make her pay for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"now COME HERE and PLEASURE ME LIKE A REAL MAN!\" Shenny shouted loudly. Pint Puncher was getting increasingly angry with the needy wolfess. He'd hold nothing back and punch her so hard the other villains will tell stories of it. She was going down! In the superhero's mind it was a done deal, forgetting that this was exactly how he got into trouble the last time. Riding this premature victory rush, the Puncher flew straight at Shenny. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

Shenny was far from the sharpest tool in the shed, but even she could anticipate his actions. With little effort she grabbed him mid-flight, drawing a loud surprised gasp from him. Her large hand overwhelmed Pint Puncher, who recognized quickly what had happened. He quietly hoped he wouldn't get thrown into a building again, but the malicious smirk on Shenny's face suggests something far more sinister. She had talk about pleasuring her, and he feared he knew exactly what that was going to mean for him. His suspicions were eased briefly as he wasn't lowered to her nethers just yet. Instead she held him up to eye level, staring at him with bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you w\u00e1nt me to catch you, or were you just making it easy out of pity? I DON'T NEED YOUR PITY!\" She roared whilst squeezing the little hero in her hand. Pint Puncher felt his whole body compress and twist, forming as her hand directed. It walked the line between painful and profoundly uncomfortable. As she calmed down again the overpowering pressure faded, but her grip was iron and he wasn't getting out anytime soon. Or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny opens her hand, revealing the wracked super hero in her palm. Pint Puncher sputtered and groaned, trying to shake off the massive squeezing he'd just endured. The wolfess didn't give him the time, as she leaned forward and dropped her big tongue on him. The squishy organ easily soaked the super hero in thick layers of saliva whilst she relished his taste. Having thoroughly tasted him and slathered him in drool, She closes her fist once again, trapping him in her large hand. Pint Puncher struggled, but his captor barely even noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the fun part...\" She said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cruel smile, Shenny...</span></div></div>",

He notices her moving her tail aside and expose her dripping cunt and winking tail hole. The Pint Puncher noticed what was going on and before he could get a chance to flee, she sits down hard on him, forcing him between her rump cheeks enough for his face to rub on her sweaty tail hole. The wolfess started to moan and fingers herself as she sits down more, working the hero further up into her rear. The wolfess seems to keep herself clean under her tail, but the smell was unbearable. It reeked like a sewer and the hero struggle as she keeps using him as a dildo. The hero sinks in halfway as she fingers herself harder, enjoying the hero pushing under her tail. Just before she keeps fingering herself, she lays on her side and places her fingers on his feet. The wolfess lets out a loud howl and jizzes just as she pushes the hero fully into her curvy butt. The wolf pants heavily, happy that she has a new toy for her rear. After a few moments, she feels a familiar pressure and leans over, letting out a deafening fart that pushed out both his outfit and cape. \"Hehe, guess all that fun made me gassy\" she chuckled as she gets up. She licks her paw clean and walks off to tear up more of the city happily as her butt's new tenant settles in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of the wolfess, the now nude hero shivers as she is forced up curl up in her bowels. Outside, he can hear her footsteps as she steps on cars and smashes into buildings. He whimpers as he occasionally hears a scream while he is helpless. Although the inside of her ass is a bit comfy, the smooth walls would squeeze him at times and occasionally, the wolfess lets a fart, whether it's a silent one or a loud one. To make things worse, the gas seems to build up around him, held in by the wolfess perhaps before letting one go to get comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero now has two choices, he could stick around in the wolf's rear and hopefully find an escape before it's too late, or wait till the giant wolfess gets distracted by something...all while trying not to get too comfortable from the thick fumes...</span></div></div>",

Before long his whole body was squished against the soft flesh, held firmly in place by a large, powerful hand. Any struggle was met with more pressure alongside delighted moaning. She slowly dragged Pint Puncher's body along her form, the coarse fur brushing along his face. He was forced to explore every part of her soft globes before Shenny began rubbing him across her belly. He could hear the soft churning and gurgling inside as he was pressed against the soft gut. The wolfess was in no way fat, but at this size her belly easily formed itself around the super hero being pressed into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter calmly rubbing her belly for a few minutes Shenny's smile grew wide and she dragged Pint Puncher lower still. His feet were the first to feel it. A sudden shift from the endless landscape of fur he'd endured so far. This part of her was smooth, and he knew exactly what time it was. With a complete lack of subtlety she shoved him downwards, rapidly transitioning for a gentle rub to grinding on top of the little man in her hand. She leant forward, pushing down hard on the little super hero with her sex. He was utterly pinned against her hand, which in turn was pinned beneath her crotch and the ground. She lifted up only to slowly rub him up and down the slickening surface of her pussy. In these moments Pint Puncher could hear her moan in unfettered bliss. She had him completely at her mercy, using him as little more then a toy. The only thing that relieved his shame at that moment was the idea that at least nobody saw him in this position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the cars near her hadn't moved, their occupants still trapped inside and watching their hero be humiliated. They could only see the odd glimpse of him as he was pressed between her large hand and equally large pussy. Slime coated his whole body and Shenny was only just getting started. The super hero desperately needed a break to regain his bearings. To his great surprise the wolfess overhead stopped rubbing him into her nethers for a moment. She had other plans in mind. As great as it felt to have the super hero at her mercy, Shenny would need something just a little... more... to really seal the deal.</span></div></div>",

But she caught herself in a curious dilemma. She could pick between sliding the bruised super hero into herself, but those cars full of trapped people were looking mighty inviting. Her frustration with her indecision grew until a malicious little idea sprung into her mind. The little hero in her hand was probably used to being shoved into every orifice she had. He'd almost begin to like it, given how frequently it happens. But those bystanders would be less prepared. They'd be much... squirmier. And to boot, Pint Puncher could watch. It was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small hero was pulled away from the wolfess' vagina, coated in pungent slime. He sputtered and coughed, his body was battered and bruised from her weight rubbing back and forth, bearing down on him. She dropped him behind the cars, smiling cruelly. Suddenly Pint Puncher heard a massive thud behind him. Shenny had sat down, encircling both the cars and the hero with her legs, smashing her feet together right next to him. He jumped away, only to fall over. His cap had snagged between her feet, leaving him stuck. He breathed heavily, recognizing the need to slow down before he'd get knocked out again. But there was no time, as he sat and witnessed the wolfess put her plan into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe effortlessly peeled open one of the cars and plucked a screaming human from it. With great care she moved it to her nethers, which seemed almost eager to receive a new guest. But she didn't rub this man along her womanhood. He'd probably not even last ten seconds before expiring. No, she carefully pinched his legs between her fingers and pushed them inside of herself. She shuddered at the sensation. Even such a puny little man could provide her great pleasure. Only now did she fully grasp the extend to which her pussy was h\u00fangry for humans. Almost without help it pulled the man in up to his waist, her lips proving large enough to hold him in place in spite of his erratic struggling. With a disturbing wet 'shluck' more of the man sunk into her. She panted with unabashed bliss and even began pulling the man back out a little to extend the sensation of devouring him with her womanhood. After a minute of playing with him her hunger won out. She groaned in exertion and pulled him in completely. Shenny sat back a little, feeling her little prey squirm inside of her. Her tongue was hanging out as she peered down at Pint Puncher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat on his knees, visibly defeated after witnessing this disturbing spectacle. The large wolfess' had sucked a man into her vagina and he was powerless to stop it. Now she was enjoying wringing the life out of him just for pleasure. And he had just sat there, too busted up to even try and stop her. But no more. He had bided his time, his super endurance recovering at a great pace. He calmly removed his cloak and walked towards her. Pint Puncher suddenly broke into a sprint and charged straight for the slavering lips of Shenny's pussy. </span></div></div>",

The huge wolfess gave him an unwitting helping hand with one of the most disgusting experiences in Pint Puncher's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother loud moan preceded her release and the superhero was approaching her slavering love tunnel. He readied himself to leap in when the lips parted and Shenny came in spectacular fashion. The charging hero was stopped dead in his tracks by a massive torrent of slime bursting out from her vagina. Amidst this brutal wave of release something heavy collided with him. It was the trapped man, flushed out with Shenny's climax. Both him and the superhero were knocked off their feet. They both laid in the thick pool of feminine release as the wolfess panted loudly. She was practically glowing with joy, happy to find such a powerful climax after squeezing the little toy she'd inserted. But she was insatiable. Her eyes fell on the sputtering superhero. It was high time he stopped being an outside observer and got a much closer look. The thought of a super-powered man struggling inside made her horny all over again and a large hand reached for the Pint Puncher.</span></div></div>",

A tight grip ensures her slippery prey does not get away as Shenny feels her primal hunger return. Squeezing an innocent little man was a good warmup, but she was ready for the main course. This hero had already proven resilient and he was going to need every ounce of that super endurance to satisfy a woman of her stature. The wolfess brought her victim down to her groin. She was still on her knees, her legs parted and her pussy on full display. It was dribbling steadily, probably some of her earlier climax but almost certainly aroused by its soon-to-be new prisoner. The nauseating stench grew worse by the second as the hero was brought closer to the fleshy cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if they could sense the morsel being held in front of them the netherlips parted, revealing a narrow passage quivering with anticipation. Her whole body seemed poised to consume the hero. The urge to insert him became overwhelming and the screaming Pint Puncher was introduced headfirst into her vagina. Shenny kept a firm hold of his body, only allowing her pussy to savour his head. All he could see anymore were the glistening dark pink walls surrounding him. Loud moans echoed overhead as the wolfess clamped down on her prize. Between clenches the trapped hero could feel something even worse. Her grip on his body was slowly lightening. She was getting ready to experience him inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith gentle pushing the hero's shoulders vanish into the slavering pussy, twitching with glee as it attempts to take hold of its meal. Shenny's hunger would be sated soon enough as she again marvels at her own body. The feeling of her womanhood dominating her opponents and pulling them inside of her was empowering. With the hero out of the way she could wreak havoc without pause. Nobody would dare oppose her as she picked the lucky few that got to risk their lives to satisfy her. Theirs would be the privilege of exploring her nethers and bringing her to climax or die trying. Maybe she could even break the Pint Puncher's spirit completely and keep him around as an obedient little toy for her to use at her leisure. If he was man enough to survive her depths, of course. Every thought of using him turned her on more, her pussy sucking in his body with every pulsing clench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasure surging through Shenny is incomparable. She goes cross-eyed, leaning back into a building and letting her body have its way with the hero. It seems to know exactly how to extract the maximum amount of fun out of him. The sucking and squelching coming from her nethers is music to her ears as the terrified people cowering in their cars watch the last of the hero's legs and feet disappear into her hungry snatch. The noxious stench of her musk paired with the overwhelming strength of her man-eating pussy is too much for him to handle. The heat and stuffy atmosphere inside make it impossible to focus on anything more than surviving this ordeal until the towering she-wolf reached her peak and spurted him out.</span></div></div>",

With powerful clenches she tormented her prisoner, ensuring he would know for the rest of his days who was strongest. The heat between her loins kept growing, her whole body yearning for release unlike anything she'd ever felt before. She reached down to rub herself and stimulate her pussy even more, but the pathetic hero just didn't seem to work hard enough in there. Her interest in him as a toy began to fade. What good is a Pint Puncher toy if he can't even bring her enough pleasure to release him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero felt his efforts weaken, the ongoing punishment from his surroundings was starting to overwhelm him. His mind was being numbed by the pain from her inner walls bearing down on him with all their strength. He ached from head to toe and the sweltering heat did not help one bit. He was utterly drenched in her juices, their horrid stench abusing his nose. Getting out of here was going to require a miracle. He could only hope to provide his tormentor with enough pleasure to release him. But even those disgusting ideas had to take a backseat to his aching muscles. Try as he might, he couldn't muster the strength to even squirm anymore. He wanted to kick and push, but his limbs simply refused to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny could feel her prey failing to elicit any further pleasure inside of her. She knew in her heart that keeping him around was just a waste of time. No man, not even the mighty Pint Puncher could be spared if they failed their one task. The heat between her legs spiked and with this final act the hero might just manage to bring her the sexual joy she sought. The Pint Puncher became increasingly numb to his surroundings. He could no longer even tell whether he was awake or not, drifting into a dreamlike state. The wolfess murred and moaned, feeling an orgasm for the ages form deep within her. It started as a spark at her very core, but as it thundered down to her nethers it built in ferocity like a stampede. She flinched and shook as the torrent of her climax gushed through her love tunnel and gushed out onto the road. It made her previous release look puny by comparison and her roar of pleasure was loud enough to shatter nearby windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContently she looked at the large pool of her juices, curious to see any signs of the superhero. Finally she found the confirmation of his fate and gladly shared it with the terrified humans around her. From the slimy little lake she carefully picked a white spandex suit. It was dripping with her arousal and completely devoid of any sign of its wearer. The Pint Puncher had met his match in her ravenous pussy. A fitting end for the little nuisance, she murmured. She took a few deep breaths, calming herself down after such a powerful climax, and looked at the humans huddled in their broken cars. Already she felt her insatiable hunger building once more in her nethers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's next?\"</span></div></div>",

It was awful in Barron's smelly rectum!  Warm, rancid farts dominated the tunnel, and the slick sweat from his crack still covered the poor plug, who tried to scream for help.  But with no mouth, how would he scream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEEESSSSS!\" the vile creature roared as the bane of his existence slid between his cheeks and sealed his anus.

He grins at the response. He grabs around Borris and molds him, the boar laughing while imagining what they're gonna do to the Pint Puncher. The Puncher can only look on in horror as Baron transforms Borris into a custom made flail. He resembles a long elastic string with a ball as large as Baron on either end. One is Borris' head, one is Borris' shorts covered rear, and everything in between is his extended chest and stomach.

Along with her abilities she shares with other animals, she earned the ability to \"change forms.\" She has limited forms, but she knows how to use them well. First is her feral form, the familiar feral turkey, that she uses to slip past her prey before springing her trap. Then, there's her amazon form, where she resembles a bbw, standing as tall as Borris and boasting hips the size of a car. She likes to use this form to punish her enemies, either using bad gas or using her weight. Then is her fly form, where her wings become even larger than usual and she's able to fly faster than before. She likes to use this form to close the gap between her and enemies and leave behind a trail of gas. Before each fight, she eats up lots of vegetables, making her emissions exceptionally foul. She likes to gas enemies into unconsciousness, cover them in tasty spices and sauces, and then swallow them up.</span></div></div>",

One person goes in, one's coming out in a body bag (according to promotional material). All of the patrons are shaking in their seats, waiting for the match of a life time. They wait, and wait, and wait...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere are they? That's the question on everybody's mind tonight. That question is replaced by \"What's that stench?\" when they catch wind of something. They realize the source of the stench as they see a herculean form approach the arena. He appears to be a lion, boasting ginormous muscles, black shorts showing of the full outline of his backside and his extremely noticeable bulge. He also bears a terrible stench that he can manipulate. It seems the main event's been replaced by the plan of Derek, the evil and stinky lion. He marches up to the arena and grabs a microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, wimps!\" The muscular lion begins. \"You're tiny wrestlers couldn't be here today! It's all me! Well, not ALL me. I've got a very special friend blocking of the exits to the arena. And they'll stay closed unless someone has the balls to face me!\" Nobody in the crowd was up to the challenge. Derek could turn coal into diamond with his biceps! None of them could possibly take him. He waits for a response. \"Nobody? Alright.\" He squats and starts pushing, much to the crowd's horror. Suddenly, a hole forms in the ceiling as a white clad form smashes through, kicking Derek in the face and sending him to the opposite turnbuckle. The Pint Puncher has come to save the captive crowd! He grabs the microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you're big and tough, Derek? I've benched creeps bigger than you,\" the young hero taunts. Derek snarls in response and stands at full height. The Pint Puncher tosses the microphone aside and gets ready to fight.</span></div></div>",

With every insertion it felt like she added just a little more mass to its intimidating girth. Amidst all of this torment only one question remained seared in the Puncher's mind: Why was he erect? He felt himself weaken, the large slimy body around him slowly sapping his energy away. But in spite of being very aware of this he was rock hard. Soon the questions fade and make way for a primal release. He shoots his load, grunting in hard-fought defeat. The slimy tendril that had pumped his cock all this time eagerly accepted his seed. The moment it received its prize Bessy nearly went insane. The cow had milked the man and the irony was not lost on her. But a small seed donation was just the first trial she had in mind for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPint Puncher's limited mobility inside of Bessy slowly worsened as the walls of his little bubble began to close in. The slimy sensation of the tight pocket changed as the walls themselves began to drip slime. It filled the slimy chamber with an unbearable stench. Fishy, warm and a little sweet. The superhero wasn't quite able to place it, but from the outside things were much clearer. The Slime Cow had gently pushed him further down her body, right up to her crotch. In this part of her body it only felt natural to introduce the Pint Puncher to her arousal. The foul smell restarted his pathetic struggles and terrorized his nose. Having putrefied what little air he had left Bessy shifts the hero back to her big, round belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in position the trapped superhero now has to deal with an old foe. Tendrils swirl all around him, twisting and turning his body whilst caressing every square centimeter of his exposed skin. This time they play a lot rougher though. The cow tongues now brush heavily against him. Their much greater size makes each lick feel a lot less friendly. Large tongues shove him around inside the tight pocket of air. Slowly the pocket dwindled in size as the sensation of large cow tongues licking him made Pint Puncher shiver in disgust. The tongues gradually grew longer too, eventually wrapping around him in a squeezing coil. Not much later the coil simply became one with the rest of Bessy's body, now pressing tightly against the Puncher from all sides. His air supply was gone and the constant resisting against her had drained his power. He either broke out now or faced the cow's slime entering his mouth.

If there was any source of hidden power inside of him, he would need it now. Bessy felt his movements slow down and slowly grew a smile. Today would be the day she would absorb the little pest that stood between her and her meals. Already his energy coursed through her. His stay in her body had robbed him of a considerable portion of his energy, something the Slime Cow would greedily use.

Where did this sudden jolt of vigor come from and what on earth was that feeling it gave her. The superhero span quickly in the air, shaking of any remaining drops of ooze and looking at his foe. She was still coping with his sudden escape, the hole in her slimy body quickly filling in. The cold wind blew all along him as he planned his next move.

She'd seen who made those footsteps and sent him on a collision course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek, the muscular lion saw her and knew what she had done. He took a fighting stance as best he could with his current handicap. His belly wasn't so much full as it was bulging out to an almost comical degree. It had made walking difficult, but he'd still be able to throw one hell of a punch. Then he got an even better idea. He held his arms wide open, grabbing Pint Puncher in a crushing bearhug. Though there were stronger villains around, Derek still had more then enough in him to pulverize the little man. He slowly wrenched the life out of him, working up quite the sweat. A nauseating stench began to emanate from him, further weakening Pint Puncher's grip on consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBessy just looked appreciatively at him, watching the little hero squirm and struggle. Derek needed no assistance, but she had one little devious idea she just couldn't resist. She flicked a small glob of herself towards the pair, landing on Derek's arm. He just smiled, seeing the little blob move towards the hero. It sat itself on Pint Puncher's mouth and nose, providing the final nail in his coffin. His body went limp and the lion tossed him aside. He had lost consciousness, allowing Derek to reveal why he had stuffed himself to bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my lovely.\" He said, walking towards Bessy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... you look tasty today.\" The Slime Cow giggled in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I always? But don't fret, I brought you something to still that hunger.\" Derek smiled and squatted down, grunting as he began to expel his stomach full of squirming captives out of his butt. One by one they squeezed through that narrow passage before unceremoniously falling on the floor. The people struggle to get up, slick with saliva and slime and disoriented from spending hours sloshing around in Derek's belly. Bessy's eyes widened with unabashed delight and she stretched her neck until her head could give Derek a nice smooch on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few stragglers began to stumble away from the duo and Bessy quickly got down to business. Her hands grew disproportionally large and she stretched her arms to reach out and grab them, pulling them towards her slimy body. With each victim writhing inside of her the Slime Cow grew a little and Derek had brought a good dozen if not more of them. She giggled, beginning to pull her new victims in via her mouth and pussy. There was no real need for it with her slimy body, but it felt great. Pint Puncher was out cold for this feast, and by the time Derek had finished pushing out his last prisoner he'd regained his usual muscular form. Slimy tentacles hastily wrapped around the man's limbs and pulled him into Bessy's slavering pussy. He joined the squirming mass inside of her as the Slime Cow settled down to digest her big meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPint Puncher finally regained his senses and shakily stood up. He saw the deranged spectacle that had taken place and knew he had to act quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you let the lady do her work or you'll be contendin with me, boy!\" Derek snarled.

As she gradually closed the distance between the two of them, his deep seated survival instincts were screaming at him to forgo his mission and flee. He tried to remain stoic in the face of this threat, his fists clenched and his eyes narrowed at the towering dragoness. Her body language, while certainly not docile, was poised and relaxed as she approached. Clearly, she did not regard the hero as a significant threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me your name, little one\" she instructed coldly as she came to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now that was but a few feet away from him, Pint Puncher was able to truly appreciate the majesty of this creature. The her flawless charcoal black scales shined in the glow of the torches and her gold slitted eyes pierced deep into his very soul. The only articles of clothing that on her were a chainmail loincloth and a chainmail bikini with gold trimmings. The normally chaste superhero found himself fighting to look away at her enormous breasts as the sturdy material struggled to contain them them. His gaze went down south to her taut, muscular stomach and down further to her thick, powerful thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are done admiring me, I would like for you introduce yourself\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher blinked and looked back up at the dragoness face, her deadpan and bored expression shifting to that of mild amusement as she peered down at him. He blushed in embarrassment before shaking his head. He couldn't allow himself to be awestruck of this creature. She posed a threat to all mankind and he was the only person able to stop her! Without another minute of hesitation he charged forward, rearing his fist back to deliver a superpowered punch. To his surprise, the dragoness did nothing to stave off the encroaching attack, her face remaining utterly disinterested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher's fist connected with her stomach with full force, the impact causing a small shock wave. He through every once of strength into that punch, which made it all the more horrifying when the blow didn't so much as make the dragon stagger. She raised a brow and rubbed her hand along her stomach curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive. It's been so long since anyone's been able to make me feel discomfort. You are far and away the most powerful creature I've encountered since my reawakening\" she said sincerely. Her praise didn't last long as she began to advance toward Puncher yet again, her face becoming cold and irritated. The hero remained stunned by the ineffectiveness of his attack, his body tensing and a lump appearing in his throat as the dragoness stood inches from away from. From where he stood, he couldn't even see the scowl on her face as her gargantuan breasts completely obscured his view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, I can't help but find your actions to be quite offensive. You waltz onto my island, don't even bother to introduce yourself and then have the gall to try and attack me unprovoked. Such disrespect will not be tolerated\" she spoke in firm, authoritative voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher was about to point out the hypocrisy of someone like her complaining about unprovoked attacks when he was suddenly sent flying back, pain exploding him every pore in his body and his the air getting forced from his lungs. The mighty dragoness had returned the favor by delivering a fierce punch to his chest. Had it not been for his super endurance, there was no questioning as to whether or not the hero could've even survived such a powerful blow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher coughed and wheezed as he laid on the ground, his head still reeling from the attack. He couldn't remember the last time he had been hit so hard. It took him a moment to collect himself, but when the pain finally subsided enough for him to focus, he looked up and let out a panicked squeak as she saw the powerful dragoness standing over him with her hands resting on her wide hips. It took but one blow for him to realize that the woman before him was nothing like the typical wrongdoers that plagued Glam City. Her strength was in a league all on it's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am feeling merciful today. Because you have impressed me with your strength, I will allow you to live. But,\" she paused as she lifted up her large, scaly foot and held it in front of his face. Pint Puncher grimaced at the thick, earthy stench that wafted from them. He could only imagine the layers of dirt and dust that had accumulated on them in the centuries she had been asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must pay service to me for the disrespect you've shown\" she continued as she waved her foot in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It didn't take a genius to grasp the meaning of her words. If he wanted to walk out of this situation alive, he would have to pay tribute to her musky foot. Puncher's nose curled at the very thought of it. Seeing his apprehension, the dragoness frowned and cleared her throat to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be keen on pushing your luck, little one. I had held back much of my strength in that punch as I wanted to be able to converse with you afterward. Had I actually meant to do you serious harm, we would not be speaking right now.

The times may change, but servitude still comes natural to the weak\" she said before walking back over to her throne. Without even looking back at him, she gestured for him to follow and the hero did so reluctantly. After what she had just subjected him to, he hand half a mind to attack her while her back was turned, but his better judgement ruled out. She reached her throne and turned to face him before sitting down and daintily crossing her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then. How's about we introduce ourselves like civilized folk, hmm?\" she asked with smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Fine, I guess. I'm the hero of Glam City, The Pint Puncher\" Puncher said thrusting his chest out proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Quite the interesting moniker\" the dragoness mused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Who are you and what do you want with my city?\" he asked bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over the countless centuries that I have walked this earth, I have adopted many names and titles. The Great One, The Destroyer, The Lord of All, and just to name a few. You, my adorable little whelp, my refer to me by my birth name: Oriana\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher rolled his eyes as she went down the list of her honorifics, though he had a hard time doubting their grandiosity given how strong she had proven herself to be. His attention was once again brought to her feet as she clenched and unclenched her toes repeatedly. He looked back at her face to find her staring intently at him. Her expression didn't seem to convey any hostility, though he felt unnerved at the way she looked at him. He had seen such an expression many times before, usually by his mother controlling foes. She was taking stock of him as though he were nothing more than a commodity for her to acquire and make use of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so, what brings you to Glam City?\" the hero asked with a nervous chuckle as he hoped to get her mind off of whatever plans she had brewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You speak as though I had chosen this particular piece of land to dominate. I've lived here long before your kind became the dominant species on the planet. While I slumbered in my bed chambers, your kind saw it fit to build your city above my resting place. Not that I hold that against you. You're not the first species to have shown such a callous disregard to your betters\" she said before holding her hand up in a silencing gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This topic bores me. I would like to know more about you, little whelp. You've proven yourself to be the one of the stronger creatures I've encountered in my many years on this earth. Tell me, are there others like you that match your power?\" she asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher opened his mouth to respond, though he was stopped as a thought came to mind. The only people in Glam City who were capable of matching his power consisted of more than half of his rouges gallery. He didn't know what use Oriana would have with such knowledge, but he didn't think that he'd feel at all comfortable letting this tyrant know about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm pretty much the only superpowered person out there\" he said in the most convincing tone he could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Oriana frowned as she eyed him thoroughly. She found his hesitation suspicious to say the least.</span></div></div>",

He half expected her to launch up from her throne and deliver yet another bone rattling blow to him as punishment, but instead she simply shrugged and leaned back into her seat with a bored look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it wouldn't matter either way. All strength pales in comparison to my own, regardless of the time period. Speaking of which...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She perked up and smiled slightly as she gestured for the Pint Puncher to come closer. He began to advance, but was stopped by her sudden icy glare. Somehow, without even uttering a single word of instruction, he knew what was expected of him. He moved without hesitation, dropping down to his knees before the fierce being before him. With that, her affable smile returned as she bent over and patted the top of his head in an oddly affectionate manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me more about the world as it is now. I imagine you must be a part of the dominant species, yes?\" she asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... guess so? It depends on what you mean. There are other creatures that are bigger, stronger, and faster than humans, but we're on top of the food chain\" the hero explained as he began to unconsciously lean into her a massive hand. As condescending as it was, it was pleasant in a way that he couldn't quite describe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Seems contradictory to me. How can you be the apex species if you aren't the strongest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By being the smartest species. As time went up we made tools for hunting and much much more\" the Pint Puncher boasted. He felt a small tinge of pride at the fascinated look on the dragoness' face as she listened to him talk about achievements of the human race. She listened in rapt attention as he went on to give her a brief rundown on the history of the world in how it related to humanity, occasionally cutting in with a follow-up question that pertained to what he was talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After roughly an hour of discussion, she rose to her feet and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much as changed since I have slept. The power dynamics have shifted considerably, with the feeble domineering over the strong. I can't help but find it troubling...\" she muttered as she stepped over the Pint Puncher and slowly walked over to the entrance of her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" the Pint Puncher asked concernedly. Somehow, it only just then dawned on him that feeding all powerful conqueror information on the outside world might've been a <i>bad</i> idea. It was as though a haze at been over his mind and once she was done speaking to him, it had cleared up and he was able to realize his folly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If what you say is true, than my strength is no longer sufficient in order to dominate others. These 'humans', they've thrived due to their cunning and ingenuity... that might just be the only thing that my might cannot overcome\" she said as she folded her arms, her wings flapping in what the Pint Puncher assumed to be a display of irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you even need to dominate others anyway?\" he asked as he stood to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is my role to do so, my precious little whelp. I do it not for my personal enjoyment...\" she paused as she looked away with a wide smirk. \"...although I <i>do</i> find it extremely satisfying...\" she snickered before turning her attention back forward, her face becoming serious again. \"I am a force of nature. I hold no ill will to the feeble creatures I conquer. I am not evil, I just <b><i>am</i></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what do you plan to do?\" the Pint Puncher asked as he clenched his fists. It didn't matter how powerful Oriana was, he refused to sit back and allow her to reek havoc on the world. The towering dragoness pursed her lips in thought before turning around to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The answer is quite clear, isn't it?\" she began with a chuckle. Her next words sent chills down the hero's spine as she spoke in a nonchalant manner:</span></div></div>",

At first glance she looks like a rat that has slight human features, but once she activates her ability she grows exponentially about ten times the size of The Pint Puncher her body becoming voluptuous her butt doubled in size each cheek bigger than he was, her bust is no small feat either being easily the largest set on the planet, and she barely contains these feature with a black bikini. Also being a rat Tiffany is rather smelly and gassy.

Finally she had him pinned, now to end this proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher groaned as the heavy pressure of the mouse's tongue dragged him along the ridges of the roof of her maw. Back and forth over and over again until his bruised body ached on all sides. When she lowered her tongue he tried to move, to do something to escape this torment. But at the first sign of movement it shot back up for another brutal grind. Only when he remained motionless, part out of fear and part because he was too worn out to move, did the mouse gradually shuffle him further back. Her belly awaited him and the superhero was out of tricks to escape this nightmare of a journey. The foul stench of Tiffany's maw would be the last thing he ever smelled. The huge anthro mouse tilted back her head, sliding the hero down to her waiting gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a single gulp the hero's entire body went down her throat. Tiffany tried not to wince at his vile taste, but she loved feeling his little body descend down to her belly. With the hero nicely stored in her belly, her attention turned back to the humans she was toying with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where were we...\" She said, pondering how to abuse her victims next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero tries in vain to fight against the narrow tube carrying him into the depths of Tiffany. With a loud squelch the esophagus opens up and he is deposited into a remarkably spacious stomach. He lands in a big puddle of warm goop, wiping away the worst of it quickly. Already he can see it work on breaking down his spandex outfit. He tries to raise his arms to punch his way out of this situation. A few solid hits should cause the gluttonous rodent to reconsider, but he'd underestimated how much the heavy grinding had done to him. His punches elicited no reaction at all from the mouse. Was he too weak or was this giant stomach simply too thick-walled from his blows to carry any impact? The hero might never know, trapped in a pit of warm goop and horrible stench. Not even the city sewers on a hot day could match the rancid air in Tiffany's belly. The superhero needed an exit, and fast.</span></div></div>",

Make sure you get all the hard to reach places down here!\" the rat said with a laugh. The Puncher recoiled at the smell coming off her enormous backside, and he was still being held several feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed his body against her bikini bottom and the stench was overwhelming. The Pint Puncher tried to hold his breath, but even then the odor seeped into his nostrils. Tiffany laughed as she felt his pathetic struggles within her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're having a hard time down there little guy, but you haven't even gotten to the source yet!\" she squealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she pulled back the waistband of her bikini bottom and dropped the hero in. He was too dazed from the smell to think to fly away until he was pressed up against her flesh by her bikini. The smell was awful, but this was not the hero's first time with foul smelling villains before, and he focused on collecting his thoughts and formulating a plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany laughed and pressed the Puncher shaped lump in her bikini, pressing him deeper against her flesh. She was about ready to end this, and she withdrew her hand. The hero knew he's have to act quickly or he'd become a permanent decoration on the inside of the rat's bottoms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the bikini was tight and form fitting, it was hardly enough to hold him. He swallowed hard and pulled himself close to Tiffany's foul smelling cheek and used it to propel himself off of it. He tore through the fabric of her bikini as if it was made of paper. He flew just out of range of her falling ass and the rat once again found herself landing on concrete with no humans to crush underneath her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood, the hole that the Pint Puncher's escape made grew into a large tear from top to bottom and Tiffany's prized bikini split! It fell off her body, leaving her completely bare from the waist down. The proud rodent growled at the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my favorite bikini you insect! You'll pay for that,\" she threatened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time for you to go back to the sewer you crawled out of,\" the confident hero retorted. </span></div></div>",

He just had to avoid being knocked out. Essentially, his real opponent was the clock! He had no idea how much time each round would last, but he knew he didn't have much time to worry about it. His focus had to be on keeping distance between him and his opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Melinda as his opponent, that task would be easier said than done. He was already facing off against two versions of the 10 foot tall, curvaceous rabbit, each one had a seductive smile on their face, imagining the torment they could put him through in his powerless state.

As he backed up, he found himself pressing his back into the original Melinda, who had quickly closed the gap of the ring. He looked up and saw her smirking down at him from between her large breasts. Her chest jiggled as she laughed at his surprised face. Melinda was enjoying herself as she toyed with her de-powered rival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the intimidation he felt looking up (way up) at Melinda's cruel face, he started to feel confident that he could make it through this round without passing out.

He flew up to get away from those vicious feet, but again he underestimated his opponent. Isabella jumped up high in the air, meeting the shocked superhero. She span forward, landing a devastating overhead kick. Her strong legs let her stick the landing with uncanny grace whilst her nemesis smacked into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you liked the taste of my feet, hero! Here they come again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was bad. The Pint Puncher was down on the floor, lying flat on his ass. He needed to get a hold of himself before that evil kangaroo got on top of him.

She has the power to absorb any living being she makes contact with into her large body.

She can remove them from her body if she is so inclined, and has enjoyed the ability to jump from partner to partner at a whim. She can also move her partner from one part of her body to another simply by making contact with herself (if her partner was absorbed into her hands, she can put her hand on her belly and transfer them there). Along with her ability, her flippers became much more useful hands and she sprouted long, muscular legs which push her far beyond her original 12 foot length.

The tapir's ultimate goal is the will. Once the physical representation of her target's will is located, her dream self will try to devour it, rendering the person will-less and completely at Juli's command. The stronger the will, the more she'll have to beat them down. Sometimes, her real self will begin to sexually assault her target to start to break down her opponent's will.

It was a perfect day for happy couples to take an afternoon stroll together, holding each other's hands and reminding each other of how happy they were together. It was picturesque. Everyone in the city was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, that is, except Susan. the enormous elephant seal lost her partner long ago. Days like this only served to remind her of just how lonely she was. She walked down the street alone, looking for someone to replace her long lost lover. Suddenly, her eyes fell on a man in his 20s exiting a flower shop with a large bouquet of roses. She approached him rapidly and plucked the flowers from his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, are these for me?\" she asked in a slightly mocking tone. \"You really shouldn't have. All I need from you is a great...big....hug,\" she said threateningly. Susan towered over the poor man, and before he could scramble away she gripped his arm and pulled him into a huge hug, smothering him against her large body. The man pushed against her and struggled to get away, but shrieked in fear as his hands and wrists disappeared into Susan's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at his terrified face with a broad smile and licked her lips seductively. \"Hello loverboy,\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a boy clad in all white appeared and grabbed the man's legs. He attempted to fly off in a daring rescue, but was slowed as his hands were still trapped within Susan's body. He used every ounce of super strength he had and finally the man's hands came free with a loud POP! The Pint Puncher flew the man to safety before returning to face the villainous seal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jealous are we?\" Susan cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time for you to march out of here Susan,\" the hero commanded, \"ALONE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seal just smiled. \"No one wants to be alone Punchy, not even you,\" she laughed. \"But don't worry, I have some prime real estate reserved just for you. You won't ever have to be lonely again!\" she said, caressing her ass with one hand and massaging a massive breast with the other. </span></div></div>",

The hero had gone through this dance with Susan before, and knew it was in his best interests to avoid rushing in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter little guy?\" Susan taunted, \"I guess I don't blame you for being a little awestruck,\" she said with a giggle. \"But I don't have the time to wait around for you with <i>sooooo</i> many eligible bachelors here. I can simply take. My. Pick.\" she threatened, her eyes moving about the city and her mouth displaying a cruel smile as she spotted a perfect target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Susan seemingly distracted, the Pint Puncher made his move. He couldn't stand by and let a defenseless citizen get caught up and trapped by her powers. He leapt to action and soared toward the massive seal. But Susan wasn't as distracted as she appeared. Her smile broadened and she was quick enough to trap the hero in an enormous bear (seal?) hug. She held him firmly against her huge body, her breasts engulfing him. Susan pressed her advantage before the Pint Puncher could break free and delivered a massive body slam, diving on top of the smaller hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, nice and close, just like we should be Punchy,\" she moaned in comfort as she let her full weight rest on top of the Pint Puncher. He squirmed and struggled beneath her, but knew oxygen depravation would get to him quickly if she didn't absorb him first. He pulled his arms and legs tight against his body and used them to push the seal off of him with his super strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she shot up into the air, the Puncher rolled to the side and took a moment to catch his breath. It was too long, apparently, as Susan had twisted her body mid-air and stretched her legs out in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe delivered an incredibly powerful hip drop squarely on top of him! Susan laughed as she stood to her feet and observed the battered hero lying bruised in the crater she had created in the street. She lifts him by the head and pulls him close to her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The super hero life has to be lonely Punchy,\" she whispered to him, \"Don't fight it. Give in to your desires. Give yourself to my beautiful, curvaceous body.\" she said seductively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N.....no......never,\" the hero gasped from his pain wrecked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan simply chuckles and pulls his head to her exposed crotch. \"I was going to place you somewhere a bit more comfortable Punchy, but if you won't go willingly I may as well make sure I enjoy this to the fullest extent!\" she laughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seal anthro moans as the Pint Puncher's head makes contact with her vaginal lips. She begins the absorption process. As his head sinks into her skin, her body tingles all over. The hero panics. If he doesn't escape now, he may never be free of this crazy woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gathers all the strength in his body and launches himself backwards into the air away from Susan. His head bursts free from her grasp and he lands several yards away exhausted. But Susan hasn't given up the chase yet.</span></div></div>",

She would have him yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that pleasure isn't your thing love,\" the seal teased as she slowly sauntered closer to the downed hero, a confident sway in her hips as she walked. \"Maybe you get off on pain? If that's the case, Susan can dish out plenty of that too.\" she says, her smile growing even broader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Puncher knows he's at a disadvantage here. He can't continue the fight and hope to come out victorious. He uses what reserve strength he has to try to fly away. He'll rest up and return to battle Susan and won't allow her the upper hand that time! Unfortunately, Susan was too close by that point to allow him to escape. She grasps his ankle as he takes off and slams him to the concrete! The battered hero is has little fight left in him, but Susan want's to make certain. The 15+ foot tall seal steps on his pain wrecked body and confidently walks all over him. She forcefully presses her foot over him with every step she takes and takes great care not to leave an inch of his body uncovered as she walks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe treads up his legs, plants a foot down hard on his crotch and grinds, forcing a groan of pain from the hero. She continues to walk as she stomps her foot down on his midsection and tramples his chest. Then, looking down on his face with two feet planted firmly on his chest, she bares her teeth in a terrifyingly happy grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we're going to be partners lover, I'm going to want to know just what you look like. No more hiding under that silly mask!\" she taunts. With a flourish, she rips the mask off of his face and bares his identify for all to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...not much to look at. I liked you better with the mask on,\" she laughs. \"Let's cover that mug up again.\" Without another word, she leaps forward and plants both feet firmly on his head, crushing him into the concrete. The hero is barely holding onto consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that she has trampled the fight out of him, Susan is ready to have him join her. But where does she decide to have him start?</span></div></div>",

It'll be just you and me together, in eternal bliss,\" she whispered seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't promise that you'll <i>always</i> enjoy it, but I'm positive that I will,\" she concluded with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher just groaned in place, unable to summon the strength to fight back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I promised you prime real estate, and that's exactly what you're going to get,\" Susan cooed, looking down at the hero from over her shoulder. \"I promise you'll get the grand tour eventually, but this will be your permanent residence,\" she said, gripping her massive, round ass with both hands. Her flesh seeped through her fingers as she gave her booty a strong squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think about it Punchy. You and my beautiful booty will be together for the rest of our lives. What more could you possibly want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped into a deep squat, her ass hovering just inches over the hero's unmasked face. He could feel the heat radiating off of her large backside and he tremored at how large and imposing it was. Having done battle with the likes of Helen and Borris, he had certainly smelled worse, but the odor Susan's rump gave off was a far cry from pleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breathe in my scent Punchy,\" Susan moaned, \"Learn to love it. You'll have full bearings of all 5 senses while your'e with me, so my scent will be a permanent feature of your new home my love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan completed her squat by planting her rump firmly on the Pint Puncher's chest, covering his entire body. She spread her thighs, revealing his face. His eyes revealed terror, while she had a sparkle of joy and anticipation from her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I feel on top of you Punchy?\" she asked, slowly shifting her weight across his body. \"Once we're together, you'll have the honor of supporting my weight every time I sit, anywhere I sit. I'm just giving you a small preview now, I promise what lies in your future will be much more...overwhelming,\" she said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood and the Pint Puncher gasped for air. His eyes were still trained directly on Susan's massive ass which hung ominously overhead. She gave her cheek a slap, sending her soft flesh jiggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that movement Punchy? When my ass moves, you'll move with it. You'll sway with me with every step I take, bounce with every bump, and jiggle when I jiggle. The only downside is that from where you'll be, you won't be able to <i>see</i> the beauty that is my ass. Just what's behind it. So take a good, long look hero. Because this will have to last you for quite. Some. Time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was enjoying the mental torment she was putting the Pint Puncher through, but was about ready to make him join her. She was confident that she had him beaten and that he wouldn't be able to put up a fight. But did she take too much time talking, giving him a chance to recover?</span></div></div>",

She looked down on her foe with eager anticipation glowing from her eyes. The moments before she took a victim were always her favorite, she wanted to savor his fear, the look in his eyes knowing that she had defeated him and that he would become a permanent resident of her incredible ass. She wanted to burn the memory of the look he had on his face in this moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally satisfied, Susan allowed herself to fall back. The Pint Puncher tried to scramble away at the last moment, but her descent was too rapid and he was too battered to summon the speed. She landed on his chest, crushing his lungs and forcing the air out of his body. He managed a pain filled groan, but he knew things would only get worse from here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero felt his body begin to get sucked into Susan's massive backside, straight through her skin. His brain forced pain wrecked body to respond out of sheer panic. He punched and clawed and pushed to try to gain separation. But it was too late. Susan's incredible weight made her an immovable object. Besides, the process had begun and he was already too deep to remove himself without his full energy.  Susan closed her eyes, enjoying the sensation of the celebrated hero getting pulled in and absorbed by her overwhelming body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the seal felt her ass make contact with the concrete street beneath her, giving her the signal that the hero's absorption was complete. She smiled and bounced in place happily. She was honest in her preview, the Pint Puncher couldn't believe what was going on. He had been sucked into Susan's ass and was completely unable to move, but still had use of all five senses. Though as he saw the street approaching, he wished he didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each bounce, the Pint Puncher felt the full impact of Susan's weight crashing down on top of him. He could see the street approaching each time, but he couldn't do as much as put a hand out to prevent it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it feel down there Punchy?\" Susan asked with a laugh, shaking her hips and grinding her ass along the concrete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero tried to respond, to scream, to beg....anything. But he found that he was voiceless. Susan simply laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't talk dear, but don't worry, I can hear each and every one of your thoughts. I know the pain you are enduring right now, all for me. <i>And I love it.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Susan</i>! The Pint Puncher cried out mentally. Let me out of here! <i>You can't keep me like this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seal just laughed. \"Of course I can darling. Like I said, this is the beginning of a beautiful life together.\"</span></div></div>",

Any onlooker who hadn't seen the brief battle would be beyond confused by her actions, but most of the people in town knew all too well what she was doing. The enormous elephant seal had successfully absorbed their hero, the Pint Puncher, into her incredibly large backside and she was basking in her victory. The citizens of the city winced at the thought of what their hero was going through, and what it meant for their likely future with an absence of their defender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher also knew, all too well, what Suzan was doing. True to her word, he felt every ounce of her weight as she sat confidently in the street. Although he had been absorbed into her body, it was as if he were lying just below a very thin layer of skin. He could feel her soft flesh pouring over his body in stark contrast to the hard concrete beneath him. With every shift and wiggle, his world was twisted. He could smell the odor that emanated from deep between her cheeks, but the foul scent was the least of his worries in the immediate moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, are you giving me the silent treatment Punchy?\" Susan laughed as she continued to grind her booty deeper into the street. \"I know just how to turn that frown upside down lover. If we're going to be together forever, which we are, we should at least have a proper date first. Don't you think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's laughter continued as she pushed herself to her feet. The hero let out a mental sigh of relief as he felt the pressure subside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Feeling better already. I knew that idea would perk you up!\" the seal said gleefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan strode confidently down the nearly empty street of the city, a destination already on her mind. Her hips swayed back and forth with every step she took, taking the Pint Puncher along for the ride with each swing. He felt the movement, but could do nothing to free himself as he saw the cityscape in Susan's rear view as she continued to march forward. He tried to move, to find some kind of a handhold to free himself, but he still couldn't quite wrap his mind around what he was experiencing. He felt every part of his body, his brain told him that he was all there, but his body wasn't responding to his commands. It was as if his eyes were glued to Susan's ass, and the only thing that he could see was what was directly behind the villain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Susan! </i>The hero screamed mentally, <i>this is insane! I can't live as a part of your ass. Let me go!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seal just laughed in response. \"And miss our first date as a couple? Not a chance lover,\" she said happily. She knew she held all the cards, all the control. She dictated what the Pint Puncher experienced. If she wanted her ass to be his world, that's exactly what his world would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seal finally reached her destination. A restaurant known for its romantic views of the city. Susan barged in and demanded the nicest table in the establishment, ignoring the long line and waiting list. The hostess knew better than to argue with a 15 foot anthro seal and escorted her to her table immediately. Susan noticed that the table was occupied. She licked her lips and prepared to sit anyway. The man who was occupying her seat wasted no time scurrying out of the way and vacating the space for the villain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher saw the fear in the man's eyes as the seal's ass descended toward him. He wished more than anything that he could swoop in and save him, but he was powerless. The man didn't even know the hero was there. Hearing the Puncher's thoughts, Susan paused before she sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't worry about him lover. He made the right decision. You know what they say, three's a crowd. This should just be you and me Punchy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any further words, the villainess plopped her ass on the seat, which instantly collapsed beneath her weight, sending her crashing to the floor. The hero felt both impacts fully and groaned in pain, which made Susan even happier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get comfy down there hero, I think I'll get a full three course meal. I'll be happy to share the leftovers with you later of course,\" she said giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan took her time eating and drinking. At her height, sitting on the floor didn't present a challenge as she was still easily able to reach the table. Every few minutes she shifted her weight over the hero's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not much of a dinner date Punchy. I know my body is breathtaking, but a lady expects at least a little conversation,\" Susan laughed with a mouthful of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let me out of here you psycho!</i> was the only response the seal received. Susan laughed and bounced lightly on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'd expect better manners out of a hero,\" she commanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finished with her meal, the villain casually exited the restaurant, ignoring the wait staff and hostess on her way out. She had what she wanted, she had no need for any of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's dinner without a movie?\" Susan asked happily, as she pushed her way into a nearby cinemas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A movie?</i> The Pint Puncher thought, <i>No, please. I can't!</i> he pleaded, not expecting a merciful response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can lover, it's my treat,\" she said with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susan walked into her chosen movie, every guest in the crowded room rushed out the other way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, how kind of them to give us some privacy!\" Susan said in mock happiness. She found a row of seats in the middle of the now empty theater and pushed the arm rests back. The seal held two seats down as she once again sat her big ass down in an empty chair. Fortunately for the hero, these chairs groaned but seemed to be able to support Susan's weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the movie began to play, the hero's world was complete darkness. All he could see was the black fabric of the chair Susan was sitting on. Once again, he felt her massive weight pressing down on him. He could hear the movie playing in the background and heard Susan's occasional laughter, but he wasn't enjoying it nearly as much as the villain seemed to be. To add insult to injury, with every laugh the seal's nude body jiggled and shook, including the flesh on her ass. This might have been the single worst movie experience he had ever had. As soon as that thought left his mind, he realized how much worse it could get as Susan let out a long, loud fart that echoed throughout the empty theater. Now the hero was concerned by the smell, as the stench was so intense he somehow gagged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie lasted three hours, and Susan decided to hop from theater to theater, enjoying several different shows back to back. Each showing gave her the opportunity to wiggle her large ass over her new partner. The movies were alright, but she was focused much more on the mental screams of anguish coming from the prisoner she held within the flesh of her ass. Susan smiled as she basked in her victory, knowing that the Pint Puncher had no way to escape her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finished with the movies, Susan exited the theater and groped her large ass with both hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you enjoy your first class seats Punchy. This is the start of a bootyful life together,\" she said laughing. Her smile grew broader as she enjoyed the hero's tormented screams, audible only to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer victory established, Susan left a life of crime. Well, for the most part. She still took what she wanted when she wanted it, but she had her prize. The hero in the white costume was never seen again after the battle with Susan, but Susan was a very visible part of the city. The residents of the town mostly tried to stay out of her way, not wanting to share the same fate as their former defender. While he spent most of his life within the seal's massive ass, she moved his consciousness to all different parts of her body. Every day was a new adventure for her as she constantly searched for new ways to make him beg for release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story of the Pint Puncher became a myth in town as the villains started to take over. They tended to stay clear of Susan, knowing full well that it was her that eliminated the only hero that had thwarted each of them time and time again. The story of the masked man with super strength who stood up for humanity was spoken in whispers, out of earshot of the anthro villains. All except for Susan, who seemed to grow happier every time his name was mentioned. </span></div></div>",

His legs were being sucked into Susan's flesh as if he were spaghetti and he was powerless to do anything about it.

He clawed at the concrete in desperation hoping to find something secure to hold on to, but it was reduced to rubble after the pounding Susan had given him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait....rubble.

It looks like you'd make a better doormat than a hero. It's a shame about your nice white uniform getting all dirty, but really, where you're going it's not going to matter,\" Susan said with a sneer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero groaned beneath her feet, his body too battered to respond beyond that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it you told me to do when we met? March out of town? Alone? That actually sounds like a good idea. Well, not that alone part, you're absolutely coming with me love,\" she said with a laugh before finally removing her feet from the Puncher's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry for a second though, you'll <i>love</i> life under my feet,\" she said ominously, brushing the hero's hair back with her toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Puncher's eyes widened. He slapped her foot away and shouted. \"Under your feet? What are you....mmmpgph!\" Susan cut off his objection by placing her large foot squarely in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right hero. You're going to spend the rest of your miserable life within the sole of my foot. You'll be able to taste every drop of sweat, feel every step I take shatter your body over and over again, and the glorious smell of my soles will be your world,\" she said with a sadistic smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't worry Punchy. If you're good, you might work your way up to some of that prime real estate I promised you earlier. But we'll have <i>plenty</i> of time for that later,\" she said with a laugh, planting her bare foot on the hero's chest. </span></div></div>",

Those weren't threats, they were promises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate to free himself but too battered and weak to use his super strength to push her off, he felt defeated.

He cringed at the taste of her sweaty foot in his mouth, but smiled knowing that it wouldn't be there long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villainous seal misinterpreted his smile and thought she had successfully broken the hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ooooh, do you like the sound of that Punchy?\" she cooed, shoving her foot deeper into his mouth. \"Does being beneath my big sweaty foot excite you?\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her laughter quickly turned into a howl of pain as the Pint Puncher bit down hard on her foot with his super powered jaws. He bit with enough force to crack a couple of the smaller bones in her large foot and send the seal toppling over. He used the reprieve to crawl away and create distance from his adversary.

She slowly tried to make her way to her feet again.

He looked towards the source, and sure enough, there was Paula, wearing her latex suit, one portion of it extended into a rubber-y tentacle. Said tentacle struck the ground, and then it pulled her forwards, pulling her to move just above the Pint Puncher, faster than he could react. With that, she stood right next to Susan, who seemed a bit upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you doing here?\" Susan asked. \"This is between me and the Pint Puncher! You can't lay a hand on him!\" However, Paula waved a hand dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, lover-girl, I'm not here for some twig of a boyfriend,\" Paula said. \"But, I happened to see an opportunity to get that brat out of my hair. So, I decided I wanted to help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Susan asked. The Pint Puncher himself was rather afraid, though he was worried about getting close. Then, Paula's latex suit shifted, shooting onto Susan's body. Rubber transfers off of Paula's body, her sleeves and leggings off and onto Susan. The seal was suddenly dawning a rubber-y bra and thong, Paula's very rubber upon her body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you gotta do is get juuuuust close enough,\" Paula said. \"Soon as I see that you're close enough, I can make that suit of yours lash out and grapple him, and pull him up close to your body. Then, you can do whatever you want with him.\" The Pint Puncher heard her plan, and didn't like it one bit. As long as the panther was in play, if he got close to Susan, he'd risked getting grappled by the rubber-y two-piece, getting pulled into a tight embrace, and then, if he couldn't escape the seal, a possible permanent residence upon her body. The Pint Puncher reasoned that facing Paula may be preferable, though she was no slouch either.</span></div></div>",

But she had never had the hero in such a vulnerable or defenseless position before. He could hardly squirm in resistance within the crater her ass had created.

Soon, he began to fear struggling would do nothing! The suit was very tight and perfectly held him in place! It'd take a miracle to RIP this in an hour, much less before Susan's wicked dance comes to an end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, her hips were going as fast as they could, furiously stroking the boy while he could do little more than futilely kick, slap, and headbutt her back. The seal was beginning to think she had him already! By now, a bit of absorption may as well just be a bit of the cherry on top!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you know you can't get out as much as I do,\" she started, causing the hero to grit his teeth. \"So, I've got a proposal for you~ You know my body can make you feel stuff even if you don't have a body in the physical world, right?\" That was true, those stuck to her body typically felt every squish and smelled every smell. \"Maybe, ai could give you this lovely feeling you feel right now~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the hero ceased his struggle, and Susan quit shaking, giving his throbbing cock a moment of reprieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can absorb you, and I can make it so that I always pleasure you~ When I walk, when I talk, whenever I'm just standing still, I can make sure you feel like my ass is giving you the time of your life~ And even better, with no body, you wouldn't feel any of the physical limitations your normal body can! I could squeeze and milk you as much as I want, and your body would never lose stamina, never feel the pain of too much stimulation, never feel like there's a limit to how much I can squeeze out of you. I could make your every moment with me heavenly~ And all you have to do... is thrust into me... Thrust until you fill me up~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher couldn't believe his ears!

He arrived at the town dump, and the wailing seemed to quiet down. That just means he'd have to search harder, they could be eaten after all! He tried to stay quiet and searched for the distressed citizen.

Unfortunately, the hero caught the interest of Julia. She snuck up behind him, but one step caught his interest. He turned around, just in time to see Julia point her nose towards the hero and exhale a purple fog. It quickly found its way into his lungs before he could fly away. Almost instantly, he fell asleep, the villainess scooping him up in her arms. She brought him over to a discarded mattress, laid him down on it, and began channeling purple energy towards her hands, a mischievous grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher was just walking around the city, except now he was dressed up like any ordinary citizen.

The purple energy then grew, and grew, and grew. Eventually, it formed into a tubby, 25 foot, bipedal tapir. The light dissipated, revealing a figure underneath. She was 25 feet tall, her hips were as wide as a city street, her lower half was a dark lavender, while her upper half was a lighter lavender, the separating line being a wavy line around her waist. Her most pronounced assets were her giant breasts and butt. She looked down at the hero hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, an entire buffet~\" the supersized Tapir cooed out. She aimed her nose towards the Pint Puncher, and began to sniff hard. She sniffed, and sniffed, and sniffed. She sniffed so hard, nearby scraps of discarded trash started to get sucked towards her. It wasn't long until the Pint Puncher started to get sucked towards her. The other citizens were quickly whipped off of their feet and sent barreling into her nose. She sniffed up almost the entire block of anything that wasn't nailed down, the Pint Puncher being the only thing resisting her strong pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia stopped sniffing for a bit, and smirked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you're gonna make ol' Julia work for her meal?\" she said.

The hero noticed the shadow and only had enough time to turn and see a dark magenta pair of buttocks aimed right at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher was suddenly smashed into the pavement, which formed a crater underneath Julia's massive girth. She gave her hips a quick wiggle to grind the hero into the cement. She chuckled as she got up and turned, seeing the hero flattened into the remnants of the road. She plucked him off of the ground, turned towards the original Julia with a mischevious grin, and the original nodded with understanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher was flung towards the original, who started to run towards him.

They chuckled as the rubbed against each other, grinding into the tiny hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey scooted away from each other, letting the hero flop onto the pavement, writhing with pain already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how?\" The Pint Puncher sputtered out.

He at first thought he was just walking through the city as normal, but the more he thought, the more he remembered searching through the dump, getting attacked by Julia, and falling asleep. He realized he was dreaming. Which means...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not real!\" the dream Pint Puncher shouted, both tapirs being taken aback. He pointed at the Julia copy, and it disappeared into a puff of purple smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, you found it out,\" Julia said, feigning disappointment. The Pint Puncher turned to the remaining Julia, and pointed at her, thinking that would get rid of her too. However, she remained in the dream. \"Being aware of the dream just means you're partially in control. As a practitioner of dream arts, I too have control of the dream. All you becoming aware of it has done was make it so I don't have 100% control. But I should be more than able to beat you down with a mere fraction of dream control!\" Julia shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo prove her point, she shot one of her arms towards the hero, as if her fists were attached to her arms by elastic. The Pint Puncher quickly dodged the attack, and watched as the fists returned to Julia. Julia's body glowed purple again, and she shifted into various forms. One was of a hippo. One was of a fox. One was of a skunk. Each shape maintained her coloration. And she then returned to her tapir form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see?\" Julia taunted. \"I'm still a goddess here!

He coughed as the foul wind passed by him, but the skunk wouldn't let her attack go away that easily. While he was coughing from the initial blast, she commanded the wind to come around and surround the fumes around the Pint Puncher's head, forcing him to smell the gas for an extended time.

The rest of her body followed suit and within seconds she had grown to match the 25 foot tapir in size. Pint Puncher felt understandably tiny now, high up in the air and surrounded by the pair of much larger women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them sucked in their gut and threw it forward, slamming the hero in between their rotund bellies. The impact was brief but vicious, stunning the superhero and making him lose altitude. In his fall he was grabbed by Clement, who quickly turned herself for a butt-first impact.

One thing just might though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, a pillar of light shined in the middle of town. Many citizens were unsure of what it was, but when a ton of villains coagulated around it, they began to run off. For some reason, the villains were focused on this light. Fortunately, a hero would show up to investigate the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher flew into the fray, and immediately stuff was weird. Normally when the hero was near the villains, they'd turn all their attention on him and try to devour him, dominate him, or otherwise humiliate him. Yet, now that he stood near them, they stayed focused on the light. The hero cautiously approached the light, and it screeched loudly. Lights shot out of the pillar and shot each of the villains. The villains then transformed into balls of light, which traveled into the pillar. Suddenly, out came a strange being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero saw a holographic projection of, what must've been, a female alien sitting on a hovering chair. She looked like she had the lower half of a squid and the upper half of a fox, except she was covered in scales. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be the champion of the world,\" she said. The hero glared her down, daring her to try something. \"I've eyed many planets to see their worth. And now, Earth has to prove itself. If the champion of Earth cannot overpower the challenges Earth itself is capable of, then there is no reason for it to exist.\" That got the hero to put up his dukes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'The challenges Earth itself is capable of,'? What do you mean?\" the Pint Puncher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can summon up the full potential of pair of beings,\" the projection said. \"I think 10 pairs should be enough to test you. If you defeat 10 pairs, I'll leave, and all of these challengers will go back to the way they were before I showed up. You lose to one, and we can do whatever we want to Earth.\" The lights the villains had formed left the pillar, and pairs of lights seemed to combine together. The Pint Puncher had no idea what was going on. \"Now, face the first fusion.\" One of the balls of light floated down in front of you, and transformed into a shape that was somehow familiar, yet very different.</span></div></div>",

His first thought was to wonder about the psychology of this fused villain. Both Debra and Quaker were urged on by hunger, but of two very different types. The hero wondered what would be the driving force behind Debker? Would it be Debra's insatiable appetite to devour, or would it be Quaker's sexual hunger and desire to feel dominant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he had an answer to that question, a more urgent one presented itself to him. How, exactly, should he go about battling Debker? He thought back to his fights against Debra and Quaker, they were always grueling and difficult. He had nearly been defeated by each several times, but a distinct theme rang true when he was successful. With the elephant, his first priority was always to remain airborne and to beware of attacks from below. With the turkey, his primary strategy was to keep the fight on the ground and to watch out for attacks from above when she used her flying form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Debker, neither of those options seemed like a particularly good strategy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was still taking stock of the situation and deciding how to proceed, Debker grew impatient. A willingness to wait was not a trait either villain had individually, so it made sense that Debker lacked that ability as well. She impatiently stomped her massive foot into the earthy pedestal she had created for herself before lifting off with enormous wings. As the hero followed her flight pattern, he felt a rumbling beneath him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe piece of sturdy turf he hovered above opened up into a deep cavern. An earthy column shot up out of the cavern and wrapped itself around the hero. He was able to break free easily, but as he did, more and more earth flew forth to trap and secure him. Before long, he found himself grounded adjacent to the cavern that was still billowing enough turf to bury him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fought against the unrelenting waves of dirt, concrete, and mud and continued to fight for freedom. He found himself nearing exhausting as there did not seem to be an end in sight. Then, just as suddenly as the columns had appeared, they fell flat over his body and hardening. As he looked around, he realized that the columns of earth had added a layer to the surrounding surface, just thick enough to match his body size as he laid on his back. He was entombed right at the surface of the ground and his body was held solidly stiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he worked to try to free himself for what he hoped was a final time, a dark shadow appeared above him. His eyes widened as he saw the massive elephant shaped ass of Debker falling out of the sky directly toward him! </span></div></div>",

The fused villain laughed loudly as she felt the flattened hero beneath her. She shifted her weight from side to side over his flattened body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled to herself as she felt the pathetic hero under her massive weight. \"I mean really, with an ass this large how could I miss?\" she thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she happily sat over the Pint Puncher, gears started to turn in her head. The possibilities that her new fusion presented were nearly endless. With a flap of her wings, she lifted herself off the hero and hovered over him, smiling as she simply observed his battered body, left nearly 2 dimensional after the impact of her massive ass from such an elevation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was just an appetizer dear. We're just getting warmed up with the possibilities,\" she said. The Pint Puncher tried to pull himself out of the crater Debker's ass had created, but before he could, he was peeled off the turf by what looked like an earthy hand. Debker didn't pay the hero any mind as she soared up to new heights, while she toyed with him using her powers of earth manipulation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand formed around him until it was a fist. The Pint Puncher struggled, but the villain's first drop had done too much damage to leave him with the strength to fight back. Inside the rocky fist, he felt what seemed like conveyer belts form on either side of him, pushing him toward the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked as he adjusted to the light as he reached the surface of the fist. He looked down and realized that he was still being held, up to his waist, by whatever earthy formation Debker had created. It wasn't done changing, as it had manipulated itself into a long....smooth....cylinder? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the Pint Puncher could think before a shadow once again returned overhead. He looked up to see the familiar sight of the Debra/Quaker fusion falling from an unfathomable height. This time though, instead of her ass storming down to crush him, Debker had her legs parted. He was greeted by her exposed pussy, which hit him with the force of a freight train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earthy formation that held him trapped forced him deep within Debker's crotch and he heard a loud moan of pleasure erupt from deep within her body. The rocky structure collapsed beneath her weight on impact, but it had served its purpose. She smiled as she clamped her legs closed over his body, sealing him deep within her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squirm little hero,\" she commanded.</span></div></div>",

Then, the light faded, and you were able to tell who the second was. The fusion sported black and white fur, the black forming stripes around the seal's curvy body.

Olivia and Susan were two of the Pint Puncher's most challenging foes, and now their powers were melded into one incredibly dangerous, likely very sex hungry, creature! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to disappear on you doll,\" Suvia's voice echoed through the street, giving the hero no idea where she was, \"But I just had to take these new powers out for a spin. Don't miss me too much though, soon we'll be united...forever,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No chance Suvia!\" the Pint Puncher shouted back defiantly, swinging a punch blindly in the direction he thought Suvia was mocking him from. Unfortunately, the punch just connected with air and the hero spun himself onto his backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuvia laughed at his pathetic display \"Oh yes Punchy, it'll be just the three of us, in one body!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the invisible villain launched herself in a belly flop at the hero, but he had fought Susan and Olivia both before, and her taunt gave her attack away.

He had been most successful against Susan with longer range attacks, weapons he could swing or throw. But with Olivia's powers, that was nearly impossible because he couldn't target her. His battles with Olivia were just the opposite, as he needed to wait in silence until a small noise or shift in the wind gave her position away, allowing him to swing with a powerful punch. That strategy would be a death knell with Susan's powers involved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a good strategy, the Pint Puncher did the only thing he could think of. He took off straight into the air. He needed separation so he could come up with a plan. Maybe Suvia would get frustrated and drop her invisibility. He just hoped that the villain hadn't recovered enough to interrupt his flight pattern, as she was tall enough to pluck him out of the air if she had.</span></div></div>",

As much as she loved to get this over and done with, there was a definite heat growing within herself that she demanded she tended to. Just as the Pint Puncher was getting his bearings back, he felt one of Suvia's feet pin down one of his things, a lot of weight holding him down. Then, he felt Suvia's other foot drag over close to his groin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt her toes slide onto his balls, then around his shaft, which was already beginning to harden at the feeling of her foot, a sensation that didn't go unnoticed by Suvia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that, hun~?\" she cooed out. The Pint Puncher felt too hot and bothered to argue. Instead, he tried to lean up to push her leg. However, with a push of her foot, the Pint Puncher felt pain run up his body as her foot weighed down on his balls. \"Don't you worry your wittle head, boy. Soon as you become a part of me, I'll see what I can do to play with you like this~\" After saying that, she began rubbing. Her foot ran up and down the Pint Puncher's length, making him harder and harder and causing him to pant. \"I could hurt you a lot. After all, the state of your body won't matter that much, once you're a part of me. You'll still be able to feel, but you can only leave with your body when I say.

They were beginning to get Squishy-big. Then, the light faded, and in its place stood a mighty horse wearing pure white spandex. The Pint Puncher couldn't guess who this could possibly be, until the fusion started acting. First, she flexed, showing off one of her powerful biceps. Then, she touched a building, and made it gummy, squishing it up in her grip. She also gave off this seductive aura, one the Pint Puncher would remember from a certain member of the Mare Storm. And the Pint Puncher could certainly smell a distinct, putrid smell from the new beast. Did... did she combine with all of her individual members?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, now this is power,\" she remarked. \"No one of our names could properly fit this form. Hey, 'hero,' can you think of something great I can call myself?\" The hero didn't even bother to answer her question. He flew straight towards the horse's head. Howeveer, she grabbed the hero midair and held him threateningly in front of her face. \"Hmmmmm... Bra-stink-squish... nah, those names aren't gonna fit my splendor at all. The Pint Puncher strained against her grip, trying his hardest to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about... Bridget,\" the fusion decided.</span></div></div>",

He had been able to match Brawny blow for blow in the past, but it was clear that this fusion possessed strength too great for him to contest. The powerful mare, now known as Bridget, only regarded his futile struggled with an amused smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really believe that you can win against me, don't you? That's just cute!\" she giggled in the most patronizing tone possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero gritted his teeth at her taunting and increased his struggles, though he quickly found himself getting weaker and weaker, his body beginning to yield and soften in her grip. His eyes widened in horror as he realized that she was using Gummy's power to turn his body into mush. He wanted to scream, but his voice was cut off by his face was mashing into his stomach as Bridget tightened her grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starting to get the picture now, little man?\" she asked as she released her grip on his body, opening her hand to reveal his flattened, putty like form. She hummed to herself as she placed her other hand on his body and stretched him out like a rubber band, wrapping his legs and head around her index fingers to keep him from secure. She then opened her mouth wide and slipped him in between her massive teeth, rubbing him back and forth and cleaning out any bits of food that might've been between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The experience was absolute hell Pint Puncher. Not only was the pain unbearable, but the hot breath of her cavernous maw didn't exactly smell like a flower field. He understood why she was doing this though. She was demonstrating her superiority over him, showing how little she regarded him as a threat. This wasn't a fight to her, so much as it was killing time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Letting out a content sigh, Bridget finally pulled him from out between her teeth and laid him back down in the palm of her hand. She didn't seem to revel in her power over the beaten hero as she patiently waited for him to reform. In her mind, defeating the hero was no longer an accomplishment; it was an inevitability. She was so much stronger than him that she could pretty much claim ownership of him and there would be nothing he could do to stop her. She placed a hand on her chin and looked up in thought, trying to think of more uses she could have for her new toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Seeing that her attention shift away, Pint Puncher focused on reforming his body and was soon back into his normal shape. The effects of her powers still resonated, so he couldn't fight her without ending up splattered against her body upon impact. If he could fly away and regroup, perhaps he could think of a way to defeat this new threat. Without a moment of hesitation he turned his back to her and took off into the air, thanking his lucky stars that he could still fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Bridget growled as she turned her attention back to the now fleeing hero. \"You little coward!\" she shouted as she took off after him, the fusion granting her even greater speed than before. Fear overtook Pint Puncher as he tried to speed up, dreading what she had in store for him upon catching him.</span></div></div>",

As it emanated, the Pint Puncher felt his struggles cease. Instead, this warm, funny feeling began to fill his body. Already Bridget could tell she was winning him over. She uncurled her fingers and held her palm parallel to the ground below, leaving the entranced hero sitting down on her palm. She shot him a sultry look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, won't you please get on your feet?\" she said softly. At her pseudo-command, the hero stood up on his feet. She barely started, but the poor hero was already weak in the knees. Bridget figured she could just blow on him and knock  him down. But first, she wanted to make this fun. \"Won't you please lose that suit?\" Deep down, the Pint Puncher was declaring \"no,\" but his hands began moving on their own. With his super strength, he ripped his outfit, and he was suddenly struck with the chill of the elements. Bridget brought her face closer and closer to the hero, her eyes focusing on his groin. Then, she puckered up her lips and smooched between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooh,\" the Pint Puncher moaned. His already weak knees were shaking more and more, excitement coursing through his body. But before she could raise his excitement anymore, she leaned her head away, and the warmth that her body emitted suddenly left. The Pint Puncher shivered at the return of the chill, and seemed to whimper at her sudden disappearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, bud, but I can't keep playing with you,\" Bridget said. \"Unless... unless you show me how much you love me.\" She held her hand close to her mouth. \"I want you to crank out a good one, right in here.\" Bridget opened her mouth and held out her tongue. Then, she closed it. \"I won't play with you until I feel your juices in my mouth~\" With that, she held open her mouth and stuck out her tongue, waiting for the hero to do as she wished. Unfortunately for the hero, he felt one of his hands reach between his legs. Then, he gripped, then, he began stroking. Bridget giggled as she watched him defile himself right now. She barely started and she was already dominating him. She could probably sit there and wait, and he'd succumb to her beautiful body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher, meanwhile, was screaming in his head. He couldn't believe he was letting himself fall for her. He didn't want to imagine what she'd do to him if he... finishes. But already he felt a deep stirring between his legs as he stroked. He felt his toes curl and his body bite his lip. He needed to fight!</span></div></div>",

The fusion of Mare Storm did more than just combine their powers. It enhanced them, making Lovey's seductive aura twice as effective. His subconscious was screaming at him to fight her charms, but we're soon silenced as his eyes locked into Bridget's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Those plush, soft, oh so very warm lips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Words couldn't describe how wonderful it felt when those lips made contact with his groin. It was a feeling so immensely pleasureable that the lovesick hero would do anything she requested in order to feel them again. But that wasn't the only thing that kept him from stopping. As he felt himself falling for her charms, he found himself more and more concerned with the idea of pleasing her. Her words rang in his head over and over again, the assertion that his love for her had yet to have been demonstrated. It seemed nothing short of disgraceful for him to disregard the words of someone so beautiful. To resist someone so absolutely stunning was a feed he didn't think he could life with himself for doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n His will continued to weaken as he furiously stroked himself, the sight of Bridget's gorgeous smile spurring him to double his efforts. It didn't take him long to reach his limit, his legs nearly giving in as he came to an explosive climax, his seed shooting out and painting her tongue in a white. Bridget had expected him to satisfy her request, but even she was taken aback by the volume of cum that his orgasm produced. She was pleased all the same as she pulled her tongue back into her mouth and swallowed, her eyes lighting up as she savored the taste. She had gotten the mighty Pint Puncher to humiliate himself, all because she told him to. If that didn't cement her power over him, nothing else would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n While she relished in his utter submission, he was laid out in her palm panting heavily with his eyes wide open. He couldn't believe what she had just gotten him to do. He felt sick, ashamed, angry-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Smoooch*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n His thought process was sent into disarray as Bridget gave his lower half a long, lingering kiss. The first type had been pleasurable on it's own, but after having just blown his load before his privates were feeling extra sensitive, making her second kiss even more wonderful. She didn't settle for only one as she brought her hand close to her face, peppering his body with kisses, though she tended to focus most of her attention to his groan.. By the time she was finished, she had brought him to another shuddering orgasm, his eyes nearly rolling in the back of his head as she pressed her lips into his groin and hummed softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Bridget soon pulled her hand back to admire her handiwork, a trail of saliva connecting her lips to his groin as her eyes trailed up and down his body. His body was sprawled out across his hand limply, his eyes glazed over and love dazed as drool trailed from the corner of his mouth. She giggled, both at his expression and the visual metaphor he provided. She literally had Puncher in the palm of her hand and it felt great. The only thing left for her to do was decide what to do with him. She could continue to use her radiant features to get him to further humiliate himself, or she could play with his puny body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her words managed to spark some clairity in his mind, his body was still too unsteady for him to capitalize on it. Bridget took notice to the anger in his eyes and smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth hurts doesn't it, <i>hero</i>? All that talk of being Glam City's greatest defender and all it took was a cute girl offering you kiss to make you all winded and weak-kneed. Don't get me wrong, I get it.

I would've never gave in to you otherwise...\" Pint Punch said coldy, his words coming out in between pants. His defiance was greeted with toothy grin by the titanic mare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Is that really what you think?\" she asked coyly as she stopped fiddling with his erection. \"I can't help but feel like I've been issued a challenge~\" she said before plucking him from her palm and holding him a few feet above her ample bosom. Using her free hand she pulled the front of her white outfit, giving Puncher a generous view of her cleavage. He tried to maintain a stoic expression, though his raging hardon was a dead giveaway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how long you hold out, <i>hero</i>\" she taunted before releasing him, letting the panicking hero to plummet into the hot, sweaty crevice below, everything becoming dark as he was fully submerged. The height of his descent created enough momentum to slip right in, aided by Bridget's saliva from her kisses. His attempts to climb out were futile as his hands couldn't grasp onto the slippery surfaces. He tried to push against his or prison to part her breasts far enough for him to try and fly out, but it did little alleviate his situation as his hands sank into the yielding walls of boob flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, that won't do!\" Bridget said before parting her breasts to retrieve him. Puncher flinched at the sight of her massive fingers, but could do nothing as they grabbed him by his head and pulled him up. For a moment, Puncher thought she had given up on whatever plans she had in store for him, but was disappointed when she left him stuck with only his head poking out from the top of her boobs. His head was stuck facing Bridget's face, forcing him to see her smug grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see your face when the fun starts\" she explained. Pint Puncher wasn't given time to think about her words before she grabbed onto both of her breasts and began to slowly rub them together. All Puncher could do was gasp and moan as his erect member rubbed along the warm, cushiony and sweat slicked surface of her breast. As pleasant as her kisses felt on his length, it paled in comparison to the full body boobjob he was receiving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Pint Puncher! I'm not even using my powers on you and you're already about to cream yourself!\" Bridget taunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher offered nothing in response. He knew that she was mocking him, but his mind was rattled by the heavenly massage he was being treated to. No amount of willpower could mask how wonderful it felt, her perfect tits dragging and squeezing his prick. The only sounds he could manage to get out were a chorus of gasps, moans and whimpers. Just when he was on the brink of his orgasm, the rubbing stopped. He blinked and looked up at Bridget who answered his desperate confusion with a knowing grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why do you look so upset? You said I'd never get you to cum without using my powers. My sexy body is no much for your heroic resolve~\" she cooked with a tone of mock innocence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Bridget... you--!\" His voice faltering as Bridget went back to rubbing her breasts together again, his words being choked back by a stuttering gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n For some time, this went on. Over and over again, she would rub her breasts together and suddenly stop when she sensed that was on the verge of his orgasm. What started as a heavenly experience soon became the most hellish form torture that Pint Puncher had ever experienced. If given the choice between spending a week lodged in between Helen's buttcrack and suffering Bridget's horrible teasing, he'd take the former without a moment of hesitation. Desperate tears streamed down his face as his loins ached with need. He looked up at Bridget's face with pleading eyes, but she only smoked back as she continued the torture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not looking so hot, Puncher. Is there was something you want to tell me?\" she asked with fake concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bridget... please...\" he whimpered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please what? Do you want me to do something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher almost felt like sobbing. It wasn't fair for him to be put in such a position. He was completely at her mercy and it seemed as though the only way he could end his suffering would be to beg her to let him cum. He didn't like the thought of it, as it would be him consceding to the point that she didn't need to hypnotise him in order to make him lust for her big, beautiful body. Aside from feeding her already massive ego, it would likely incentivise her to continue humiliating him sexually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After yet another round of teasing, the desperate hero... </span></div></div>",

To his despair, his pained confession only earned him a light chuckle from his tormentor.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"That didn't sound very sincere.

Clearly, I am no match for your iron will. I'll pull you out and mosy on over to the nearest police station--\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No!\" Puncher cried.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No? What do you mean, 'no'?

I always have! You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen! You're a goddess!\" he cried. Despite the overwhelming shame he felt at that moment, there was a small hint of genuineness in his voice as he poured his heart out. Even Bridget wasn't prepared for him to speak out with such passion and conviction, a small blush forming on her face as Pint Puncher gushed about her beauty. His apparent honesty was enough to spurn her to fiinish what she started as she reached her hands back up and gave her breasts a quick squeeze, ellicting a pleasured gasp from Puncher.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Did you really mean all that?\" she asked softly as she went back rubbing her breasts along his body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yeeeees...\" the hero groaned, his mental barriers shutting down as he gave himself to the immense pleasure he was feeling.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Who is it that you love?\" she asked as she quickened the pace of her rubbing, smiling as she could feel his swollen member dragging along the inside of her boob.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I love you...\" he moaned without the slightest bit of hesitation.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No. Say my name\" she demanded.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I love Bridget...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Louder!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I love Bridget...!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hm. Good\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n With that, she pressed her breasts together as hard as she could, forcing the air out of Pint Puncher's lungs as she squashed his puny body flat. I sudden pressure was more than he could take before reaching an explosive climax, his eyes rolling in the back of his head and mouth hanging open in a soundless scream. The sheer volume of his pent up seed was enough to push upward and spill from out the top of Bridget's cleavage, making jump in surpise. His orgasm lasted for some time and by the end of it, the hero was in a complete daze, his head hung back and his mouth agap and drooling.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Woopsie. Might've a little too far there...\" Bridget snickered as she reached down and plucked him from cleavage, raising a brow at the trail of cum that dripped his crotch to her boobs. \"I could've given the little fella a heart attack\" she said before turning her attention down to the mess he left. For one so small, he managed to paint almost half of her breast in pearly white spunk.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Dearest me, that won't do at all!\" she huffed before roughly dropping Pint Puncher to the ground.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n The sudden impact on the cold hard concrete managed to bring the dazed superhero back reality as pain shot through his back and neck. He sat up and groaned, the effects of his intense orgasm making him feel even weaker than before. It aid him in lifting the lust induced haze that had clouded his mind. He wasn't given much time to reflect on the weight of his confession before the sound of Bridget clearing her throat brought his gaze back upward, his eyes widening at what the sight that greeted him. She had stripped out of her outfit, her flawless form exposed in all it's magnificence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The fusion of the mare force not only combined their power, but it combined the team's best physical attributes to form a body so flawless that Puncher couldn't bring himself to tear his eyes away. Squishy's titanic derriere, Brawny's chiseled physic and Lovey's ample bosom and curvature. Suddenly his forced confession felt a bit less forced. Bridget stifled a giggle as she saw his cock immediately stand in full salute despite all he had endured up till then. She lowered her hand to the ground and without no instructions needed, Puncher crawled over and sat in the middle of her palm. He could feel his heart racing with excitement as he was brought back up to her bare breasts, hoping that she would give him another boobjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See this mess you made?\" she asked as brought him in close.

Just had to give him some motivation and a few well placed kisses, and the Pint Puncher was putty in her hand. She wouldn't be surprised if she could make him do something else just by promising a few kisses. Maybe she could make the promises more and more... intimate. She was sure that, before long, she'd be able to wipe out the hero's pesky resistance against her. What'll the town think when she's got their hero as her little pet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L'il guy~\" she cooed out in a sing song-y tone. \"You love me, don't you?\" At Bridget's question, the weakened hero nodded weakly, as if answering to her. \"You'll do anything for your love, right?\" Again, the hero nodded, and Bridget smirked. \"Good, cause I need someone big and strong like you to for me.\" She lowered her hand, and gently dropped the Pint Puncher onto the ground. Then, he got up to his feet, looking up at the mighty mare towering over her. One part of her regarded this angle of her more divine as he was given a glorious view of her bountiful breasts. Part of him cursed her with whatever bit he could muster. He knew he shouldn't be acting like this. He knew he should be fight back against her. And yet she kept up her powers. Things went from bad to worse when he watched her turn around, her giant butt facing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please hold me up for a while, will you?\" With that, her rear descended onto him, and he immediately went into action. He stretched out his arms, and suddenly filled both of his hands with rump flesh, the rest of his upper body getting covered up by a lot of her butt. He felt the curvatures of her cheeks wrap around his cheeks, on top of what felt like the weight of the world pressing down on top of him. He felt his legs quake, and they still felt weak. Even if he weren't suffering from orgasming twice, he'd struggle to hold her up. As he was now though, it felt like he'd fold under her at any moment. And Bridget must've known. \"Now, I don't want to feel that cold, unfeeling concrete while I'm sitting. So you better not let me down. Else, I'll have to punish you, love. Ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth halves of the hero knew he couldn't let Bridget down now. <i>If Lovey's powers were strong enough to make him degrade himself for her, who knew how powerful her Stinky powers would be now?</i> one half of the hero argued. <i>I can't disappoint Bridget again!</i> the other half argued. Either way, they agreed that they couldn't let her down on top of him. Even if he felt like he was seconds away from passing out. </span></div></div>",

Even if he had the necessary willpower to defy her, there was no way that he could best her in his current state. He was too worn out and she was far too powerful to oppose. That said, it wasn't his reason that kept him from dropping her but his deeply ingrained love for her. It seemed the weaker he became physically, the more vulnerable he was to her hypnotic seduction. Any thoughts of rebellion that entered in his mind were immediately quashed by the memory of her soft lips pressing against his tender groin. Even as his body was giving out and he was on his hand and knees, his linbs trembling beneath her great weight, all he could think about how important it was to keep Bridget nice and comfortable. Just when it felt as though his body would give out, Bridget let out a curt little laugh and stood up and stretched slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, little hero! I knew I could depend on you~\" she cooed in a condescending tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n On any other day, Pint Puncher would've responded to such disrespect with a witty retort, but his lust addled mind swooned at her praise as he looked up at her with a delighted smile. Bridget answered his smile with one of her own as she reached down and plucked his tired body from off the ground and held him up to her face. Her mind was brimming with ideas on all the ways she could play with her tiny little love slave. For the time being, she decided to reward his obidence.

Pint Puncher's eyes widened as he nodded his head excitedly. He was trembling with anticipation for another, though that wasn't the type of reward that Bridget had in mind. He watched with great intrigue as she removed the lower half of her tight outfit, exposing her titanic rear end. As expected, she had gained Squishy's finest attribute, the sheer size of her butt able to fit ten of him with plenty of room to spare. The familiar sight of sweat slink mare butt triggered also something within Pint Puncher; a memory of one of his battles with Mare Storm. He had managed to foil one of their plans, though as Squishy fell into unconciousness from the intense battle, she landed ass first onto him, his body immediately being swallowed by her meaty cheeks. There he would lay on agony, enduring a seemingly never ending barrage of farts as he waited for the the authorities to come and free him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sudden resurgence or that horrid memory caused him to snap out of his hypnosis ever so slightly as he began to squirm in her grasp, desperate to create some distance between him and her rump. Bridget chuckled at his sudden resistence as she lowered him down until he was mere inches from her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... no... not there...\" Puncher pleaded as he daggled from her fingers helplessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, hero. You're gonna like this. I promise\" she chuckled before unceremoniously shoved the weakened hero deep inside her buttcrack. Puncher cried out and did his best to hold his breath as he was hugged at all sides by two walls of soft, sweaty mare flesh. Being trapped in Squishy's butt was horrible, but it would be nothing compared to what he would endure should he take in a single breath. The fusion enhanced the potency of their powers, meaning Bridget's farts must have been even more lethal than Stinky's. All he could do was keep his hands and mouth closed as he was far too weak to even struggle. Bridget glanced back at her now covered butt, smirking as she somehow could sense that he was holding his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, don't be such a baby\" she chided as she wiggled her rumped back and forth. \"Just take a nice long breath! You'll be glad you did~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was little need to try and convince Pint Puncher as he exhaustion from holding her up began to set in. Try as he might, he couldn't hold his breath for longer than a few minutes and eventually he gave in, taking in a deep breath through his nose. The smell that greeted his nostrils was quite different than what he was expecting. A sweet arouma surrounded him at all sides, the scent being unlike anything he had experienced before. If anything, it was actually rather nice. He pressed his nose onto Bridget's skin and took a experiemental whiffs. The smell seemed seep from her very pores, enticing him to continue sniffing. The inital fear he felt had evaporated completely as and hugged onto the yielding wall of flesh, trying to take in as much of the delightful scent as he could. As he did so, her sweat began to coat his face, prompting him to lick his lips slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He quickly realized what he had just done and gagged, though he paused as the taste of her sweat hit his tongue. It was the sweetest thing his tastebuds had ever experience, the aftertaste reminding him of salted caramel. He hesitated before leaning his head in and licking more sweat off of her asscheeks. A pleasured groan escaped his lips, his mind falling right back into its lust addled state as he lavished her cheeks with licks, desperate to collect more of the intoxicating flavour. Bridget shivered as she felt his tiny little tongue inside her ass before glancing back down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you finally gave in. The fusion did more than make our powers stronger, you know. I can mix and match them my heart's content. Gummy's ability to alter body chemistry plus Lovey's charming powers makes for a very effective combination, don't you think? I can basically turn my sweat into a genuine love potion!\" she giggled as she clenched her buttcheeks together, squeezing Pint Puncher even deeper into her ass. Her words reverberated around him, though they all blurred together as he was focused on lapping up her sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Bridget could tell that she was being ignored and decided to... </span></div></div>",

It looks like a Blood Moon when Earth gets in perfect alignment with it. When the Earth is in alignment, malice radiates from the planet onto Earth, and reduces all of the animals into creatures more powerful and more violent monstrosities. The phenomenon only lasts one night out of many centuries, but the damage was always catastrophic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the next Blood Moon approached, the citizens were getting worried. If ordinary animals were made into violent machines, what would happen when a villain powered by the malice goes on the attack? They wouldn't dare let themselves be subjected to that, and quickly put together a bunker. Every citizen, except for the Pint Puncher, went in. Tonight was going to be cataclysmic, and it was the hero versus upgraded villains. He worried whether or not the bunker could possibly hold against their attacks. He also worried if he could handle them. He already had trouble fighting them normally, but this was going to be a completely different story. Could he stop them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Blood Moon rose, he couldn't keep asking questions. He heard a loud ruckus nearby, and flew towards it. There, he found...</span></div></div>",

But the Hungry Hog didn't quite seem to be himself. He wandered around on all fours like a feral boar, though a boar the size of a truck still. He snorted the air loudly and drew his attention to an abandoned food truck. Possessed with an almost unnatural speed he charged his 'prey'. The boar opened wide and bit down on the van full of delicious food. He didn't seem to care much about picking out the tasty parts. He chomped down on the whole thing, eating van and food alike. Pint Puncher was a little worried, seeing the boar in this state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stink coming off of him was slowly introducing itself to the superhero's nose. Even flying in the air at a good distance he could smell the villain. That did not bode well for the Pint Puncher. At first the thought occurred to him to just let this one rummage about. Sure, he'd take out some food trucks, but he wasn't going to hurt anyone. Then he saw Borris' trail of destruction. Shops broken into and small piles of scraps and drool that presumably were food trucks. The damage wasn't much, but the trail unmistakably led straight to the bunker all the citizens were hiding in. Whether he knew it or not, Borris was heading straight for them. The Pint Puncher let out a weary sigh and charged in. The faster he could dispatch of the boar, the better.</span></div></div>",

Borris crashed into a building, causing it to collapse. But the falling debris didn't even slow him. The hero landed and shook his head, the boar immediately charging toward him again. Pint Puncher felt a mix of pity and fear, seeing his nemesis reduced to such a base instinct. Again he flew up to dodge his opponent, but Borris was ready. He caught the hero completely off guard by leaping up in the air, pouncing towards the hero with outstretched arms. the Pint Puncher was in shock. He'd never bothered to fly very high and now the boar was on a collision course with him. Before he could fly any further two meaty hands grabbed hold of him and took him back down to earth. It was now that Borris had to think about his landing. Fortunately he'd just found a superhero-shaped cushion to absorb the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud boom echoed across the street as the boar landed again. He'd held the trapped superhero in front of him, letting his full body weight collide with him. The spandex-clad youngster screamed in pain, drawing a snorting laugh from the beast. Borris gladly added to the suffering by crushing the hero in his grip. The Pint Puncher was no stranger to being handled by the boar, but his strength was completely otherworldly. The unchained savagery brought to bear had amplified his already considerable strength. And Borris was about to make this a whole lot worse. He let go with one hand and raised his arm. His amazingly foul pits came into view. The boar's armpit was a festering hellhole steaming with sweat. The stench alone could knock out an elephant and the Pint Puncher was quickly introduced to the full horrors of Borris' pits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wet squish the hero was buried facefirst in the forest of the boar's armpit hair. It felt slimy, sodden with a mix of stale sweat and many generations of stink fermenting together in this damp torture chamber. Borris lowered his muscled arm, further encasing the hero's head amidst the eye-watering foulness. But where regular Borris would be happy to simply let him stew in there, this feral edition was hellbent on doing so much worse. The arm didn't merely pin him, but began to actively crush Pint Puncher's head. The other hand still holding on to the superhero's torso also put on a mighty squeeze. At this rate, the hero would be done for in mere moments.</span></div></div>",

His immense strength was taxed heavily as he began to spin the monstrous villain around. Squeals of rage turned to panic as Borris found himself unable to stop the hero. He tried a fart, but the Pint Puncher persevered and let slip the boar's tail. His aim was true and the squealing supervillain flew right towards the bank. The outer walls were nothing to him, simply shattering as the boar's flight continued. From inside the bank a distinct noise could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CLONK</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBullseye! The triumphant superhero quickly flew in to see if it had the intended effect. Through several large holes in the walls leading up to the vault he could see the boar. Borris wasn't moving. Upon closer inspection the hero saw that the vault door had barely a scratch. The supervillain on the other hand was out cold. An impact like that would probably leave him unconscious for the remainder of the Blood Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably for the best, because the sound of destruction filled the hero's ears. No respite for him on this day. No time to drag the boar somewhere outside of town either. He'll just have to leave him there as another villain had made their entrance. To make matters worse, he could see two distinct shapes peek out over the houses. One of them was the elephantine form of Quaker. She lived up to her name, each and every step sending a small tremor through the Earth. Her skin had a strange sheen to it and the Pint Puncher couldn't remember her steps being that heavy. When she opened her mouth for a villainous laugh, the Pint Puncher was able to see what had happened. His super sight spotted the inside of her mouth being made of stone! That was the weird sheen on her skin. Her mastery of earth combined with the Blood Moon had given her a body of living stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere he saw Rowland, who had gained a terrible new control over his horrifyingly stinky sweat. Not only had the Blood Moon made him even sweatier, he now seemed to be able to control it. Tendrils of discolored liquid sprouted from his shoulders, whipping around and destroying nearby houses. Both were looking for people to enact their cruel schemes upon but neither seemed too close to the bunker yet. Pint Puncher had to eliminate them before they found it.

She was able to step this up a notch?! His every muscle ached under the crushing rocks, how much more was his super endurance going to be able to manage. Slowly and terrifyingly he could feel the rocky skin shift and move. The faint glimmers of light that reached him grew dimmer. He was going in deeper between the cheeks. As he expected from the elephant the pressure built up further and further. What was a tremendous vice grip before now seemed like a gentle hug. With each powerful clench he felt himself compress further and further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few clenches later the hero's heart sank. He felt that familiar shape of a twitching ring. Even in stone he knew immediately he'd sunk deep enough to meet Quaker's puckered asshole. Its normal fleshy counterpart had swallowed him up on more then one occasion. Every time he'd fought himself free, either by punching his way out or waiting for the elephant to fall asleep. This stony incarnation may well be inescapable.

Behind him the pucker closed, poised not to release the Pint Puncher until the elephant had extracted every last drop of fun from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough rocky peristalsis the trapped hero was carried deeper into Quaker. She panted loudly. Was she really about to finally beat that damn hero? With him out of the picture, there's no limit to the evil she could do. Thoughts of victory empowered the elephant to leave nothing to chance. Buried deep within her mountain of a body, the hero was crushed, squashed and squeezed relentlessly. His futile wiggles were a wondrous feeling for the dominant elephant. With little time left on the Blood Moon she concentrated, pushing two boulders on either side of the Pint Puncher's head. With force she brought them together, finally putting enough pressure on him to make him faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the hero woke up the Blood Moon had passed.

He couldn't take too many of those. He needed to get proactive or he'd end up as a plaything for the stone elephant.

At first he thought it had been his knuckles, but then he saw the little fractures radiating out from his punch. He'd managed to shake up the huge stone body, at least a little.

There wasn't a hint of slime or arousal to be seen, but the hero could tell they were excited and ravenous for him. He squirmed from side to side, but the monstrous pussy didn't care. It landed on the superhero with a rumbling crunch, like a rockslide. Only the top of the Pint Puncher's head remained visibly beneath the elephant's mammoth crotch. It quivered, pulsed and shook with pleasure. In spite of its stony appearance, her nub was still sensitive as ever. The little boulder rolled itself over the superhero's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisgust turned to full blown panic when he felt his arms and legs, still trapped in the glob of dirt, rise up. The elephant wasn't getting up, which meant only one thing. He was going in! The rocky lips closed around his waist before opening again. With disturbing strength his body was pulled towards her love tunnel. Overhead the stone surface pressed him into the pavement with each crushing clench of her inner walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Quaker finally stood up the hero was buried up to his neck in her stone body. His head dangled out of her cavernous pussy, pleading for mercy. His pleas only furthered her monstrous sexual hunger for him. \"Save your breath, Puny Puncher. I want you screaming inside of me!\" The hero knew it was a long shot. The elephant was so absorbed in her lust she could only think to do one thing. In one fluent motion he was squeezed inside of her, the stone netherlips closing the door and sealing him in darkness. Pint Puncher had been around for too long for this to be his first close encounter with a big villainess. Nonetheless he felt panic set in. The stone walls churned and pulsed, crushing him periodically. He had no idea the elephant was still pushing him deeper, her stone anatomy basically forming an endless love tunnel towards the center of her body. In there she would bury the pesky hero once and for all. She even made sure to send down pockets of air so he wouldn't pass out too easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he unwittingly reached his destination the Pint Puncher tried screaming, but the thick layer of stone completely muted him. Instead the walls began to close in. Not for a pleasurable squeeze this time. They slowly constricted him, the crunching rocks forming a form-fitting cocoon around him. But even completely immobile he wasn't crushed enough for Quaker. She bore down on him with her whole body and began to squeeze. Pint Puncher felt the claustrophobic prison push in from all sides. His body compressed, pain welling up from everywhere. His head had it worst of all. It was stuck between two large boulders, slowly crushing it between them. This vice on his skull would rob him of his last scraps of consciousness. He fell still, but Quaker wasn't done. Only when she'd put a proverbial mountain on his back was her body finding the release she was after. She almost cried at the power of her orgasm, in spite of her stone body not producing a drop of cum. Pint Puncher was gone and she had the town to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">epilogue</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a pity she couldn't share her victory with the people she would now make her prey. Where were they all at? The elephant stomped the ground heavily to feel the vibrations of the earth. She felt something, but it was very faint. Better then nothing, the elephant shrugged and skipped her way there. Along the way she made sure to flatten as many cars as she could without breaking her stride. She arrived at a peculiar looking building. The doors looked heavy, but to the elephant they were almost small. She grabbed them and opened them with vigor to make a grand entrance. The doors flew out of their hinges and Quaker threw them behind herself. She leaned down to peek inside. People. People as far as the eye could see. She was filled with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuaker sat down in the entrance, spreading her legs and giving everyone a good view of her hungry snatch. From above her voice boomed. \"This pussy isn't moving until it has tasted a hundred volunteers. If you're good it might even release some of you. Your move, humans.\"</span></div></div>",

Not even a pebble is flung towards the Pint Puncher, who is beginning to get real curious about what's happening. The villain's eyes lose focus and roll back, her heavy stone body slowly toppling over. It looks like the repeated assault from the superhero had taken it's toll. He though about getting one more in for good measure but that didn't seem necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large elephant slammed into the pavement, her huge stone body leaving a sizeable crater. The impact had a devastating effect on her, shattering her girth into thousands of little boulders, collapsing into a heap. Pint Puncher looked pleased, seeing the elephant literally fall apart by his hand. \"She'll be fine.\" he sighed wearily. He doesn't know how, but Quaker will be back. Hopefully it'll be long after this horrible Blood Moon has gone. The crimson orb still hung ominously in the sky, empowering villains all over town. He flew up in the air to see where he was needed next. Two situations arose needing his immediate attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe highway was packed full of traffic. Most cars were abandoned, their owners having reached the safety of the shelter. But with his super-sight he could see a few people still huddled in their car. Approaching them was Shenny, the lusty amazonian wolfess. Her insatiable desires were amplified and her pussy now had the strength of a tornado, sucking in whole cars and compacting them for her pleasure. A steady stream of her arousal left a pungent trail along the highway, dotted with tiny balls of crushed metal. She still had some distance to cover before she'd reach any car with someone cowering inside, but she couldn't be ignored for too long. If they stayed in their cars the people risked being crushed inside of their cars. But if they made a run for it, she would almost certainly chase them down. A shudder ran down the hero's spine at the mere though of what she might do to those she catches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scream echoed from a different part of the city. The superhero turned his attention to it and spotted a man being held by his collar by a distinct bunny. Melinda was out hunting for stragglers, her clones searching all the houses around as she marched down the street. Finally it seems they had found someone she could play with. The clone held the man up and took him to the supervillain. Immediately the effect of the Blood Moon was visible. Where Melinda still looked like herself, the clones were each hulking with muscle. Splitting herself now created clones that are stronger instead of weaker. Only the main Melinda remained unaffected. Toned muscle covered every part of her clones and it was far from just cosmetic. They effortlessly bashed through doors and walls to look inside buildings. Cars and even trucks were flipped over effortlessly by the clones. The clone handed the squirming man over to Melinda, who cradled him like a child. Pint Puncher knew her disposition towards people. She was thinking about nothing but ways to make that man miserable. He had to interfere fast before she'd start tormenting an innocent civilian. Or worse, before her clones find another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher faced a difficult decision, who would he take on first?</span></div></div>",

Clearly the wolfess had priority for the superhero. He soared through the sky, quick to meet the empowered villain. She smelled the air, picking up that familiar pervasive scent. The towering wolfess smiled, knowing she had an audience. Sensually she spread her legs a little and grunted lowly. The cars on the highway shook a little until one of them was lifted into the air. The lustful wolfess had mastered her newfound vacuum powers already and quickly sucked the empty car to its destination. It hit her slavering pussy with a big splat. A few large fingers guided the hefty car as it was slipped into the gaping love tunnel. In mere seconds the huge wolfess had slipped the car completely inside, her netherlips relaxing and hiding it from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffled creaking and crunching could be heard coming from Shenny's crotch as the small drip of feminine juices steadily built up. She growled and grunted, seeming in complete control of the monstrous powerhouse between her legs. Not a minute had passed when she pushed the vehicle back out. The former SUV was an unrecognizable slime-soaked lump of compacted metal. With a heavy thud it slammed into the road below. A huge cruel smile spreads across her face. The Pint Puncher had just been observing the situation, thinking up a plan of attack. He thought the wolfess hadn't noticed him yet. Suddenly she turns her head and stares right at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive, isn't it?!\" She growled with a booming voice. \"I can't wait to feel what I can do to you! Now GET IN ME!\" The towering wolfess turned to face the hero and thrusts her pelvis forward. As best she could she aims her huge hungry snatch at the hero. The powerful vacuum residing inside began to take effect, pulling the hero towards her. Can he dodge out of the way or will Shenny have her way?</span></div></div>",

The gaping tunnel was able to handle cars, it had no problem at all with the thrashing little man. Shenny quickly showed her new prisoner who's boss. Her slimy love tunnel bore down on him, crushing the hero in an oppressively hot vice. How the tightly clenching wall could ever relax enough to fit an entire car was beyond him. His super endurance was put to the test as the wolfess began crushing and kneading her prey. Thick slime leaks in from all sides, lubricating what little movement he has inbetween devastating squeezes. Far above the wolfess moans lewdly. The squirming little hero inside of her feels even better than she had expected. His defiant wiggles brutally suppressed by her immense body. It was like a dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmpowered by the Blood Moon, the wolfess' pussy far eclipsed the hero in strength. He knew he shouldn't have tried to fly away now. Had he dodged to the side and used her own lumbering size against her, the Pint Puncher would not be trapped in her womanhood. He cursed his hindsight and stoically endured his punishment. Outside Shenny couldn't give less of a damn what the hero could and couldn't do for her. He was plenty useful just for venting her frustrations on. His super endurance would be put to the test. The insatiable pussy squeezed and released him so quickly that it almost felt like a mouth chewing on his body. To his horror he began to feel his body compress, crushed by the enormous wolfess. He'd been sat on by many villains, hippos and elephants among them. But never had the hero felt as much pressure as he did right now. Shenny's love tunnel seemed almost fanatical in it's urge to crush the little man. With no way to fight or flee, the hero could only hope his super endurance would see him through this trial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, the wolfess' insatiable nature gave her the upper hand. He was at his wit's end whilst Shenny was a little winded from all the arousing action between her legs. A big puddle of slime had formed beneath her, wetting her feet in her still warm release. The wolfess didn't care. Nothing around her mattered as long as she could feel the futile struggling of the hero in her pussy. It took nearly a full day, but finally the Pint Puncher's endurance had found its limit. His lights popped out under the obliterating pressure of her inner walls. Shenny only noticed hours later when she felt the squirming had stopped. Sadness over losing her living toy soon replaced itself with joy. No Pint Puncher meant no pesky heroes to oppose her. The huge wolfess jumped with joy, shattering the freeway beneath her feet and collapsing several buildings with the small earthquake she just caused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">--- epilogue ---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis called for a celebration. She tracked down that faint human smell and followed her van-sized nose towards the bunker. She spotted the unusually large doors of the bunker entrance and knelt down before them. A devious plan emerged in her mind. That entrance passage looked exactly big enough for this to work. The bunker's reinforced interior trembled as she dug away some of the dirt on the outside. With a feat of surprising flexibility she spread her legs and sat down. Her prominent snatch was positioned right in front of those imposing doors. Faced with the monstrous vagina the solid steel doors suddenly looked a lot more flimsy. Something the wolfess drove home even further when she pushed herself forward a bit. The steel warped and folded as the immense crotch slammed into it. Another thrust blew apart the lock and swung the warped doors open. The monstrous pussy incited mass panic among the huddled crowd. The netherlips parted and the tornado-strength vacuum began.</span></div></div>",

The tornado-like strength drew anything smaller than a car straight off the highway and into her hungering snatch. Shenny was completely unfazed by the assorted items being sucked in.

It snapped shut in an instant, trapping the hero inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately she knew what she wanted to do with her nemesis in her mouth. The large tongue rose up, smashing him against the roof of her maw. She pressed down hard, grinding him back and forth along the rigid surface. His taste on her tongue was weird. A hint of delectable little man but mostly stale spandex. With the hero roughed up a little she had time to decide what to do next. Her jaws parted a little and the wolfess spoke.

The serrated points of the carnivore poked him painfully in the back. His super endurance was about to be tested as the top row of pointed teeth came down. No tooth managed to pierce his skin but they sank into his stretchy body from both sides, pulling it out of shape in hilarious ways. The wolfess enjoyed abusing her size and power over the hero, knowing no other person in this city could stand against her with him out of the way. And here he was, completely at her mercy and being used as chewing gum of all things. She chomped down hard, making sure not to give him any chance of a miraculous getaway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher was drenched in saliva as the slavering maw pushed and contorted his body in weird shapes. Worse yet was the ripping. His suit wasn't blessed with the same inhuman endurance as his body. The teeth poked holes and little tears in it, leaving him more and more exposed. After a while the chewing grew less forceful and slowed down a little. Shenny was beginning to tire of her little piece of gum as it seems even superheroes lose their flavor after a minute. She felt almost no movement from her little victim. Her mission to weaken him was a success. A tasty success. Maybe her belly was a fitting end for the hero.

Puncher had teased her before and had the audacity to not follow through. One way or another, she would have the diminutive hero in her inside her. She looked around her environment and smiled as she spotted a downed radio antenna by her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile, Puncher was in his own personal hell. His ultra durable body had proved to be a curse rather than a bless as he found his gummy, mangled body lodged between Shenny's teeth. His strength was all but depleted and any attempts to move his limbs proved fruitless. From where he was resting he could only watch as her enormous maw opened up and a sharp metallic structure began to approach him. He groaned inwardly as it poked at his body, slowly working him out from his imprisonment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon enough he was free and out in the open, his contorted form hanging limply from the antenna that had been used to pick him out of Shenny's mouth. His giant tormentor giggled at the helplessness of her once formidable foe. Seeing him so weak and pathetic made her wet all over again. She reached down and gingerly plucked him from the antenna, placing him down between her legs and right in front of her cavernous pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You and me have some unfinished business, little fella\" she snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher trembled nervously and shut his eyes, mentally preparing himself for what was to come. To his surprise, Shenny refrained from shoving him inside. In fact, she refrained from doing anything. He weakly gazed up at her and was unnerved to see a wide grin on her face as she fondled one of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You got me all worked up and you're think I'm going to do all the work? I don't think so. I want you to pick yourself up and march right inside\" she said with a sinister grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher was at the loss for words. Surely she couldn't have been serious. There was no way that he would ever voluntarily do such a thing. Indignation seemed to be the response that Shenny was going for as she simply nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't get me wrong, I know you don't want to. You're more than welcome to refuse... but just so you know, the minute you do I'm not going to play so nice anymore. Maybe I'll stick you to the bottom of my foot while I go for a jog. Maybe I'll stretch you out and use you to floss my teeth and toes. Hell, maybe I'll just end it all and eat you\" she said in a matter of fact tone that made Puncher's hair stand on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Or,\" she continued with a wide smile. \"You can crawl up in there and we can both have some fun. And I promise you, it'll be just as enjoyable for you... so what's it gonna be?\" she said as she reached down and parted her lips invitingly, hitting Pint Puncher with the familiar smell of her womanhood. The truth of the matter was, he had no real pleasant options to choose from. He was in no condition to try and fight back, but the thought of playing along with her demented games was a hit to his pride that he didn't think he could live with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In the end, Puncher decided...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He shook his head, trying to gain some clarity. The Pint Puncher was having trouble thinking straight, his brain floating in the heady scent of Shenny's womanhood. She looked at his silly confused face with a big smirk. Could she really pull this off? Could she defeat the hero by just offering herself to him and letting him walk to his doom? Finally he snapped out of it. He looked at the gaping pussy in front of him and back to the wolfess. That tunnel was a one-way trip and they both knew it. With a disgusted frown he stepped back, still a bit shaky on his feet. For a moment she was disappointed, then the familiar anger overtook her once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Am I not good enough for you?! IS THAT IT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fuming wolfess felt a very strong temptation to unleash the gift from the Blood Moon and suck the hero into her snatch. In his weakened state he wouldn't be able to resist her at all. But now that he'd rebuffed her affections she felt overwhelmed by the urge to hurt him. No matter how long it took, no matter how much he'd squeal. Dozens of ways to make his life hell flashed before her, but the simplest of all floated to the top. With a malicious smirk she sat up a little. Since spreading her legs did little to entice the hero, she closed them quickly. The two walls of her thighs rapidly closed in on the hero. He tried to fly up, but he was much too slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy thump her legs met, squashing the Pint Puncher between them. He managed to fly up just enough for his head to pop out atop an ocean of flexing muscle. Merely slamming her legs together wasn't nearly enough punishment. Even though the hero cried out in pain, Shenny wanted more. She crossed her legs and bent her knees, her thighs putting ever more pressure on their prisoner. He felt himself compress and flatten in the brutal grip of her muscled legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the SPIRIT! SCREAM FOR ME!\" She howled, enjoying his torment to the fullest. He was given a disturbing reminder of this when the stink of her arousal pierced his nostrils again. Of course she was getting off on this. He didn't have much of a choice in the matter, the intense pain making him wail for mercy. But mercy was the last thing he could expect from the wolfess. She squeezed her legs together as tightly as possible, smiling cruelly at the little head begging her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher heard a distinct crack and feared not even his super endurance was enough to stop her from breaking his bones. But it was not his skeleton being crushed. The cracking came from below. The highway Shenny was sitting on couldn't handle the stress anymore and was beginning to break. Though she was aware of her seat's quickly fading stability, it still caught her off guard when it collapsed beneath her. \"oop!\" she squeaked as she fell down a little. Her big butt easily caught the impact of this short drop, but her legs loosened up around her hero, causing him to bounce out from between them and land on the road nearby. His wracked body was in no state to fight the overwhelming Shenny. He needed to hide himself in one of these houses. If he could stay hidden long enough he might recover his strength and stand a halfway decent chance against her. Whatever he wanted to do, he had to be fast. She was already looking around to find him and her evil mind had an impressive list of tortures ready for him.</span></div></div>",

He didn't quite have the energy needed to create some separation between him and Shenny, so he opted to try and hide amoung the larger pieces of debris that littered the landscape. The temperamental amazon huffed irritibly as her eyes scanned the area, looking for the slightest hint of movement that would alert her to his presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You may as well come on out and get it over with, little man. We both know that you're way too weak to fight me. At this point you're just wasting both our time\" she said in a matter-of-fact time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Puncher said nothing, though deep down he knew she wasn't wrong. Their had just begun and she had already managed to trounce him to the point where he could barely move. At that point it seemed as though her victory was a forgone conclusion, and his resistance was nothing more than a minor technicality she had to deal with. Still, the hero's pride and sense of duty kept him from giving in. If he didn't at least try to fight back, he wouldn't be able to live with himself. Undeterred by his lack of response, Shenny leaned back and began to gently stroke the entrance to her love tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come on, Pint Puncher. You don't have to be afraid of me. If you come on out all will be forgiven and we can have fun like I promised. I saw how you were looking at it, Puncher... I know you'd love to just jump right in~\" she cooed affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher shuddered at her advances and closed his eyes, praying that she would eventually come to the conclusion that he had scampered off somewhere to lick his wounds. Unfortunately, he had forgotten about Shenny's acute sense of smell, which let her know that he was still in her presence. The hormonal wolfess' face contorted in rage as she was once again hit with the sting of rejection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I said... come, <b><i>OUT!!!</i></b>\" she roared as she slammed her fists on the ground, causing the ground around Pint Puncher to break apart. Not wanting to get caught in the cascade of fall rubble, he jumped from out his hiding spot to higher ground. He didn't get very far before he was snatched out of thin air by Shenny, his body being crushed in her enormous hand as he was brought to her scowling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So NOW you come out!\" She snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher couldn't so much as wheeze out a response as he felt his lungs being compressed under her vice like grip. Still, he didn't need to say anything, as the expression on his face was a dead giveaway as to his true feelings at that moment: overwhelming fear and regret. The latter came from the shame he felt in getting caught so easily, though Shenny seemed to interpret it differently as her expression softened slightly and a smug grin spread onto her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"At least you're aware of how inconsiderate you've been. You're going to have to do a lot to make it up to me though. Sorry won't cut it\" she said with a chuckle, her playful mood returning once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With her victory secured and her prize won, Shenny thought back the list of tortures she had formed while searching for him. Would she act them out, or would see simply dispose of him and go on her merry way?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having witnessed his durability after demoting him to her chewing gum, the cruel villainess knew she could do as she pleased with the hero. The odds of him perishing a moment too soon seemed minimal. With this freedom in mind, the wolfess threw her victim onto the ground. The Pint Puncher bounced a little from the harsh impact and strained to look up at his tormentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now just hold nice and still, You can begin your apologies to my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had she said it before a large wolflike paw hovered menacingly over the hero. Small bits of dirt and debris rained onto his beaten form. He expected the violent impact of a stomp laced with all her anger. But instead the coarse surface set itself down on his body with an uncharacteristic gentleness. The light treatment was not to last and soon Shenny introduced her weight to the hero. The large paw smothered all but his feet, leaving them to wiggle in panic as she pressed down harder and harder. When she tried to balance on one leg the road beneath her cracked, shaking her off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe merciless squeezing reminded the hero of his time between her thighs. Only now one of the warm, fuzzy walls was replaced by the cold uncaring asphalt of the road. The rocky crunch of the road confused the superhero again, making him fear he'd cracked a rib or two. As painful as the torment was, at least it didn't last long. Shenny stumbled after the ground shifted a little under her weight. She looked down at her prey and knew she shouldn't linger on just using her feet. Hearing him wheeze and squeak as he slowly regained his normal shape made her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look a little de-feet-ed Punchy, not going to give up on me now, are you? ARE YOU?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sudden outburst scared the hero, but not nearly as much as her approaching hand. Large fingers wrapped around him and her tight grip squeezed the air right back out of his lungs. The wolfess held him close to her face before clenching her fist with all her might. The immense pressure rivaled that of the crushing he'd received mere moments ago. She was not holding anything back, ferocious in her determination to inflict as much pain as possible. Underfoot his screams were muffled, but in hand she kept his head neatly poking outside. The Pint Puncher wasn't entirely sure where he found the air to scream, but the pain made it hard to think straight. All he could do was hope she had her fun soon and maybe if he's really lucky the wolfess will just discard him. Shenny had no such plans for her toy. She brought him close to her heaving tits, hovering his face just inches away from the swollen nipples matching his head in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tongue. Out. NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearful obedience made the broken hero stick out his tongue without a moment's hesitation. He didn't get to question anything before he was brought into contact with her tit. With as little care as possible for the hero she rubbed him against her sensitive flesh. With a booming moan she pulled her toy away and returned to squeezing the life out of him with her clenched fist. Several times she repeated it, pressing the hero against her soft nipples and commanding him to lick them. After a few times she didn't even need to say anything. The Pint Puncher just went through the motions, blindly obeying her will lest she punish him even more. After a while it began to bother her. Her first solution was to simply tell him to man up and keep squirming fearfully. To her surprise the hero didn't respond, not even after she threatened to chew on him as a punishment. After a few vindictive chomps with almost no reaction outside of a weak yelp it was clear that his super endurance was reaching its breaking point. Shenny found herself pondering her options. Should she destroy the weakened hero with a glorious finisher? Or should she ease up and just toy with him a little, maybe let him recover for a few minutes so she can keep playing with him?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> On any other day, Shenny would've jumped at the opportunity to eliminate her most burdensome of foes. He had been a thorn in her side for as long as she could remember, constantly butting in whenever she tried to have fun. She would often fantasize about all the ways in which she would go about punishing him; all the ways in which she would use and abuse his puny body until he could take no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That said, this was not like any other day. She had vented most of her frustrations out on him and was much more levelheaded as a result. For the moment, her mind was no longer clouded by her emotions and as such, she began thinking about her end goal. Disposing of Pint Puncher would certainly bring her some pleasure, but how would she follow it up? She had a city's worth of toys to fool around with, but they wouldn't last nearly as long as him. Pint Puncher could be chewed up, trampled, stretched out and still be around for her to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her eyes lit up as an idea came to mind. What if she kept him as her permanent toy? Whenever she wasn't trouncing through town for kicks, she could still have him on standby to fulfill her every need. When terrorizing the city grew tedious, she could always return home and unwind with him worshiping her titanic body. He would obey her every command and the moment he stepped out of line, she'd introduce him to the bottom of her heel until he pleaded for her forgiveness. Her mouth watered at the thought of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny looked down at Pint Puncher and giggled as he was hunched up in a fetal position. His body had managed to reform itself in the time she had spent contemplating her next action, though he made no attempt to move. It made little difference, as he knew that there was no way he could escape. He was far too weak and she would simply punish him for trying. All he could hope to do was sit still and hope that Shenny would simply lose interest in him and end it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His hopes where soon crushed as his limp body was hoisted up with uncharacteristic tenderness as Shenny held him up to her face by the scruff of his neck. As she brought him close to her face, he took in a shut his eyes and prepared for the end. To his surprise, he felt something soft, moist and warm press against his stomach. He opened his eyes and was stunned to see that the hormonal wolfess had given him a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Feeling better now?\" she asked in a tone that hinted genuine concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher stared at her in stunned silence.  In all the times he had went toe to toe with her, he couldn't recall her acting in such a way. It didn't last though, as her eyes quickly darkened and her mouth curled into a light scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I asked you a question\" she growled irritably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-yes...! I... I feel better...\" Pint Puncher blurted out nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His response yielded an immediate response as her face brightened again. It was nothing short of chilling how quickly her mood could shift. Still, he considered himself lucky to even be alive at that point. Laying him down on the flat surface of her palm, she gave him a gentle, yet condescending pat on the head. He wanted to lash out at her for treating him in such a demeaning way, but couldn't quite find his voice. After the abuse he had just endured, her pats were downright pleasant by comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny smiled as she saw that complacency on his face. If she was going to make him into her permanent plaything, she would have to take the carrot and stick approach. Once she was done \"rewarding\" him, she began to bring him back down to the ground. Pint Puncher flinched as he thought that she was lowering him to privates and was relieved when he was placed by her foot. He watched as she leaned back slightly, her arms reclining on the remains of an apartment complex as she held her massive foot out to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Be a good boy and tend to my poor tired feet, will you?\" she asked in a sweet, demure tone that was unbecoming of one with such poor temperament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher was at a loss for words by her request as his eyes rested upon the her dirt caked soles. Much to his embarrassment, he could see the silhouette of where she had stomped on him, as there was one section of her foot cleaner than the rest in the shape of a human male. Surely she didn't seriously think that he would degrade himself in such a way, did she? After everything she had put him though, she had the gall to address him like he was nothing more than a simple servant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'If I could only get enough strength back for one good punch...' he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A pleasured sigh broke Pint Puncher's thoughts, bringing him back to the present. He looked up to see her looking down at him with a pleased smile. At first he wasn't sure what to make of it but he soon realized why she was smile. He looked in front of him and was horrified to find his hands kneeding into the soft soles of her foots. He couldn't recall himself moving forward, meaning he had simply acted out of some kind of instinct. As he stumbled back, a giggle came from his tormentor as she wagged a finger at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No no. I didn't tell you to stop. Get back back to work, little man\" she said in a playful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher swallowed nervously and looked back at her foot. All of his instincts where nagging at him to simply do as he was told. The happier Shenny was, the less likely he was to be punished again. Still, he didn't like the idea of giving into her demands, no matter how beaten he was. A tiny sliver of pride managed to endure the massive amounts of trauma he had endure and caused him to hesitate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny didn't seem the least bit perturbed by his subtle show of defiance, watch on with a wide grin. As far as she was concerned, one of two things were bound to happen: either he gives in to her orders and is rewarded for his obedience, or he refuses and gets thoroughly disciplined. It didn't matter the outcome because when it was all said and done, she would have fun either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What does the Pint Puncher do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pint Puncher tried to summon whatever bit of courage he has left in his beaten body and remain bold in the face of his tormentor's demands, but after the pain and humiliation she had put him through, he couldn't stomach any more abuse. He had come to fear Shenny's wrathful hand and the thought of intentionally disobeying her caused his mind to be flooded with the memories of her prior punishments. The only bit of resistance he showed came in the form of a reluctant sigh as he walked back up to her foot and went to work messaging its soft surface.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Shenny's eyes widened with delight as she watched her longtime nemesis throw away the last bit of dignity he had. In the many times they had clashed with one another, he proven himself to be a hero of unwavering courage and tenacity. Even when she had him against the ropes, he would remain defiant and through sheer gumption, would manage to squeak out a victory.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Yet here he was, slaving away at her feet with the threat of her displeasure looming over his head and keeping him in check. She had beaten that fear into his mind and now he was powerless to resist her. It was a lot for her to drink in at once and she could feel her womanhood growing more and more wet with this newfound development. The urge to stuff his pathetic body deep inside her began to resurface, but she managed to push it back for the time being. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"You're doing a really good job down there, little fella!\" She said in with a tone of genuine sincerity.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Puncher said nothing, though he felt a wave of relieve wash over him. He knew how unpredicable her mood swings could be, so he wasn't certain if obeying her would yield more positive results than it would if he remained stubborn.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Hmm. My feet are pretty dirty. They probably stink, don't they?\" She asked as she wiggled her massive toes causing the dirt and rubble in between them to rain down onto Puncher's head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Pint Puncher sighed and shook his head. The one aspect of Shenny's personality which proved most consistent was her constant need for validation. It wasn't hard for him to see that she was fishing for a compliment and the thought of playing along with her didn't appeal to him in the slightest. Still, he was well aware of what would happen if he didn't comply and he could already feel her angry gaze baring down on him. Just as she was about to lash out, he cleared his throat to speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"F-fine... they... they smell fine...\" he stammered softly as he kept he continued to kneed into the her sole. He kept his attention on the task at hand as he didn't want to debase himself any more than was necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was then that Shenny's foot lurched back and he was quickly seized by her enormous toes, squeezing him in between the big and second toe. Fear shot through him and he trembled in her grasp. Had he said something to displease her? Perhaps she took offense to him saying that her feet only smelled \"fine\". Whatever the reason, he closed his eyes and prepared himself for the punishment that was to come. Instead, he was greeted by the pleasant sensation of his body being caressed as Shenny gently rubbed her toes rub and down his battered form. He opened his eyes and was surprised to see her smiling down at him, a light blush showing through the fur on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's with the weird look? You made me feel good, so now I'm going to return the favor. Just relax...\" she cooed as she continued her thorough massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n To be in such a vulnerable and degrading position, Puncher knew that he should've felt discomfort and shame, yet he couldn't bring himself to feel contempt towards Shenny. The softness of her paw-like toes along with the warmth of her fur did wonders for his tired, beaten body. Granted, he could've done without the dirt and sweat being rubbed into his skin, but the skill in which she squeezed, rubbed and kneaded into his sore muscles was truly impressive and for a that brief moment, he was comfortable being where he was. The gentle rocking motion that her toes created began to slowly lull him to sleep and once again, his body acted on it own accord as he wrapped his arms around her big toe before leaning his cheek onto the plush fur and falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny in the meanwhile was ready to burst with excitement. She had managed to subdue the city's greatest hero with nothing more than her feet! What other villain could claim such a boast. The sight of him hugging onto her toe sent shivers up and down her spine. She had just not long ago trampled him beneath her foot, yet there he was cuddling up to it like it never happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She took care not to wake him as she gently plucked him out from between her foots and gingerly slid him into the valley of her cleavage. Standing up to her full height, she let out a tired yawn and stretched. She had all but lost interest in playing with the rest of the citizens and began the long trek out of the city and back to her home. Many residents had bore witness to the battle between her and Pint Puncher and though they weren't sure why she was suddenly leaving, they where more than happy to chalk down another victory for their brave hero. Little did they know, said hero was currently resting comfortably between the hormonal giant's massive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny's home was quite a long distance from the city, though it was a rather quick trip for someone of her current size. Unlike some of the other villains, she didn't have a roof over her head. After all, there was no structure that could contain her should she slip up and accidently grow in her sleep. Her home was a simple forest with a plateau in the center where she would perch on and look out at the city in the distance. She moved past the prominence and walked into a clearing that was large enough for her to comfortably sit down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she parted her breasts to look down at Puncher, she began to think about her next move. The image of him nestled between her toes and hugging her foot lingered in her mind. As much fun as it was to beat him into a messy pulp, there was a distinct pleasure she took in watching him willingly giving in to her whims. What she truly desired was a slave that put her happiness above all other things; a slave that would lovingly worship her no matter how cruel or abusive she felt like being. Her nether regions grew moist that the thought and she had to resist the temptation to plunge him in on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n No. That would come later. She wouldn't even need to shove him in. He'd march right inside her with a smile on his face, happy to please his mistress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon enough, Pint Puncher began to come to. The last few hours were a blur in his mind and when he woke up, he found himself...</span></div></div>",

Shenny didn't have what one could call a distinctive scent, but after he had been so intimately acquainted with her body, his nose was quick to distinguish that he was still with Shenny by the faint musky smell surrounding him. His first thought was to try and struggle for freedom but he lacked the necessary motivation. While his body had recovered quite a bit from the battle, his pride and self-esteem were still in the dumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The crippling reality that he had come to accept was that Shenny was far too strong to resist. What other conclusion could he come to after she had made a show of dominating and humiliating him to thoroughly? Even if he could somehow find a way to defeat her, there was no way that he could bring himself to face the public after having lost so decisively in view of the entire city. He was completely unaware of the gratitude and admiration that they felt as they believed that he had driven Shenny out of the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eventually two giant fingers parted his furry prison slightly and he was plucked up by the scruff of his neck and brought to Shenny's massive smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good morning~\" she giggled before kissing his chest and stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"M-morning? How long have I been out?\" Pint Puncher asked as he looked around at his new environment. They seemed to be in large forest clearing, though he wasn't sure how far they were from the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"About ten hours or so. I mean, you were knocked out <i>cold</i>. Who would've thought that my foot cold be such a talented masseuse, huh?\" She joked as she wiggled her toes playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher's face reddened in embarrassment as he averted his gaze from hers. It was bad enough that he had been subdued by her foot, but what really made him ashamed was how much he actually enjoyed it. As he thought back to that moment he tried to see it for the degrading indecency that it was, but all he could think about was how soft and warm her toes were. It wasn't right, he <i>knew</i> that it wasn't right, but for some reason his mind continued to paint it in a positive light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His attention soon shifted back up to Shenny's face and he felt uneasy when he saw that she was simply smiling down at him. By now she should have either eaten him or shove him up her pussy, but at the moment she seemed content to just stare at him. Her inaction somehow put him even more on edge and eventually, he felt compelled to ask her intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So... um... what happens now?\" He asked in a slow, cautious manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's for you to decide\" Shenny said with a snicker. Seeing the confusion on his face, she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Long story short, I wanted you be my slave. Then I thought it over a bit and I figured that I'd settle for you just being my boyfriend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher stared blankly at her, unsure of what to make of what he just heard. He had never taken Shenny to be the type to give any consideration to relationships as she had shown herself to be nothing more than a temperamental hedonist. This was something entirely new and he didn't know what being her boyfriend would entail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That said, I'm not going to force into it. There's a reason that I wanted so long to pull you out, you know. I wanted to make sure that you were fully rested and at a hundred percent before I gave you the offer. If you don't want to be my boyfriend, I'll go you a few minutes to prep yourself and we can slug it out like before. If you win, you can head on outta here\" she said as she gently lowered him onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The thought of fighting Shenny again sent a shiver down Pint Puncher's spine. Despite having defeated her numerous in the past, he had little confidence in himself after having been lost so badly last time. Shenny smirked as she saw the fear in his eyes and stretched her body out slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I mean, you could always try running away, but you'd be stumbling around in the dark trying to find the way back home. Plus, even if you did make it back, you know I'd be visiting eventually. It's not like I wouldn't be able to find you\" she explained as she let out a loud yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Right... so... what happens if I agree to be your boyfriend?\" Pint Puncher asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You belong to me. Period. Though I'll be much more giving than before. See this?\" She asked as she stood to her feet, featuring to her enormous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"All this is yours to enjoy~\" she cooed seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher cringed internally, though he had to admit that the last bit of her ultimatum was somewhat tempting. As much as he disliked Shenny, it was impossible to deny that her body was one that most women could only dream of possessing. As if reading his mind, Shenny knelt down in front of him and flashed him a lustful smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If you want, I can give you a sample of what to expect. Just pick the part of my body that you appreciate the most and we'll have some fun~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher thought about her offer found himself conflicted. He wanted nothing more than to be a hero, but that title didn't seem to fit him anymore. He had given into Shenny's demands without hesitation, licking her nipples and massaging her feet in fear of angering her. There was nothing heroic about capitulating to a villain, especially not in front of the people had sword to protect. He also didn't like the idea of giving someone like Shenny carte blanche to do as she pleased with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a moment of thought, he looked back up at Shenny and said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hero's conflict reached a boiling point. He'd given in to Shenny and done as she pleased, but was that not his duty as a hero? To protect innocent people from becoming her playthings? At least he could survive her attention, where she would not hesitate to snuff out however many civilians it would take to pleasure her. Sure, she'd beaten him once. But he's beaten her too and if what she says is true, ten hours have passed. It won't be long before the Blood Moon itself passes and with it her power boost. He was fully rested and ready for round two. The thought of submitting now was a tempting spark in the back of his head. That enormous, beautifully shaped body could be his to play with. No, it was not worth it. Not if it meant surrendering his freedom to her hormonal whims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's only one thing I love more that your body, Shenny! And that is beating you in the name of law and justice!\" He said, his voice spirited and powerful. But he had more than just spirit. The Pint Puncher had a plan. Before the wolfess could accept his challenge, he added a very tempting little clause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But let's not rush into things. You beat me fair and square, so I'll offer you a deal!\" The towering supervillain paused, intrigued by the hero's actions. What was that little runt going to propose? With a sultry smile she motioned for him to get to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get one day! One day in which I'll play with you and join you in whatever fantasies you have in mind. After that we go back to normal and we stand on opposing ends of the law once more!\" The superhero spoke confidently, trusting the wolfess' lust to cloud her judgment. Hopefully she wouldn't realize that a day from now her Blood Moon empowerment would be gone. It was his only chance to avoid a repeat of his previous smackdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny mumbled to herself, reeling with devious thoughts. The hero's offer was a curious one, but oh so very tempting. There were so many things she wanted to do to him. Most interesting was the idea that she could turn him to her side. A day full of all the pleasures her vast body could provide him with. When she was done, he would never want to leave her again. He would willingly throw himself at her feet and enter any orifice of her choosing. He would provide her hungering pussy with playtime and sustenance in ways only his nearly indestructible body could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the wolfess wasn't entirely convinced this wasn't all some elaborate setup. He was fully rested and ready to fight, why would he let her do this to him if he didn't want to be hers forever? Her doubts were hard to formulate inbetween all the arousing fantasies of using him for a day. As tempting as his offer was, she couldn't shake the feeling there was something fishy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Shenny accept the hero's offer?</span></div></div>",

She could feel her loins dripping with anticipation, her mouth curling into a lecherous grin as she reached down and picked Puncher up by the scruff of his neck. Pint Puncher remained stonefaced, though he felt a chill go down his spine at the hungry look in Shenny's eyes. Perhaps it wasn't such a good idea to make an appeal to her based desires... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got yourself a deal, loverboy. But just know this: by the time I'm done with you, you won't even remember whatever plan you've cooked up. I'm going to make you cum so hard that you'll only be able to get a stiffee when you think of me. You're going love my body; you're going to love <i>me</i>\" she said in a low, seductive tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher's confidence took a sudden hit at her words, his eyes wide as a nervous sweat trickled down his brow. He could see it in her eyes and in her smile, her words were no mere boast. She ignored his uneasy expression as she suddenly pulled him in for passionate kiss. Her plush lips wrapped around his head, a thick stran of saliva connecting her lips his cheek as she pulled back. She didn't settle for just one as she soon peppered his naked body with kisses, paying special attention to his exposed crotch as her lips lingered there for some time. Puncher wasn't sure of what to make of this passionate display at first, but the moment her lips made contact with his groin his uncertainty quickly dissipated, his body shivering from the sensation. His approval didn't go unnoticed as Shenny pulled her head back and slowly slid her massive tongue out of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... What are you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher's question died in his throat as she brought her tongue down on his groin, the warm, moist appendage trailing up along his member and causing his mind to go in complete disarray. No cogent thoughts could be formed in his head as she worked his shaft with expert precision. Her technique was far from gentle as she lapped his crotch like a car lapping up a puddle of cream, quickly bringing Pint Puncher to the first one what would be many orgasms. She groaned in delight as she sampled his seed, her mouth latching to the lower half of his body and sucking furiously, with little regard to his safety or comfort. Any pretense of self-control was tossed out the window, her eyes crossed and breathing heavy as she recieved a euphoric high off of the amount of control he had over him sexually. As she suckled and licked his privates, her hand snaked down to her crotch, her face becoming a deep shade of red as she played with herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n While she was tending to her personal needs, Pint Puncher was helpless against her brutal onslaught. He screamed and squirmed in her grasp, his mind racked with pleasure to the point where it almost crossed over to being painful. In less than five minutes, Shenny brought him to his climax ten times without a moment's rest. If he didn't know any better, he would be thought that this was secretly her plan to make his heart give out from exertion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The torment finally ended five more minutes later when Shenny finally reached her own climax. The large wolfess let out a low moan as she came, the vibration radiating around Puncher's beaten member and drawing out yet another orgasm from him. By the time she was finished, was completely sapped of energy, his eyes glazed as he hung limply from her mouth. With her head now clear, Shenny looked down at the hero with a sheepish grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a bit carried away there, didn't I?\" she asked after pulling him from out her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Mmph...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That was the only sound Puncher could make at form at that point. Even didn't even have the energy to meet her gaze as he struggled to catch his breath. Sensing his discomfort, Shenny lowered him down to her breasts and cradled his worn body, her eyes reflecting an uncharacteristic sympathy for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, little guy. I've ran you ragged and it hasn't even been a half hour. I promise, I'll try to reign it in from now on. It's not right for me to be the only one having fun...\" she said softly, her enormous finger caressing his back with tenderness unexpected from someone of her poor temperment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher was in no position to reply, his breathing still haggered and his eyes still glazed over. As his mind began to immerge from the sexual haze that it had been dragged into, the first cojent thought he had was in regards to how comfortable Shenny's breasts were. They soft yet firm, her body heat inviting him to bury his face into the yielding flesh. It was almost enough to put him to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, little man. You can't give out on me now\" Shenny chuckled as she pulled him back slightly. She grinned as she saw the obvious disappointment on his face, his eyes unashamedly leering at her bosom. \"We still have a whole day ahead of us. You've still got a whole body to explore~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She placed him down onto the ground gently, snickering as she struggled to stay on his feet. She let out an exaggerated yawn as she laid down with her body sprawled out and facing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what. I'll let you pick what we do next. Pick any part of my body you want to have fun with and I'll endulge whatever game you have in mind\" she offered placing a hand on her hip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The exhausted hero's eyes widened at her invitation, his eyes running up and down her flawless form as he ponder his options. After what had endured, his mind was still slightly frazzled and he could scarcely remembered why he doing this in the first place. All he could think about was Shenny and her gorgeous body, his plan pushed into the back of his mind for the time being. His eyes lingered on her boobs for some time, though occasionally they would shift over to her feet. Humilation aside, he could still remember how wonderful her massive toes felt as they massaged his body. Shenny followed his gaze downward and smirked as wiggled her toes slowly, as if to further entice him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eventually, Pint Puncher made his decision. </span></div></div>",

The wolfess giggled at his staggered gait and offered a helping hand. He didn't even fight it as she picked him up and stuffed him deep in her cleavage. It almost felt like the hero was afloat, fully surrounded by the large mounds of the supervillain. They rubbed against his battered body in all the right ways, offering him a welcome bit of relief after the sexual assault he'd endured. His movements slowed as the ocean of softness around him lulled him into a blissful rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you like them a lot aren't you... wait, are you... falling asleep?\" Shenny seemed surprised at first, but her temper began to flare up. \"I satisfy you like that and all you do is fall asleep?!\" She wanted to crush the thankless little bastard right there. Mash her boobs together to make him regret taking her for granted. If he survived, he'd be in the proverbial doghouse, tending her every need for the rest of the day! Thankfully her rational side won a rare victory. She felt the hero's resistance melt away as he seemed to greatly enjoy her softness. Rage made way for pride, as she beamed with joy at the comfort her boobs were bringing to her former nemesis. Only someone with a beautiful body like hers could accomplish that. She reluctantly acknowledges that sucking him off so much probably drained his batteries a little. Fine, he can have half an hour to rest in the depths of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero's nap was interrupted when the soft mounds holding him began to squeeze together. High above he heard a mumbling voice. \"Wakey wakey\" was about all he could hear. His eyes shot open wide. He had fallen asleep in Shenny's boobs. There was feigning to let your guard down to appease her and there was this. She was supposed to be the enemy. She spent last night crushing him into submission! He can't allow himself to be this relaxed around her. Blushing bright red he tried to crawl his way out of his plush containment. With some effort he popped his head out from her cleavage, being greeted by the wolfess' broad toothy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, you look so cute! I could just eat you up right now. Not that I'm going to, we still have much of me to explore. But rest assured we'll get to the internals in due time.\" Her voice was creepily seductive as she casually talked about eating him. It dawned on him seconds later she probably wasn't just referring to swallowing him with her mouth. It did little to stop the shudder running down his spine. She interrupted his cringing with a request. \"Wiggle in there for me, little guy. You feel good rubbing my boobs.\" Subtle squeezes notwithstanding this was the gentlest bit of playtime he'd endured so far. Playing along to extend it was a no-brainer for the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny moaned softly as the hero squirmed between her soft mounds. Occasionally she'd squish them together a little, pinning the little man between their soft mass. Then she'd relax, allowing him to rub the smooth surfaces once more. Throughout all of it she even began to work up a little sweat, making the hero's prison much more uncomfortable. Finally her boobs had received enough attention. She only needed one more thing to finish this. Her little toy had sank deep between her mounds again, but with her large fingers she deftly fished him up from his prison. He still looked a bit careworn, but surprisingly content, given his predicament. He was dangling by his leg, slowly being moved to her squishy boob once more. This time he slammed face-first into her nipple, the smooth surface tense with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it a lick.\" Shenny offered, hoping she didn't need to be forceful now. To both their surprise she felt the tiny, wet surface of his tongue against the sensitive nipple. It felt nothing short of heavenly for the towering wolfess. She quickly reclined and let go of the hero, draping him on the softness of her boob. The Pint Puncher kept on licking. The sweaty tinge of her boob was easy enough to deal with. The more he could keep her doing this sort of light stuff, the longer he could withstand her love. Knowing how much of these twenty-four hours he promised were still ahead, he needed every little bit of help he could get. Unfortunately, Shenny agreed with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just loving those boobs, aren't ya. Good, rest up while you can. Because the next stage is about to start and I can't wait to...\" Her sentence was cut short as a few drops of milk emerged from the sensitive nipple. The hero quickly lapped them up, causing the wolfess to moan loudly. She didn't even know she could lactate at this time, though given the puny amount it was probably just an accident. An accident that felt absolutely amazing. She quickly grabbed the hero and moved him back into her cleavage. With a big smile she announced he earned another thirty minutes of downtime. She kept caressing her soft mounds, occasionally squishing the hero between them a little. He had done a good job on her rack, but now it was time. She plucked the Pint Puncher from his warm prison and dangled him in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why you picked my boobs, little boyfriend. Now it's my turn, and I want to feel that exact same love and care on my...\"</span></div></div>",

He had feared that his restful respite would be a lead-in to a much more arduous task and was pleased to be placed in a position he was familiar with. Shenny blinked and tilted her curiously at his reaction. Given how badly she crushed him underfoot before, she expected him to break into a nervous sweat at the very thought of being near her colossal feet again. She decided to view his apathetic response as a step in the right direction as she flashed him a bright smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright boyfriend, get to work!\u201d she ordered, her voice taking on a more playful tone as lowered him down to the ground and between her feet. Puncher was instantly hit with a scent that made his nose crinkle slightly. The long trip to the forest had left the bottoms of Shenny\u2019s feet caked in dirt and mud, leaving a pungent earthy odor that seemed to surround him. Shenny noticed his displeased expression and pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Don\u2019t give me that look! It\u2019s not like I have shoes to wear on the walk to the city!\u201d she snapped as her face reddened in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her defensiveness managed to get an earnest chuckle from Pint Puncher, the first he had in quite some time. Even he had to admit, when she wasn\u2019t flying into a rage or destroying the city, her temper could be rather endearing. He soon turned his attention to the wall of flesh that stood before him and quickly went to work kneading into the soft pads of her paw-like feet. His efforts didn\u2019t go unnoticed as Shenny let out a moan that echoed throughout the open field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, that feels soooo good\u2026 you really know how to treat a lady, don't you~?\u201d she cooed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know me\u2026 I aim to please\u201d Puncher replied with an awkward smile. He wasn\u2019t too proud of where was at the moment but he knew it could\u2019ve been a lot worse. He had grown intimately acquainted with Shenny\u2019s sensitive paw pads and knew how best to please the moody wolfess. The fact that such knowledge even occupied space within his brain was somewhat bothersome though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 don\u2019t be afraid to that tongue of yours, little guy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher swallowed nervously, though kept his hands moving as he looked at the filthy foot flesh in front of him. He had a feeling that Shenny would make such a vile request and had been steeling himself for what was to come. With minimal hesitation, he set about his task, licking her paw pads from top to bottom while fighting off the urge to gag at the taste of congealed mud and dried sweat. Above him he could hear Shenny gasping and moaning, along with a wet squelching noise that he was all too familiar with. He glanced up at her and shuddered at the intense, lecherous look she was giving him as she aggressively fingered herself. His eyes shifted away from the sight, though he could still feel gaze trained on him the entire time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly, the squelching noise came to an abrupt halt along with her moans. Puncher looked back up at her and wasn't quite sure what to make of the look she was giving him. Her heated expression was no longer present and was replaced with a one of contemplation. In all the time he had known Shenny, she couldn\u2019t recall a single instance where she looked the least bit uncertain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not enjoying yourself, are you?\u201d she asked softly. Her question caught Puncher off guard and he wasn't sure how best he could answer it without accidently sending her into a violent rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what makes you think that?\u201d he asked with a nervous laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see it on your face\u201d she responded flatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m more concerned with making you feel good!\u201d he chimed with as much forced enthusiasm as he could muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that. It\u2019s a lot more fun when you\u2019re into it too\u201d Shenny said as she leaned forward slightly. \"Hold still. I'm not gonna do anything to hurt you\" she said before taking in a breath. Puncher wasn't sure was she had planned but wasn't given much time to guess as her lips parted slightly and a thick strand of drool began to drip down before splashing onto him. It was a miniscule amount to Shenny but to Pint Puncher it felt like she had dumped a bathtub full of spittle onto him. He didn't bother trying to hide his disgust as he retched and gagged, though Shenny didn't seem to mind as she giggled at his reaction. The tiny hero was so preoccupied trying to get the saliva out of his mouth and eyes that he didn't notice her feet closing in on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna love this!\u201d she giggled before she leaned back onto her hands and pressed her feet together with Puncher sandwiched between them. The diminutive hero had no idea what to expect but soon found out as her feet began to move, his member dragging along the smooth, warm and slick wall of flesh in front of him. Shenny wasted little time as she rubbed her feet together, her spit acting as lubricant so avoid causing any unwanted friction. A smug grin spread along her face as she could feel his hardening pecker poke against her  sensitive skin which was soon followed by a pleasured groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? I told you! Every part of my body is a delight to the senses~\u201d she tittered as she continued to rub her feet together. Puncher was in no position to respond as his mind was racked with pleasure. The initial disgust he felt was pushed back into his subconscious as the towering wolfess expertly worked his shaft. The experience was not unlike his time spent between her boobs, though Shenny proved more adept at messaging his body with her feet. He was dragged from the sole to the ball of of her foot before stopping at her titanic toes. With a wide grin, Shenny began to knead into his hapless form, stifling a moan as she felt his dick slip between the crevice of her big and second toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The previous pleasure Puncher felt paled in comparison to what he felt at that moment as he cried out in surprise. Her mammoth digits pulled and twisted his member meticulously, sending shockwaves of ecstacy throughout his body. In his pleasure addled mind, he grabbed onto her big toe and attempted to push his cock in even further, his thought process now dominated by newfound lust as he pumped his hips aggressively. It wasn\u2019t long before he reached his peak, a strained gasp escaping his lips as he coated her toes with his seed. He was reluctant to leave it at that though and continued to thrust his hips forward, wanting to drag out the experience for as long as he could. Shenny apparently shared his sentiment as she continued to toy with his cock, dragging out three more orgasms out of him before she decided to give him a break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she parted her feet, Pint Puncher flopped nervelessly onto the ground wide a wide-eyed and stunned expression on his face. The weight of what he had just engaged in had finally set in as his mind was filled with conflicting emotions. His initial plan was to wait out the clock until her powerup was gone so he could fight her on an even keel. He was only indulging her perverted games because it was the only way he could think to keep her preoccupied. He didn\u2019t actually enjoy any of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n At least that was what he kept telling himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Self-doubt lingered in his mind as he reflected on his actions. If he really didn\u2019t enjoy himself, how could he possibly justify what he had just done? Sleeping in her cleavage could be explained away as him resting up and it succeeded in wasting an hour of Shenny\u2019s powerup, but he couldn\u2019t use his adherence to the plan as an excuse as it to took no residence within his mind as he was rutting the crevice of her toes. Dread began to surface within him as he thought about the implications that this development presented. Shenny managed to bring out a part of himself that he didn\u2019t even know existed using nothing more than her feet. How weak was his resolve if he could be so easily manipulated in such a debased manner? If it was really that simple for Shenny to get him to give into her like that, did it render all his past victories against her moot? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Puncher going through his existential crisis, Shenny sat with a content smile on her face, her loins dripping wet from the sexual high she got from watching Puncher submit to her feet. As enjoyable as it was to have him service her gorgeous body, it felt even better to be appreciated. Never before had she held any care or concern as to the feelings of others, yet the joy she derived from the adoration she received from her once prominent foe was nothing short of intoxicating. Once her high began to fade, she looked down at her boyfriend-to-be and was surprised at the saddened expression on his face. She knew nothing of the existential crisis was going through and was perplexed as to why he would look so despondent minutes after what had to be the best orgasm he had ever experienced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned as she reached down to pick up his prone body, her intention being\u2026 </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Is everything alright down there? You look so sad for someone who just blew the biggest load in his life between my toes? Aren't you having fun, boyfriend?\" Shenny's curiosity slowly became laced with malice. \"Am I not entertaining you enough? Are you not feeling stimulated by my gorgeous body anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed her hand down on the hero, gripping him tightly. Her fingers stink with the potent musk of her sex as the remnants of her fingering session provide the smallest amount of lubrication for the hero. His captor swiftly brought him to her face and inspected him closely. Her foul breath washed over him as she contemplated what to do next. Much like the Pint Puncher she was in conflict with herself. Shenny wanted nothing more than to crush the little man into submission, to subject him to such an overwhelming amount of her he couldn't do anything but love her. But something else tugged on her mind. For the first time she looked upon the hero with a measure of pity. She wanted to convince him living with her and being her boyfriend were going to be the best decisions of his life. But how could he choose that when he was getting tormented by her? A weak cough shook her back to the present and she eased her vice-like grip on the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'm expecting too much...\" She thought aloud. Her eyes fell on the Pint Puncher again, looking increasingly pathetic trapped in her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I know you can take it. In fact, I know just how to get you in the mood again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher's world became a blur as she moved him into position. The tight, smelly fingers released him and left him looking around with uncertainty. He found himself laying on his back on the floor, the enormous wolfess towering over him. Far away on either side of him her muscular arms were holding up her body as she looked like she was about to do a set of pushups. What in the world was she playing at? How was this in any way fun to her? His confusion lasted until he heard a strained grunt from Shenny. He looked up and saw her massive jiggling boobs come down like a pair of fuzzy meteors. not a sound could escape the hero before he was buried completely beneath the soft surface of her right tit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>FWUMP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe supervillain relished the panicked squirming beneath her boobs. After a few seconds she pushed herself up again, allowing the Pint Puncher his freedom. He looked dazed and confused, but there was an unmistakable smirk on his face. The heavy smothering embrace of her rack was more comfortable than she gave it credit for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like being punished like that, don't you? Then prepare yourself little man.\" She said with a naughty smirk before burying him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>FWUMP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the hero felt himself pinned beneath the soft flesh. The huge globes were heavy, but their malleable nature meant the weight was spread out well, making the whole experience easily bearable. He kept squirming, sending shivers of pleasure through the jiggling mass. He knew Shenny was enjoying this as much as he was. Where she stomped him into submission just the other day now he was loving her smothering embrace. What the hell was going on with him? The superhero still couldn't shake his troubled feelings for the whole situation. But he knew he had to hide them, at least for now. If she saw him act all weird again she might get upset. This heavy teasing was supposed to be a punishment already. Or who knows, maybe she's building up to the punishment still. His next reprieve was much shorter as Shenny moved from smothering to squashing the Pint Puncher repeatedly. She huffed and puffed, maintaining a steady pace of pushups whilst slamming her tits down on the hero over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>FWUMP FWUMP FWUMP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly this was turning unpleasant but before he could complain she stopped. He got to see the wolfess once more, still holding her position, but panting a little. The smell of sweat filled the air as she was understandably a bit winded. Her smile couldn't be bigger, seeing the squished hero slowly come to his senses. She carefully sat down before him, making sure not to accidentally sweep him away. With the towering sweaty wolfess before him the Pint Puncher felt a sense of dread coming over him. Her smile was getting a little unsettling. He could practically see her mind reeling with all the things she wanted to do to him. Her pussy was as wet as ever, practically twitching with excitement. His nervous smile made her all the more giddy. How should he enjoy her beautiful body next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Pint Puncher awaited Shenny's next course of action, something curious caught the corner of his eye. A thin white streak trailed down breast, dripping onto the ground and forming a small puddle. Shenny was completely oblivious to her lactations and didn't take notice until she followed his gaze and looked down at her now hardened nipples. For a moment, her lecherous expression waned and a look of unease touched her face. This was clearly something that she wasn't used to dealing with, though her disposition quickly shifted back to lustful as she got an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She lowered her hand to the ground and Pint Puncher knew immediately to climb into it. It didn't take a genius for him to figure out what she had in mind. In a matter of seconds he was greeted by the familiar sight of her swollen nipple, a thick stream of milk seeping out and staining the fur surrounding it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what you did? You made this happen, little boyfriend. Now you're gonna fix it!\" she snickered as she pushed used her finger to push him face first into the sensitive flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher grunted and coughed as the impact caused some of the milk to go into his nose, though he quickly recovered and went about his task, his hands grasping onto either side of her massive nipple as he began feeding. He had sampled her milk before, but he didn't get a chance to really savor it. It was very sweet, so much so that he had to pull back and give himself a second to adjust. Once his taste buds became accustomed to it, he went right back to suckling her teet, his eyes shutting close as a wave or contentment washed over him. His previous concerns slowly began to fade out of his mind and he found himself appreciating how much comfort Shenny's breasts provided. They were so soft and warm... and as she was currently demonstrating, they could provide him with some much needed sustenance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he continued to drink, he could feel his body being pushed even deeper into her boob, the smell of her sweat stained fur filling his nostrils. In his tranquil state of mind, he didn't mind the smell nearly much as he initially did. At some point, Shenny began to rub her enormous finger up and down his back, which he found to be surprisingly soothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking down at her once fierce nemesis, Shenny couldn't help but smile. Their time together had been much more gratifying than she could ever have hoped. She had envisioned their relationship being entirely one-sided with him waiting on her hand and foot and appeasing her ravenous sexual appetite. Yet she felt a an unfamiliar sense of satisfaction in the intimacy they shared at that moment. She thought back to her previous battles with Pint Puncher and how she would daydream about snuffing him out in the most cruel and painful manner possible. Her face visibly soured, as the thought of eliminating Puncher seemed much more distasteful than she remembered it being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n A sudden surge of pleasure jolted Shenny from her moment of reflection, as Pint Puncher had begun to bite and squeeze on her nipple in an attempt to coax out more milk. A low moan escaped Shenny\u2019s lips as her boyfriend-to-be ravished the sensitive flesh, her eyes glazing over and her tongue hanging out in a less than dignified display. Puncher could sense the effect his stimulation was having, but paid it little mind. All he cared about was getting more of her delicious milk and her satisfaction was a secondary concern. It didn\u2019t much for him to get what he wanted as the volume of milk increased twofold, though he continued to stimulate her nipple while he drank. If he was going to gorge himself, it only seemed fair that Shenny got something out of it too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 you\u2019re making me really happy right now, you know that\u2026?\u201d she murmured as she delicately stroked the top of his head with her finger. Puncher responded by clamping his hands onto her breast tightly, eliciting another gasp from her. By that point he had had his fill and was focused on pleasing his captor. Shenny didn't quite pick up on this as she quickly brought him over to her other swollen teat which was still pushing out a steady stream of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, little guy. You\u2019re not finished yet\u201d she breathed as she pressed him tightly into her bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Can\u2019t...full\u2026\u201d Puncher coughed as he pushed against the yielding flesh in an attempt to get some fresh air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny\u2019s response came as a surprise to him as she pouted and looked down at him with a wide eyed, innocent expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it feels soooo gooood\u2026 please? Just a little more\u2026?\u201d she whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Punt Puncher stared up at her silently. It was odd to see Shenny ask for a favor rather than use her superior strength to force him into compliance. He found himself strangely compelled to fulfill her request despite the protest of his now full stomach. He turned his attention to the leaking nipple and with a reluctant sigh, began to drink. As much as he enjoyed the taste of her milk, he could only take in so much at once. His stomach began to protrude slightly and he began to feel lightheaded and just when it felt as though he couldn't take in any more milk, Shenny pulled him back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher breathed a sigh of relief, though he felt absolutely bloated and sluggish. If Shenny wished to engage in any more fun, she would need to give him another hour or so to sleep it off, although judging from the look she was giving him, he wasn't sure if he'd get a chance to rest. Shenny's hungry gaze returned, but something seemed off to Puncher. Her eyes were cloudy and her expression was eerily calm, her body tremble with anticipation. Cupping her hands together, she brought him mere inches from her face, her eyes never leaving Puncher once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you\u2026\u201d she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With those three simple words, Pint Puncher felt the air leave his lungs. It certainly wasn\u2019t the first time one of his foes had uttered that phrase to him, be it sarcastic or sincere, but he never thought he would ever hear Shenny say such a thing to him. He looked up to meet her gaze, trying to see if there was some kind of underlying malice in her words. As he stared deeply into her eyes, he could see that she was being entirely serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you so bad right now\u2026 I want you so bad it hurts\u2026\u201d she said with a toothy smile, her voice cracking lightly. What began as a plot to acquire a willing sex slave had become something entirely different. Shenny longed for his acceptance and affection, so much so that she was actively fighting against what came naturally to her. She wanted nothing more to shove his puny body into her hungry pussy, but she also wanted to be sure that he wanted it as well. If she gave in, it would run the risk of scaring him off the idea of being her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her loins ached with need and her will power was faltering. Can she find it within herself to wait a just little longer? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fire in her loins was burning brightly, but in the face of such a singularly unique opportunity Shenny would not let her efforts with the Pint Puncher go to waste. She whimpered a little at the mere thought of putting him face to face with her hungry pussy. Her large hands brought him close to her chest and hugged him tightly. She shielded her little boyfriend from her pained expression. As much as she didn't want to it, her instincts would drive her mad if she didn't sate her lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny had lived with this curse ever since the calamity empowered her with amazonian size and strength. Her loins always hungered for prey, no matter the circumstances. The longer her pussy was without nourishment, the more overwhelming her sexual desires became. There was only one thing that could lessen the need: a victim squirming for his life inside of her. A good climax could keep her somewhat mellow for days and if her victim was quick enough they might even walk away from their little adventure inside of her. But the best ones were the people that went in and never came out again. Those that committed their very lives to her pleasure brought her to such heights she could go without another insertion for weeks. If she wanted to get through the remainder of this 'date' without losing control over her urges, she needed to relieve herself. But all she had to hand was the Pint Puncher, unless..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large wolfess looked out her window to the city. A devious plan began to hatch in her mind. Surely one of the townsfolk could be sacrificed in the name of love. But the Pint Puncher couldn't know. If he knew she'd been torturing people to satisfy her needs he'd never fall in love with her. Suddenly she realized that the little hero she'd been hugging awkwardly long now was quite bloated, fattened up with her milk and sluggish. Her smile curled up high as it seems this situation would resolve itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My love, you look like you're ready to burst. Would you like to take a little nap after helping me? Your bed awaits...\" She graciously showcased her humongous cleavage again in case the hero had forgotten what it looked like. Groggily the Pint Puncher nodded, anything that didn't involve a lot of physical activity sounded good now. A chance to cope with the excessive amounts of delicious milk in his belly. He shuffled himself into her cleavage and with a little help nestled himself deep between Shenny's soft boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the hero snuggly smothered in her rack the wolfess set off to find someone to feed to her pussy. Every step she took squeezed and massaged him, sending him drifting off to sleep. Before long she had reached the outskirts of town. The streets were deathly quiet, not a human in sight. The houses looked empty. After a bit of sniffing around she finally came across a lone man cowering in a bush. She left him under the illusion that his hiding place was effective right up to the moment she reached down and grabbed him. The man screamed in terror which Shenny swiftly punished with a powerful squeeze. Her crushing grip forced the air from his lungs, silencing his noise. Shenny quickly hoisted him to her face and angrily whispered at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet! My date is trying to sleep in there.\" She pointed at the immense cleavage concealing every trace of the Pint Puncher. The panicking man looked at her like she had just lost her mind. \"Whatever, just stay quiet and let me do this...\" She huffed, lowering him to her crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pussy was twitching with anticipation, the glistening labia leaking their excitement onto the man. The hand cradling him brought him up, pressing his puny body against the warm flesh. Immediately Shenny felt the lower lips parting, preparing for their meal. With the amount of pent-up frustration she had in her loins the man would need a miracle to survive. Back and forth he went, the wolfess rubbing herself with his body and sliding him ever deeper between the lower lips. With a subtle slurp his legs vanished into the wolfess, causing her to struggle and suppress a moan. The next few seconds looked like a particularly disturbing horror show as the immense vagina swallowed more and more of him, quickly pulling him inside. She didn't refer to her pussy as 'hungry' for nothing. She felt her inner walls carry him deeper, squeezing him from all sides. She bore down on him with all the lust she had bottled up over the last few days. Before long the man had stopped moving. The wave of relief she felt just from ending his life was palpable, but Shenny had to keep quiet. If the Pint Puncher awoke now he'd probably be able to figure out what was going on. Quickly the wolfess got up and returned home. Her movements help her body to reduce its victim to cum for a powerful eruption. By the time she arrives home there's nothing left of him but a powerful orgasm ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely managed to get to the bathroom before the dam burst and her nethers released a huge torrent of arousal. Strands of slime drip from her loins as she stands basking in the afterglow of another great climax. The pool of slime between her feet showed no trace of its origin. With a huge sigh of relief the wolfess tidies the place and her legs up. Though the hunger would never completely leave, she'd be able to resist the urge to cram the Pint Puncher into her puss for now. One day, when he was ready to go in himself she would blow his mind and make him wish he'd known about the intense pleasure before. Not a moment too soon, as a yawning superhero pokes his head out from her cleavage. With a little help from a giant finger he freed himself from the soft, smothering embrace of Shenny's rack. The bloated gut was gone and he looked ready for more. She quickly overpowers him with a kiss, quietly ecstatic that he seemed none the wiser about her actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better?\" She asked with her softest voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah.\" He stammered back, still struggling with her face-smothering kiss.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n With the fire on her loins subdued and her thoughts clear, Shenny decided to take a short break from her usual lewd acts and simply enjoy Pint Puncher's company. She tried to think of the ways in which they could spend time together that didn't solely revolve around sex and after racking her brain for a solid minute, an idea came to her. Pint Puncher raised a brow curiously at the mischievous smile she gave him. She didn't give him any warning before shoving him back into her cleavage and walking off. The place she intended to go was very special to her and while she had grown to love him immensely, she didn't want to run the risk of having him know it's location should he choose not to be her boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The trip was relatively short due in part to the enormous strides she was able to take. After all they had done up until then, he could only imagine what she had in store for him. Her mountainous breasts consumed all sound, so he couldn't hear what was going on outside of her cleavage. It wasn't long before he was freed from his confinement and he was greeted by a truly breathtaking sight. Standing before them was a vast hot spring, easily able to hold someone of Shenny's size with plenty of room to spare. A roaring waterfall poured down from the mountain side forming a rainbow. Shenny allowed him to take in the sight before lowering him to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my special spot where I go to unwind. I'm the only person who know about it\" she said proudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is... wow\" Puncher muttered as he looked around him. Many different types of fauna surrounded the area, adding to the already colorful display. Hundreds of trees surrounded the spring, keeping it safe from wandering eyes. Had it not been for Shenny, he was certain that he could never find such a place on his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice, but\u2026 why bring me here? I would think that you would want to keep a place like this under wraps\u201d Puncher inquired curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis place is special to me\u2026 and so are you\u201d she said with a warm smile, her face reddening slightly. She sighed and stepped into the spring, her titanic body submerging up to her shoulders causing waves to ripple across the normally still waters. She looked over at Puncher and giggled. \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there. Come on in!\u201d she called before leaning her head back and closing her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher shrugged and walked over to join her. As he got close to the steamy waters, he could see just how far it descended. To fit someone of Shenny\u2019s great size, it went without saying that it must\u2019ve fairly deep. Still, he didn\u2019t feel like he had anything to worry about. Even if something happened to him, he was certain that Shenny wouldn\u2019t let him drown. To be on the safe side, he kept to the edge as he gradually lowered himself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon enough, he was seated right beside Shenny, his pose matching hers as he leaned back with his eyes closed. Any residual stress that lingered in him melted away and he found himself feeling content and at peace with his surroundings. Had she not brought him there, he would\u2019ve never been able to enjoy the warmth of the spring. His plan of distraction was once again pushed into the back of his mind, though this time it was done consciously. After she had brought him to such a beautiful and tranquil area, he was feeling very gracious towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh\u2026 maybe this \u2018boyfriend\u2019 thing isn\u2019t so bad after all\u2026</i>, he thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reclined against the edge of the spring, he began to drift asleep. In his lethargic state of mind, his dreams were filled with fantasies of Shenny and all the racy activities that they could potentially engage in. Such thoughts would normally be nestled deep within his subconscious, but he felt no shame in indulging in them at the moment. His fantasies were interrupted by the rippling of the waters. He opened his eyes to she Shenny ascending from the spring, her wet fur clinging to her body and emphasising her curvaceous figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelp\u2026 I think it\u2019s time we finish up. We\u2019ve been in here for almost an hour\u201d she said as she stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher could hardly believe it. Had there really been in there that long? Looking down at his hands he could see that his skin was starting to wrinkle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Let's go wash up\" Shenny said as she reached down and gently plucked him from out the warm waters. She approached the roaring waterfall and deposed him onto a cliff that rested beside it. With her hands free, she went to work cleaning herself, letting the pouring water pound down onto her. For someone like her, the crushing stream amounted to little more than a light drizzle. From where he was seated, Puncher was granted a full showing of her body, his eyes following her hands as she scrubbed herself clean. From her muscular thighs, to her ample breasts, to her shapely rear end. It finally dawned on him just how gorgeous she really was, his length standing on full salute as she cleansed her body of residual dirt and sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he was unashamedly lusting after her. Shenny remained completely unaware of his growing admiration. If anything, her thought process was quite different from his, as was silently reveling in how close they had become. She had no real frame of reference when it came to the concept of love and relationships, but she was certain that her feelings for Puncher were genuine. Only he could bring her to such a calm state of mind that sex hadn't entered her thoughts in the slightest. Once she was finished with her shower she turned her attention to him and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow\u2019s your turn\u201d she said as she picked him up and held him under the waterfall. Her large hands scrubbed and carressed his body with such delicacy that it surprised him. She had previously shown little concern for the amount of strength she exerted when handling him, so he assumed that she was simply incapable of restraint. As pleasant as it felt, he couldn\u2019t help take notice to how she seemed to avoid his groin. Her fingers would occasionally trace along his shaft unintentionally, eliciting a moan from him that was drowned out by the sound of the roaring water. He was actually disappointed when she was finally finished without tending to his aching manhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! Nice and clean~\u201d she giggled. As she stepped out of the spring, Pint Puncher felt unsatisfied. She had managed to kindle a fire in his loins and it had gone unchecked for almost an hour. If he wanted, he could bring it to her attention, though in the long run it could end up giving her too much control over him if she realized that that he really did lust after her body.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher struggled to balance his need for relief with his doubts towards Shenny. Not whether this was all a ploy to slowly kill him or anything. Was it really all that bad to be her boyfriend? Throughout this 'date' he'd gotten to see a side of her he couldn't imagine until today. She was gentle, caring and composed. It was hard to believe this was the same hormone-driven monster he'd fought before. Maybe all she ever needed was someone unafraid of her love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towering wolfess sat quietly as she watched the hero ponder. A sly smirk decorated her face as she smiled at his confusion. She'd seen the piercing boner dangling between his legs. It was hard to miss, even at the Puncher's small size. Just a few light touches were all it took to bring him to the edge. Now was the big test. Would he try to hide his attraction to her or finally submit himself to her for release. Her own mind raced through all the ways in which she could give that cock a beautiful climax. As long as he came up to her himself she'd do whatever it takes to blow his mind with ecstasy. The heat in her loins grew a little, but the recent meal kept her lust for him in check. Were he willing to let her relieve him it would be another step towards introducing him to her pussy. Her daydreams were interrupted by a gentle tug on her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S... Shenny?\" The hero muttered, blushing brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" She asked with the gentlest voice she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's a bit weird to ask, but could you...\" The wolfess interrupted him. \"There's nothing to be ashamed about, Pint Puncher. You've seen me naked, slept between my boobs and spent hours staring at me. Frankly I'd be more insulted if you weren't hard right now.\" The hero felt a sense of relief wash over him, though he was still beet red with shame. This was supposed to be his nemesis, why did he think asking her sexual favors was in any way a good idea? Shenny expertly broke him out of his doubts by running a finger along his length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, you're already about to blow, aren't you?\" She cooed lovingly. \"Not a moment to waste then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took hold of the hero carefully, keeping her fingers clear of his crotch. She didn't want the hero to climax too soon. As she lifted him to her face the final decision was monumental... handjob or blowjob? Looking at the squirming hero in her hands made her salivate a little. That was the decider. If she was so hungry for that cock she would feast heartily on its bountiful load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her pursed lips closed in the Pint Puncher too caught on to the plan. He bit his lip in anticipation as hot breath washed over his manhood. The moment the wolfess' puffy lips made contact she sucked his entire manhood in. In an instant the warmth of her maw surrounded his cock and a wet tongue introduced itself. It quickly span around the hero's little man, coating it in a layer of warm drool. It twitched erratically in response, so close to bursting it hurt. Shenny knew she wouldn't get much if any time to play with the little thing, but she didn't mind. With this bridge crossed the Pint Puncher would be far more willing to let her play with him again. He couldn't be anywhere but in heaven right now. The way he tried to grab hold of her muzzle and thrust a little told her more than enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gentle licks paused and she carefully pushed her tongue against the tip of his dick. The surge of pleasure it sent through the hero made him shake with uncontrolled delight in her gentle grasp. He couldn't hold out another millisecond and with a relieved moan he came. The release was so powerful he felt like his dick was about to explode as it shot its payload into Shenny's maw at full force. To the wolfess it was a paltry offering, but the taste made every drop worth it. She loudly gulped it down, exaggerating a little to make the hero feel good. Her tongue quickly cleaned him up and the puffy lips withdrew, planting a last big smooch on his tip before pulling back to let her look at him expectantly. The epic climax had robbed him of his breath, but he struggled through it to say just one word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits there for a little while, letting the exhausted superhero catch his breath for a few minutes. His little wiggles in her grasp feel too cute for words. Occasionally she brings him in close to nuzzle him a little, sneaking in a big lick or two as well. She even offered him another helping of her milk to revitalize him. He kindly declined, remembering how full he felt after the first helping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must mean you're feeling good again.\" She suggested. The hero nodded at her with a smile. \"Excellent, then you can return the favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\" The Pint Puncher asked a little fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise me.\" Shenny replied, setting the hero down next to her and laying down on her chest in the soft grass. She closed her eyes and waited for him to get started. What does the Pint Puncher do? With his super strength, he can probably manage a massage. Maybe her back or her feet. Probably best to not do anything too sexual. Shenny's pussy was still dangerous and he didn't want to awaken its hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Pint Puncher considered the options presented before him. He had grown accustomed to tending to her feet, but he was sure that she was already anticipating it. After what she had just done for him, he wanted to really show his appreciation to her. His eyes ran along her body before eventually landing on her twitching ears. Upon seeing them, an idea came to mind. He had always wondered whether or not Shenny could be pacified with an ear rub, being that she was partly canine. Now was as good a time as any to find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny's eyes fluttered open as she felt her tiny boyfriend climb onto her neck before crawling onto the top of her head. She was about to ask what he had in mind, though her voice got caught in her throat the moment his hands made contact with her ear. An involuntary moan escaped her lips as he rubbed and scratched the sensitive outer surface of her ear. She was hit with a wave of euphoria unlike anything she had ever experience before, her tongue hanging out and muscles relaxing. Pint Puncher smiled at her reaction and went to work tending to her other ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it... just relax...\" he whispered into her ear as he continued to work his magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny could do nothing but moan at the pleasant massage she was receiving. Her mind had become lost in a haze and the growing hunger she had built up from bringing her boyfriend to his climax had begun to dissipate. Her usual lecherous thoughts were absent and all she wanted to do was curl up with her boyfriend and cuddle with him. Pint Puncher was amazed at how effective his massage was. Had he known how sensitive her ears were back when they were fighting, he could've defeated her much more easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He paused, taking a moment to reflect on his last thought. With the knowledge he now possessed, he could potentially incapacitate her before making his way back to the city for assistance. It would be risky, but it was certainly possible. Should she come back for him, he would better prepared to combat the towering wolfess. He was pulled away from his thoughts by a low moan coming from beneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you stop for? That felt sooooo good...!\" she whined as she looked up at him with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher blinked and quickly went back to work tending to her ears, earning a muted gasp from Shenny. The plan that he had begun formulating was tossed aside as he put all his focus into making his titanic lover happy. Upon further reflection, the thought of taking advantage of such a weakness seemed wrong. She had displayed an intimate side of herself that only he had seen before and he knew it wound her emotionally if he were to use it to his advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How're you feeling?\" he whispered into gargantuan ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny could only grunt in response, though the blissful smile on her face told him everything he needed to know. Judging by the constant fluttering of her eyelids, she was doing her best to not fall asleep on him. Pint Puncher smiled warmly at the sight. In spite of their less than pleasant history, he found an odd sense of satisfaction in his ability to bring her to such a tranquil state and while he didn't care to admit it, he had grown quite attached to her. Once again, he could feel his heroic nature eating away at his current mindset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> This is Shenny we're talking about!</i>, he thought to himself. <i>She's just an emotionally unstable bully! It doesn't matter how cute she's acting right now, she's just as dangerous today as she was yesterday! Sure, she may be beautiful and her boobs may be big and soft... and her legs so long and her thighs so thick and muscly, and her lips... those lips... they're so plush and...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher's eyes glazed over as he became lost in his thoughts. He couldn't even try to fight off his attraction to the colossal amazon. It wasn't like it was a well kept secret. Their last bit of fun had already demonstrated how much he lusted for Shenny and her gorgeous body. While he was still on the fence as to whether or not he wanted to be her boyfriend, he decided to drop his attempts to reject his sexual desires for the time being and own up to his attraction to her. He smiled and leaned into her ear, his fingers trailing along along the edge slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the most beautiful girl in the world...\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His words made Shenny's eyes shoot open and her heart skip a beat. Had he really said that? No. It couldn't be. She must've just imagined it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen anyone prettier than you...\" Puncher whispered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n No. She was certain she heard him right. She wasn't entirely sure how to react at that moment. Their relationship had just taken a sudden leap forward that it caught her completely off guard. She looked up at him with wide, uncertain eyes and was greeted with a pleasant smile from her boyfriend as he continued to massage her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Almost as if on command, Shenny closed her eyes and let out a shuddering sigh. As confident in her beauty as she was, it occurred to her that no one had ever complimented her appearance before. Whenever she encountered someone else, they were usually pleading for their pathetic lives or trying to run and hide. Yet Pint Puncher, the runt had been a thorn in her side for so long, had reduced her to putty with a few strokes to her ear and a few pleasant words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it... just let me take care of you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny nodded slightly, her eyelids becoming heavy as he continued to whisper sweet nothing into her ear. Most women would roll their eyes at such broad attempts at flattery, but Shenny relished them. No matter how much she attempted to qualm her the constant hunger down below, it didn't change the fact that she was an emotionally starved woman who longed for genuine companionship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher sat on her head for some time, kneading into her sensitive while continually whispering compliments into her ear. The gentle rubbing had gradually lulled the amazon to a peaceful slumber, though he was sure she could still hear him as her ears would twitch with ever comment he made. Suddenly and without warning, Pint Puncher said something that he would immediately regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The moment that sentence escaped his lips, he slapped his hands over his mouth in disbelief. How... why did he say that?! Why would he <i>ever</i> say that?! No good could come from saying that to her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I-It was just a slip of the tongue...</i>, he thought to himself.<i> I don't love her. I <b>can't</b></i> <i>love her!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n He looked down at Shenny and swallowed nervously. He knew very well that a confession of love was the point of no return between them. There would be no way he could turn her down after that. His only hope was that she didn't actually hear him...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The snoozing wolfess' ears twitched, much like they did when he was whispering sweet nothings into them. The hero's heart skipped a beat, but it may have been a false alarm. His words provoked no further response. The Pint Puncher knew that saying those words to her would've led to something far more had she heard them. She'd shower him in affection, probably dragging him to her lips for a barrage of kisses or something equally overwhelming. She wouldn't respond to \"I love you...\" by just laying still, right? He prays to whoever would listen that the wolfess really hadn't heard him accidentally confess his love for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly his heart rate dropped back down and he absentmindedly rubbed the large ear again. Shenny murred with delight, barely awake anymore. It provided him with a moment of peace. The hero carefully sat down. He had to face the consequences of what he just said. He had to accept that somewhere deep down he had romantic feelings for her. He longed for an excuse, a way out of this conundrum that didn't involve facing reality. Maybe all that crushing him underfoot had given him brain damage? Maybe her milk was somehow laced with something? There had to be some way of explaining how he could feel so amorous towards someone who he couldn't love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if this was genuine, this couldn't possibly work out. Shenny belonged in prison. She'd caused so much death and destruction there could be no other place for her. He was a superhero, for crying out loud. He had to defend the city from people like her. But maybe this was protecting the city? Maybe she could be made to renounce her evil ways if he stayed with her. He smiled at the mental image of the wolfess fighting crime. Maybe she could sate her lustful impulses with petty criminals, carrying them to the nearest police station in her snatch. Of course she'd have to let them out again, but with the amount of crime in the city keeping her pussy stuffed should be easy. The picture of her in spandex working alongside him and manhandling supervillains was too much and he burst into giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess stirred a little beneath him and the Pint Puncher hurriedly rubbed her sensitive ears again, calming her. There was something disarming about seeing her fiery temper so relaxed. Before long Shenny informed him just how relaxed she was. A tiny snore signaled that he had successfully lulled her to sleep. He carefully stood up and walked along the top of her head to her neck before hopping down. She hadn't noticed a thing. In her sleep she was softly mumbling, drawing his curiosity. Quietly he walked up to her muzzle to try and hear what she had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Puncher... so soft... so sweet... love... you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was talking about him. He was literally the man of her dreams. He smiled broadly hearing her speak of him so tenderly, but this didn't help his internal struggle. He had every opportunity to just fly away, but he couldn't do it. Not just because the 24 hours he promised to stay for weren't over, but also because she'd be heartbroken. Not like any of the villains who projected their foul desires onto him, but genuine heartbreak about losing the first human she's ever felt any real love for. He couldn't bear to bring her such sorrow. But if he was sticking around with the sleepy wolfess, what should he do?</span></div></div>",

He was tempted to take this opportunity to further explore the wonders of her body while she was asleep, though he quickly pushed the thought from his mind. While he had become much more accommodating to his based desires, he found the thought of toying with her sleeping body to be distasteful. He'd wait until she was up and about before fully indulging himself, although that meant that for the time being he was stuck with little to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. I guess I could go for a nap myself...\" he said with a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Instinctively, he began walking towards her chest, though he stopped upon realizing that she was sleeping on her stomach. He groaned in disappointment, as he had grown to enjoy sleeping between her breasts. With his usual resting spot taken from him, he began thinking of other spots on her body that he could rest. Her feet provided a similar level of warmth, though her paw pads were a bit too sensitive. His gaze shifted over to Shenny's backside, landing on her shapely rear end. It had only just then occurred to him that he hadn't had the chance to properly admire it. He flew up a few feet to get a better look at it and for a fleeting moment, he considered using it as a temporary resting place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before he could properly weigh the pros and cons of that idea, Shenny let out a loud yawn and turned over to her side, her head now resting on her hands as she curled up slightly. With her hefty breasts now exposed, Pint Puncher eagerly dropped back to the ground and began to advance towards them. He stopped once his foot dipped down slightly and it occurred to him that her heaving boobs had left two giant groves in the earth. He snickered as he looked down as saw a smaller hole resting in the center, as he knew that his flattery had caused her nipples to dig into the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Turning his attention back to Shenny's massive bosom, he hovered over and pushed himself between them. From where she was laying, it took him some time to worm his way in, though he had little trouble getting into place. He had become so intimately familiar with her boobs that he knew how best to position himself. His squirming had a tangible effect on the towering amazon as she moaned and sighed from the pleasure, her nipples hardening and leaking out a minute amount of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher smirked at her reaction, though he did nothing to exacerbate it once he was where he wanted to be. Their fun would continue once the both of them got some rest. There was no need for him to do more than he had to. From where he laid, he couldn't couldn't quite make out what Shenny's sleep induced murmurs, though assumed they were the same as before. He was half correct, as Shenny continued to dream of her loving little boyfriend, though her dreams had taken a slight turn...</span></div></div>",

The Pint Puncher kept himself nestled deep between her soft boobs and tried to join her. But trying to sleep was proving to be a challenge. She kept moving around, shifting herself and gently smothering the hero. He could only imagine what she was dreaming about until he heard a very distinct noise. A loud, sloppy wet sound began to ring out from down below. Wedged between her tits he couldn't see it, but he didn't need a lot of imagination to know what she was doing. Shenny was busy pleasuring herself in her sleep. What a dream it must be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's... mine...\" Was the first bit of understandable English to emerge from her in minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her dreams the towering wolfess was sitting in a large suburb, a few crushed homes beneath her. Right across from her was another Shenny, looking a bit rougher and more unkempt. They were sitting close enough for their crotches to touch. Both of them grunted lewdly as they felt their prize move about. Between them, wedged in both their pussies, was the Pint Puncher. He didn't move much, the overwhelming muscle of his captors doing the work. Slowly he was pulled back and forth between the Shenny's, each trying to claim him as their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time Shenny thought she was inching out a victory, her nemesis redoubled her efforts and pulled him back into the middle. Likewise she was able to counter any of her advances as they happened. The two seemed locked in an eternal stalemate until Shenny began to feel something. Right at her bosom, close to her heart a glowing spot appeared on her fur. It was warm, flowing through her like a river. She felt empowered and invigorated, looking the other wolfess in the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He. Is. Mine!\" Shenny growled menacingly. Her pussy began pulling on the hero like nothing either of them had seen before. The other wolfess could not stand up against such power. Try as she might with a last ditch effort, the Pint Puncher was slipping away. With a loud squelch he was pulled free from her only to vanish an instant later into the depths of Shenny. The sudden victory and associated superhero insertion overwhelmed her. She laid down on her back, seeing the other wolfess turn to smoke and dissipate. Several more buildings were reduced to rubble beneath her but she couldn't care less. With the hero inside of her, nothing would stop her reaching the climax she yearned for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher outside of dreamland began to reconsider his choice of napping place. Comfy as they normally are, the soft mounds began to grind him flat as his lover kept on vigorously masturbating. Her fingers went ever deeper into her sopping wet pussy until she finally released a small flood over her legs. It was a good thing they were still near the hot spring, because she was making a big mess of herself. More impressively, it sounded like she was still asleep. With her whole body finally calming down a little, perhaps a nap could be had. But Shenny's dreams were far from done, as he was about to experience.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Within the realm of her dreams, Shenny had become intoxicated off the pleasure her boyfriend had granted him. She could feel him deep inside her, kicking and squirming furiously in an attempt to bring his giant lover as much pleasure as his tiny body could. In her dream she could easily envision him buried deep inside her snatch, his face brimming with joy as he threw himself against the slick walls of her love tunnel, his rock hard dick rubbing along the walls in a respectable attempt at conventional sex. No other person could provide please her with such passion, such enthusiasm and love. There had been instances in which some of her victims were enamored with her curvaceous body and willingly risked their lives to pleasure her, but they all paled in comparison to Pint Puncher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just when it seemed like things couldn't be better, something strange happened. It took Shenny a moment to realize it, but she could feel something stirring down below. It felt as though something were swelling inside her snatch, stretching it to the brim. She gasped and shuddered at the new sensation, as she had never felt something so large enter her pussy before. She opened one eye and was stunned to see the face of her lover just inches from her own. They were the same size as her, a fact that Shenny could barely wrap her head around. If he was in front of her, what was it that was plugging her cavernous pussy? Her inquiry was answer as Pint Puncher pushed his hips forward, eliciting a gasp from the horny wolfess, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her gargantuan lover repeated this motion, sawing his manhood in and out of her pussy, a loving smile etched onto his face as he watched her squirm and spasm beneath her. Shenny was struggling to make sense of what was happening at that moment. It had been so long since she had actual sex with someone, the type that didn't involve just cramming someone into her drooling pussy. The last time something like this had happened was when before the calamity that transformed her into the amazonian giant that would ravage the city on a weekly basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she laid back riding a wave of confusion and arousal, it suddenly became clear to her what all of this meant. Pint Puncher wasn't simply tending to her unquenchable sexual appetite like so many had done before; he was making love to her. The warmth with enabled her to defeat her doppelganger had returned, though it was much more intense the previous instance. Her eyes watered from both the euphoria and the love which filled her being. It felt as though that the fire in her loins was being properly dealt with for the first time. Her tongue hang out and as she went crossed eyed, her mind completely giving in to the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes... take me... make me yours...! P-Pint Puncher...!\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A sudden shake jostled Pint Puncher from his slumber. He wasn't all that surprised to have been woken so suddenly, as he sense that Shenny had been walking around while he slept. He could only imagine with the towering amazon was doing at that moment, especially when it was causing her boobs to quake so much. He wiggled his way up to the surface and was surprised to see that she was still asleep. Her eyes were shut tight and her tongue hung at the side of her mouth as she continued to bounce her breast up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a considerable amount of effort, Pint Puncher pulled himself free from her cleavage, though the unsteady ground caused him to tumble back and land on the ground beneath her. Immediately, his nose was hit by the pungent musk of her womanhood, though it seemed to completely surround the area rather that one particular spot. The grass beneath him felt unusually damp and large pillar like stones littered the landscape. Pint Puncher blinked as he stood to his feet, as he noticed something curious about that stone that surrounded him. They all were darkened at the top, as though someone had been coming around to moisten them from time to time. He approached one and quickly jumped back once he caught wind of the feminine scent that seemed permanently etched into its surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A wet squelching noise drew his attention back to Shenny and his eyes widened at what he saw. She sat on her knees, her pussy enveloping what had to be the largest stone the in the clearing. She bounced her body up and down repeatedly, the stone standing firm as she continued to ride it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Puncher\u2026 yes\u2026 I love you\u2026 so much\u2026 take me\u2026!\u201d she moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher remained frozen in place, completely unsure of what to make of the spectacle taking place in from of him. His immediate thought was to look away, though he found himself unable to. There was something about what he was watching that resonated with him. Shenny, the woman who had once been one of his most fearsome foes, was currently screaming out his name while riding out her orgasm. In her sleep she had managed to walk all the way over to a clearing to do this, her mind completely fixated on him the entire time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He may not have known how to respond to it, but his body certainly did as his dick became painfully erect at the lewd display. He watched completely enraptured as she groped her sizable breasts while she continued to ride her imaginary lover. It all came to a sudden halt as she let out a howl of pleasure, her juices completely coating the rock and the surrounding area. After a moment of recuperation, Shenny abruptly stood up, her powerful pussy nearly pulling the stone up with her. A content smile touched her sleeping face and without another word, she plodded back over to the spring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher in the meanwhile was still awestruck at what he had just witnessed. It was then that he noticed the raging stiffee between his legs, though he had long since gotten used to it. What concerned him the most at the moment was the lingering temptation that nagged at him. While he was watching Shenny, there was a moment where he had begun to imagine himself lodged deep within her hungry snatch, throwing his body against her inner walls and rubbing his pecker against every inch of it he could. He quickly tossed the thought aside as his logical side took over. He had seen her crush cars with that monstrous pussy of hers. He was better off avoiding it, no matter how much he had grown to care for her. Still, he couldn\u2019t quite shake away the curiosity that had taken root within his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He decided to ignore it for the time being and address a more pressing matter: the painful hardon he now had. He thought of going back to Shenny to tend to it, his body shivering at the prospect of receiving another blowjob from her. His attention shifted back to the glistening stone that Shenny used to get off, his eyes fixated on a drop liquid that ran down the surface. If he really wanted to, he could make use of what she left behind...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher looked over to Shenny, still fast asleep. She'd no doubt be able to help him out with his problem, but after the awe-inspiring display he was more than a little hesitant. If he woke her up from such an intimate dream, there'd be hell to pay, no matter how much she loved him. If he did so because he wanted a blowjob... the hero gulps at the thought. She would probably indulge his earlier urges and stuff him in her snatch straight away for some very rough pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the alternative wasn't much better. If he let her sleep and simply approached her lips with his raging boner there'd be no telling what she'd do. In her dream she was going all out on him. The scent of his little manhood that close to her sensitive nostrils might trigger actions the hero is in no way looking for. Again he might be plunged into her pussy. Even her sleeping maw might not be safe. It could gently suck him off, but in her sleeping state it could just as easily slurp his whole body up. Should that happen, he could only pray the wolfess was just being playful, not hungry. He's sure he doesn't want his lover to wake up discovering she's swallowed him. With Shenny not able to help relieve his urges, he'll have to help himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy scent of her musk was all around him. The large stone was glistening with her release, several large beads of it running down the side. He walked up to the slime-coated spire, impressed that with every step the stench seemed to get even more potent. By the time he neared his prize, the musk was so thick he could almost lean on it. He reached out and stuck both his hands in the large drop of her feminine juices. Immediately he noticed the warmth. He expected the liquid to have cooled, but it felt strangely warm to the touch. Perhaps her release was simply so massive it would take a while for it to cool down. The second thing he noticed was the strange tingling he felt all over his body. It felt like her juices were arousing him more just through skin contact. Though it may well be the ongoing stream of lewd thoughts in his head too. Just glancing over to her sleeping like a baby made his dick throb even more ferociously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two handfuls of the thick slime he went to work on himself. He rubbed it all along the length of his manhood, the stimulating juices quickly making his boner almost painfully erect. Before he'd even started he already felt on the verge of finishing. It wouldn't take much to reach climax and another handful of slime being slowly rubbed against the twitching tip was enough for him to spurt. He grunted, not wanting to cry out lest he wake Shenny, holding on to his manhood as it blew its load. Rope after rope of cum shot from him, adding to the wolfess' slime in the grass. His dick kept going until his balls felt ready to implode. He was certain there wasn't a drop of seed left within him as he stared at his lover. The Pint Puncher wondered if her climax from just a few minutes ago was as epic as the one he just felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero looked at his loins and saw his softening manhood still covered in a thick layer of Shenny's arousal. Only now does he begin to blush, realizing what he'd done to relieve himself. At least no-one had seen him do it. He flew over to the springs and sat on the side. With some difficulty he cleaned the slimy juices off his dick. Probably best the wolfess' doesn't know what he just did. As much as he fantasized about himself inside her pussy, he knew it'd be a lot more painful in reality. Perhaps one day they could find a solution for that. For now he can only think about following Shenny's fine example and resting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passes and the wolfess slowly begins to stir. With an amused smile she feels her boyfriend nestled snugly between her tits. She stares at him amorously, remembering the dream she had. Every vivid detail of their intimate love further awakened her desires. She looks down at her loins and sees the aftermath of her dream. Her thighs are glazed with her juices. Looking out to the clearing she can see the glistening sheen on her favorite rock. With a content smile she carefully sits up. As she sets about cleaning herself in the hot spring her thoughts wander to her boyfriend again. How much of that did he experience too? Was he really asleep between her soft globes all this time. If he wasn't, would he have seen what she did. Would he have heard... Shenny blushes a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is the wolfess' turn to watch over her sleeping partner, ensuring he has pleasant dreams while she dries herself off and walks home. She takes extra care to step softly, letting the hero slumber in her swaying rack. Her path takes her to the outskirts of the city, but as she sees the people turn and run something feels different. Maybe it's because her hunger was sated quite recently. Could it be that all the climaxes the Pint Puncher is bringing her? She doesn't even remotely feel the need to stuff her pussy right now, no matter how easy it might be with these pathetic humans. A bemused smile creeps onto her face as she playfully commands the fleeing people to be silent. Without another word she moves on, heading into the woods. She finally arrives home just in time for a big yawn echoing from her tits. The superhero wakes up in his comfortable cradle and the two stare lovingly at eachother.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Time seemed to stand still as the unlikely lovers gazed in each others eyes. The both of them had went through great changes in such a short amount of time, each of them undergoing some form of awakening. For Pint Puncher, she had brought forth feelings of lust and longing that he never knew dwelled within him. For Shenny, he had tamed the fury and aggression that motivated much of her actions, resulting in a softer, kinder giant. Their relationship was as bizarre as it was sudden, but at that moment it all seemed to click together perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny's warm smile wavered as another thought came to mind. If she was going to spend the rest of her life with her miniscule boyfriend, there were certain things that felt needed to be properly addressed. She cleared her throught as she readied herself to do something had never done before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... sorry for... you know... beating you up...\" she murmured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher stared at her in shock. Had she really changed this much? He would've never thought Shenny to be capable of remorse until that moment. He smiled brightly at her and shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all good. Don't worry about it\" he said with a shrug. Despite the severity of his beating, he couldn't find it in him to hold a grudge against her. The pleasure she had given him in the last few hours pushed aside any negativety that had initally resided within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His response drew a relieved sigh from Shenny, though she didn't really know how to follow up on it. An uncharacteristic shyness washed through her as she bit down on her lip, struggling to think of something to say. Pint Puncher stared up at her curiously, surprised to see her so quiet. He was going to ask what was wrong when it suddenly occurred to him that he was the first and only man she had ever loved. She was just as new to love and relationships as he was and as such, she didn't really know how to approach such a topic. While he shared her inexperience, he wanted to make sure she knew that he would care for her no matter what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He smirked as she motioned for her to lean forward. She blinked and leaned forward, a surprised gasp coming from her as Pint Puncher leaned in and gave her a light peck on the lips. It was a relatively small gesture in comparision to everything else he had done, but it had a tangible effect on her regardless as she felt her heart swell with girlish glee. She blushed brightly as she stared at her boyfriend, her eyes shining with unabashed love for him. It took every ounce of willpower to keep herself from pluck him from where he sat and peppering his body with kisses. She simply smiled laid down beside him, her finger trailing circles along ground as she ground as she eyed his naked body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... such a cute little thing you are...\" she murmured seductively before her hand reached over and gently pulled him in closer. He did nothing to resist as he laid back against her and, his hands folded on his lap as he stared up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I ever wanted to hurt you... it'd be a sin to damage a cutie like you~\" she cooed. Her hand delicately ran up and down his back. Pint Puncher said nothing, though she could tell that she was doing something right as he nuzzled her enormous fingers. It never dawned on Shenny just how handsome the tiny hero was. She had heard other villains comment on his appearance before, but she didn't see him as anything other than another thing to satisfy her pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea how much I love you...\" she said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have a pretty good idea\" Pint Puncher said with a grin. It felt good to finally be open about his blossoming affection towards her instead of fighting against it. There was no two ways about it: he absolutely adored Shenny. Granted, he still intended to try and sway her away from her villainous ways as he was still a hero at heart, but that was bridge they'd cross at a later date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Well, then you MUST know what comes next~\" she cooed as her finger began to snake closer and closer to his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're relentless...\" he laughed sheepishly his dick began to harden in anticipation. His mind thought back to one of the declarations Shenny made upon excepting his offer, that he would only be able to get hard when thinking of her. It seems she wasn't that far from her intended goal as her mere touch was enough to trigger his arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get used to it, loverboy. I'm your girlfriend now, and you know what that mean?\" she asked before pulling him ever closer, her massive maw inches from his face and her hot breath washing over him as she spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means I've got a quota to keep. Every day I'm going to milk you completely dry and leave you cross-eyed and drooling. There won't be a day that goes by where your body doesn't carry my scent...\" she growled huskily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her words held a hint of danger to them, but Pint Puncher couldn't bring himself to care as he trembled from the thought, his cock throbbing with arousal. Shenny's promise was very bold and hyperbolic, but he knew that she was more than capable of following through with it. He had lost count of the amount of times she had brought him to his climax and he had proven that she was capable of doing it indirectly as demonstrated by the hour prior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny giggled at the effect her dirty talk had on him before her mind went to their potential future. She envisioned them living peacefully in the forest, far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. With him around she really didn't have much reason to muck around their anymore. Besides, he no doubt would have reservations with being with someone who would case harm to innocent people. She was fine with making that compromise for the sake of the man who brought her so much happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All that said, there was one bridge they needed to cross in order to reach that point, the one that had been at the forefront of their relationship: she needed to get him to willfully service her pussy. If she could get him to reach that point of his own volition, it would forever cement their status as a couple. She looked down at her lover and sighed inwardly as she thought about how to approach the topic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pint Puncher? Can I ask you something personal?\" she began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire away\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like my body, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously\" he said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you thought about... you know... down there...?\" she askex hesitantly as her gaze shift down to her crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher's smile faltered as he followed her gaze, a lump appearing in his throught as he stared at her naked crotch. Different emotions washed over him as he struggled to think of an answer that'd satisfy her. He was tempted to admit to his fantasies, though he had no idea whether he'd survive any attempts to endulge them. He thought back to when he used her secretions to get off and the aphrodisiac effect it had on his body. He could only imagine how grand it would feel being completely soaked it while it was fresh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe... maybe it wouldn't be that bad... Shenny wouldn't let anything bad happen to me...</i> he thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After mulling it over for several minutes... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher agonized over it for minutes, but after seeing Shenny's concerned stare he finally relented. If she wanted to be close to him she should know his feelings on the matter. The wolfess had surprised him before with her gentleness, he could only hope for the same now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Shenny, I won't lie to you. A part of me really wants to feel what it's like. You know, to be fully immersed in your love like that. But I'm scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened. Not even after her heaviest pummelings had she ever seen fear in the hero. But here he was, quietly admitting his weakness to her. She tried to comfort him, holding him close to her soft bosom. Whether it worked she didn't know, but at the least it prompted the hero to elaborate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how driven you are by your urges, especially down there. I'm just afraid that if I go in... I won't come out. Not even because you tricked me or something. But simply because you cannot fight the overwhelming desire to keep me in there. I think it'd be a great experience, but I can't have it be my last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny was touched by his honesty, but a pang of irritation flashed by. Did he doubt her self-control? Her pride felt wounded, but she had to concede he wasn't exactly wrong. Just in the last 24 hours she'd stuffed a man inside of herself and her nethers went so wild on him he perished in her depths. The memory alone sent a wave of heat through her. She couldn't let that happen to her boyfriend. But what if he was right? What if, when the time comes, she cannot contain her lust? Her sexy superhero boyfriend didn't exactly make it hard for her to feel lustful. It would take an iron will to pull him back out again once he was in. But if there's anyone on the planet that deserved her commitment and willpower, it was the Pint Puncher. In her best soothing voice she whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I know you've been in there under less friendly circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought back on the various fights he'd had with her. More than once had she managed to shove him into her pussy. But every time he powered through, pushing his way back out. He knew firsthand the immense crushing power her loins could bring to bear to constrain anyone trapped inside. He snapped back to reality, seeing the wolfess patiently waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand you might feel nervous. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit nervous too. Normally all I think about is how to keep that heavenly feeling in. To have my victim squirming for my pleasure. But you changed that. Now, all I want to think about is feeling you squirm with pleasure inside of me. Again and again I want to feel it. So believe me when I say I'm entirely committed to making sure you get out. My desire to have you in my pussy is nothing compared to my desire to have you in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher breathed a big sigh of relief. At least for now she didn't intend on using any force to get her way as he feared. Her determination was inspiring, fueling the hero's own bravado. Surely if the titanic wolfess could overcome these doubts, so could he. Slowly he peered down between her legs. From down there the thick stench of her musk rose up. It tickled his nose and made the hero feel strange. In spite of all his doubts and fears he felt an unmistakable attraction. Shenny noticed the hero's fixed gaze and pulled him away from her chest to speak to him eye to eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to be closer to it? Get comfortable around it maybe?\" He nodded and her gentle grasp carried him between her legs. Before him stood his final challenge. He was already pretty much Shenny's boyfriend, even if the 24 hours hadn't passed yet. But this final step could tame her sexual urges completely. She'd no longer pose any danger to the city and its inhabitants. Living here, deep in the forest, where she couldn't hurt a fly seemed like an outcome too good to be true. Would he still have time to save the city from other supervillains? Would she understand if he left for a little while to save the day? Would she be willing to join him in the hero business?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirks a little at the last one, picturing the huge wolfess in a spandex suit. Petty crime would fall overnight as she threatened to stuff all the muggers and vandals in her snatch so she could deliver them to the police. Slime-soaked criminals confessing their guts out lest they'd be given back to her for more in-depth interrogation. On the whole it was probably better if she didn't try to help the city. The collateral damage from her size alone would probably render her efforts meaningless. That, and he's not so sure the citizens would forgive her so easily for all those people that were abused or killed during her many rampages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith composed patience she sits up a little and spreads her legs, allowing the hero to see inside. A long dark tunnel, roomy enough for two and leading deep into the wolfess. The whole mound of the wolfess was glistening with her arousal, eagerly anticipating the guest of honour. The hero's legs shake, seeing the pleasure portal in front of him. Now that he had time to look at it he had to admit a certain attraction to it. Like a moth to a flame the hero got closer, the powerful musk getting ever more potent. Soon the shimmering lower lips were within arm's reach. How does he start this intimate interaction?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Pint Puncher tried to think of the best way to approach such a delicate matter as he knew that his personal safety was on the line. Common sense would dictate that he start of slow, teasing her nethers and and building up to his complete immersion into her heavenly folds. The trouble came in actually following through with it. As much as they talked about Shenny's self-control (or lack thereof), he found himself struggling to reign in his own desires. Her feminine musk reached deep into his brain and took hold of his senses, dominating his sense of self-preservation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As his cation gradually began to erode into nothing, he made a b-line for her drooling love tunnel, his eyes glazed over and his mouth watering in anticipation. Shenny was stunned by his by his boldness and was about to tell him to be careful before her thoughts were thrown into complete disarray. Her brave little boyfriend, without any ceremony or buildup, plunged into the depths of her womanhood. Shenny\u2019s eyes shot open and her mouth was agape in a silent scream. She had dreamed of this moment for so long and now that it had finally come to pass, it was better than she could\u2019ve possibly imagined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The lovestruck hero didn\u2019t regret his decision in the slightest as he pressed his body against the slick walls of her cavernous pussy, his senses going wilds and he humped and licked the surface. After he had previously used her feminine juices to get off, he had a general idea of the effect it would have on his body, but his expectations paled in comparison to the actual thing. Her fresh juices were hot to the touch, their aphrodisiac effects much more prominent now that he was at the source. The scent that once used to make his nose curl in disgust was now the most intoxicating aroma he had ever had the pleasure of smelling. A sliver of the slimy substance had gotten into his mouth as he dived in and after that, he was determined to sample as much of it as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As her inner walls squeezed against him in a vice like grip, Puncher could do nothing but smile as he gave in to experience. Why on earth did he delay this for so long? Shenny\u2019s womanhood was a treasure trove of delights, providing him with pleasure that he would\u2019ve never previously thought impossible. He felt foolish for not only putting it off, but for even resisting the giant wolfess when they had once been foes. If he had known that her snatch was this heavenly he would\u2019ve gladly submitted to her then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His eyes rolled in the back of his head as he came to an explosive climax, his seed getting washed away by her feminine fluids. It would be the first of many as he continued to grind his still erect dick against the wall before him. The slime that now coated his body had affected his libido as well, making the hero unbearably horny, but that was only a partial explanation as to his extreme enthusiasm. He was also driven by his immense love for the former villain, a feeling of unmatched gratitude washing over him as her pussy gnawed on its willing captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His actions had a clear effect of Shenny as she sat with her eyes glazed over and her tongue hanging out, a chorus of gasp and moans escaping from her lips as her fingers clutched the grass beneath her. She had shoved so many different things into her snatch, ranging from people, to cars, to small trees, but none of them could bring her the amount of satisfaction that Pint Puncher could. She could feel his swollen prick jabbing along the sensitive walls of her pussy, his rouge tongue lapping up her juices as he worshipped her from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-oh god\u2026 yes! I love you\u2026 so much\u2026! Fuck me, Pint Puncher...!\u201d She screamed as she groped her hefty bosom, twerking her nipples with her fingers. He had apparently heard her and was happy to oblige, increasing the speed of his movement twofold and forcing a whimper out of Shenny. Tears began to stream down her cheeks, stemming both from the overwhelming pleasure and the intense love that swelled within her. She had once overheard someone claim that there was a distinct difference between having sex and making love, a notion she scoffed at before she had deposited the poor sod into her hungry pussy. Now she understood what he meant perfectly. In spite of their considerable size difference, it didn\u2019t feel like she was having her pussy serviced by a loyal servant, as was her initial plan for their relationship. It felt as though she were making love to her amazing boyfriend, her mind racked with joy as he was given full reign to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon enough, Shenny began to approach the moment she was waiting for. She bit down on her bottom lip and groaned as her vaginal muscles squeezed her boyfriend tightly, prepping her for what has to come. She let out a roar of euphoric joy that echoed throughout the land as she finally reached the best orgasm she had ever had, her pussy letting loose a torrent of liquid as her body shook from the sensation. Her secretions completely coated the ground beneath her, spreading out a great distance and threatening to completely envelop the forest in a haze of her potent musk. As she basked in the afterglow of what had just taken place, her mind went to her lover. A wave of concern washed over her as she looked down at her crotch to find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still basking in the afterglow of some of the most mindblowing pleasure she'd ever experienced, the wolfess looked to her lover. He needed to be heaped with praise and kisses. The prodigious puddle of her arousal was impressive to look at, a testament to his skill at bringing her joy like no other. But amidst all the slime there was no sign of the hero. Immediately her eyes shot wide open, her heart skipping a beat. She couldn't have... he was far too tough for that. Her pussy shouldn't be able to break him down so fast, even with the pleasure he provided. A wave of sorrow came over her, fearing the worst had happened. But before the floodgates could open she felt something familiar. A tiny hand rubbing the inside of her love tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy! You're alive! I was scared half to death you'd become a part of my orgasm!\" She exclaimed ecstatically. He might've responded, but from inside of her not a word could escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher smiled broadly, feeling the tense body all around him calm down once more. Hearing her panic like that was strangely adorable. As if her pussy could get rid of him so easily. This wasn't his first time in here and he'd escaped just fine before. This was however the first time he didn't really mind being in here. Rational thought was a challenge inside of the sopping wet snatch. Her musk was slathered all over his body. He would have difficulty smelling anything else for the foreseeable future. The walls bore down on him, embracing the hero in their slimy folds before relenting to let him breathe more easily. Had he not just been pelted with a torrent of her arousal he would say the slavering pussy was ready to climax any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a fuss he used to make over absolutely nothing. The overwhelming embrace of her nethers was so delightful, smothering him in her most intimate place. If only he knew this was the only thing he'd ever been afraid of. He could've saved the day just by diving in here and letting her inner walls provide him the most thorough massage he could imagine. The slime-soaked hero kept daydreaming as his surroundings got more active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny could feel him squirming around in there. If he was panicking, this was the most laid back escape attempt she'd ever felt. Slowly it dawned on her that he might be either too dazed by their epic sexy times or simply unable to find the exit. Her fingers scurried down to her crotch and began massaging the wet flesh. Slowly she slipped her index finger deeper between the moist lips and before long she was probing her own love tunnel. Carefully she advanced, feeling herself get closer to the hero. Her deepest urges pushed her to keep him inside, but her will was stronger. She wanted the Pint Puncher out of her snatch, so she could feel him go back in later. She reached in until she felt his arm brush against her fingertip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting you out, Puncher. Grab my finger!\" She ordered. The hero began to realize that with him not putting in any effort to escape the wolfess might be concerned. He did admit to her he was afraid to be stuck in here much like he was now. He felt the large finger rub against his hands, prying in a little deeper to poke his head. He cleaned his hands as best he could and grabbed the digit, twisting it a little to indicate he was ready to go. Slowly it drew him back out, the walls trying to clamp down and hold him but the wolfess being far stronger. Daylight pierced the entrance and before long he was being pulled out. When only his legs were still left inside he and Shenny exchanged glances. The desire they saw in eachother's eyes was palpable. Shenny was the first to mutter what they were both thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... wanna go again?\" She asks, a little uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fresh air around him was still heavy with her musk, but not nearly as overwhelming as the inside of her pleasure cavern. It gave the Pint Puncher some time to think. He didn't really mind another dip into her pussy. But right away? Maybe they shouldn't rush such a good thing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> An awkward silence hung in the air as the two stared at each other. Shenny could see the confliction on his face, his sex-addled brain weighing down his sound judgement. She didn't bother to wait for his answer before she let out a sigh and gently plucked him out of her dripping snatch. Puncher groaned his disappointment as he was lifted into her palm, his body already longing to be enveloped by her glorious pussy once more. Shenny giggled at his reaction and gave him a gentle pat on the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have all the time in the world to go back in, lover. I don't want you becoming addicted to it though. Otherwise I'd probably never get to see your handsome face~\" she joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher smiled sheepishly as he looked the other way. There was some truth in what she said. As he was being fished out of her tightening vag, he had found himself reluctant to part with it. While his fear of being crushed to death by her slick inner walls had been conquered, he now had to master his ability to reign himself in when necessary. While the idea was tempting, he knew that Shenny wouldn't want him laying inside her 24/7, not when there were so many other parts of her body to be worshipped and enjoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero laughed closed his eyes as he sat in her palm, utterly drenched in her juices. He began to reflect on everything that had lead him to this moment, all that he had been through in such a short amount of time. His past battles with Shenny seemed so quaint and pointless in hindsight, especially considering how easy it was to tame the emotional wolfess. She wasn't simply an evil tyrant with an insatiable libido; she was a lonely woman who was in desperate need for a companion. Thankfully, Pint Puncher more than happy to fulfill that role. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Shenny asked softly, her voice hinting concern as she waited for him to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than alright. I feel... different. In a good way. I can't really explain it...\" Puncher said as looked up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny smiled and nodded. She understood his feelings perfectly. Now that they had finally cleared the ever present hurdle in their relationship, she felt much more at peace. She could see this sentiment reflected in her boyfriend's expression as he looked at her an almost zen-like calmness. It wasn't hard for her to grasp how this change came about. They had given into each other completely and as such, were no longer plagued with fear or doubt as to their future together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Punchy,\" Shenny began as a thought came to mind. \"Did you have something planned for when the twenty four hours were up? Like, to defeat me or escape something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, not really. Once the blood moon had finally ended and your powerup ended, I was just gonna wing it and see if I could beat you in a rematch\" Pint Puncher said nonchalantly. He saw no reason to keep his plan under wraps anymore. It's not like he intended to go through with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In hindsight, that was a pretty stupid idea. Powerup or no, you'd still have beaten the snot out of me\" he said with a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sell yourself short! You're <i>the</i> Pint Puncher, after all. Besides, it's not like you haven't beaten me before. Like, remember that time me and Tiffany teamed up to fight you and <i>still</i> won?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher grinned as the memory came flooding back to him. The gargantuan duo had teamed up to defeat him, using their immense size and impeccable teamwork to kick his spandex-cladded rear end all over the city. All seemed lost when they lifted his body out of the debris and began to press their massive butts together with him sandwiched in the middle. Thinking quickly, Pint Puncher cut a hole through Tiffany's panties and after powering from out between her sweltering cheeks, managed to free himself by flying from out her buttcrack. Defeating them afterwards was a simple as blaming the damage to Tiffany's panties on Shenny pushing him too hard, which lead to a brutal fist fight between the rat and the wolfess while Pint Puncher watched on in amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that was just dumb luck. Tiffany's never been the thinking type, so of course she'd just believe me right off the bat\" Pint Puncher said with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True... but still, you shouldn't downplay your skills like that. You're still the toughest little guy I've ever tangled with\" she said with a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Truly, this was a different woman from the one Pint Puncher had fought yesterday. He never took Shenny for the modest type, though his status as her boyfriend might've had something to do with that. She flashed him a toothy grin, her eyes narrowing as she leered down at him playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you start getting soft on me, loverboy. Big Bad Shenny could flip the evil switch when you least expect it. You wouldn't want to end up plastered on my foot again, would you...?\" she growled with over-exaggerated menace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Punched laughed in response, but what caught Shenny's attention was how his cock twitched at her faux-threat. She thought she was just imagining things, but continued with her over-the-top villain monologue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be your girlfriend, but that doesn't mean I'll be miss nicey-nice. Maybe I'll chew you up and floss my toes with your flattened body again. Maybe I'll shove you up my ass and just leave you there all day? Hell, maybe I'll just stomp you until your little body is nothing more than a tattoo at the ball of my foot. You can ever sleep on me, my cute little boyfriend...\" she said with a snicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her words were in complete jest, as she cared too deeply for her lover to even think of harming him. That's partially why Pint Puncher's reaction confused her so much as he looked away from her with a strained smile, his dick standing fully erect and throbbing once Moreno . Could it be that his time spent with her had turned him into a bit of a masochist? Her mind went back to the last time she had \"punished\" him and the wide grin that had been on his face as she continuously brought her giant breasts down onto his body. She didn't think much of it at the time, but it made some bit of sense in hindsight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Seeing the clear discomfort on his face, Shenny decided to... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shenny's grin grew along with the uncomfortable smirk on her lover's face. Her threats seemed to resonate with him, or at least with his dick. But she can imagine that the pain that came with her trouncing him before their date might temper any enthusiasm. Through perhaps funniest of all was him not picking up on her giggly voice and barely contained laughs at the silliness of her words. She pitied the little guy, picking him up and holding him close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do whatever it takes to make you happy, boyfriend.\" She whispered softly. Her large finger brushed by his still hard manhood. \"Even if that's sitting on you.\" She added with a smile, making the hero blush. The Pint Puncher wasn't sure what aroused him about having the wolfess squash him flat. Maybe he'd been flattened by too many butts, bellies and bodies in his career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than ever did he wish she would be able to join him. Just for once seeing villains like Helen or Borris get flattened beneath Shenny's feet would be a delight. He could already picture the dumbfounded look on their faces. Villains closer to his size might even get the surprise of a lifetime as she stuffs them in her snatch. Though the number of cars and pedestrians she might step on when tiptoeing along the road would not make it worth it, but really only by a small margin. Maybe one day he could tempt a supervillain to fight him outside the city, where Shenny could assist him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden wetness interrupted his thoughts. The wolfess had brought him close to her face and planted a big kiss on the side of his head. Gently she slurped and lapped her arousal off him. Her big tongue tickled him as it cleaned up the viscous goop coating his body. Her piercing musk was replaced with smelly saliva, but on the whole it was a step up. Things got even better when she revealed how she was going to dry him off. With little ceremony she shoved him between her fuzzy globes. Shenny ground her boobs together, slowly working the hero deeper between them until he started popping out underneath. She quickly plucked him out again, now mostly dry and smiling from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better.\" Shenny brought the Pint Puncher close to her face again and sniffed loudly. \"My my, aren't you smelling handsome now.\" He might think he smelled a little vague at the moment, but the wolfess' sensitive nose was embraced by a heavenly mix of her musk with undertones of her saliva. The hero blushed, patting the big nose gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently his pats were a bit too gently because the wolfess scrunched up her face. For a moment the Pint Puncher feared he'd upset her, but her loud inhale made things clear. \"Aaaah... aaah... aaaah...\" He wanted to fly clear of the sneezing wolfess but reflexively she grabbed hold of him. He was held tightly in front of her face as she closed her eyes, desperately trying to stop herself. He braced for impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"aaaahCHOO\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA storm of snot and hot air surged past him, soaking the hero's head. If there was one upside to her holding him firmly it's that her fingers stopped his body from being pelted with gunk too. He is sure half the city would've heard a sneeze that loud, though his perception might be skewed by experiencing it at point blank range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know what came over me.\" Shenny sputtered, blushing brightly. Before the hero could answer he was surrounded by her soft lips as she suckled his head, removing any evidence of the incident. \"There, all better.\" She said, still feeling a bit awkward about the whole situation. She was so used to dominating him with her size, she didn't even think twice about sneezing on him. The wolfess opened her hand, gesturing for the hero to fly up for a moment so she could wipe it clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher saw her fidgeting awkwardly. He wanted to calm her down and he knew exactly how. Confidently her flew up to her head, carefully landing next to her big ears. The moment he laid a hand on them she sighed deeply. She sat back, the hero holding on to the large ear. \"There... it's all good now.\" Soon she was murring with delight as he gently rubbed the large ear. He needed her at her calmest, because he knew the next question he had for her might cause her to get emotional. As much as he enjoyed her company, there was still a city out there in need of a superhero. He couldn't stay here forever, as much as he might want to. With the haze of her musk fading from his brain his sense of duty stood unscathed. Any moment the city didn't need his help he would spend in Shenny's embrace, caring for and exploring her enormous body. But how would she react to this? He swallowed the lump in his throat and softly spoke into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenny, I love you more than anything in this whole wide world. But there's a city out there that needs their superhero. Now I can tell you from experience it's far from a full-time job. And every second I'm not needed I want to be here with you, making you happy. Would you be okay with me flying off from time to time to save the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny's pleased murring fell silent.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shenny's face tensed as she processed the weight of his request. It didn't really surprise her. Pint Puncher's extreme altruism was his most defining trait and it was foolish for her to think that he's put aside his chosen profession just to be with her. She couldn't help feel a small tinge of hurt regardless, as his desire to be a hero flew in the face of her vision of the future, with them spending the rest of their days cut off from the world outside of her forest. Seeing displeasure on his face, Pint Puncher continued to caress her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not trying to upset or hurt you. You know that I would never dream of doing that\" he said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know...\" she murmured as she sat with her arms crossed and her legs folded. An ear massage wouldn't be enough to appease her this time around, though she appreciated the effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've invested a lot of time into protecting the city. It just feels wrong to throw it all away just like that. Those people depend on me, Shenny. And while I'd love to spend every waking moment with you, I can't do it with a clear conscience knowing that someone is getting hurt because of my lack of action\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny said nothing as she stared at the ground. While she had become much more kind and considerate since they had gotten together, she still fought against her old selfish tendencies from time to time. She knew that he was just in his desire to be a hero, but her inner brat turned her nose at the idea. She had become used to having him around her at all times and after having been exposed to such unconditional love, she wasn't sure if she could bare to part with him for even a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenny?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The wolfess was brought out of her daze as Pint Puncher looked at her with concern in his eyes. She could feel just how badly he wanted her approval and for a moment she felt her mental barrier begin to break down. So he'll have to spend a few hours away from home. What was the big deal? It's not like he'd be gone forever. The more she thought about it, the more she began to warm up to the idea. Their relationship wouldn't be unlike that of a married couple. Every morning would start off with her giving him a nice helping of milk before seeing him off to his superhero duties. He'd return later in the day, they'd take a dip in the spring before capping the night off with a bout of passionate lovemaking. Her face lit up at the very thought of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was then that another concern came to mind, making her smile leave just as quickly as it had arrived. It all sounded so simple, but there was one glaring flaw in her vision. After feeding her beloved, she wouldn't be sending him off to some sort of menial office job as would be the case if they were a normal couple. She'd be sending him him off into a city full of all manner of violent, perverted and sadistic villains that wouldn't hesitate to do away with him for good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm sorry, but... no\" Shenny said as her hands clenched tightly onto her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why? I just need to step away for a few hours each day and then I'll be back to worship your body all night long~\" the hero cooed gently into her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just it! What if you go and don't come back?!\" Shenny snapped suddenly, making Pint Puncher jump back in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just yesterday you and I were duking it out in the middle of the city\u2026 do you remember how well that turned out for you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher didn\u2019t need to be reminded of the one-sided beatdown he received from her. He could still remember being ground up by her monsterous molars and being crushed beneath her foot. That sort of thing was hard to forget. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have any idea what I intended to do to you after I beat you? Do you have even the slightest clue how lucky we both were when I hatched my stupid plan to enslave you? Had the thought never came to my mind, you wouldn\u2019t be here!\u201d Shenny fumed, her face flushed with a mixture of irritation and embarrassment she felt no pride in the type of person she had been in the past and it showed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShenny, it\u2019s fine! That\u2019s all in the past now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you get it?! There are a city full of bad guys that all want to do what I had originally planned! They want to stomp you, eat you, crush you, hypnotise you\u2026 hurt you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her rant petered out as she reached the last point, tears beginning to stream down her face. The angry expression on her face became one of overwhelming fear and sorrow as she looked down at her bewildered love who had climbed off her head to better look her in the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t let that happen, Punchy! I just can\u2019t! You\u2019re the only man I\u2019ve ever loved! If you were to get hurt, I\u2026 I\u2019d\u2026\u201d her words were cut off as she buried her face into her hands and sobbed quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher had become racked with guilt for the pain he had unintentionally brought onto his lover. Her concerns were entirely unfounded as there had been many a time where he was certain that his life would end while on the job. Her example rung true, as he remembered thinking that she would snuff him out or toss him aside once she was done decimating his broken body. The series of events that lead up to their union had been born of sheer luck, a fact that he was just now starting to realize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he gently patted her on the cheek to try and calm her down, there was only solution he could think of\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The citizens could count themselves lucky. They may soon have two superheroes looking after them, even if one might be a little less modest. Cautiously, he spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... what if you came with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny looked up, her eyes still full of anguish, but with a discernible flair of bemusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Become a superhero and help me rid the city of these villains!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all seemed to be going so fast. Just yesterday she was beating him within an inch of his life because he was a superhero, always messing with her plans. And now he thought she could be one too? Words failed her as she pondered, muttering incoherently to herself. The Pint Puncher seized on the moment and began selling her the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can use that enormous body and matching strength to pummel anyone that might harm me into submission. I'll try to lure them out of town and you can give them the beating of a lifetime. The people might have some issues with you at first, but save their lives a couple of times and you'll be surprised how quickly they change their tune. When they get a chance to look at your gorgeous body as you punch the stuffing out of a villain they'll come around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny liked the idea of being cheered on for ridding the city of some villains. She had more than a few outstanding grudges, and to be rewarded for settling them seemed almost too good to be true. But would people really stop hating her? She didn't even want to think about how many of them had gone into her pussy and how some of them hadn't come out. She'd done terrible things to a lot of people, all to satisfy her basest urges. Did the puncher really think they could forgive her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if they don't, that's their loss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to be thoroughly convinced. The wolfess wiped away her tears, thinking on his proposal. She had thought about making the hero worship her as a slave before all of this. Now the city folk might worship her as a saviour. Doubt hung heavy in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. It's all going so fast. Can't you just stay here with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I can't do that, Shenny. Those people need me... they need us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've caused so much pain to them, what if they don't approve of you forgiving me... What if they demand you lock me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once the Pint Puncher felt shocked and irritated. Did she really think he would do that? He managed to steer her away from her villainous ways practically overnight. If that wasn't good enough for the city then they could fend for themselves. Those citizens might be his duty, but that doesn't mean he has to neglect his own personal needs. And his need for Shenny was almost immeasurable. He flew down to her muzzle and looked her square in her big eyes. He honestly didn't want things to ever go that far, but if it did, he knew exactly where he stood. Side by side with his lover. Slowly and commandingly he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then they can all get bent. They'll accept the both of us or they can deal with having neither of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis persistence was inspiring. More and more the wolfess began to warm up to the idea of being a superhero. He made it sound a lot like it would just be her beating up supervillains. She already did that in her spare time. It couldn't hurt to try, right? She'd be nearby if her boyfriend ever was in danger, and woe betide the villain that might put him in danger. Though for the city's sake he'd better be in trouble somewhere near the outskirts. Because if she needed to save him, there was no amount of trampled buildings and people that would stop her from charging in. There was one last amusing little thing still bugging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Punchy, I'm sorta willing to try this. But...\" The hero gulped. \"I'm not wearing any spandex!\" He paused for a moment, not quite parsing what she just said. He'd been so tense about this whole situation her joke went right over his head. The wolfess pitied him, gently grabbing him off her muzzle and hugging him tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright.\" He awkwardly mutters. \"It'd be a sin to hide your beauty anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither party could predict how this would end up going, but their shared sense of adventure led them onto this path together. They huddled close together and mused back and forth for hours, imagining tall tales about their heroic deeds. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The couple's merrymaking was undercut by a bright light flashing in the distance, drawing their attention to the city. Shenny's sensitive canine ears twitched twice as she picked up on a sound that she was very much familiar with: the sound of people screaming in peril. Her eyes darted down to Pint Puncher, though he didn't need to be told what was happening. He stared at the city with an ironclad focus that she hadn't since the last time they had butted heads. In a show of extreme confidence, Shenny shot up to her feet and clenched her fist tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They need us Pint Puncher! There\u2019s trouble in Glam City and it's up to Pint Puncher and his trusty sidekick to save the day!\" she said boldly, her speech coming off slightly stilted as she attempted to make her voice as \"heroic\" as possible. She had intended to inspire her boyfriend with her enthusiasm, but quickly felt embarrassed with herself when she looked down at the bemused smirk on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I thought I'd... you know... try getting into character...\" she said as she twiddled her thumbs shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her tiny lover laughed and shook his head. It never ceased to amaze her how the lumbering giant could come off as both a intimidating and adorable at the same time. He walked over to her foot and gave it a reassuring pat as he smiled up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to work on the theatrics. For now, we've got a job to do\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Shenny smiled brightly and nodded as she turned to make b-line for the city. The self-doubt that had been dogging her had been momentarily pushed aside to make room for overwhelming optimism. Regardless of how everything went, she found a surprising amount of joy in being able to tag along with her lover, fighting alongside him as they worked to protect the city. While it wasn't quite what she had in mind for their relationship, she was far from disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Aren't you forgetting something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The eager wolfess blinked and turned around to see that her loving hadn't moved from his spot. He stood with his hands on his hips, a wry smile on his face as he looked up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna leave without me, are you?\" he asked in mock offense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can fly, can't you?\" Shenny asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. We both know there's only one way for me to travel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny stood unsure of what he was hinting at, though the perverted smile on his face made it easy for her to connect the dots. With an exaggerated sigh she knelt down and scooped up his tiny body before depositing him into her cleavage with his upper body poking out from the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get too comfortable with this, mister. I don\u2019t need you getting all doughy and out of shape because of me\u201d she scolded playfully as she rubbed the top of his head with her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher simply smiled in response as he leaned back against her chest, his arms reclining on either side of her breasts as though they were armrests. He wanted to hold on to this moment of togetherness before the real challenge began. He was confident in their ability to dispatch of whatever threat awaited them. That wasn\u2019t what worried him though. Shenny\u2019s skepticism was entirely justified considering how much damage she had caused in the past. He fully intended to stand by her regardless of the outcome, but it wouldn\u2019t be easy for him to part ways from the place that he had once called home. He could only hope that the citizens could find it in their hearts to forgive his giant lover, although he couldn\u2019t really hold it against them if they refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Punchy\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The hero glanced up to see her smiling down at him. If there were any doubts left in her mind, she didn\u2019t certainly didn\u2019t let them show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince we\u2019re going back into the city, shouldn\u2019t you have your mask on?\u201d she asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher blinked and brought his hands to his face. With all the excitement distracting him, he forgot all about his mask. This sudden realization brought about another one as he also recalled how his previous battle with Shenny had destroyed his costume, leaving him stark naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour clothes got ripped up, but I made sure to keep your mask safe\u201d Shenny said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Wow, good looking out!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n His gratitude was slightly lessened once he saw where she\u2019d been storing his mask. Her reached behind her and fished his mask out from between her furry cheeks. Pint Puncher\u2019s nose crinkled as she placed it into her hands. It didn\u2019t smell quite as bad as he had expected, but it still carried a faint amount of mustiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 thanks\u2026\u201d he muttered before slipping it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His displeasure completely went over the giddy wolfess\u2019 head  as she flashed him a bright smile and turned her attention back to their destination. Her expression intensified and soon Puncher\u2019s ride became much more rough as she took off sprinting, her enormous breasts bouncing with each earthshaking step she took. Her past trips to civilization had usually been done by a brisk walk but she knew that she couldn\u2019t afford to waste time. Plus, she was eager to get start in her exciting new character as a superhero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Even with great strides she took, it took her a decent amount of time to reach the city limits. She had worked up a decent sweat from her run, her chest heaving as she panted from the exertion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, here we are. Time to go bust some heads, Punchy! ...Punchy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She looked down at her boobs and cringed. The only part of her boyfriend that she could see was his limp fingers sticking out from her cleavage. She quickly parted her breasts and hosted him out from his sweaty prison. His body was damp with her sweat, though he didn\u2019t seemed to be all that fettered by what he had just been through. It wasn\u2019t hard for her to see why, as a she could see a sliver of cum trailing from her cleavage to his now flaccid cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Of all the times for it to happen, it had to happen now?\u201d she said as she struggled to keep from laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s not my fault I slipped in!\u201d Pint Puncher said with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you say, loverboy\u2026\u201d she said as she lowered him down to the ground. \u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like we talked about before. I go in, find the troublemaker, then lure them out here where we both can slap some sense into them\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny nodded, though there was a noticeable amount of uncertainty in her eyes. It had just occurred to her that their plan required him to face the danger on his own for a while. There was was no guarantee that he\u2019d be able to fly back out of the city after he had gotten the attention of the villain he was attempting to bait. Maybe they\u2019d incapacite him in such a way that he couldn\u2019t escape at all. Pint Puncher was quick to pick up on the growing concern on her face and decided to address it right away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. I know you\u2019re worried about me. I\u2019m more than a little worried too\u2026 but we have to power through had hope for the best\u201d Pint Puncher said before flying up and patting her on the muzzle. \u201cIf it seems like I\u2019m taking too long, feel free to come looking for me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny smiled and nodded once again before taking her tiny boyfriend into her hands and giving him a quick kiss for luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026 be careful. And make sure not to rough them up too bad. I want them to have a little fight in them before I introduce them to the bottom of my foot\u201d she said with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher returned her smirk and nodded before flying off into the city with a renewed sense of vigor. His eyes narrowed with focus as he scanned the area for any sign of trouble. The streets had been cleared, no doubt due in part to the destruction wrought during the blood moon. It didn\u2019t take him long before something finally happened\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A shriek echoed from a nearby supermarket. The unmistakable sound of a villain up to no good. The Pint Puncher shot towards it but decided against his usual dramatic entrance. If he cocked this up Shenny would have to rescue him. And if he wanted her to make a good impression as a hero, trampling half the town to get to him probably wasn't the best way to go about it. He needed to be extra certain he wasn't running into any traps here. Thankfully he could calm down a little when he heard the voice of the villain in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be like that. I'm sure we can get along. Just think of it as a bit of light sparring. And if you win, you can eat me too you know. I'm not that evil.\" Insincerity dripped of his words as Derek jokingly offered a fair fight with whomever he might have cornered. The lion was a dangerous wrestler, but not too bright. His ability to stink up the place and customize his smell to match any smell he's ever encountered was terrifying. Especially since he's met a fair few of the smellier villains in town. He wouldn't hesitate to unleash all their stenches combined on his hapless victim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully the Pint Puncher stalked the aisles until he saw the lion, standing tall over a cowering woman. He was salivating madly, drool leaking onto her. He was already looking forward to swallowing her whole after defeating her in a fight. Before he could lay a finger on her the superhero set his plan into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Pick on someone your own size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Pint Puncher! You volunteering to be the main course?\" His smile grew and he turned to his victim briefly. \"Sorry, looks like you're demoted to dessert. Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.\" He faced the hero once more, stomping towards him. Derek looking imposingly strong, but the hero had no plans to fight him here and now. He just needed to make sure the lion would be so angry with him he'd have no choice but to give chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero flew towards his nemesis, ready to strike. But this wasn't his usual punching. Before Derek could adapt a loud thwack rang across the supermarket. \"What the hell...\" He growled, holding his cheek. The short fur obscured the bright red handprint in his skin. \"Did you just... slap me?!\" The lion huffed and snorted. He'd never been disrespected by an opponent like this. Even the humans he subdued threw more of a punch than that. If this little shit thinks he can just mock him like that, he was in for a very rude and extremely smelly awakening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you gonna do about it, second-rate wrestler?\" The Pint Puncher taunted before flying off. The supervillain shot from a little angry right into blinding rage. Nobody, and he means NOBODY gets to call him that and walk away unscathed. He was going to crush and humiliate this little hero as publicly as he could. When he was done, the hero wouldn't be able to show his face anywhere anymore. He would beg the lion to end it all. And Derek would deny him, just so he could bury him in stench over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero soared through the streets, flying a little slower than usual so his pursuer could keep track of him. He heard the heavy thuds of the lion's steps as they gained on him slowly. But by the time Derek had gotten anywhere near the hero they were out of town. The plan had worked perfectly and towering before the two was Shenny. A diabolical grin adorned her face as she raised her foot. The Pint Puncher held his arms up and cowered before her, pretending to be deathly afraid of her impending stomp. She caught on quickly and stared him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek might've been fuming mad, but he wasn't dumb enough to interfere here. He knew better than to get between Shenny and her prey. She'd stomp the both of them in a heartbeat. He smirks at the Pint Puncher's predicament. If Shenny didn't take him, the hero's freshly flattened body was going to have to endure him too. Maybe he'd even mimic her piercing musk or butt-smell. Just to rub it in a little more how completely she was about to destroy him. He looked in awe at the foot coming down. But why was she leaning forward so much? Did she want her full weight behind it? If she didn't adjust herself she was going to miss the hero. That large sole was beginning to get real close to him now. Oh crap...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>THOOM!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth shook a little as Shenny slammed down her foot atop the lion. He might've been almost twice the Pint Puncher's size, it didn't matter. He vanished almost completely beneath her paw, only an outstretched hand still visible on either side. Not content with a simple step, she grinds her foot back and forth, pressing down even harder on the supervillain. Being heroic felt remarkably similar to her beating up other villains that were in her way regularly. Though she could imagine the Puncher probably not enjoying the sensation of Derek under her foot as much if he were the one doing the stomping. When she was certain she'd flattened her target enough she lifted her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek almost came up with her, his sweaty body clinging to her sole. Thankfully gravity set in and he peeled himself free. What had he done to earn this? Was Shenny still upset with him about something? Her expression seemed so calm. And why isn't she also stomping on that pesky hero? She hated the very sight of him. When he saw the hero fly up and congratulate the wolfess things became clear. She even blushed a little at his compliments. Suddenly her attention turned back to him. He was little more than a bruised heap, barely having moved. But something the hero said had spurred her on to land another giant foot next to him. They were arguing a little whilst Shenny's big toes cradled his head. Suddenly they squeezed together hard, pinching his head inbetween. The pressure overwhelmed him and soon his consciousness faded. Distantly he felt the pressure alleviate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I just knocked him out, so he won't get up to any funny business.\" Shenny huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine. I'm sorry I doubted you. Just remember, as heroes we can't just kill them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes. Code of honour and all that. Speaking of, where do we take him now? Supervillain jail? He's puny enough, maybe even a regular prison might do.\" She added with a giggle. The Pint Puncher replied dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably best to keep him away from humans, even human prisoners. The supervillain jail sounds good. I'll show you the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny raised a brow. She was just kidding about the supervillain jail, but the more she thought about it, the more it made sense. Like her lover said, most these villains probably couldn't be locked up with humans, lest they'd eat or torment them all in some way or another. Curiosity mounted as to what such a facility would even look like. How would they hold someone of her stature, for example? She leaned down and picked up the unconscious lion. Derek hadn't proven much of a challenge, but she was happy her first act of heroism went so smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big smirk the wolfess followed her lover. How would those prison guards react to her dropping off a villain for them? Would they think she's there to turn herself in too. They'd be up for a surprise then. Speaking of surprises, what if she put the lion down there? He's probably small enough to fit in her pussy. The idea of her pushing her prey out in front of them and leaving the prison guards with a slime-soaked Derek was hilarious. That'd show em she's part of the good guys now. She was certain her lover wouldn't mind her harmless little prank. Without her stepping on anything expensive they soon reach the prison. The Pint Puncher had flown ahead to explain that Shenny wasn't about to attack them. He thanked his lucky stars that they believed him. The guards still looked a bit weary of the giant wolfess, but she could hardly blame them. It's not every day someone as stunningly beautiful as her shows up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Glam City was a place that regularly had to deal with all manner of superpowered menace, and though they lacked the resources needed to combat the growing threat of evil anthropomorphized animals, they wouldn\u2019t simply allow Pint Puncher to fight on their behalf without doing something to assist. That was why they constructed the Institute for the Study of Evil Animals, or I.S.E.A for short. Pint Puncher\u2019s relationship with them was give and take at best, but when it came to detaining his vanquished foes, he could find no group more equipped to do so. Their headquarters was an unassuming two story building in the middle of town, though Puncher knew that the real facility rested several stories underground from having been on the inside a few times. As expected, several guards were waiting for them out front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They looked upon the titanic wolfess with their hands clutched onto their respective weapons. While they knew that Pint Puncher would never steer them wrong, the destruction wrought by Shenny was still fresh in their minds. Their concern didn't bother her as she soon stood before them with a pleased grin on her face as she looked down at them. Their catch was nowhere to be seen and for a moment he began to worry that she let him get away when his back was turned. His fears were dispelled when he noticed Derek's foot protruding from her snatch. He fought of the temptation to burst out laughing as he flew up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just couldn't resist, could you?\" he asked with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I was just making sure this criminal was properly detained is all\u201d she said with a huff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She grunted and closed her eyes, allowing her powerful inner walls to gradually push the unconscious lion out. He fell a great distance before landing in front of the guards with a wet splat. They didn't quite share Pint Puncher's amusement as their noses curled at the powerful stench that now radiated off of their prisoner. They were reluctant to even put their hands on him, but they didn\u2019t want to run the risk of him waking up and taking his anger out on them. It took ten guards to carry Derek off to his cell, though a handful remained to keep at eye on Shenny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith all due respect Pint Puncher, I don\u2019t think I feel very comfortable in you bringing her in while she\u2019s fully conscious\u201d one of them complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not \u2018bringing her in\u2019. She\u2019s the one who helped me nab Derek in the first place!\u201d he said as he looked up at his colossal lover with a proud smile. She merely blushed and shuffled her feet shyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe that as it may, she\u2019s still one of Glam City\u2019s most wanted criminals. Just yesterday she caused up to fifty million dollars worth of damage to the downtown era. She has to be put away for everyone\u2019s sake\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you don\u2019t have to worry about that anymore, because from this point on she\u2019s going to be working with me. As a hero\u201d Pint Puncher said sternly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The gaggle of security officers erupted into protests. It was bad enough that he was essentially telling them to turn a blind eye to the giant criminal standing in front of them, but now he expected them to just accept the idea that Shenny had turned new leaf? It was preposterous. Unthinkable even! The hero remained stonefaced while they continued to voice their complaints, though it wasn\u2019t hard to detect the frustration mounting his expression. He had expected some pushback against his announcement of Shenny as his partner, but he wasn\u2019t prepared for the emotional response that it would trigger within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They spoke so harshly of her, using terms like \u201cfreak\u201d and \u201cmonster\u201d while they clamored on about how much of a mockery of justice it was for him to allow her to run free. The hero tried his damned hardest to understand where they were coming from as he had carried their same mindset regarding Shenny not two days ago, but his love for her had begun to blind him to the validity of their complaints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He glanced back up at Shenny and wasn\u2019t surprised to see her sharing his offense. It was in seeing her pained expression however, that he was finally sobered up to the selfishness of his perspective. She had caused so much pain and suffering in her wake and for him to just expect people to forgive everything she had done was not only foolish, but downright disrespectful. If she truly wanted the approval of the citizens of Glam City, the first step would be to humble herself before them. The question on his mind of course was whether or not she would do it...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was trying to help them, and yet all she heard was pleas for them to detain the monster. Was that all they saw? Another villain to be brought to justice? Even after she delivered them a thoroughly disabled Derek? She could feel anger rising within her. The idea of showing these ungrateful little bastards what a real monster could do was tantalizing. She'd smash this whole compound in a single swipe and stomp half the guards flat. The other half could be her meal and entertainment. But amidst it all, a beacon shone brightly. She saw the Pint Puncher look up to her. His troubled glare told her everything. Now more than ever did she need to contain herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards stopped arguing when the titanic wolfess stood before them with balled fists. For an instant they all feared the worst. But as though a huge burden just fell off her shoulders her posture lightened. With the greatest care she kneeled down before the diminutive building. All eyes were upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry. That's probably not going to mean much, coming from me, but I want you all to know that I truly am sorry for the things I've done. I've caused a great deal of damage to this city and its inhabitants and that won't go away with a few honeyed words. But your hero, the Pint Puncher, saw opportunity in me. Against all possible odds he saw something good within me. He opened my eyes, lifted the haze from them that sent me down a path of destruction. If you let me, I will bring you so many defeated supervillains you're going to need a bigger facility. I know my past doesn't warrant a second chance. But please, I beg you, let me show you the good I can do for this city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the guards were still apprehensive. But between seeing the towering wolfess on the verge of tears and the hero's unshakable faith in her they were cautiously optimistic. Glam City could definitely use another hero, but this was going to happen on their terms. After some grumbling among the higher-ups present one of them addressed both superhero and wolfess. He was a relatively short, stocky man with more chins than most of these men combined. He spoke with a harsh tone, barking orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up, you two! Pint Puncher! You will be held personally responsible for her actions. One slip-up and I'll expect you to turn both her and yourself in. And you...\" He pointed at Shenny. \"First off, if you want to deliver us villains, keep them out of your pussy, it's disgusting. Secondly, you can drop them off outside town. The Pint Puncher can let us know and we'll collect them. The less we have you barging around in this city the better. Even your little plea damaged the road.\" He pointed to where she was kneeling, cracks in the pavement radiating out from her knees. The Pint Puncher vowed he would fix that right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lastly, don't expect any kind of gratitude or forgiveness anytime soon, villain. I don't know what the Pint Puncher sees in you, but I'm not about to question his sense of justice. If he thinks you can help clean up the rest of you supervillains I'm giving it a try. But we'll be watching you. You take one step back, indulge your wretched urges just once, and it's all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess felt a lump in her throat. So many emotions were bubbling up within her. The Pint Puncher had accepted a huge gamble with her. If she messed up, even if it's only an accident, he'll be responsible. They were ready to lock him up the instant he, or indeed herself, stepped out of line. Was it really worth going through with all this if it was going to put so much stress on her boyfriend? Shortly after the anguish pride followed. Who did this chief character think he is, bossing them both around? Puncher saves the day several times a week but still it's not enough? Why did he even put up with this blowhard? She wouldn't mind putting him down a peg. Maybe give him a tour of that 'disgusting' pussy of hers. That'd change his mind right quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny swallowed her pride and carefully got up. Quietly she spoke to the man. \"I understand.\" The Pint Puncher flew up to her and told her to leave town for now and head back home. He'd be right behind her after patching up the pavement. Before she left he stopped her to add one more thing. He flew up to the top of her head and grabbed her ear, whispering softly into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so. Unbelievably. Proud. Of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd feared the worst, hearing the guards speak to her with open disgust. Someone as beautiful as Shenny might not have taken it well. But she kept her calm, showing sincere humility and dealing with the harsh words gracefully. Today was a great day for both of them and tonight he was going to shower her with all the affection she deserved. Together they would show everyone that love can tame even the wildest beast. Supervillains everywhere would cower before them as they brought justice far and wide, filling the cells of the I.S.E.A. to bursting. The road may be long, but one day he hoped they would look at Shenny and see the hero he knew she could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher mends the pavement in a flash, returning to his lover minutes later. Together they prepare to return to her home in the forest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> It wasn't long before the couple were back home resting their tired bodies in the spring. While their first job together had proved effective, the words of the I.S.E.A official still lingered in their minds. They couldn't afford to make any mistakes in future endeavors, lest they risk reigniting the ire of the city folk. Still, they were confident that everything would work itself out. Shenny had demonstrated such pose and maturity that their success seemed an absolute certainty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n For the time being however, the couple were content to just relax and enjoy their time together in between jobs. Puncher was seated atop Shenny\u2019s head, gently rubbing her ears while whispering words of praise into them. If she wasn\u2019t going to receive any gratitude from the people in the city, he\u2019d make sure that he more than compensated for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo. Came up with any names yet?\u201d Shenny asked as she leaned back in the spring, her eyelids heavy from the earrub and the calming waters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot this again\u2026\u201d Puncher sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You get to have a cool superhero name, so why can\u2019t I?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh so NOW my superhero name is cool? The first time you heard it, you couldn\u2019t stop laughing\u201d Puncher chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but that was back when I was a bad guy. Now that I\u2019m a hero I can finally see the appeal\u201d she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnlike me, you don\u2019t have a secret identity you\u2019re trying to protect\u201d he pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph\u2026 fair enough, I suppose\u2026\u201d she conceded before letting out a loud and drawn out yawn. The warmth of the spring and massage was gradually lulling her into peaceful slumber. She slumped back against the dipping walls of the spring, her head hanging back and her eyes shutting tight. Pint Puncher grinned as he slipped off of her head and onto the ground. He knew that she wouldn\u2019t be asleep for long so he had little time to muck about. He waited until he could hear the sound of her snoring before taking off in the direction of the city\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to do WHAT?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me the first time, doc. Now can you do it or can\u2019t you?\u201d Puncher asked in a hint of impatience in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Utilizing his superhuman speed, Pint Puncher managed to reach I.S.E.A headquarters in record time. There was some much to do about his inability to schedule in advance and his blatant nudity and after being given a spare uniform to cover his naked body, he was granted permission to speak to the head of Research and Development. It was through this particular field of study that the facility were able to craft a slew innovative gadgets used to pacify and detain any criminals that came their way. The head of the department was a small, stocky bespectacled woman of with a near permanent frown, Ms. Mia Wong. She tended to regard Pint Puncher with a cold and dismissive attitude but quite often proved herself to be the most helpful and approachable member of the facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said I couldn\u2019t. I just don\u2019t understand why you thought that I\u2019d be eager to let you use the fruits of my precious research to make a gift for your oversized troublemaker of a girlfriend\u201d she said in a less than warm tone, her eyes never leaving her clipboard even as they spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo things. My girlfriend is NOT a troublemaker. I\u2019d thank you to remember that, MA\u2019AM. Second, if she\u2019s going to be busting her butt to prove to you all that she\u2019s on the up and up, I think it\u2019s only fair that she receive some bit of compensation for her thankless work\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s called community service, hero. You don\u2019t get a pat on the back for cleaning up the mess that you helped create. I would hope that you, a civil servant, would understand that better than anyone else\u201d she derided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not here to debate with you and I don\u2019t have a lot of time. Will you do this for me or not?\u201d Puncher asked with a half desperate plea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said I wouldn\u2019t\u201d She said before turning her attention away from her paperwork to met him eye to eye. \u201cI expect you to pay me back in full. Five cases of chocolate bonbons, on my desk, tomorrow\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, right. I know the deal\u201d Pint Puncher said with a smirk. The petite scientist always conducted herself with an a constant air of dry cynicism, so much so that no one could name a single instance in which they\u2019ve seen her smile. Yet the seemingly emotionless woman had a sweet tooth so ravenous that her services could be easily bought with just the right confectionary. She lead him into one of many testing chambers in the facility and sat down at the stationary control panel that rested in the center of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The moment Puncher stepped inside, he was hit with a pungent stench that nearly bowled him over. He looked around for the source of the offensive odor, but could find nothing out of the ordinary in the pristine white room. The only object of notice was a large red tarp that covered the wall in front of them. It was strung up by a series of hooks, though it still managed to drape onto the floor from it\u2019s sheer size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be frank with you, hero. I don\u2019t have the time, resources, or patience to design an outfit for your girlfriend. BUT, I can give you the next best thing\u201d Dr. Wong said as he pressed a few non-distinct buttons on the panel. Seconds later, a spray bottle containing an unknown blue liquid was deposited in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever wondered how some people like Tiffany and Rowland can keep their clothes in tact whenever they change sizes?\u201d she asked rhetorically before walking over to the enormous tarp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour last little bout with Tiffany provided us with a means to study this phenomenon\u201d She said as she ran her hand along the fabric. It was then that Puncher realized that the \u201ctarp\u201d in front of them was in actuality the bottom half of Tiffany\u2019s trademark bikini, and the horrid stench that engulfed the room her her feted musk. He considered complaining about their apparent refusal to wash the material, though he kept his comments to himself for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI spare you the hour long lecture on quantum mechanics. Long story short, these are nanites. Spray them onto the clothing of your choice, they bond with its particles, yadda yadda yadda. Basically, it\u2019ll keep make her outfit grow and shrink with her\u201d she said before tossing the bottle over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about getting it on your skin or anything. It\u2019s made for fabric and fabric only\u201d she explained dryly before sitting back at the control panel. \u201cAnything else you want? You know I have nothing better than to do than to entertain your inane requests\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best, Dr. Wong!\u201d Pint Puncher said as he ran up and gave her a quick hug before heading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever. Just don\u2019t forget my payment!\u201d She called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher\u2019s trip had taken a short amount of time, though picking out the perfect outfit for his lover proved more time consuming than expected. It was hard to account for the tastes of someone with such simple desires. Still, he was confident that the clothing he picked out would be to her liking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He found his titanic lover still resting in the spring, her snores resonating throughout the entire forest. He placed the bag onto the ground before flying up to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShenny\u2026 rise and shine\u2026\u201d he cooed softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n His gentle approach managed to get a delighted murr from Shenny, but it did little to make her stir from her slumber. The hero decided to up his game a bit as he flew over to her nipple, half submerged in the spring, and gave it a firm squeeze. That was more than enough to jolt Shenny awake, her a cute gasp coming from her as her eyes shot open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNngh\u2026 Punchy\u2026 don\u2019t scare me like that\u2026\u201d she huffed as she stroked the top of his head with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t mean to startle you. I just wanted to show you the gift I got you and--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA gift?!\u201d Shenny swooned as she jumped to her feet, nearly sending her boyfriend tumbling into the spring. She showed no signs of exhausted despite having been woken so suddenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup. Close your eyes for a minute\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny bit down on her bottom lip as she did as instructed, her heart racing with anticipation. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she had received a gift of any kind. Someone of her stature was used to simply taking what she wanted with minimal resistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you can open your eyes now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The eager wolfess opened her eyes to the sight of her boyfriend floating in front of her face with something in his hands. Open closer inspection, she could see that he held a large pair of leopard skin panties, along with a matching bra. Thick tufts of fur decorated the waistband and just below that was a dark brown loincloth, givinging it a more feral appearance. It was an outfit that one might expect to see on a stereotypical amazonian warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said no spandex, so I figured you might want something that showed a little more skin, or in your case fur\u201d Pint Puncher said with a bright smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny tilted her head at her gift, her ears perking with interest. It was far too small for her at her current size, which meant that she would use her size changing ability to shrink herself down to a modest nine feet. Overall, she seemed... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Aw, that's cute. You're a brave one, trying to buy lingerie for a woman. But I must say, I've got a few pointers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher expected as much, especially given Shenny's titanic stature. The first question was the most obvious one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I've got a real slim figure, but there's no way that's gonna fit me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you shrink yourself down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, but I can't go around stomping out evildoers when I'm merely ten feet tall, now can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I've treated them with a special substance I got from a good friend of mine. It allows them to stretch infinitely. No matter how big you want to be, these babies will grow right along with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny was awestruck by the level of forethought on display. A set of clothes that could keep up with her size-shifting abilities long sounded like a pipe dream. She'd always been jealous of other villains that were capable of growth without shredding their gear. For the longest time she figured it was just part of their superpowers, a part that she missed. Though this did lead her on to her next question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very thoughtful. But let's get one thing very clear...\" She reached down and pinched the leopard skin bra between two big fingers. She inspected the tiny garment up close before casually throwing it over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These babies are not getting caged. They're free as can be.\" She gestured towards her heaving rack, bouncing proudly in the wind. The Pint Puncher reluctantly had to agree it'd be a crime to cover them. Maybe one day she can think of a use for them. Perhaps to keep him mashed against her boob for a long time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fair, they were part of a matching set, so I figured I might as well get both just in case. Now, do you want to give them a try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess nodded and got out of the spring. With a deep breath she concentrated her willpower into reducing her size. It almost felt odd to be small all of a sudden. She'd been having so much fun with the tiny hero it was slightly unnerving to suddenly tower over him by a mere three feet. He handed her the panties and she quickly slipped them on. They fit like a dream, the cute fuzzy waistband nicely accenting her own. The comfortably loose loincloth gave just enough of an impression of modesty to keep those joyless clowns in the I.S.E.A. off her back. She could still feel the comforting breeze brush along her nethers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see if this growing concoction does as advertised.\" She said with a smile. Within moments she exploded in size, the panties expanding along with her beautifully. Shenny's smile grew wide as she reached her familiar titanic posture. The Pint Puncher flew up, curious to see if the good doctor in the lab had delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it feel? Comfy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very, like it was made for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome. Now how's about you have a nice big sit-down and let your superhero boyfriend pamper you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny didn't need to be told twice. She laid back and closed her eyes, getting ready for the hero to work his magic. He started in a familiar place, scratching the back of her right ear. Gradually he moved up, whispering sweet words into the large ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so very impressed by what you did today. Not just in catching Derek, but also keeping your cool afterwards.\" She shrugged dismissively, but it did raise a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy, you've been doing this hero shtick for a while now. How many villains did you defeat before people began to cheer for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr... I'll be honest, I never really kept track of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think they'll ever cheer for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher could feel where this was going. She might've kept her temper, but the insults thrown at her by the people she was trying to safeguard had cut deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. It'll probably take a while for them to warm up to you, but I know they will. You'll be on posters in bedrooms soon enough. And what a poster it'll be...\" He trailed off, daydreaming about his lover's intensely hot body. She smirked broadly, encouraged by his optimism. The mental image of teenagers hanging pictures of her in their bedroom as a superhero to look up to was amusing. The two of them were lost in thought for a few minutes before he finally spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, how about I make you feel just how proud I am of you. Do you think your pussy is ready for that?\" The wolfess raised a brow. That was forward, even by the Pint Puncher's standards. Immediately she responds with a big smirk. \"I don't know, do you think you can beat Derek?\" They both giggled at the situation they'd put the hapless lion in. He probably didn't imagine his day would end up being carried around in Shenny's pussy and delivered to the I.S.E.A. like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero flew don't to Shenny's waiting snatch. The loincloth did little to conceal the potent feminine musk radiating from her. Carefully he pushed the cloth aside to reveal the wolfess' treasure cavern. It was already becoming moist with anticipation, twitching excitedly at his every touch. He gently slipped both his arms into the passage, but her lust for him was insatiable. Like a hungry beast the vagina squeezed the hero's arms and pulled them in much deeper. Before he knew it he was in up to his shoulders, his head next to go. His face-first entry was swift and immensely arousing. Feeling the former villain pull him in with such vigour was inspiring. The comfortable slime-stained tunnel soon accommodated his whole body, massaging it with gentle squeezes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steady, soothing rhythm soon coaxed him into a deep sleep. His dreams were filled with lewd scenarios involving himself and Shenny. Vividly he imagines her sitting down atop a supervillain, aligning her crotch with his maw and climaxing so heavily the villain cannot breathe through the ceaseless torrent of her release. Only when he falls unconscious does her orgasm end. The strange dream seems to reflect what's happening in his surroundings. The slimy feminine juices are beginning to build up. This, paired with the increasing twitchiness of the walls could mean only one thing. He was about to be expelled from the warm chamber. Where does the hero find himself?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> The wolfess\u2019 relatively subdued orgasm pushed Pint Puncher from out her dripping love tunnel and onto the grass below. He stood to his feet and stretched out slightly. The gentle caresses of her vaginal walls worked wonders on his normally stiff joints, giving him yet another reason to appreciate his titanic lover\u2019s assets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to wake you like this, but duty calls\u201d Shenny explained as she stood above him, a her juices coming down on his in a light drizzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher blinked and turned his attention forward. Once again, they were standing on the outskirts of the city. While he could scarcely hear anything while resting inside of Shenny, he could easily make out the sounds of buildings crumblings and screaming pedestrians now that he was frew. The hero was quick to shake off his sex-dazed stupor as he flew up to his partner\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re on a roll with these alerts\u201d he said with a proud grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, these giant ears aren\u2019t just for show you know?\" she giggled as her canine ears twitched reflexively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. Well, I\u2019m off to see what\u2019s up. Get your stomping off prepped up!\" he joked as he turned to fly off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny frowned and snatched him out of the air, holding him in front of her muzzle. As much as she loved to see him coated in the remnants of their love making, she wanted her man to look professional while on the jobs. She gave him a quick tongue bath before drying him off with her breasts once more. She then gave him a quick kiss for luck before sending him off. Puncher couldn\u2019t help but respect her change in attitude as he flew through the city. She knew not to waste time playing around while lives were on the line, a trait necessary for any would-be superhero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew she had it in her\u201d he said proudly to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He surveyed the area for some time, his eyes narrowing at the trail of destruction that lead him downtown. Crumbled cars, crushed buildings and cracked streets littered the landscape. He spotted a number of giant footprints in the pavement, cluing him in as to who was responsible for all the damage. His hunch proved correct as he reached the downtown district to find the colossal rat anthro Tiffany lounging on a flattened office building like a recliner. She seemed to be awaiting his arrival, a coy smile touching her lips as she stood to her full impressive height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTook you long enough to show up\u2026\u201d she murmured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou never learn, do you Tiff?\u201d Pint Puncher asked as he folded his arms. He was more than a little irritated that his sexy times with Shenny was cut short so suddenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, don\u2019t look so upset, Punchy. I did all this just to get your attention~\u201d she giggled as she ran a hand along her expansive hip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Something felt off to the hero. The tone that Tiffany was taking with him was quite different than what he had come to expect from her. She was a braggart, constantly deriding or threatening those who would stand against her, but now she spoke with a calm, almost sultry voice. She shook her body gently, letting her mind bogglingly large bosom bounce with every sway she made. Comparatively speaking she stood a head shorter than Shenny, though her breasts noticeably larger. If Shenny was a D cup, Puncher estimated that that would make Tiffany near an F. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With his attention fixed on the hypnotic display, Tiffany smiled knowingly as she addressed him. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So it's true then... the mighty Pint Puncher has a thing for everything big? Well aren't you at the exact right spot then. If it's big bodies you want, few can stand up to mine. Now how about you get a little closer so I can properly introduce you to all my immense assets.\" She reached out to the superhero, who hung in the air, entranced by the massive swaying tits. Even Shenny could learn a thing from those, and her cleavage was already big enough to need scuba gear. He spots the hand and glides backwards. First and foremost he has to lure the immense rat out of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's say I do...\" He spoke with a deep voice, honey to the rat's ears. \"How about we see if you're big enough for my tastes outside of town, where we can have all the fun we want without any of that pesky destroying buildings or flattening innocent people?\" Tiffany sighed. Even when dumbstruck by her huge rack he just had to be a hero about this all. Whatever, she could finish destroying the town after she was through with him. The thought of the Pint Puncher willingly submitting himself to her whim was too much to resist. With thundering steps she followed the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth hero and villain said nothing during the trip, each fantasizing about the outcome of their encounter. The Pint Puncher imagined a big struggle between Tifanny and his lover. But he'd provide some extra heavy punching on top of Shenny's considerable strength. They'd lamp this rat in a moment, call it in and let I.S.E.A. wonder about the logistics of getting the titanic rat into a cell. They'd be back to their usual kinky hijinks in no time. The supervillain on the other hand was having a different fantasy. With the hero succumbing to the allure of her hefty butt and boobs he looked about ready to offer himself to her freely. With a loud snort she imagined all the horrible ways in which she would use her size to put him in his place. Seeing that perverted stare in his eyes... he might even like it. She'd crush him, squeeze him, grind him and smother him until there was no more of her vast body left to torment him. After all that he could fulfill his desires of being close to her by getting eaten and adding to that beautiful body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher looked ahead in the woods but was surprised not to see any giants. Where did Shenny go? Was she planning something? Or was she up to her old misdeeds whilst he wasn't looking. He prayed she could resist her urges. Surely him spending some time in her pussy should satisfy her for a while, right? Amidst the trees he spotted a familiar small tail. She'd shrunken herself down for extra surprise. She probably heard Tiffany's voice and didn't want the titanic rat to see her too early. That might ruin the plan. He smiles at her quick thinking and continues to fly just out of reach of the rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leading the humongous rat some distance into the woods he turned to face her once again. The Pint Puncher's smile grew as he could see Shenny growing to her full size behind Tiffany. The wolfess had found a small clearing so no falling trees would give away her cunning plan. She stood tall and strong, a head taller than the villainous rat. Just as she was about to grab the hero, a large fuzzy finger tapped on her shoulder. With the biggest smile the Pint Puncher reveals the grand scheme. \"Sorry Tiff, I'm already taken...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a violent snarl Shenny twists her opponent to face her and throws a brutal haymaker into Tiffany's gut. The oversized rat was reeling, but ready to block subsequent attacks. This wasn't their first brawl and it wouldn't be their last. The wolfess tried to leverage her taller stature, but between the vast boobs and a bit of a paunch the rat probably matched her in weight. Soon this slugfest of epic proportions began to turn a little silly as the two grappled eachother, falling over. A devastating thump echoed through the woods, sending flocks of birds into the sky. Both giants were growling like animals, fighting over their pint-sized prize. Jealousy did not become Shenny, but having something she'd lament losing made her fight harder than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero doesn't just want to sit idle and let Shenny have all the fun. He spots an opportunity to clock Tiffany right in the head. With his outstretched fist ready for one hell of a punch he charged into the fray.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> With a head full of steam the hero bolted forward, his fist clenched tight as was prepared to deal a decisive blow to the lumbering menace. He was in mid flight when Tiffany suddenly bucked Shenny off of her with her powerful legs, her teeth clench as she turned to get back onto his feet. Pint Puncher\u2019s eyes widened as he found himself barrelling towards the villainous rat\u2019s enormous tits. He wasn\u2019t able to pump the breaks in time to prevent himself from flying face first into her cleavage, his tiny body sinking in deep between her soft, yielding boob flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Three thoughts crossed the hero\u2019s mind as he laid between his foe\u2019s impressive rack: The first was how stupid he felt for getting into this mess in the first place. The second was in regards to Tiffany\u2019s breasts. Having now experienced the warm embrace of both her and Shenny\u2019s cleavage, he could could conclude that Tiffany\u2019s breasts on top of being larger were significantly softer. The third thought, and this hindered any possible enjoyment he could receive from his predicament, was that the large breasted giantess absolutely stunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Although she might have had his lover beaten when it came to whom had the finer assets, Shenny had her beat simply by virtue of being able to take care of herself hygienically. The worst stench he ever caught from Shenny was that of her sweat, an scent that he had grown to appreciate over time. Tiffany\u2019s body carry a musky, cheesy, rancid odor that made it clear that she didn\u2019t believe in bathing. He retched and struggled to separate the smelly walls to try and escape from his horrid prison, but his attempts proved useless as his hands sank into the yielding surface around him. Things weren\u2019t made much easier by bikini, which compressed her massive boobs together in such a way that his movements were minimized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Neither giant seemed to notice his interference as they stood to their feet, their eyes narrowed as they sized each other up. It wasn\u2019t long before they were back at it, their fists swinging and their feet making the earth tremble with every step they took. While the two behemoths slugged it out, Puncher was in absolute hell. His smelly prison bounced wildly, jostling him him about without a moment of rest. If Tiffany\u2019s pungent stench didn\u2019t make him feel sink enough, the constant rocking of her breasts made it a struggle to keep from vomiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just when it seemed as though things couldn\u2019t get any more hectic for the hero, a sudden lurch caused him slip from the tight confines of her cleavage and into the front of her bikini. The fierce bout had made Tiffany work up a good sweat, her breast becoming damp from the exertion and making it easier to Puncher to move about. From where he now resided, the hero was nothing more than a barely visible bulge in her bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your deal, Shenny? Not too long ago, you and me were kickin\u2019 Pint Puncher\u2019s rump all over the city, and now you\u2019re a couple?\u201d Tiffany said once the two of the paused to collect themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not the same Shenny you knew from before. Unlike you, I actually have something to fight for now!\u201d Shenny snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, now you\u2019re starting to sound like him!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment\u201d Shenny said with a proud smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t if I were you. Your little boytoy is very fickle, you know\u2026\u201d Tiffany snickered before running his hand along her voluptuous form. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen the way he was checking me out... I can hardly blame him, though. When it comes right down to it, I have you beat where it really matters\u201d  She said as patted her plump chest and generous rear to punctuate her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny huffed in disgust. She knew that her loving little boyfriend would never dream of cavorting with another woman. Their hearts belonged to one another and nothing would change that fact\u2026 yet there was something about her words that bothered her ever so slightly. A seed of self-doubt had been successfully planted in her mind, fueled by what remained of her old emotionally charged personality. Seeing a hint of uncertainty in her eyes, Tiffany smiled in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off my rack. I have expected him to dive right in!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Shenny growled. \u201cI won\u2019t have you talking about my boyfriend like that! Even if he was checking you out, he\u2019d never lower himself to mess around with the likes of you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh get over it, princess! No matter how much you may want to think otherwise, your \u2018boyfriend\u2019 is no different than any other man. He\u2019s a slave to his dick, just like the rest of em!\u201d she taunted. \u201cSeems like you need some convincing. I\u2019ll make sure to keep you just conscious enough to watch as me and Pint Puncher make sweet, sweet love together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That was all Shenny could take. A burning white hatred washed over her and all she could do was charge forward with a furious roar. Tiffany blinked and took a step back as the enraged wolfess came bounding towards her. Before she could even raise her fists to confront the oncoming threat, Shenny caught her in a frighteningly powerful bearhug, her arms wrapped around the rodent\u2019s waist as she lifted her body of the grip. Tiffany gasped and struggled against her larger foe as the air was forced from her lungs. She wasn\u2019t the only one suffering, as Pint Puncher\u2019s body was flattened by the mountains of flesh crushing him from the front and back. He was sandwiched between the two titans, unable to so much as budge from the intense pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Thinking quickly, Tiffany reached down and grabbed onto Shenny\u2019s neck. She reeled her head back and delivered a jarring headbutt to the wolfess, causing her to stagger a bit. The furious amazon managed to keep her grip film despite the pain, but it was evident that they blow had disoriented her a bit due to the flickering of her eyelids. Tiffany gave her a strained smile before reeling her head back and repeating the motion several more times, each one more fierce than the last. As tough as Shenny was, the sinister giant knew that it was only a matter of time before her the pain superseded her adrenaline and her body gave out. Shenny was too far gone to realize what was happening, her mind clouded with all encompassing rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher was in the dark what was happening, both figuratively and literally, but the pained grunts coming from his girlfriend was enough to tell him that she was in danger. He fought and squirmed against his constrictive surroundings, desperate to lend aid to his struggling lover but it proved useless. The most his struggles accomplished as getting a slight rise out of Tiffany, her gigantic nipple jabbing him in the back as hardened from his pathetic attempts at resistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Things weren't looking good for crime fighting couple. Pint Puncher was pinned down between several tons of plush tit flesh and Shenny too caught up in her emotions to notice that she was beginning to lose consciousness. If something didn't happen soon, the cruel rodent would walk away from this skirmish the victor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher felt the rat's big nipple poking him in the back. Escape might not be possible from this oppressive prison, but he did smell an opportunity. An incredibly rancid, cheesy, stinky opportunity. With all his strength he began to twist himself around, facing the hardened flesh. It pushed him heavily into the sturdy bra, the smallest amount of rotten milk leaking from it. He didn't think there was another level of depth in the vileness of this supervillain, but she managed to beat all possible odds. Another heavy crack echoed overhead as she delivered a heavy headbutt to his lover. He had to act now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing stars yet, Shenny?\" Tiffany taunted. She really hoped the wolfess w\u00e1s starting to lose consciousness. Her enraged glare didn't give her much information and her own head was starting to hurt. Suddenly she felt something very peculiar. Something very familiar was caressing her nipple. It took great effort to move at all, but each stroke sent a surge of pleasure through the rat. A cruel smile formed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho ho, what did I tell you? Guess who's currently rubbing my nipples. You should probably already know, since I don't think we know anyone else around that loves big girls and can resist being crushed between our racks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny's rage either faded or grew so intense she came full circle. Her monstrous bear hug faded and she took a step back. Sure enough, on the rat's right nipple a small human-shaped bulge was wiggling about. The wolfess grabbed her aching heart, seeing her lover abandon her for another just because her tits weren't big enough. But before any tears could flow the rat howled out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher felt the weight lift from his back as Shenny stepped back. This was his moment. Tiffany's bra might still be squeezing him into her titflesh, but compared to the last few minutes of immense pressure that was nothing. He grunted in disgust at his pungent surroundings and took a strong hold on the rock-hard nipple. That alone might've been little more than a pinch for the rat, but he wasn't close to done. With every ounce of his strength he twisted the flesh, giving the supervillain a superpowered titty twister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAH, WHAT THE FUCK?!\" Tiffany cried out, tears welling up in her eyes. It felt like a million needles were just stuck in her sensitive nipple. Worse yet, she heard a small ripping sound and felt a sudden breeze on the hurting flesh. Out from her bra shot the Pint Puncher, gasping deeply at his sudden exposure to fresh air. He sucked in a lungful as he surveyed the situation. Shenny was reeling with emotion, unsure of what to think. He'd heard the rat's vicious taunting. He would need to be there for his lover when this is all over. He wouldn't trade her soft embrace for that smelly landfill of Tiffany even if it was ten times bigger. But first things first. There was a rat in dire need of more punching. Filled with righteous fury, the superhero charged at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill dazed from headbutting Shenny and getting the air squeezed from her lungs by the wolfess' immense bearhug, Tiffany flailed wildly at the hero. None of her clumsy swipes got near him as he landed blow after blow to her head. His little fists stung even more than his lover's hard skull. He came at her from every angle, never pausing in his relentless assault. The rat was on the ropes and the final blow came in when two large arms wrapped around her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny saw the superhero furiously lay in to the rat. Maybe there was still hope for her? Maybe it was all part of his plan to help her? But did he really need to pick the one route to assisting her that put him in Tiffany's tits? She still felt sad about seeing her lover in another woman's tits. Especially when those tits were... bigger. She'd not often had to contend with this feeling. Normally she was the biggest thing around, on all fronts. Even the rat couldn't measure up to her in height. But her bouncing assets had the wolfess beat. For once, she wasn't the biggest. Her inner conflict was gnawing on her soul. But her boyfriend seemed to have his mind all made up, relentlessly beating the snot out of that rat. She'd deal with this later. For now it was time to end this. Tiffany was so busy with the Puncher she had her back turned to the wolfess, a fatal mistake. With speed she grabbed her by the chest and lifted her off her feet. Shenny growled furiously and squeezed the squirming rat with a strength even the wolfess didn't know she possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she tried to headbutt the titanic wolfess again, her efforts were interrupted by the Pint Puncher, who kept on hitting her. Like the world's angriest mosquito he buzzed around her head. Air was growing sparse as the dominating bear hug mercilessly crushed her lungs. A few desperate gasps were all that was left for Tiffany before her body went limp. With the unconscious rat still in her arms, Shenny feels a rush of elation wash over her. The rat proved a challenge in more ways than one, but she had overcome. All those lingering doubts and feelings on the other hand... those were coming back to her stronger than ever. </span></div></div>",

The impact rattled the surrounding area, though there seemed to be no noticeable damage done. He turned to face his lover to celebrate their victory when without warning, he was snatched out of the air. Shenny whimpered and she hugged him close to her chest, her eyes watering as her conflicting emotions were getting the better of her. Her boyfriend's loyalty had been on full display with his furious assault, yet she couldn't look past the hurt she felt in seeing him in Tiffany's bra. The villain's cruel words had opened the door for all of Shenny's insecurities to take hold of her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She sat there for some time, her eyes clenched tight as she struggled to push these thoughts out of her head. There was no way that Puncher would abandon her. He had done so much for her, opened her eyes to the wonders of heroism and vouched for her when everyone else doubted her. There was no way that he'd dump her for a vacuous slag like Tiffany... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A surge of pleasure shot through her suddenly and she look down to see her lover with his arms wrapped affectionately around her breast. He was kissed and licked at her teat, sighing happily as a warm dollop of milk greeted his eager tongue. After spending what felt like ages trapped between Tiffany's rancid mammaries, it felt wonderful to be back where he belonged: nestled against his lover's swollen teat. Seeing her boyfriend so happy and content at her bosom made brought a smile to Shenny's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you... so very, very much. Every part of you...\" Puncher murmured softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fears of inadequacy died out right then and there. Now she was certain. There was no way he'd ever turn his back to her. Tiffany may have her beat when it comes to her assets, but they shared a bond that went beyond the physical. They loved each other, and no tarted up big titted hussy was going to come between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, Punchy... <i>but</i>,\" she began as she plucked him from her boob and held him up to her face. \"After we send this bitch off to the I.S.E.A, you're gonna spend the rest of the day making it up to me. You're gonna be worshipping my boobs for a loooong time, mister!\" she said half-jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, please! Anything but that!\" Puncher cried out in watch had to be the worst display of acting Shenny had ever seen. After a hard days work, he would get to spend the remainder of the afternoon tending to his gorgeous girlfriend\u2019s big beautiful tits. Truly, he was the luckiest man alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two in less than a week? I'm actually impressed\" the director said as he stroked his chin. The I.S.E.A had responded to the call in record time, their engineers eager to try out an their experimental equipment on the subdued giant. Soon enough, Tiffany was sitting in small cage, her body having been forced back to its normal diminutive size. She sat scowling with her arms bounded in front of her by size nullifying handcuffs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still not a fan of you letting Shenny muck about... but if you two keep turning out results like this, I might have a change of heart before not to long\" the grizzled director said with a half smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all we're asking for, Mr. Abbott\" Pint Puncher said with a smile as he reached out to shake the portly gentleman's hand. He blinked when he saw Mr. Abbott shrink back, his nose curling as he eyed him cautiously. Puncher pulled his hand back and sniffed it, retching at the rancid stench that linger on his skin. He stunk of Tiffany's viscous sweat and sour smelling milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n That brought his attention to the captive rodent herself, his brow furrowed as he fought to control his simmering hatred. He walked over to the cage and lifted it up, meeting Tiffany in the eye. Open seeing him, Tiffany's scowl turned into a playful and flirtatious grin as she swayed her chest again, letting her now uncovered breasts jiggle hypnotically. Puncher remained unfettered erotic display as he glared into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a lot I'm willing to look past. I've been stomped on, chewed up, squashed flat, beaten, eaten and sat on so many times I've lost count. And yet I try to keep a cool head and not hold a grudge against my enemies, no matter how much they may deserve it. But let me just say this: if you ever, and I mean <b>ever</b>, make my girlfriend cry again... you're not gonna be dealing with a noble superhero. You're gonna be dealing with an angry, pissed off boyfriend with superpowers. I will put a beating on you worse than anything you've ever felt before. Do you understand me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany didn't so much as blink at his threat as she leaned her head through the bars and looked up square in the eye. Her usual sadistic smile had an intense layer of raw, visceral lust that made Puncher feel uneasy even in his enraged state of mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get out. I don't know how long it'll take me, but I'll get out. And when I do, I'll be coming for you. I'll take you away from her. I'll make you <i>my</i> boyfriend... and then I'll make you cum so hard you'll forget all about your flat chested ex~\" she purred as she pressed her breasts between a single bar of her cage, squeezing her tits around it as she leered at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n To Pint Puncher, this shift in motivations seemed to come completely out of nowhere, though her lust for the hero had been building up throughout the duration of their bout. She delighted in seeing him become entranced by her breasts, got chills from seeing the look of sheer jealous on Shenny's face, and went weak at the knees as he squeezed her nipple. All of this led her to the conclusion that she <i>needed</i> to have him. She wanted him to worship her the way he did with Shenny; she wanted to see the look of heartbreak on the wolfess' face as her 'soulmate' surrendered himself to the rat's smaller, sexier body. It would be a glorious day for her when she got Puncher to renounce his love for Shenny... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher curled his nose in disgust as he shoved the cage away, sending Tiffany falling back onto her tiny little rump. He was done dealing with the repugnant little vermin. He looked up at his lover who stood idly by with her arms tucked behind her head. She was patiently waiting for him to be done dealing with the agency so they could go home and have fun. To entice him speed things up, she batted her eyelashes at Puncher, shaking her shoulders and causing her magnificent breasts to jiggle about. A not-so -subtle reminder of what to expect once they got back. Pint Puncher nodded and hurriedly dismissed the I.S.E.A before flying up to his titanic lover, who gently deposited his body into her cleavage before making her way back to the forest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shenny casually strolled back through the forest, emphasizing swaying her boobs from side to side. The Pint Puncher was in for the ride of his lifetime, nestled securely between the soft globes. But not all was right. Shenny's sensitive nose picked up a most peculiar scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell am I smelling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a blush the Pint Puncher replied. \"I think that might be me. Getting mashed between Tiffany's terrible tits has left me a little stinky. Wanna hit the spring before we get down to business?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, a tongue bath will do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero was plucked out from the soft embrace and held close to Shenny's maw. Before she could lick him even once the full strength of his putrid stench assaulted the wolfess' large nose. She was used to a lot of bad smells, but this was an all new kind of stench. The hero stunk like a burning landfill. She quickly pulled him away from her nose, coughing and retching a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking hell, what did she do to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just her all-natural boob scent.\" The Pint Puncher said jokingly. He'd been farted on, belched on and even been on the receiving end of superpowered skunk spray many times. Now that he wasn't getting mashed into the source of it, Tiffany's stench was manageable. Shenny didn't seem to agree though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she thinks you'd fall for that? You're getting cleaned up mister, but I'm not gonna sacrifice my taste buds for that. Seriously, you smell as bad as the landfill she crawled out of.\" They both kept joking about Tiffany's awful stench as she carried him to his much needed bath. When the spring was in sight Shenny threw the hero in from great distance. For comedic purposes the hero flailed around, seemingly forgetting he could fly. With a big splash he landed in the soothing waters. He let himself float to the surface and relax, but his titanic girlfriend wasn't done yet. Two large hands descended upon the superhero and began to roughly rub him all over. She was driven to rid him of every trace of Tiffany's foul stench. The wolfess knew he'd been mashed between the rat's vast boobs in the middle of her bear hug. With that much pressure the stink gets in deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher loved the passionate and personal attention he was getting. Her large fingers rubbed him everywhere, making no exceptions for his rising boner. When Shenny finally deemed him clean she grabbed him by the arm and dangled him in front of her nose. Several loud sniffs pulled gusts of cold air past him. She seemed pleased with the result, but there was a different little smell tingling her nostrils. She looked at the hero and saw his little spire standing erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see someone's a fan of my handiwork.\" She giggled, lowering the hero and washing his crotch in her warm breath. His prick was twitching with pent up lust and the wolfess already had plans for it. With nimble hands she removed his pants, leaving his throbbing manhood dangling in the breeze. She'd sucked him off before, but she wanted to do a little more. The Pint Puncher's eyes widened as she opened her maw and slowly dangled him between the many large and razor-sharp teeth. No matter how much he trusted her, the hero called out to his girlfriend. \"Ehm, Shenny? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer only reply was a lengthy soft moan as she closed her jaws around his midsection. His squirming legs slapped against her tongue and the squishy lips sealed everything below the hero's waist in the wet cavern of her maw. The teeth stayed back, but her large tongue hastily began to introduce itself to his exposed body. It coiled around his legs and drew large streaks of sticky drool all along his vulnerable groin. The warmth and wetness of her maw brought him to near-climax already. When her tongue started teasing his manhood he felt just about ready to explode. All it took was one more little poke from the tip of her tongue to send him gasping and moaning into a climax. He grabbed hold of her muzzle as best he could, spraying his load all over her tongue. She kept on teasing and pleasing his little man until it had nothing left to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was left to enjoy the warmth of her maw a little while longer before she pulled him out. Slowly her puckering lips gave up their prize, slurping and suckling as much as they could along the way. The taste of his squirming little body was divine and the constant futile wiggling made it so much better. She finally freed him from her maw completely and deposited the panting hero in her palm. His lower half was soaked with drool, his manhood understandably floppy after being drained so thoroughly. His smile couldn't be bigger and the wolfess was not one to leave her boyfriend wanting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been a bad little boyfriend, cavorting in another woman's tits. It's high time you get punished.\" She said seductively. The Pint Puncher smiled, entirely ready for whatever 'punishment' the wolfess has in mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> The sultry giantess looked down at her lover with an mischievous grin as she fondled her naked breast. She had told him that he would spend the rest of the afternoon worshiping her boobs and she meant it. She brought him over to her swollen teat, a wicked her hand squeezing on the sensitive flesh to coax out a relatively small drop of milk. Pint Puncher stepped forward excitedly, only to be held back by Shenny's massive finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh. You don't get to drink from me now... my tits are still upset about you messing around with that skank. If you ever want my milk again, you're gonna have to show them how sorry you are...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero's eyes widened at her words. While he was certain that she was merely playing up the punishment act, he dreaded the thought of being forever denied the sweet taste of his lover's delicious milk. Almost immediately, he fell onto his knees with his hands pressed flat against her palm, apologizing profusely as his eyes lingered on the mouthwatering liquid leaking from Shenny's nipple. Shenny stifled a giggle as she watched her tiny lover prostrate himself before her glorious bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... you certainly <i>sound </i>like you're sorry... I guess I can overlook what you did, just this once\" she said before slowly closing her fingers around him. \"That said, I'm still gonna have to teach you a lesson\" she said before lowering his body to the ground. Puncher watched as she sank to her knees, taking great care to align her boobs with his body. He knew exactly what the giantess had in mind for him and quickly braced himself for what was to come. Shenny's approach was far more restrained than the last time she had \"punished\" him due to her having adopted a greater appreciation for foreplay since then. Her breasts descended on him slowly, allowing him to drink in their sheer enormity as they approached. The eager hero wrapped his arms around her massive mounds, lashivishing them in kisses even as they pinned his body to the ground. There wasn\u2019t the slightest bit of fear or apprehension in his mind. All he cared about at that moment was showing Shenny\u2019s breasts the appreciation they deserved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny smiled at his attempts to please her, though it didn\u2019t make her ease up as she pressed the entirety of her body weight onto him with her  head resting on her folded arms. There was barely any room for Puncher to move as he was flattened by a mountain of tit flesh. Yet even as he laid there completely immobilized and increasingly soaked in her sweat, he couldn\u2019t help but find his predicament incredibly arousing as his stiff member jabbed against her boob. His subconscious kink for being squished had come to the forefront and it showed in how he continued to kiss and hump against his meaty prison. There really was no competition in his mind as to who\u2019s tits were superior between her and Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny smiled happily as she laid there for a few hours, allowing her lover to worship her boobs even while he was being punished by them. To keep things from getting dull she would occasionally grind them back and forth, giggling as she felt his pecker rub along her boob with every movement. There were times when she would feel her nipple brush along his head, though he showed remarkable restraint in keeping his hands away from it. He knew he was being disciplined and had to earn the privilege. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a well behaved little boyfriend~\u201d she giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After awhile she began to tire of her game and and decided to bring it to an end. She sat up and smirked as she looked down to find her boyfriend missing from the boob shaped groves left in the earth. She didn\u2019t need to be a mind reader to know where he was. With an exaggerated sigh she reached down and peeled Puncher\u2019s flattened form off the surface of her breast, laughing as she took notice to the thick trail of spunk dripping from his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it looks like someone enjoyed themselves. Kinda defeats the purpose of being punished, but oh well\u201d she joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that\u2026 good\u2026 enough?\u201d he asked between pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes. You've made the girls feel very happy\u201d Shenny cooed. Naturally, she would not let his efforts go unrewarded. She grinned as she brought him to her swollen nipple once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on. You\u2019ve more than earned it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuncher didn\u2019t need to be told twice. He wrapped his arms around her teat and went to work squeezing and licking it to draw out her milk. Soon enough he was gulping down the sweet substance in mouthfuls, his constant prodding causing his colossal lover to shudder and moan as he fed from her. Eventually he pulled away from her nipple, his stomach plump and his expression that of intense satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u2026 I needed that\u2026\u201d he said before letting out a light blech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. But never forget that I can always cut you off, so watch yourself\u201d she jokingly threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that bit of business taken care off, Shenny began thinking of other ways they could have fun before heading off to bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seeing the little hero all clean again reminded her she'd been bearhugging the smelly giant rat too. Dipping her muzzle between her big tits she sniffed loudly and groaned. Tiffany's sewer-like odour hung on her body like a filthy drape. Something needed to be done and far more importantly, someone needed to be blamed. With a sultry smile she points an accusatory finger at the superhero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, you left quite a mark there, Punchy. Being a hero is dirty work. Time for you to do your duty, mister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher looked up at his large girlfriend, unsure what she had in mind. With elegant grace she slid herself backwards over the edge of the spring, dipping her vast body into the clear water. Intentionally or otherwise the hero was given a spectacular view of her beautiful body. Even after being mashed beneath her tits for hours, blowing his load over and over smothered in pure bliss, he still felt his loins stir with lust. He didn't get to drool for too long. A large arm lifted up from the pool, the wolfess waving her finger, beckoning him closer. He flew up to see her laid out in the pool, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to bearhug that stinky rat into submission, so it's high time you help me rid myself of her stench. Start rubbing, hero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bemused Pint Puncher was unsure of the intentions of his giant lover, but he gratefully seized on another opportunity to be close to her tits. He dashed in to vanquish the evil that is Tiffany's stench and set to rubbing every part of the soft boob with vigor. As much as he was putting his back into cleaning his lover, it still wasn't thorough enough for Shenny's tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'm thinking a bit too small here. You're no good at cleaning my godly body, but maybe you just need a helping hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed hold of the Pint Puncher and rubbed him over the jiggly surface of her rack. It felt great for both wolfess and superhero turned sponge. Feeling the endless softness brush past his exposed manhood was arousing, heat building in his loins. Then again, that might just be the friction of being rubbed all over. Soon her bountiful chest was clean and the hero was lowered to her strong belly. Beneath the wet fur he felt a powerful core. No wonder she could crush Tifanny so easily. The rat might have assets for days, but everything inbetween was flabby and unkempt. Where Shenny found the time to keep herself in such great shape between hormone-fueled rampages is anyone's guess. But the resulting beauty is undeniable, whether he's ogling from afar or being rubbed against every perfect inch of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon his little slice of heaven was upheaved again as Shenny rolled onto her side, bringing the squirming man to her shapely bottom. Much like her tits the softness of her butt was immeasurable. The musty stench was a bit of a downer, but thankfully she didn't completely commit to using the hero to clean her butt. He'd be spared the depths of her asscrack... for now. The wolfess needed her little man in mint condition. She laid back against the smooth rocks surrounding the spring, nestling the hero between her boobs. With her eyes on the setting sun she seems lost in thought for a moment before bursting with giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" The hero asks, curious and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just hit me... you managed to get an advantage over Tiffany by giving her a titty twister. The big hero of the day, saving everyone by pinching a nipple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You would've done the same if you were pressed up against those rancid tits of hers. Hell, when she was put in her tiny cage she even tried to seduce me. You've no idea how close I came to twisting the other one too, just to shut her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher's comfortable surroundings quake as the wolfess bellows with laughter. The mental image of the superhero leaning down to pinch tiny Tiffany's nipple was too much. He was flung around, desperately trying to keep a hold of the boobs that were housing him. By the time Shenny had calmed herself he was hanging from her right nipple, hoisting himself back up onto the soft surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should rename you to the Pint Pincher.\" She said, barely containing a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we now?\" The superhero said mockingly, a devious smirk on his face. Before she knew it, the hero kneeled down and reached for the soft flesh crowning her luscious round boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't. You. Dare...\" the wolfess warned him. In response he grabbed hold a little tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's my name again?\" He said with the same smug tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pint Puncher, you're the Pint Puncher.\" Shenny yelped. The hero's strong grip on her sensitive nipple was causing it to harden. Though she imagined herself much tougher, she'd seen Tiffany's reaction to this trick. Even she felt the tiniest sting then, a brief instant of empathy for the rat. Right now she was undoubtedly hamming up her fear, if only so she could get twice the payback later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought.\" He let go of the smooth surface, gently patting it to soothe the anxious wolfess. She didn't really think he'd go through with it, did she? Also, were those nipples rock hard before, or did she actually like his little stunt a lot?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With that bit if excitement done the hero nestled back into the comfortable confines of her cleavage. After the stunt he had pulled, Shenny was tempted to pay him back by squeezing her tits together with him sandwiched in between, but opted to save it for another time. The events of the day had left her a tad tuckered out, so she was more than happy to just sit with him and enjoy the sight of the setting sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They both sat there in silence, both of them reflecting on their second day working as a team. Shenny was still kicking herself for ever letting the slightest bit of doubt enter her mind. How could she let that vapid rodent get to her like that? She knew nothing about their relationship or the love they shared. Her boyfriend had committed himself to helping her rehabilitating her image with Glam City, an act that could\u2019ve easily caused a considerable amount of friction between him citizens of the city. He had put his reputation on the line just to give her a second chance, something that he\u2019d never do unless he really saw potential for good in her. In Tiffany\u2019s mind, the hero was nothing more than a pervert with a closeted love for giant women. How naive she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero\u2019s thoughts lied elsewhere as he thought back to the aftermath of their fierce battle and Tiffany\u2019s parting words. He wanted to dismiss it as nothing more than standard supervillainesque monologuing, but he knew there was more to it than that. The look in her eyes had chilled him to the very core; the look of crazed abject desire, not unlike the looks that Shenny would give when she would force helpless citizens into her pussy. Except Shenny\u2019s look could at the very least be somewhat justified in that she was tending to her insatiable libido while Tiffany didn\u2019t share such a trait. No, her motives were made quite clear as she was being hauled away. She wanted him, every part of him, and she wanted to usurp Shenny\u2019s place in his heart. The very thought of it made him want to retch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Punchy\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero\u2019s thoughts were interrupted as he shifted his attention back to his statuesque lover. It was clear that something was on her mind by the expression on her face, though she seemed hesitant to speak her mind at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know we\u2019ve only been together for like, three days right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero raised a brow in surprise. He hadn\u2019t even considered how little time had passed since they fought against each other as enemies. It was nothing short of surreal how drastically their opinions of one another had changed in amounted to a single day. They had gone from bitter rivals to passionate lovers just like that. Shenny seemed to share this epiphany as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it normal? For you humans, I mean\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d the hero asked tilting his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it normal for you all to fall in love in such a short amount of time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really. There\u2019s that whole thing of \u2018love at first sight\u2019, but honestly, that\u2019s a whole load of bunk\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny nodded, though it was evident that his answer was not the want she wanted to hear. Puncher laughed and gave her chest a reassuring pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it matter anyway? You and I aren\u2019t so normal ourselves. You\u2019re a giant wolf lady and I\u2019m a superpowered guy with an affinity for spandex. \u2018Normal\u2019 isn\u2019t something that folks like us do\u201d he said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, when you put it like that\u2026\u201d Shenny giggled as she stroked him on the top of his head with her finger. He always knew just what to say in order to bring her right back out of her funk. Who cares if their relationship was only a few days long? All that mattered was that they were happy together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The wolfess sighed and turned her attention back to the setting sun. To think, she had initially brought him into her home with the intent of making him a servant. She was ashamed at the selfish person she once was, but if she could go back in time to the exact moment where the thought of enslaving him entered her mind, she wouldn\u2019t change a thing. As bad as her actions were, they inevitably lead to them getting together and her getting molded into a better person. In the end, through a series of contrived coincidences and dumb luck, everything turned out for the better.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun dipped past the horizon and Shenny carefully got up. The pint-sized superhero nestled in her boobs was moving so little he might be asleep. Try as she might, her steps and the resulting jiggle roused the hero from his slumber. He looked around for a second before realizing he was being carried home. Like a content cat he laid his head back down on the soft-furred boob. The journey didn't have any further interruptions with the exception of one unfortunate deer accidentally finding itself under her foot. With a bright blush Shenny fished the flattened animal from under her foot, quickly swallowing it to hide the evidence. Even titanic wolfesses had to eat and quick snacks like these were always a nice treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving back home she doesn't waste another moment. Her worn-out body yearned for rest and her bed looked ever so inviting. Carefully she shuffled onto the soft expanse of her bed, making sure the Pint Puncher didn't fall from her breasts. Once she was in position she looked down at the hero, comfortably nestled between her tits. With the sweetest voice she whispered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puuuunchy... look what I have... It's a little present...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill half asleep the hero looked up, seeing his girlfriend's huge smile. She seemed unsettlingly cheery for this hour of the night. And why was she holding her tits. Was this about the...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Shenmmmbbbmhl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis protests were cut short by an avalanche of boobflesh smashing into him from both sides. Mercilessly she ground her tits together, squeezing the Pint Puncher between them. He seemed to play along well, providing all the futile wiggling Shenny could dream of. Like a hungry monster the soft masses chewed up the hero, squishing him flat between their imposing forms. Overhead the wolfess huffed and moaned, arousal building as she felt the puny superhero squirm. She finally released him from this one-sided wrestling match with her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, Punchy. I don't know what came over them. Normally they never do this. Though if someone were to try and <i>twist</i> them, they might make an exception.\" Shenny said, mirroring his smug tone from before. With a drawn-out groan the hero acknowledged he'd been outclassed. Quickly she lifted him back onto his feet, inviting him to sleep in her soft rack with the promise it wouldn't spontaneously try to squeeze him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe casually stepped back, saying he'd rather go somewhere less... squeezy tonight. With an insincere smile the wolfess offered him all the options her body provided, putting on a voice like a used car salesman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you could try my big, strong thighs. Those have definitely never squished anything like a grape between their relentless strength. Or maybe you're more of an ass man. My butt can clench with enough force to crush cars, perfect for a squeeze-free sleeping spot. Though if you want the perfect escape from any squeezing at all, might I suggest the pussy? Absolutely certain to be in no way capable of crushing you until you faint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying along in her little act, the Pint Puncher replied. \"The pussy, you say? Why that sounds interesting. I should take a close look and hope that in no way I'm pushed in deep.\" The wolfess' bikini bottom never made it to the bed, hanging on a nearby chair. Her pussy was already glistening with anticipation, radiating her feminine musk. The path was clear and before long the hero stood before the gaping entrance. He warmed up his lover with a few gentle licks and before long her hand came in to guide him into her moist depths. He found himself buried deep within the most intimate folds of Shenny's snatch. As she promised, the pressure was barely noticeable, merely squeezing him at every opportunity and soaking him with her arousal. A bedchamber fit for a king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take the superhero long to find a comfortable sleeping spot. Shenny felt him slow down and fall asleep, finally seeing an opportunity for some rest herself. She sure wouldn't get much sleep with him crawling around in her sensitive love tunnel. There was a time, not even a week ago, where she'd would've now tried to crush the life out of him, rendering the hero into more of her hot release. What a tragedy that would've been. The lovely Pint Puncher, light of her life, reduced to a puddle of cum. She silently thanks the little hero in her pussy for all he'd done to open her eyes so far. Metaphorically speaking at least, because her eyes were ready to close for some sweet dreams.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> As Shenny slowly drifted into a peaceful slumber, she began to dream of her future working as Glam City's first superheroine. In her dream she was treading through the city patrolling for any potential evildoers, her typically thunderous footsteps coming down with great delicacy as to not damage the streets. Her presence was regarded not with panicked screams and fearful whispers, but with cheers of adulation and gratitude. Occasionally one of her more bold admirers would wolf whistle at her, and while she found a bit of enjoyment in such flattery, she would politely reject their advances. Her heart belonged to but a single man. Speaking of which, where was he? She looked around expecting her lover to be hovering close by but he was no where to be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenny, help! I am in trouble!\" Puncher's voice called out in a stilted and exaggerated matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The wolfess puffed her chest out with a confident smile as her ears quickly picked up on the direction of his voice. No doubt her lover had gotten into a bit of hot water with some kind of superpowered menace. With no time to waste she bounded off in the direction of his cried, taking great care to not accidentally step on one of the many hapless citizens. She skidded to a halt once she finally reached her destination, the first national bank of Glam City. One of the walls have been caved and many citizens were either on the ground unconscious or gasping for air. The infamous Helen stood in front of the bank laughing maniacally, her hands holding bags of stolen money. Pint Puncher had his face buried deep between the villainous hippo's meaty cheeks, his body twitching with every brassy fart that was shot into his fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again I, Helen, reign supreme over Glam City's mightiest hero! Now I will claim him as my prize and wisk him away to a lifetime of torment! Most likely gas related!\" she bellowed with an over-dramatic flair. Shenny\u2019s naive perception of superheroes and supervillains had a noticeable effect the setting in which her dream took place as everyone seemed incapable of speaking in anything other than stereotypical monologues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast, Helen!\" Pint Puncher said as he pulled his head away from her rear to do speak. \"You may have beaten me, but this city still has--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was cut off as Helen let loose yet another greasy fart into his face, her hands clutched over her mouth to stifle her laughter. After a minute long coughing fit, Puncher glared up at her angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Let me at least finish before you get at it again!\" he barked irritably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry! I couldn't resist~\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, where was I...? Oh yeah. You may have bested me, but this city still has one last line of defence! My partner Shenny will come and make quick work of you, you vile villain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! You can\u2019t fool me, Pint Puncher!\" Helen laughed as she shoved his face back into her smelly buttcrack. \"There\u2019s no way that you managed to get Shenny to renounce her evil ways!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny grinned as she stepped forward, slamming her foot down hard into the concrete to get their attention. That was a setup line if she ever heard one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think again, Helen!\" Shenny called as she stepped up to the bank, towering over the two with her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! It can\u2019t be! You managed to get the beautiful and powerful Shenny to become a superhero!?\" Helen gasped in exaggerated surprise as she looked up at the colossal heroine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\u2019s right, Helen! I\u2019m here to bring an end to your smelly reign of terror! Let my boyfriend go and surrender quietly and I promise you\u2019ll be treated well in the Institute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't stomp on me, Shenny! Not unless you want to risk turning your boyfriend into a pancake along with me!\" Helen said as she wiped Puncher\u2019s face up and down her immense crevice of her buttcrack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmph hhmph mmph hmpph!\u201d Puncher shouted fruitlessly as his voice was completely muffled in a sea of hippo ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what was that?\u201d Helen asked as she pulled his face out for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>said</i>, don\u2019t worry about me, Shenny! Hurry up and-- mmph!\u201d Once again his speech was cut off by Helen shoving his face back into her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough of that\u201d she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Punchy but if I were to hurt you in my fight for justice, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to forgive myself\u2026!\u201d Shenny said putting the back of her hand on her forehead dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! Your love for Pint Puncher has brought about your undoing! I have no such weakness, for I am a villain of the highest caliber!\u201d the sinister hippo chortled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny huffed and placed a hand to her chin. It was clear to her that Helen held all the cards in this dispute. If she tried to pluck her comparatively smaller body off the ground, there\u2019s no telling what the vile villain would do to her lover. She had bared witness to the the sight of Helen bending steel between her powerful cheeks, so she dreaded to think what she could do to Puncher\u2019s ensnared head. Eventually an idea came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a proposal, Helen! Let my boyfriend go and face me one on one! I win, you turn yourself into the Institute! If you win, not only will I allow you to have my boyfriend as a prize, but you can keep me as your permanent slave! I\u2019ll even shrink myself down to make things fair!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen\u2019s eyes widened as she licked her lips. Two slaves and all she needed to do is beat her in a fight? How could she turn such an offer down?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a deal, Shenny!\" She shouted before pulling Pint Puncher free from her ass and letting him fall lifelessly onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Let\u2019s take this fight to the city limits. No need to drag any innocents into our battle\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t want your fans to see you lose, huh? Fine. I\u2019ll play along\u201d Helen said with a smirk as she began to make her way out of the city with Shenny tagging along behind her. Of course the despicable villainess didn\u2019t really intend to fight a fair battle. The moment she agreed to the proposal, she already had half a dozen ideas on how to go about winning through dishonest means. She was a villain afterall. Cheating was practically a prerequisite for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She didn\u2019t get very far out of the city when something caught her attention. She looked around and was surprised to see no citizens running away from her. Normally there would be a whole gaggle of them walking about before immediately running off in a panic once they realized that she was coming. She also noticed that he had gotten dark. Like, really dark. So dark that it looked like something was blocking out the sun. A cloud perhaps? No, that wasn\u2019t it. She turned around to see what it was causing the sudden darkness and swallowed as she saw what had to be the most horrifying sight she had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n While her back was turned, Shenny had lept high into the air and hugged her legs into her chest, literally cannonballing down towards her. As the massive heroine came down at her like a furry meteorite, Helen instantly felt regret for every misdeed she had ever committed. The impact sent shock waves throughout entirety of Glam City. The street between her was completely demolished beneath Shenny, but she couldn\u2019t care less. The damage was repairable and no one got hurt. That was what mattered the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She sighed and slowly stood to her feet, grinning as he could feel the hippo\u2019s flattened body stuck to her butt. Deciding to add insult to injury, Shenny bit down on her lit and let out a powerful fart of her own, rattling the window of every building in a five block radius. She awaited for the smell to die down before reaching back and peeling Helen\u2019s body off before bringing it up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-that\u2026 wasn\u2019t fair\u2026\u201d Helen whimpered weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSays who?\u201d Shenny snickered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that nasty bit of business taken care of, Shenny strolled over to the I.S.E.A where she was greeted by the jubilant staff. They took the flattened hippo off of her hands and showered her with many words of praise and admiration. It wasn\u2019t long before Puncher showed up, his body covered in bandages from his fight against Helen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did it again, Shenny! You\u2019re the best partner I could\u2019ve ever asked for!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPint Puncher\u2019s moist resting spot jostled ever so slightly as Shenny tossed and turned in her sleep. The constant rocking had woken him up, though he wasn't too bothered by it. As he laid there listening to her mumble in her sleep, he couldn't help but wonder what it was she was dreaming about. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Days ticked by with few highlights. The two heroes relaxed by the springs, in the woods and in Shenny's home. The supervillains of Glam City were quiet. With the exception of one guy so unknown they'd already forgotten his name five minutes after flattening his villainous hopes and dreams. The I.S.E.A. was grateful all the same. Not much fame to be garnered this way, the wolfess lamented. The Pint Puncher cautioned her to be patient. Recognition and adoration would find her in time. He knew well that these evildoers never stayed quiet for very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps they've gotten scared? I'd think twice about doing evil stuff if I had to contend with a towering beauty like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, these guys are far too full of themselves to let something like that distract them. They'll be around soon enough, just you wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And whilst they're finding the guts to act, how about you be a good boyfriend and bring those superpowered lips to your lover.\" She said, beckoning him in with a finger and a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away, my love.\" He said, flying to her pursed lips. The two locked into a passionate kiss, time freezing as they embrace the moment. Glam City might be quiet, but the nights with Shenny most certainly weren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery night sparks fly as the two get into ever more imaginative lewd games. No part of Shenny's huge, beautiful body is left unattended. His gentle touch caresses her breasts, pussy and more. Almost every night culminates in the hero being stuffed deep between her tits or swallowed up by her pussy. From there the smooth symphony of her body carries him to vivid dreams of her. His large girlfriend is no different, dreaming up myriad horny fantasies. Those she can remember the next day she'll eagerly try to make a reality. Be it a lengthy session of mawplay or smothering the hero beneath her heavy butt, he seems up for just about anything. How could she have spent so many years looking for the right man and never noticed he was right there all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning was no different from previous mornings. The hero had barely been given a chance to wake up before he found himself getting suckled further and further into her maw. Only when Shenny's plush lips pursed around his neck did she stop, leaving the Pint Puncher at the mercy of her tongue. With practice and no mercy at all she assailed his crotch, lapping and slobbering all over his cock. He gasped in wonder at her gentle and arousing touch.The tongue seemed to notice his expression and tightly wrapped around his body, squeezing it a little. Can't have her little hero go soft now, can she? In mere moments she brought him to a powerful climax. Greedily she lapped up every drop, suckling on the limp rod for everything he could offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Shenny. Nice to see you're up already.\" He joked, still up to his neck in her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give me that tone, mister. Your little pecker was hard as rock this morning, you wanted this as much as I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's called morning wood. Men have random boners in the morning all the time.\" he explained. Whether she missed the point or willfully misunderstood him he couldn't tell, but her broadening smile was bordering on unsettling. \"Oh really?! How very interesting.\" Something told the hero he was about to find himself waking up to her sucking him off a whole lot more. Of all the problems he could have, being woken a little early by a blowjob seemed almost too good to be true. They play around some more and share breakfast when a distant siren disturbs their romantic meal. Glam City is in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's about time.\" Shenny says with a smile. \"Let's see who's in for a world of hurt today.\" She pulls on her 'uniform' and stuffs the hero between her tits. With great strides they reach the outskirts of town. Things seem relatively quiet until they spot a big dust cloud billowing up from a downtown mall. That must be the source of the disturbance. The superhero flies up to his girflriend's face and plants a tiny smooch on her muzzle before flying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dust clouds obscure the mall, but the Pint Puncher can hear heavy steps. Someone distinctly not human is in there. He keeps his distance from the dust, not wanting his unknown enemy to have any shot at an ambush. Who would attack a mini mall anyway? So many candidates sprung to mind it's probably easier to list who wouldn't attack these places. The crowds of people, the many stores selling expensive items, these places were villain-magnets. He can't tell precisely why, but the superhero feels someone leering at him from down below. The steps ring again, much faster this time. Either this villain was really fast or he was about to fight more than one adversary. Whoever it might be, he had his targets set. Shenny was waiting in the woods, ready to crush them for justice. No matter the foe, they will prevail.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> As the dust began to settle, Puncher could finally nake out the figures standing in front of the decimated mini-mall. A knot formed in the pit of his stomach, as the perpetrators behind this attack were revealed to be the notorous team of superpowered mares known as Mare Storm. It was clear that the group had been anticipating  his arrival as they soon turned their attention his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lookie who it is, girls! Our favorite little superhero~\" Lovey crooned excitedly. Her ability to control minds was on full display as she had numerous store employees happily doting on her as she sat back against a makeshift throne of rubble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about time he showed up. I still owe him a beating for our last encounter...\" Brawny grumbled as she rubbed <br>\r\nthe spot on her muzzle where the hero had clocked her but good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in line, Brawny! I called first shot on him back at base, remember?\" Squishy protested as she placed her hands on her enormous hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have him after I'm done beating him into the ground\" Brawny growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I both know that there won't be anything left of him by the time you're done!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's my problem how?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the two colossal mares bickered with each other, Pint Puncher was taking the opportunity to assess the situation. Mare Storm had proven themselves to be one of his most dangerous of foes do in part to their numbers advantage and diverse range of abilities. The first time he had fought them, he didn't so much as get a single blow in before they proceeded to thoroughly decimate and humilate him. Still, that was more the result of them having caught him off guard than anything else. His subsequent encounters with the group, while acceptionally challenging, eventually resulted in his victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n That said, his primary goal was still to lure them out of the city so he and Shenny could fight them as a team. Delivering Mare Storm to the I.S.E.A all but guaranteed them a generous reward. To accomplish this feat, he'd have to think on his feat. Lovey, the defacto leader of the group, was far more cunning than her bubbly attitude let on. That accompanied by her mind control powers made for a lethal combination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the holdup, little fella? Come on down and play with us!\" Gummy giggled as they peered up at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! We promise we won't hurt you too bad this time~\" Gassy added with a mischievous grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher grimaced as he considered his options. They didn't seem to be in the know regarding his relationship with Shenny. Otherwise they would've made some mention of it while they taunted him. He their lack of awareness to his advantage, but still left him with the question of how he would go about luring him outside the city. Taking the approach he did with Derek would be risky. If even one of them got their hands on him, they could cause some serious damage. Gummy and Lovey were the most dangerous in that respect, as their powers were tailor made to incapacitate. He could try taunting them like he had done Tiffany, but the only person who'd fall for it would be the temperamental Brawny. All things considered, there didn't seem to be an easy solution to this dilemma. He had to act quickly though, lest the villainous mares grow suspicious to his inactivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After weighing his options a bit, he decided that the most effective course of action would be to... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He needed a ruse. A trick that would send all five members of Mare Storm chasing after him. If he goaded them, Lovey was likely to catch on to his plan, but how else could he get the mares to follow him? There was one possibility. They'd never see this coming, and it might just prove too tempting to ignore. He swallowed his pride and put on the biggest, most scared expression he could muster. With a shaking finger and quivering voice he pointed at them and stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... not you... not here... not today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he flew off. The mares were bemused at first, but none could resist. Lovey's smile grew tenfold. Whatever horrified the hero, she was going to grab him and make it a hundred times worse. The others gave chase too, eager to discover what had the mighty Pint Puncher turning tail and running away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero flew erratically along the main street. Not for a moment did he want to give his pursuers the impression this was all part of a greater plan. He would lead them to Shenny to even the odds. Without the wolfess' help Mare Storm posed a considerable challenge. Though they rarely gang up on him all at once, they have no problem taking turns and beating him down the moment he loses the upper hand. Being afraid of them wasn't hard to act, since even his past victories had left him bruised and beaten by the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrawny had personally seen to many to the bruises, delighting in using the hero as a punching bag. Her twenty foot stature and muscular form were a serious threat. Squishy was no smaller, yet weighed so much more. A fact she'd gladly demonstrated on multiple occasions by planting her enormous ass on top of him. A shiver ran down his spine at the mere thought of it. Gummy lacked the sheer size of her sisters, but even her relatively petite frame stood thrice as tall as him. Her ability to render his body into a gummy mass was terrifying as there seemed to be no end to the things they'd do to him in that state. He'd been chewed on, stretched into a thong and even inserted in some very unsavory places. The most foul of those belonged to Stinky, the stench specialist of their little team. Every part of her body was soaked in an odour so horrid it could strip paint. Her gas felt potent enough to corrode metal and on the few occasions he'd been forced close to the source he'd been unable to smell anything else for days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them he feared more than Lovey. The others might be able to bruise his body, but she had access to his mind. In her thrall, people would obey her every command, and he knew he was no different. He'd done unspeakable things to her in this state. He'd let her live out her most depraved fantasies before giving the others a turn. Only suffering extensive trauma could snap him out of it. He'd been lucky Brawny played too rough with him or he might still have been under her dominion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time would be different though. He had an ally waiting in the wings to turn the tables. An ally three times as big as even the tallest member of Mare Storm. Much like with Derek he pretended to be too occupied by the mares chasing him to see the titanic wolfess ahead. Only when the horses stopped in their tracks did he slow down, nearly smacking into Shenny's leg. All eyes were on the hero. Six villains had him surrounded, each of them at least three times his size and all but one of them ready to unleash a world of pain. Shenny was first to respond, lifting her huge foot over the Pint Puncher. All of Mare Storm had a front row seat to the savage stomping about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BOOM!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mares all gasped in shock as the foot came down on Gummy. The sole drove her into the ground, cracks in the earth radiating from the impact. As adept as she might be at turning others to gum, her own body wasn't quite so capable at absorbing weight. The arms and legs jutting out from under Shenny's foot were motionless, a swift KO. One down, four to go. With a cocky smile the superhero spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're not the only team around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mares knew they'd been duped. How he managed to convince Shenny to join his side was a question for later. Right now they readied themselves for an epic battle. The heroes too prepared. Though Gummy might be out for the count, the others would be fighting even harder now. Brawny was snorting angrily, Squishy looked ready to sit on him for a year straight and Stinky looked up to the wolfess. Lovey tried her hardest to survey the situation, but there was no time. The showdown of the century was about to commence.</span></div></div>",

Without Gummy there to provide support, the group struggled to hold their own against the crime fighting couple. Gummy's powers typically left Pint Puncher unable to properly defend himself and defeating him while he was able bodied and well rested proved a greater challenge than the group was accustomed to. The presence of his titanic partner didn't help things, as the team had to bob and weave the giant's heavy foot falls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Stinky was the second mare to meet her end as Shenny came down on her rear first before letting loose a fart of her own. Squishy followed suit as Puncher swooped in and delivered a jaw jacking uppercut to her, knocking the hefty anthro out cold. With two members left in the fray, Brawny shifted her focus from trying to attack Puncher to playing defensive for Lovey. No matter what happened to the rest of them, Lovey's safety was a priority above all else. Her superpower, while effective, served the purpose of compensating for her lackluster physical prowess. She may have been stronger than the strongest human, but that meant little compared to someone of Pint Puncher's immense power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The leader of Mare Storm was left utterly helpless against this new threat, her mind controlling abilities rendered absolutely useless. For her to properly utilize her powers, she needed to come into contact with her prey, or at the very least be in close proximity of them. Shenny made this feat impossible for her to manage, as she created a fair amount of distance between them and the superhero. There were some instances were he'd come just close enough for her to use her charm, but by then his colossal partner would force them to separate with the threat of being squashed beneath her heel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It wasn't long before Brawny was finally taken out of the fight as Punchy managed to successfully trip up the hulking brute by dashing into her legs. Shenny was quick to dispatch of her, jumping onto on the dazed mare with both feet and knocking her out instantly. Lovey watched in absolute horror as the titanic wolfess casually scraped her teammate off of her foot as though she were nothing more than an old candy wrapper. It didn't feel right to be on the wrong side of a beating. Even when Pint Puncher managed to overcome their teamwork and greater numbers, they still at the very least managed to get a few good licks in beforehand. Never before that they been so thoroughly dissected and outclassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The petrified mare began to slowly back up as the two heroes quickly put her teammates into one big pile. It was only a matter of time before they turned their attention back to her and when that happened, there was very little she could do to defend herself. With no team to back her up, she had to think on her feet in order to come out of this unscathed. The most obvious option at her disposal would be to surrender quietly. Pint Puncher didn't seem the type to turn down a chance at peaceful resolution, though that didn't account for his gigantic partner. Her team hadn't had much personal interaction with Shenny in the past, but she had seen enough of her to know that she was far from merciful. After racking her brain for a more optimal solution, something came to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Lovey. Your team's been beaten and we've got you cornered. I think it's about time to called it quits\" Pint Puncher said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you... I... I'll never let you catch me!\" Lovey cried as she began sprinting for the city. Pint Puncher was quick to give pursuit, his fists clenched tight in preparation. Little did he know, he was playing right into Lovey's hand. The cunning mare had been quick to discern the reasoning behind his deception. Despite her sudden shift to heroism, the lumbering wolfess was forced to keep away from the city. Lovey posited that Shenny's prior history as a villain played a part in it, though the how and why if it didn't really matter. What <i>really</i> mattered to her was the obvious advantage it provided. Shenny wouldn't come near the city, meaning Pint Puncher would have to break away from her in order to prevent Lovey from escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lovey could hear the hero behind her, his superior speed allowing him to quickly close the distance between them. Once he was in range, she quickly turned to face him, her arms outstretched as she pull her all into casting her seductive aura onto him. The moment he came within three feet of her, his tense body went limp, his eyes becoming unfocused as the momentum of his speedy flight resulted in him flopping lifelessly into her arms. It wasn't often that Lovey used all of her power at once, as she found it a greater joy to break down her victim's will to fight before allowing their mind to slip into a deep state of hypnosis. Given the urgency of her situation however, she didn't have time to mess around. A wicked grin spread along her face as she looked down at the now vacant stare of the superhero. He had been so bold as to lure his team into a trap, so it felt cathartic to return the favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puncher... are you listening right now?\" she asked softly as she caressed his head gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The enraptured superhero didn't answer right away, his eyes twitching and his muscles trembling as he fought against her influence. Lovey smiled down at him as she rubbed his shoulders, her hands glowing a dull pink as she continued to hold of his mind. It wouldn't be long before Shenny noticed what was happening, so she had to act quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little hero... you won't let the big bad wolf come get me, right? You'll protect me to the very end...\" she whispered down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher's eyes went wide. The heartless fiend actually expected him to turn on his girlfriend! A battle was being waged in his mind between his undying loyalty towards Shenny and Lovey's hypnotic influence. Every time the thought of resisting entered his mind, it would be undercut by thoughts of how beautiful Lovey was and how wonderful it would be to submit to her. Doubt began to show on Lovey's face as she looked down at the hero. Up until then, no one had ever been able to resist the full strength of her mind control. Would he be the first to overcome her ability?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lovey looked the diminutive hero deep in his vacant eyes. Her hypnotic powers flowed into him but he was amazingly resilient to her will. There was a bond between him and Shenny that was hard to break. But she'd broken him before and she'll do it again. She focused her energy, tearing away at his mental barriers until he was exposed and weak. Her hands glowed brightly as she rubbed his chest, shoulders and head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, Punchy, let me in. You don't wanna hurt me, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero shook his head meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't want that big, mean wolf to hurt me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, looking behind him to see the concerned wolfess staring at them. She would not lay a hand on his mistress. He would prove his love to her... No... he loves the wolf, not the mistress. His wavering mind shuddered as once again Lovey overwhelmed it with her hypnotic influence. He must attack. He must fight the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare huffed and puffed. Breaking the Pint Puncher was hard work. His mind was fighting her at every turn. Even now he struggled to break free. Once he'd dispatched of his former ally she would pick his brain clean to see where this strength is coming from. And then she and all her sisters would delight in taking their revenge. Slowly they would run him ragged, wearing him down as their own personal plaything. And when he's spent she would stuff him in a cage, just so he could recover for another day of grueling servitude. With him rendered a slave to their whims, Mare Storm would have free reign to do as they please with the people of Glam City. Lovey was panting with exhaustion, but the hero seemed under her control, flying to his next fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny saw the Pint Puncher fly back towards her but something was amiss. Foremost, where was the horse? Did he beat Lovey himself and if so, did he just leave her lying around in the suburb? She couldn't quite put her finger on it but something was wrong. Her boyfriend looked off. She can't put into words what's wrong, but she can tell he's under a spell of some kind. His dead-eyed expression, the fact he's picking up speed, maybe even that he's readying a punch, wait a minute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah, what's gotten into you?!\" Shenny was shocked, her number one boyfriend had just taken a swing at her. Granted it was clumsy enough to dodge, even for someone her size, but what was going on? She snatched the hero from the air and looked at him closely. Up close she could look the struggling Pint Puncher right in his eyes. There was nothing there. No fire, no passion. Even when they were arch-enemies he had this spark of determination pushing him on. The mare. She was responsible for this. She'd taken his fire away. Anxiously the wolfess stood just outside town. There was a villain on the loose in dire need of some violent justice. But she couldn't just leave her boyfriend here. She had to contain him somehow. The wolfess was tempted to wrap some lampposts around him to tie him up, but quickly a much better idea sprung to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher was held tight in the large hand of Shenny. As heavy as her grip was, he could tell it was a fraction of her strength. Why would this evil monster grant him that kind of mercy? His scenery changed as she lowered him to her crotch, pulling open her bikini bottom with her other hand. He was brought before her moist pussy, the powerful scent playing tricks on his mind. He was filled with revulsion and... desire? He vaguely remembered the smell, like he'd been here before. Lovey's hold on him weakened, but his captor was not about to take any risks. With gusto she plunges him into her pussy. The wet walls take a firm hold of him, eliminating any chance of fighting back with powerful squeezes. The crushing pressure paired with the pungent scent worked on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny felt reasonably certain she'd given her boyfriend an appropriate time out, now it was time to show that wretched horse what happens when you mess with his mind. She saw the horse kneeling on all fours. Taking the Pint Puncher's mind had not been easy by the looks of it. A commendable effort that deserved a congratulation. The wolfess already knew exactly what she would give the mare as thanks for mucking with her boyfriend. A nice, long, excruciating squeeze sounded like the perfect gift. But she was in a suburb and the I.S.E.A. would not look kindly on any destroyed homes or worse, dead bystanders. What would the Pint Puncher do in this situation? The wolfess agonized before finally making the tough call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLovey was still panting loudly, her mind hazy from expending such large volumes of her hypnotic energy so quickly. It was all or nothing. Either she'd see the hero defeat the titanic wolfess or she'd be forced to surrender to them. Heavy thumps echo around her, louder and louder. Those two were beating eachother senseless by the sound of it. Finally the mare had caught enough breath to get back on her feet. Her heart nearly skipped a beat as she saw Shenny standing right in front of her. In her dazed state she'd never even recognized the giant's heavy step. Where'd the superhero go? Did she beat him too? A large hand descended, grabbing her by the head and torso. She couldn't see a thing inside the powerful grasp, but she could feel hot breath washing over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hurt my boyfriend...\" Shenny growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLovey gulped, realizing the source of his resilience and the powerful bond between hero and wolfess. She wasn't given time to plead or apologize for her misdeeds. Shenny swung her prey down between her thighs. She slammed them together, encompassing most of the mare's body in muscle. She'd been able to tip-toe along the main road and she would take a similar approach in exiting the city. So far she'd maybe damaged the road a little and crushed one empty car. Acceptable collateral for bringing in five supervillains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please clear a path, coming through, be careful.\" She spoke to the people as she shuffled back out of the city. The tiny men and women quickly scampered. One or two of them even cheered her on, seeing what she was doing to Lovey. Apparently making supervillains wail for mercy is a bit of a crowd pleaser. It's a good thing there wasn't any fight left in Lovey, or the damage would've been much higher. Not even the hero wiggling in her pussy could distract her from doing this right, though he was trying his hardest. With every step she got closer to the woods, and with every step another pained yelp echoed from between her thighs. She ground them together heavily on each and every step, tormenting the evil horse. Perhaps not the most heroic thing to do, but damn did it feel good to put her in her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny reached the other members of Mare Storm, still neatly stacked in a pile of unconscious villains. She sat down and pushed Lovey down to stuff her head between those crushing thighs. With a long and powerful squeeze the leader of the infamous band of mares joined the others in unconsciousness. The wolfess grabbed her from the vice grip of her legs and brought her to the pile, painfully squeezing her one last time before dropping her on top of the other horses. With a fresh stack of large horses awaiting the I.S.E.A. Shenny had time to deal with the hero. She'd kept him on lockdown, squeezing firmly with her inner walls whenever he moved. But with the source of the hypnosis knocked out, was the Pint Puncher still in her control? She eased the crushing pressure and was pleasantly surprised not to feel him trying to punch his way out of this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenny! I'm fine! Can you get me out?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shenny was half tempted to keep him trapped within her pussy as a joke, but quickly dismissed the idea as she pulled him out. She had done a decent job in rehabilitating her image thus far and having Pint Puncher accompanying to the institute might only serve to further irritate them. The last thing she needed was to have their greatest triumph marred by her last of modesty. She wasted no time in bringing her liberated lover up to her maw and cleaning her juices off with her tongue. She wanted to make sure that he was nice and presentable for when they brought in Mare Storm. After drying him off between her lush breasts, she finally allowed him to move independently as she placed him back onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How're your head?\" she asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels like someone tried to poke at my brain with a salad fork...\" the hero groaned as he rubbed his temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing that a little TLC won't fix~\" Shenny cooed as she nudged her tiny lover with her foot. \"For now, we've still got a job to finish. Let's take these troublemakers to the I.S.E.A and get a pat on the back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuncher nodded and went over to the unconscious villains, though Shenny was quick to cut him off as she reached town and scooped them into her arms. While she knew that he was more than capable of lugging the group over to the institute, she didn't want to run the risk of have him be in close proximity to Lovey or Gummy should they suddenly come to. She walked in great strides over to the institute, her heavy footsteps drawing the attention of the city folk. It was nothing short of surreal to see the woman that once brought terror into their hearts walking alongside the great Pint Puncher with the beaten bodies of Mare Storm held tight within her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey eventually arrived at the facility where they were once again greeted by the staff. They still had their reservations regarding Shenny's sudden switch to heroism, though they had long since gotten over the initial shock of it all. That said, even <i>they </i>weren't prepared for the impressive catch the two would bring. Shenny very gently lowered the group onto the ground, less for their sake and more to avoid causing unnecessary damage to the walkway leading up to the building. Defeating Mare Storm proved a relatively simple task for someone of her stature, but in the eyes of the institute, she had performed a herculean feat that demanded their respect and admiration. Not only were Mare Storm high tier supervillains, but their diverse range of abilities provided the them with a cornucopia of research opportunities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fallen wrongdoers were taken hauled off, the head of the facility Mr. Abbott stepped out to greet them. Shenny tensed up at the sight of him, remembering well how he had admonished her not to long ago. The portly director stroked his chin as he peered up at Shenny with a stoic expression, his dull gray eyes seeming to stare right through her. After a long, awkward silence he finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Shenny. May I have a word with you?\" he asked as he gestured to the building. \"It's to my understanding that you're capable of shrinking down to a more compact size. I'd like you and your... significant other to join me in my office\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't bother to wait for them to respond as he walked back into the building. Shenny stood completely bewildered and nervous. He didn't look so impressed with their victory. Had she somehow offended him again? She couldn't think of any other reason why he'd invite her into his the facility. Just as she was about to let her insecurities get the better of her again, Pint Puncher let out a pleased chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable. He actually called you 'Miss'! I guess he\u2019s finally starting to warm up to you\u201d he said before nudging her on the shoulder slightly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You know I\u2019ll back you up no matter what\u201d he whispered before flying down to the entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n His relaxed attitude calmed her considerably as she quickly shrunk herself down to her minimum height of eight feet before walking up to join her lover. She had expected to encounter some difficulty getting into the facility despite her diminished size and was plesantly surprised to see that the doorway was made to accommodate her like. Puncher lead her down the long pristine white halls of the institute, his hand wrapped tightly around her wrist and his thumb gently rubbing on the back of her hand in an attempt to comfort her. He knew that she was never comfortable being that much smaller and her stress would be doubled by stepping into such a tense and potentially hostile environment. As her boyfriend, he would do all he could to alleviate her tension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n News of their latest victory seemed to drastically effect the staffs opinion of the two as they were greeted with polite nods and warm smiles with every person they passed. The timid wolfess smiled back at them, feeling very much out of place. She was accustomed to being looked at with fearful eyes or admiring gazes, but these people didn't seem to view her in either light. She chalked it up to her less imposing size, but she couldn't help but think that there was more to it than that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a quick decent down to the bottom floor of the institute via the elevator, they were once again standing before the director in a spacious office setting. The rural design of the room was a sharp contrast to the rest of the building. Aside from the numerous security monitors surrounding the his circular rosewood desk, his office was bereft of the advanced technology that she had previously seen. The rotund director regarded them with a quick nod before walking over to his desk and sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two certainly have been keeping busy. It's not often that we get such a large influx of specimens in such a short period of time\" he said as he shuffled through the numbers papers on his desk. \"I'm sure you've noticed by now that I'm not the type to give out praise. I don't believe in giving people a pat on the head for doing what they're <i>supposed </i>to. That's just who I am. That said, I'm not so stingy that I can't show gratitude when it's warranted\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He held up a form for them to look at and while neither hero could make out the technical jargon that made up most of the document, they knew it pertained to Shenny due to the photo attached to the side by a paperclip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I have here is a form that, when signed, will grant Shenny a complete pardon for the destruction she's wrought in the past. Meaning you'll be permitted within Glam City so long as you don't maintain the good behavior you've shown up until now\" Abbott explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny gasped and placed a hand over her mouth as her eyes went wide. She had dreamed of being able to go forgo their standard tactic of subterfuge in favor of fighting right beside her tiny lover, though she had long since dismissed this idea as being nothing more than a fantasy. Not only was she being absolved of her past misdeeds, but she was essentially one step closer to making that dream a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god... thank you so much!\" she cried as she reached down to lift him up for a hug. She was stopped as Pint Puncher grabbed onto her arm, his face not quite sharing her enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the catch, Abbott?\" he asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Perspective as always, Pint Puncher. I like that\" he said with a half smile. \"Of course I'm doing this not so much for your interest but for the interest of the institute. As much I'd like to lock up your girlfriend and throw away the key, I'd be doing an active disservice to our cause by doing so. She's helped maintain the peace while providing us with prime candidates for study, making her an irreplaceable asset. I'm more than willing to put my prejudice aside when the greater good calls for it\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all well and good, but that doesn't really answer my question. What is the catch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Abbott smirked and said...</span></div></div>",

What is this going to entail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly smile cropped up on the portly man's face. \"In short, you'll be working for the I.S.E.A. much like your heroic friend. You'll be given all the benefits he has. Things like insurance for collateral damage. I'm sure in your past fights with him you've been punched through a building or two.\" Both hero and wolfess stare at eachother and blush a little. \"The Pint Puncher also enjoys a bit of insurance to make sure he can do his job well without worrying about damage dealt to the city. We'll cover the costs and make sure nobody starts complaining. Though keep in mind our gratitude is not endless. We do still expect you to keep excess damage to a minimum if you can help it. No leveling entire neighborhoods, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good.\" Shenny nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want, we also provide you with clothing options. Let's just say your boyfriend there goes through a lot of spandex. We're ready and prepared to make you an appropriately sized suit too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher chuckles a little and she laughs along heartily. \"I've already told him I don't do spandex, and if it's alright with you, I prefer my current outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbott sighs deeply. He could tell she wasn't going to change her mind. \"Though I cannot officially condone it, if you keep bringing us villains at this rate, I guess I can look the other way. At least it's an improvement over your first appearance here.\" Shenny huffed a little at the idea of covering up her body being an improvement, but more pressing things probed her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, so far this is sounding a lot like what Punchy and I have been doing for you but with a few extra perks.\" Abott's smile faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that brings me to the requirements. A full pardon is not given lightly, and neither is working for the I.S.E.A. There will be expectations of you. First of all, we expect you to place the safety of the city over anything else you might be doing. We need you ready to defend it at a moment's notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny smiled, thinking about their previous encounters with villains. She already got pretty close to doing what the director wanted. Her smile grew when she remember she even once carried the Pint Puncher along in her pussy, just so he could stay in a little bit longer. Making it official of course meant she'd no longer have the excuse of 'the city can wait' when things were heating up between them. But beating up supervillains had only strengthened their passion for eachother. She looked at the hero confidently and spotted a blush on his cheeks. Was he thinking about getting carried into battle in her puss too? She pulled her face back into a serious smirk and turned to Mr. Abott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I can do. Does that also mean I've got to live closer to the city? Because I like being in the forest a lot. No humans around to accidentally step on and all that. It lets me be who I am without endangering anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe director sighed. He would've preferred them as close to the city as possibly, maybe even living in the city. But their past actions were fast enough for his standards. \"If I'm honest with you, Shenny, I would appreciate it if you came to live in the city you're going to protect. At your current size, finding a nice place wouldn't be too difficult for us.\" The wolfess gulped loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that, sir, but I must confess I'm not feeling very comfortable right now. Not just because I feel so small, but also because it takes some effort to stay small. This is not my normal size. It feels strange to explain, but I fear that I might accidentally grow back to my usual height. And I don't think there's any nice places in the city that could withstand that.\" She tried her hardest to offer an explanation that didn't involve wanting some privacy for herself and the Pint Puncher. In truth she mostly wanted the distance so they could live out their deepest sexual desires without anyone interfering. Thankfully Abott seemed to understand her issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could help you be more at ease with your current stature, but I think that at least for now your regular dwelling will do. As long as you keep responding as fast as you have, there should be no issues.\" Shenny smiled politely. \"Thanks for the offer, but I prefer my normal size.\" He sighed again. She continued with a smile. \"If you brainiacs ever find a way to grow as big, you should give it a try.\" They both chuckled a bit at the thought of Mr. Abott being as tall as Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any more requirements we should know off?\" The Pint Puncher interjected. He didn't have much patience for bureaucracy, but he was at least pleasantly surprised his lover was as inquisitive about this deal as he was. Abott always had something up his sleeve, but so far his demands had been reasonable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing out of the ordinary. Standard legal mumbo jumbo that doesn't really affect you. Do you superpowered people even need sick days? Can you even get sick? Holidays, well I reckon you got plenty o those when the villains are too scared to do anything. Just the usual things really, like contacting us whenever you defeat a villain so we can bring them in. Of course if you can haul them to us yourselves that is appreciated. Handling something like Mare Storm would've been quite the logistical enterprise. You have my thanks for saving us a bundle of work on that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All in a day's work.\" Shenny said with a proud smile.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Abbott answered her proud smile with a curt one of his own before fishing through his desk drawer and pulling out a stack of legal forms. Shenny frowned at the imposing sight. She was a simple woman very little understanding of the process of litigation. Her only real frame of reference in making deals came from days of villainy, when she would encounter a fellow evildoer who proved to be more than she could immediately handle. Instead of wasting the time and energy needed to dispatch of them, she would attempt to meet them halfway, offering one or two concessions in order to keep them out of her hair. Her deals were never anything more complicated than \u201cstay away from this area\u201d, or \u201cdon't touch this building\u201d, and they were generally upheld through the honor system rather than any written forms. It didn't seem to occur to Abbott that a being who'd spent most of her life living in the woods wouldn't have a solid grasp of the concept of paperwork, though he was quick to take notice upon seeing the expression on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust sign on the dotted line\u201d he explained as he placed the papers in front of her, along with a fountain tip pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then...\u201d Shenny muttered, grabbing the pen into her large palm and staring down at the form. She had a general idea of where she was suppose to sign, but it suddenly dawned on her that she had never actually used a pen before. Someone of her great size was accustomed to vocalizing her intentions rather than writing them down. Still, she tried her best to scribble her name onto the document, her eyes narrowed in focus as she moved slowly to avoid accidentally snapping the pen in two between her thick fingers. By the end, her signature was wholy unrecognizable chicken scratch, though she and Abbott seemed satisfied all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent. That settles things for now. You two can go now\u201d He said before swiveling his office chair until his back was facing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher had half a mind to scold him for his lack of tact but thought better of it. His less than pleasant tone didn't negate the good that he had done for his colossal lover. Now that she was allowed back into the city, they could tear through the criminal underworld as a team like he had originally envisioned. He could stomach a few rude comments and a bit of paperwork if it meant that he could remain close to Shenny even while working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much, Mr. Abbott! I won't let you down!\u201d Shenny chimed excitedly as she jumped to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmhm\u201d the portly director grumbled as he waved them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, the two departed through the elevator. The ride up was punctuated by silence as the two daydreamed of adventures yet to come. Shenny in particular was eager to get started, as she wanted so badly to make her dream a reality. Once they reached surface level, the elevator door opened to reveal a familiar sight. A stocky woman stood before them, regarding the Puncher with a cold, disengaged expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo. You're done chatting up the director I take it? Good. I got something for you\u201d she said dryly. She didn't bother to wait for them to respond before she turned and walked away, expecting them to immediately follow behind. Shenny wasn't entirely sure of what to make of the stranger who had just approached them, but quickly tagged along when once Puncher began following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right. You don't know me, do you? I'm Dr. Kia Wong. I'm the one who helped your boyfriend out with that outfit of yours\u201d she said giving Shenny a quick glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Well, thank you! I absolutely loved it!\u201d Shenny responded with a bright smile. More than anything else, she was happy to see that Puncher had an actual friend within the seemingly emotionless and sterile institute. Dr. Wong responded with a nonchalant shrug as she continued further into the facility. Eventually they entered a laboratory, the same room where she had gifted the nanobots to Puncher. Tiffany's colossal panties were no longer strewn up on the wall, though in their place there was a large glass chamber. The villainous rat sat in the middle of it, her tiny body completely nude and her normally shaggy fur looking clean and prim. The only article of clothing she possessed was a small red collar around her neck. Her holding chamber was clearly built to accommodate her basic needs, with a hamster wheel, a container full of food pellets and a bottle of water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExamining clothes is one thing. A living, breathing specimen is entirely different\u201d Dr. Wong said before going over to her console and pressing a few buttons. \u201cHaving Tiffany here and assisting me in my work has been quite rewarding. I think it's only fair that I allow you to partake in the fruits of my stuides, seeing as how you've provided me with such a fine test subject\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With a few more keystrokes, the doctor had summoned two objects from her console: a shiny chrome dog collar and yet another spray bottle full of an unknown liquid. She gestured for the two to come over and examine their gifts, which they were quick to oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll give you a quick rundown on what those are. The collar is something I developed in order to keep Tiffany from shrinking out of her restraints. It stabilizes the molecules to prevent them from contracting or expanding any further. In layman's terms, you put it on and you won't have to worry about accidentally growing or shrinking\u201d she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny wasn't quite sure how to feel about the collar. While she could definitely see the practical implications of such a device, it didn't make her any more comfortable with the idea of being at such a relatively small height for long periods of time. Still, she was grateful all the same and showed it with a polite nod and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. Um... what's this supposed to be?\u201d she asked as she went to examine the bottle, only to have it snatched from her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>This</i>, is not for your massive mitts. This is for him\u201d Wong said as she thrust it into Puncher's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-alright, but what is it?\u201d the hero asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething I want you to test out. Seeing how we're going to be seeing a lot more of each other, I figured I'd take this opportunity to have you act as field testers for me\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn't exactly answer his question\u201d Shenny pushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's concentrated anise. Basically the rough equivalent of catnip for canines. Test it out and tell me what happens\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher looked down at the bottle in his hands with renewed interest. He knew from experience that Shenny's body reacted to stimuli like any other canine, as he could often bring her into a state of dull complacency with an ear rub alone. The thought of her high as a kite on anise was rather amusing, though there was no telling what she'd do in such a state. There was a chance that it'd either make her relaxed and slightly air-headed, or it might drive her already hyperactive libido even more wild. He shuttered in a mixture of fear and excitement at the prospect of a hornier-than-usual Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's all I have for now. Come back every now and again and I might have something new to give you\u201d Wong said before turning over to the console were one of the lights was beeping. \u201cHuh. It's time for Tiff's bath now. I suggest two make yourselves scarce. She's been pestering me all week asking where you two have been and the last thing I need is for her to flip out while I'm scrubbing her down\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Despite the considerable lack of a threat the tiny mouse presented, couple were quick to depart from the facility. The sinister rodent had left enough of a negative impression in their minds that they didn't want to so much as hear her voice. The moment they stepped outside Shenny shot up to her full height and sighed in relief. It felt as though a boulder had been lifted from her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then. I say we get back home and celebrate my new job!\u201d She said giddily as she grabbed her boyfriend from off the ground and quickly slid him into her cleavage. Puncher could sense that she was in high spirits from the news they had received. He could hear her massive heart beating at an excited pace as she briskly walked out of the city and back to their home in the forest. He could only imagine what she had in store for him once they returned. His hand tightened around the spray bottle Dr. Wong had given him. Perhaps he would make use of it once they arrived back home...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The large wolfess walked straight home and laid herself out on her couch. She fished her superhero boyfriend from her cleavage and sat him down atop one of her boobs. In his hands were the gifts from doctor Wong and both shared a nervous glance. Shenny reached in and carefully took the collar from the hero. She inspected it closely before dismissively throwing it across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not your style?\" The hero asked jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small is not my style, yes.\" She replied with a smile. It faded a little when she continued. \"Also, did they have to make it into a collar? Couldn't it have been a belt, or a bracelet or something?\" Her voice softened a little, moping to herself. \"Do they think I'm your pet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher burst out laughing, surprising his giant lover. \"Hahaha, if that's the case I should be wearing it, seeing how often I'm getting pulled around by you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly smile crept back onto her face. \"I've yet to hear you complain, little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say you know far better ways than a collar to keep me happily following you.\" He said, patting the soft surface of the boob he was sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them laughed heartily, the superhero having to work hard to remain in place atop Shenny's jiggling tit. He almost slips back in between them but thankfully she manages to contain herself well enough. Her eyes turned to the spray bottle in his hand. He soon followed suit, feeling large volume of doubt wash over him. What effect would this stuff even have on her? Would her unique origin diminish the effect or amplify it? He looked up to her and saw the same doubt, an uneasy smirk on her face. She fidgeted about a little before speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I couldn't quite follow what doctor Wong said when talking about this stuff. Did you catch it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's something that stimulates dogs in all kinds of ways, but further concentrated. She wanted to see if you'd have any response to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny raised a brow. \"Stimulates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the effects can vary quite wildly. You could feel a bit sleepy and light-headed. It could make you feel nervous and excitable. Or it could make you hornier than ever before. There's not really any way to predict which it'll be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny's brow lifted up even further. Her being horny was what let her down the path of supervillainy, and he wanted to amplify her lust for him? With a nervous tone she stammered back. \"Are... Are you sure that's a good idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher scratched the back of his head, looking at the bottle and back to his lover. Her concern was far from unfounded, but this felt like an opportunity that wouldn't present itself again. \"I'd be lying if there wasn't a part of me that's immensely curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brow was close to detaching from her forehead after hearing this little confession. \"I'm just afraid I'll not be able to think straight under the effects of that stuff. What if I hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like this stuff makes you lose control completely. You got this.\" The hero said, beaming with confidence. He knew the risks this little bottle brought with it, but his curiosity was dancing circles around his better judgment. \"We'll try it just once, and if it's no fun we'll throw it away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean we'll return it to the I.S.E.A. Can't have anyone with malicious intent getting a hold of this.\" She said patronizingly, patting the hero on the head with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes, you smartass.\" He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. If you're confident this won't get out of hand, let's see what this mysterious little spray bottle can do. Just know that if you end up in my pussy for the next three days because I'm feeling unreasonably horny as fuck, it's all on you.\" She said, her confidence growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, like with Lovey? You didn't even hesitate before slamming me into your love tunnel.\" He said with a cheerful smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were under her control, I had to restrain you somehow. Would you have preferred I put you in my maw?\" She snapped back, annoyed that he was doubting her decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not mad. I just think it's hilarious that even on the job I seem to find ways to end up in your pussy.\" Both of them could have a laugh at his comment. With their doubts sufficiently cooled the hero flies up to his lover's muzzle and aims the spray bottle at her big nose. His hand shook a little from the nerves, but he had faith in Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's do some science.\" He announced grandly, causing her to snort and giggle. With a big smile she responded. \"Oh don't you worry. No matter what this stuff does, you're going to get properly scienced to celebrate my new job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a squeeze of the trigger the bottle unleashes a large cloud of fine white mist, all of which quickly vanishes into Shenny's nostrils. He'd hoped to start small but the spray mechanism seems to have unloaded the entire bottle at once. The superhero throws the empty bottle aside and looks intently at his lover. At first she seems puzzled. Did it even work at all? Wong was right about anise having profound effects on dogs, but Shenny was far from just an ordinary pup. Nothing much seemed to happen until she started looking at him. Her silent stare felt like it could melt steel, making the hero feel a little uncomfortable. Her pupils were slowly dilating as the spray began to take effect. Out of nowhere she snatches him up in her hand and brings him closer. His face is practically touching her big, wet nose as she loudly sniffs him. Satisfied, she lifts him up again to look at him. He can see it in her eyes, the spray is working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow is Shenny feeling?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> For some time did Shenny stare at the uneasy hero, her face conveying very little emotion. He began to worry that her body was reacting negatively to the anise, but his concerns were immediately put to rest as Shenny flashed him a wide smile. Her eyes became glazed over and he could see her blushing brightly through her fur. The next thing he knew, she was going into a fit of giggles, her free hand being placed onto her muzzle to try and contain her sudden mirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... so small!\" She sang, her eyes widening with wonder as she stared down at him. She spoke as though it had only just then dawned on her how much larger she was than him. She continued to giggle she ran her finger along his body, poking and prodding it with renewed curiosity. Her odd behavior wasn't quite what Pint Puncher was expecting, but he couldn't help but be amused by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teeny tiny~\" she slurred drunkenly as she snorted from trying to restrain her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I really that small or are you just really big?\" Puncher asked with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny blinked and tilted her head, her face scrunching up in intense focus. She turned her attention down to her own body and gasped in amazement at what she saw. Had she really been that large the whole time? She didn't linger on this discovery for long before her eyes shifted back over to the tiny man resting in the palm of her hand. He was so small and so cute... and squishy looking too! She poked his stomach a few times, laughing as she did so. Her constant prodding caused the hero more than a little discomfort, but it wasn't anything he couldn't handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're a tiny squishy little thing~\u201d she sung, her eyes suddenly lighting up as an idea came to mind. \u201cHold on, I wanna check something!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She unceremoniously dropped the hero onto the makeshift grass couch before sliding off and getting onto her knees. Pint Puncher had no idea what the playful giantess had in store for him as he moved to stand up. Before he could ask her intentions, Shenny cupped a hand over her left breast and pulled it upward before letting it flop back down onto him. A mountain of tit flesh was soon dropped down on him, nearly forcing him back down onto his knees. Shenny stood before him with an amused grin as she watched her lover struggle to hold up her boob like Atlas holding up the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on squishy, don't let it drop~\u201d she cooed as she lipped her chops delirious glee. While her tone and demenor were playful, her words carried a veiled threat that Puncher was quick to take notice off. Should his legs give out under the immense weight of her tit, she would know doubt find some way to \u201cpunish\u201d him for his failure. He had a general idea of what her punishments entailed, usually something sexual in nature, though there was no telling what type of games her mind would conjure while on this new high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He gritted his teeth and pushed back against her hefty tit, using all of his strength to keep it from completely enveloping him. Shenny appeared to be impressed with his determination, though was quick to ramp up the difficulty as she leaned forward, pressing most of her body weight down onto him. The hero's knees buckled under the pressure and he fell to a knee, her boob threatening to completely smother him. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sweat rolled down the hero's brow as his knees were beginning to feel wobbly. The overwhelming mass of the wolfess' tit was bearing down on him mercilessly. He was not one to give up so easily though. With gritted teeth he pushed back as hard as he could. Against all odds the smothering flesh on his back began to lift. His herculean strength was overpowering his girlfriend's sheer size. It wasn't until she popped her head down on the couch to look at him that the situation became clear. His strength may be mighty, but the only reason he was able to defy the weight on top of him was Shenny slowly lifting herself up to get a better look at him. With a playful smile she muttered along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, squishy strong. Tiny hold up Shenny. But uh oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile widened as she began to lean down again, doubling down on the weight crushing the hero. In mere moments it became clear that even the nearly insurmountable mass resting atop him earlier was her holding back. With no restraint she lets herself flop down. The hero's body maintains its pose as an avalanche of boobflesh squeezes it flat. The soft mass rolled over the hero like a wave, smothering him completely and pinning him between its endless softness and the couch. Triumphantly Shenny dragged her imposing rack from side to side, flattening her boyfriend until she finally lifted herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, squishy went squish. Too much Shenny for you, tiny squishy?\" She could barely string together a sentence amidst the fit of giggles attacking her every time she looked at the flattened hero. \"Don't feel too bad, no squishy can withstand me.\" With a mischievous smile she loomed over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero wanted to throw back a snarky reply, but he was interrupted by a large claw poking his side, peeling him off the couch. Faint groans were the only commentary he could offer as Shenny, still very much feeling dopey because of the anise, brought him to her lips. With some care she gave him a passionate kiss, inflating him a little and speeding up his recovery. There was little time to celebrate for the Pint Puncher. The wolfess took hold of her boyfriend tightly and stared at him. Here eyes seemed lost, adrift in a sea of thought. Suddenly an idea rolls to the forefront, her focus returned and her gaze falling on the hero once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squishy soft. Only bad superheroes are soft. Gonna punish tiny squishy to make him better hero.\" She announced grandly. The somewhat delirious tone in her voice did not fill the Pint Puncher with confidence. She stared intently at her boyfriend, her mind racing with ways to toughen him up. Unsure of what to expect, the hero braces himself for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I got it.\" She said, again licking her chops. The superhero gulped, fearing he was about to get very intimate with her large maw. Before his dread could creep in further his face was battered by her large tongue. The slimy muscle dragged itself along his face, slathering it in drool. Her behaviour was getting a little erratic, but so far she'd not hurt him. Heavy as the smothering titflesh was, he could hardly call it painful. More licks added ever more extravagant amounts of drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sloppy tiny ready for punishment?\" She asked, holding still until she got an answer. When the Piny Puncher stayed mute on the subject she squeezed her hand and him in it for a moment before smiling again. Her brain, floating in anise, came up with two ideas. Maybe the little guy needed to be put in her form-fitting bikini bottom. Once he could handle that kind of squeezing nothing would stand in his way. Or maybe he needed to be chewed out properly like she'd heard the humans talk about. Shenny didn't know how humans chewed eachother, but she was much better than a human. She'd chew the hero out nicely to toughen him up. At the mere idea she began to salivate a little, flashing her big teeth at the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> A small sliver of sense managed to shine through the anise induced cloud that had formed in Shenny's mind. She wanted to toughen her little hero up, but chewing him out seemed a tad excessive. Plus, it might run the risk of working <i>too</i> well and making him so tough that she'd end up chipping a tooth on him. No, for a job like this she needed to keep things simple and easy. Her finger trailed along the rim of her bikini bottom, her eyes fixed on the confused hero as he awaited his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to toughen you up~\" she sang before pulling her bikini bottom out slightly and bringing him to the rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher swallowed nervously. He knew that this day would come at some point, though he didn't expect it to come under such curious circumstances. He had explored the many wonders of Shenny's gorgeous body, devoting a great deal of time to worshiping every inch of flesh that he could get his hands on, but the one area he had yet to explore was her taut, generous rear end. He had admired it many times while they bathed together, marveling at how perfectly round and plump it was while waited for his lover to finish washing up so that she could tend to his aching hardon. He was hesitant to approach it however, due to his dislike of the natural must that emitted from that area. At least he assumed it did. He had come to discover that Shenny was the type of person who took her personal hygiene quite seriously and aside from the powerful feminine musk that would often accompany her after a night of passionate lovemaking, he couldn't recall an instance in which he found her scent anything less than pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Still, he was very much uneasy at what he was about to endure. His lover seemed dead set on dropping him in, so he did nothing to resist it. This was a bridge that he was bound to cross. He figured that he might as well let it happen just to cross it off his bucket list. Shenny let him drop down into the back of her bikini bottom before letting it snap shut and trapping him between a wall of flesh and fabric. Everything went dark for the hero as he was pressed against the warm furry flesh in front of him. The feeling was not unlike what he had experienced during their bout with Tiffany, though he found his current settings to be much more enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The smell wasn't nearly as bad as he assumed that it would be. The air around him carried the aroma of exotic flora with only a light hint of mustiness accompanying it. He found it amusing to think that Shenny's butt carried with it a better scent the the whole of Tiffany's body. A chuckle escaped his lips and for a moment, he found himself content with his surroundings. For something that was supposed to be a punishment, he was surprisingly comfortable. The pleasant scent, the warmth of her body, and the snugness of her bikini bottom made for a delightful resting spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Little did he know, his punishment hadn't even commenced. For a second he felt the world around him shake, the muscles in Shenny's glutes flexing from some kind of physical activity. The hero felt weightless and began to wonder what was happening outside of his snug prison, though he soon found his answer when he was suddenly flattened beneath the full weight of his giant lover. Shenny had jumped into the air and landed full force onto her couch, giggling as she felt the hero's body crumble beneath her. She rubbed her butt back and forth along the soft surface, barely able to contain her mirth as she went to work toughening the little superhero up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile, the Pint Puncher was going through absolute hell. His body lost some of its dimensions from the impact and the sudden friction was causing his surrounding so heat up. His nose caught of very faint bit of sweat and with each movement Shenny made, it became even stronger. And yet despite the his growing discomfort, his dick was the only part of him that responded positively to his current predicament. He cursed himself for his blossoming kink, gritting his teeth as his cock rubbed along the dampening fur in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Shenny gasped as she felt his hardened length poking into her slight. \"See? I knew you'd get tougher!\" She stated proudly as she increased the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher wanted to voice his disapproval, but the constant stimulation of his dick please the intense pressure against his lungs made it difficult to do make any noises other than wheezes and grunts. Eventually the constant rubbing managed to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wall of fur pressed against the hero slowly shifted as Shenny ground her butt against the couch. The pressure and heat took all his attention, leaving him unable to notice that he was moving along the massive buttcheek. Only when the overwhelming crushing force began to lighten a little did he realize where this was going. Either he was slipping out to the side or he was about to find himself near her buttcrack. Knowing his luck, it could only go one way. The musty smell grew stronger, but it was an afterthought to the sweaty stench building up from the intense grinding. His subtle change of position didn't go unnoticed by the wolfess either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squishy want more? Yay!\" She slurred joyfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher's muffled protests were either missed or soundly ignored as she stood up. She pushed her buttcheeks apart to allow the hero more space to enter. When he was reluctant to do so Shenny helped him more directly. Several large fingers pushed against the stretchy fabric, catching the hero by surprise and pushing him completely between those two plump hemispheres. Even though he was certain her asshole was practically touching him, the smell was remarkably bearable. Perhaps being put in similar predicaments by notorious stinkers like Helen had skewed his perspective, but this was a butt he didn't mind to much being close to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenny's gonna make you supertough. Tough as me!\" She sang before cheerily letting go of her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike two muscular walls the buttcheeks enveloped the Pint Puncher. With his lover no longer spreading them he was made to feel the full strength of her glutes. And what a strength it was. Already he could feel the immense cheeks clenching, squeezing him flatter and flatter. Between crushing him the surfaces around him were soft and malleable. But with every clench they turned hard as iron, bearing down on the hero with a strength he couldn't possibly fight. The only thing that felt harder than her crushing buttcheeks was his dick, defiantly erect even in the face of such overwhelming assault. It was so close to bursting the hero needed all his willpower to not make a mess. He didn't want to face even more punishment for blowing his load in her buttcrack. Thankfully he received some help from a most unexpected source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>PFFFFRRRT</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry squishy. Too much clenching.\" Shenny said, laughing loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe putrid stink of her fart wasn't half as bad as the distinct rush of air he felt blowing past the top of his head. Just how close to her butthole was he? Mercifully the relatively small fart dissipated quickly, returning him to the slightly more pleasant stench of her butt sweat. A distinct hint of her feminine musk could also be detected. He was happy to know he wasn't the only one feeling more than a little aroused by all this. There was no denying that this was an exciting new experience for the both of them. Though he did wonder if the anise was adding to this or detracting from it. Would this be more fun if she had full control of herself? And would he be able to retain any semblance of being three-dimensional as her butt methodically squashed him flat? He already felt thin as a sheet, but she wasn't done with him yet. Rhythmically she clenched her cheeks on him before pausing to let him breathe. Faster and faster, harder and harder. Finally he heard a faint, muffled moan, followed by a laugh. It was quickly becoming apparent she wanted more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> The intoxicated giantess was having the time of her life training her squishy little companion. She wasn't sure if she could even recall why she had chose to put him back there in the first place. Not that it matter to her, as she was keen to simply act on her the first thought that came to mind. As her powerful glutes relentlessly squeezed his body, she had become curious to see just how flattened he was. With that, she hooked her fingers into the waistband of her bikini and pulled it down, alleviating much of the pressure on her lover's puny body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher felt her mountainous cheeks part slightly, allowing him to take in a deep gulp of air. The constant squeezing at let him all but plastered to her furry buttcheek, his body paper thin with his aching member being the only part of him still whole. He could do nothing but hope that his lover was kind enough to lend him aid as he was wholly incapable of movement. As though reading his mind, Shenny reached back and dug her fingers between her cheeks in search for him. It took her a moment to find him, as his flattened body hugged the contours of her flesh almost perfectly. It was purely by luck that her fingers managed to dig underneath his leg, but she was quick to grab onto it and peel him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The delirious wolfess went into a fit of giggles looking at his sweat soaked body. Her attention quickly shifted over to his erection, partly because of it being the only part of him that remained intact from the constant crushing. She looked at it as though it were the first time she had ever laid her eyes upon a pair of male genitalia, her eyes wide with curiosity and intrigue. She laid him flat in her palm and began to poke and prod at his manhood, laughing at every twitch and spasm it made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh... it's so hard! I made you reeeeal tough!\" she tittered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher groaned as she relentlessly toyed his with privates. Even in her drug addled state of mind, she knew just how to get a rise out of him. Her giant finger worked his shaft with rough yet meticulous strokes, a look of sheer amusement on her face as she watched his futile attempts to buck his hips into the massive digit. He looked at her with desperate eyes, all but pleading with her to relieve him of his pent up tension, but his torment went completely unnoticed by her. That or she just didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you is tough... super tough... like me am...!\" she drawled before bringing him in and trailing her enormous canine tongue onto his body. By that point she was so far gone that she couldn't even be bothered to form coherent sentences. Thinking clearly had become a chore that she was no longer willing to entertain. She found it much more rewarding to just act without thinking and judging by the pleasured cries of his lover, he clearly was in agreement with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She continued to lap his body with her tongue, letting out a squeal of delight once her taste buds were greeted with a familiar flavor. The coarse and wet surface of her massive organ been the tipping point for him and soon he was brought to a screaming orgasm. Shenny moaned lustfully at the taste, and she soon found herself wanting more. Driven by impulse alone, she didn't even hesitate in throwing her boyfriend into her gaping maw. The hero let out a panicked squeak as his body hit the wet surface of her tongue, but he wasn't given much time to voice his distaste for his new surroundings before she began thrashing his body around her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was no stranger to this situation. During their time together, Shenny would occasionally toy with him using nothing more than her maw. At times she would taunt him by leisurely laying back on the couch, ignoring his moans and cries as her tongue completely milked him dry. She didn't do it too often however, as she feared for what might happen should she get careless and swallow him by accident. That concern was completely tossed aside as she swirled him around playfully, savoring his unique flavor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n This went on for sometime before eventually...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hero didn't know up from down anymore, being a plaything for his lover's tongue. It pushed him around, showing him every corner of her maw. When he wasn't pressed up against those fearsome canines it would curl around him and squeeze him like a snake. Granted, it wasn't that much pressure compared to the pounding he'd received shoved between her buttcheeks. Nevertheless, he was completely at her mercy. Any struggles he made were quickly subdued when she'd press him against the roof of her maw or briefly law him atop a row of pointy molars, threatening to chew him like gum. Though he was a little afraid she might accidentally chomp down on him in her altered state, he still tried to enjoy himself. Her massive tongue slathering past his manhood certainly made his stay more pleasurable. The Pint Puncher was at full mast and every lengthy lick brought him a bit closer to another epic orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny felt her little boyfriend wriggle and squirm in her maw. She loved every second of it, showing her appreciation by smothering him with her tongue, licking every part of his cute little body. She squeezed, suckled, lapped and loved her superpowered little man. He was every bit as enamored by it too, his erection informed her as much. More and more she could feel him bucking, thrusting himself into her tongue. A moan echoed from her maw and that distinct wonderful taste washed over her taste buds again. Her own loins responded with a powerful rush of sexual fluids. She savoured the moment, carefully swallowing the hero's release. There was so much of it for a man of his stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride was wild and the hero held on tightly to one of her large canines. Loud gulps echoed from the back of his girlfriend's throat as she greedily claimed his cum. The Pint Puncher was in awe of the noise and movement all around him. He imagined how easily she could swallow him whole and was thankful that even now she seemed at least to try and keep him in her maw. His thoughts wandered onto other people. How easily she could send someone to her depths. Given the size of some of the supervillains around, Shenny could offer a permanent solution for them. Though with a smirk he pictured the I.S.E.A would start complaining if she simply ate all the villains plaguing the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after emptying his balls, the hero's rod still stood tall. Shenny knew the challenge laid out before her. There was still more tastiness left in there. In her anise-fueled mind it made perfect sense. She murred and moaned at the mere prospect of milking him again. Her tongue swung into action, smothering him in her cheek and swirling him around her maw even more vigorously. The Pint Puncher felt like he was on a sopping wet rollercoaster, terrified and excited in equal measure. The ride only stopped when an exasperated wolfess pressed him against the roof of her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny just gave her boyfriend the ride of his life, why was he being to stingy with his tasty love juice? Fine, if the normal approach wasn't good enough anymore she'd just squeeze those little balls empty. She pressed him even tighter, slowly grinding her tongue back and forth along his body. When she relaxed herself a little she felt him practically humping her tongue, prompting her to lay on the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher didn't fully grasp why, but he loved this strange new game. Her soft tongue pressing him into the roof of her maw felt heavenly. The little taste buds grinding along his body were like a heavy massage. He felt himself respond by relaxing, growing hornier by the second. He would reward her for this in the way she loved most. His past two orgasms were not going to stop him. With heroic determination he grunted and moaned until he finally came a third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleasure rushed up and down Shenny's body as she felt that amazing taste adorn her tongue once more. She savoured it, letting it leak along her sensitive taste buds. Finally it felt like the hero's manhood was beginning to wane. He was spent. She closes her eyes in bliss, happy to taste his release again and to know her little boyfriend was having an amazing time in her maw. She slowly begins to swallow the cum, surprised by the volume of it. A huge wad of it even. She didn't know the hero could produce that much in one load. Hungrily she worked it all down her throat, gulping loudly as she claimed her prize. Almost immediately afterwards she falls asleep, her foggy mind not once wondering why her maw was empty all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero felt the massive tongue calm down and lower him. Before he even noticed his position a gulp echoed from behind him. He suddenly realized how close to that never-ending gullet he was and quickly reached out. But there was nothing to hold onto except for the almost smooth surface of her tongue. He slipped back further, trying to crawl away. The thick coat of slippery saliva on his body paired with the exhaustion from playing in her maw so enthusiastically didn't give him enough purchase and with the next gulp he felt her gullet caress his legs. From there smaller, quicker gulps pulled him down and in seconds he was sent down his lover's throat. The slimy passage seemed to take forever before dumping him in a pool of smelly goop in a large stomach. He yelled out to his lover, but all he heard were the noises of her body all around him. The gurgling of her belly, the slow heartbeat overhead. No effort seemed to be made to rescue him. She wasn't rushing around frantically or trying to heave to get him out. He could only conclude she ate him by accident and was now asleep. He needed to find a way out of her, but he didn't want to hurt his lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were precious few options available to him. He could fly up and hover above the digestive muck below. He'd have to hang there until she woke up and hopefully realized what had happened. Alternatively he could take the more proactive approach and go even deeper into her digestive tract. He'd probably need all night to carefully work his way through her bowels, but once he reached the finish there's no way she wouldn't notice him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pint Puncher was no stranger to this particular situation. He had long since lost count of all times in which he had been swallowed whole on the job, although this situation was markedly different in that he couldn't simply power his way out like he normally would. He considered the options presented to him and opted to say far away from her bowels. Hovering above her stomach acid would be long and tedious, but it was the safest option available to him. Besides, as much as he had come to adore every single part of Shenny's body, there were still some places were he simply refused to tread, and the thought of being excreted through her digestive tract didn't appeal to him in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he remained trapped in his damp, sweltering prison, his lover was laid onto the couch with a content smile on her face. The past few minutes were already a blur to her and she could scarcely remember why she felt so pleased with herself. Had she not been so spaced-out, she wouldn't reacted with horror and despair at what she had just done, but at present she was having a hard time grasping the urgency of what she had just done. While her actions didn't inspire much confidence in Puncher regarding how much she truly valued their relationship, but her dreams better revealed her true feelings. She once again dreamed of their life together, happy and successful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a hard days work keeping Glam City safe and soaking in the gratitude of its citizens, they had gone back home to unwind in the only way they knew how. She envisioned him the way she did a week ago, with him matching her in size as they made loved, his hands pinning her down by the wrists as he pounded her into the couch. As much as she enjoyed the near absolute control she had in regards to the sexual side of their relationship, she felt a bit of a rush at the thought of him being able to take a more commanding role. Of course, this was nothing more than a fantasy. Even if she were to shrink down to her absolute smallest, she she'd still tower over him. That certainly didn't stop her from fantasizing about it on occasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It wasn't long before the day broke and the sun began to raise, shining in through the entrance of Shenny's home and hitting her on the face. She grumbled and covered her eyes, wanting to spend just a little more time sleeping but eventually she gave in and sat up. She counted her blessings that she was woken by the sun and not by the alarm, as that meant that she would have more time to have fun with her pint sized lover. After rubbing the sleep from her eyes, she parted her breasts and peered down with an eager grin as she was prepped to tend to his morning stiffee. It came as a surprise to her when she saw that he wasn't there. As a matter of fact, he didn't seem to be anywhere near her body. She didn't feel his slumbering body within her pussy, which was the first place she'd expect him to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... did he go over to the institute without me...? No. He wouldn't do that\" she murmured as she sat down on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She sat trying to think of where he'd go so early in the morning when her attention was drawn to something faintly shining in the sunlight. She reached down and a delicately picked it up being bringing it to her face. It was an empty spray bottle. She vaguely recalled seeing it before, though she couldn't for the life of her remember where or when. She knew that it in some what pertained to Pint Puncher, but her memories of the prior night were hazy at best. The most she could remember was him spraying something near her nose and after that, everything went black. She frowned and began to mentally retrace her steps, from the moment they brought Mare Storm in, to her receiving her job offer and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" she giggled as she tossed the bottle aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was all starting to come back to her. Dr. Wong had given them a bottle of anise to test out and the results were more than she either of them had expected. She remembered having her tiny lover pinned beneath the oppressive weight of her breast, shoving him into her bikini and grinding his flattened body between her cheeks. Those certainly were lovely memories, but that didn't answer the question of where her boyfriend was. As she struggled to remember more of what had gone down that night...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shenny's belly surprised her with a sudden and loud demand for attention. It bubbled and roiled, prompting her to pat it. The heavy taps intended the chamber holding the Pint Puncher enough to tap against his head, waking him up. He too was greeted by the loud gurgling, but from much closer to the source. It amazed him just how noisy his girlfriend's body could be. He tried yelling out to her, but he wasn't sure any of his words could escape her large body. Undeterred he cried out for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenny! In here! You accidentally swallowed me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words were too muffled for her to notice and her belly drowned it out with its own cacophony. The superhero needed to try something more drastic to get noticed. He drifted towards the side of the stomach and pushed into the slimy flesh. Gently at first, but firmer and harder later. When it all seemed to have no effect he flew back a little and charged towards the stomach wall, ramming it shoulder-first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess felt the strange bump in her belly. She looked down, puzzled. What did she eat and why was it causing such a ruckus inside of her? Again something in her stomach pressed against it. She held her hand down on her gut and felt it a third time. There was no mistaking it. Something was moving in there. What did she even eat last night? Shenny closes her eyes, deep in thought trying to piece together more of last night. She recalled the taste of her boyfriend's cum as she brought him to a shivering climax over and over again. She'd milked the poor guy dry with her tongue, giving him full-body blowjobs. The tangy taste of his release was delightful, but she vaguely recalled being quite enamored by the taste of the rest of him too. His writhing naked body atop her tongue was a delight all on its own. Suddenly the wolfess' eyes went wide and she stared down at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P... P... Punchy?\" She stammered. \"Is... that... you?\" She listened intently, her large ears fully focused on her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muffled \"yes\" echoed from her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"are... are you ok?\" Shenny asked, fighting back tears. If she'd hurt him she'd never forgive herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, would like to get out though.\" Her belly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ofcourse... ehm... how?\" Before the Pint Puncher could answer she was on her feet, walking to the end table next to the couch. On it were the superhero's clothes. She carefully snooped through his things until she found the phone he uses to contact the I.S.E.A. Shenny casually flicked the device down her throat and gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sending your phone into my belly. Maybe Dr. Wong can help us.\" She said. The hero was impressed by her creativity, but how was he going to catch a phone in the pitch darkness of her belly. He flew up, patting the surface of her stomach to find the entrance. He found it just in time as the undulating muscle opened up a little, depositing a large wad of slime in his hands containing a distinct hard shape. He wiped the goop off the device and turned it on. The brightly lit screen blinded him, his eyes unprepared for it after spending so long in the dark stomach. He didn't have the best of receptions normally out here in the woods. Being inside of his girlfriend wasn't going to help things. Thankfully the device managed to find a weak, but stable connection. He rang up Dr. Wong and prayed she was available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Wong here, what can I do for you, Puncher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... this is gonna sound weird...\" He started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist looked over her shoulder to the pint-sized mouse villain sitting in her cage. \"I think I can handle weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, so I might currently be in Shenny's stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the... Do I want to know how you got in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an accident, that anise stuff had some errr... interesting effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me more...\" Dr. Wong replied, her eyebrows raised with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later doc, first we need a way to get me out of here. I can communicate with her, albeit with some difficulty. I can tell she's panicking, so please help me before more accidents happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you got two routes. First is just following the digestive tract. Her intestines should be big enough for you to sort of... swim through. It's gonna be smelly, but in a few hours you should reach her butt. I'm sure she can take it from there.\" The superhero shuddered at the idea of being mired in her bowels for hours, forced to suck in the fetid air. With growing fear he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orrrr....\" Dr. Wong laughed a little at his reaction. \"Or you could try going out the way you came in. If she starts heaving, you can probably push along with the motions and pop back out of her throat. It'll be a little unpleasant for her, but it'll also be done much faster. Other than those two options you're out of luck. Unless you consider digesting in there a viable alternative.\" Both of them chuckled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Dr. Wong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime, do let me know about those little adventures of you when you're around. I'd love to get more data on her inner workings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero rolled his eyes and turned his attention to his increasingly skittish surroundings. Shenny was getting increasingly nervous about having her boyfriend in her belly. If she'd swallowed him last night it meant he'd been stuck in there for hours now. The conversation between the Pint Puncher and Dr. Wong was just mumbling to her, but thankfully the reassuring voice of her boyfriend rang out from her belly once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenny! Dr. Wong told me there's two ways. Let's try the quick way first. You gotta try and throw me back out. Pretend I'm a hairball or something. I'll try to push along from inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hairball? That's cats!\" She huffed. \"Then pretend you're a cat for a minute. It'll feel a little weird, but try to resist the urge to swallow me back down again.\" Her belly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny stepped away from her living area to a nearby clearing. She carefully got on her knees and began muttering to herself. \"Okay, I gotta do this. For the Pint Puncher. For my boyfriend.\" With confidence she spoke up. \"Get ready Punchy, I'm getting you outta there!\" She went down on all fours and began to retch, feeling the little bulge of her boyfriend fight against her esophagus. She fought on through the discomfort, pushing him further and further up. Does Shenny succeed?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Shenny's eyes watered as she felt his body squeeze back up into her throat. It took a great deal of willpower for her fight against her natural inclination to swallow as she continued to retch him up. Finally, with one final wheeze she coughed him out. Her boyfriend tumbled onto the ground with a splat, his naked body covered head to toe in slime. He groaned and shielded his eyes from the sudden ray of light, though he was granted much time to adjust to it as he was snatched up by his colossal lover. She was nearly in tears as she showered his body in kisses, pausing every few seconds to profusely apologize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alright, alright! I'm fine!\" he chuckled as he pushed against her maw slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He petered off once he looked up at saw the expression on her face. She was absolutely wracked with guilt and shame, her eyes wide and her bottom lip trembling as she stared at him. It wasn't hard for him to see why. She had worked so hard to change her ways and to refrain from regressing back to the violent hedonist that she once was. It'd be absolutely heartbreaking for all that effort to be thrown away after a night of drug induced debauchery, especially when it came on the heels of their greatest achievement thus far. He smiled as he flew up and scratched her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. I know you'd never do anything to hurt me\" he murmured softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts. I'm not going to let you beat yourself up over a simple accident\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A simple accident? I could've <i>killed </i>you! How can you be so calm after that?!\" Shenny cried in a mixture of annoyance and anxiety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could've... but you didn't. And you wouldn't\" Puncher said softly. He spoke with such confidence and certainty that it caught his gigantic lover off guard. He knew that she was constantly struggling with self-doubt and the last thing she needed was an excuse to tear herself down again. He decided to bring a little levity back as he looked down at his slime soaked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's about we hit the spring? I could really use a scrub down\" he said before hovering off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny stared silently at him, feeling more than a little confused with her lover's unshaken optimism. She was relieved that he didn't feel the need to hold it against her, but she couldn't help but feel as though she got off too easy with him. She didn't want his affection to blind him to any potential harm that might come his way, accidental or not. No matter how deeply she cared for him, someone of her size posed a constant threat to her surroundings. She considered bringing that point to his attention but quickly dropped the idea. He knew exactly what she was capable of, having fought her numerous times in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet he chose to be in a relationship with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The absurdity of it all forced a smile onto her face. She was thinking too deeply into the incident. It happened, he was fine and none the worse for ware. There was no need for her linger on it any further. With her spirits raised, she exited her domicile and headed over to the spring, stopping only to strip out of her bikini bottom. To her surprise, her boyfriend was waiting patiently for her near its edge, his body still coated in slime. She giggled and placed her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Have you gotten so spoiled that you expect me to bath you every day?\" she asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still feeling a bit winded out of our fun last night\" Pint Puncher responded with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well, it looks like I'll have to pick up the slack yet again\" she said with an exaggerated sigh before stepping into the warm waters. She wasted little time as she snatched his body up and began scrubbing him down thoroughly. She didn't want there to be even the slightest bit of evidence left of her stomach fluids on his body. Of course, being the lecherous type that she was, she could hardly kept her fingers from stroking his morning word. Even after laying inside her stomach over night, he wasn't any less turned off by her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She teased him relentlessly, her fingering lingering on his privates before quickly moving on to the rest of his body. By the time she was finished he was completely spotless, save for his manhood which leaked small droplets of pre-cum with each throb. She wouldn't let him suffer for long before she walked over to the waterfall and began scrubbing herself down using his body as a makeshift bar of soap. His pleasured groaned were drowned out by the crashing water as his now slippery dick was rubbed up and down her perfect form. Despite having been milked dry the prior night, he still managed to let loose a powerful orgasm that was soon washed away by the waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once she was done washing up, she stepped out of the spring and shook the water from her fur. She then dropped her pint sized lover into her cleavage and pressed her breasts together to dry him off. She smiled as she plucked him out and kissed him on the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. All clean!\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much obliged\" Pint Puncher chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that bit of business settled, the two began to rack their brains for something to do to past the time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shenny held her boyfriend close, pressing him firmly into the softness of her tits. The superhero was overwhelmed, but something was amiss. The enormous wolfess seemed more skittish than usual. Her kind embrace was much tighter than normal, almost painfully so. He was pressed deep into the short fur on her boobs. Far below their soft surface he could hear her heartbeat. Was she just excited after rubbing herself with him or was there still some unresolved doubts gnawing on her mind. It mattered not to the hero. He had the villain in his sights and he would defeat these doubts plaguing his lover. With some effort her drew her attention, pushing for her to release him. He flew up to her face and spoke confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's still bugging you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes and responded snarkily. \"Well, for most of this morning I was terrified I had eaten my boyfriend. So yeah, you could say there's a bit of leftover stress there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, get down, I know how to help with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what are you planning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lie down in the grass, don't make me wrestle you to the ground.\" He commanded with a goofy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, you and what army?\" Shenny said with a playful smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just these two big boys.\" He replied, flexing his arms and making his girlfriend fly into a fit of laughter. Undeterred he vowed to act on his words, flying up to shenny's face and pushing. He didn't use any of his super strength, but the wolfess played along as best she could whilst laughing her head off. She laid herself out on her belly in front of the spring, her boyfriend seeking out his familiar space atop her head, close to those big sensitive ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my girl, now just breathe slowly and listen to your favorite superhero. I know this morning was probably a bit weird, but that ain't gonna stop me loving you. Hell, I don't think a single aspect of us can be called anything other than weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Last night was the first time in weeks where I felt like I lost control. That feeling I hadn't felt since... well... since I was a villain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only you were like that as a villain. You'd be much easier to beat if you always acted that loopy. But I think we can both conclude that anise stuff is both a success and something we really don't need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny smiled seductively in response. \"I'm not so sure about that. Vague as it is, I do remember putting you in a few other places too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the rubbing on her ear slow to a crawl, the hero atop her head looking over his shoulder to her beautifully rounded ass. For a moment she wonders if she should grant the distracted Pint Puncher his wish and cram him between those cheeks again. Before any more devious plans pop up he responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a surprisingly nice ass to be close to. Maybe all the more unwashed villains have made me a bit fearful of huge butts. But your bottom is one I didn't really mind getting smooshed by. The only thing that was odd was feeling your farts ruffle my hair. Seriously, how close to your butthole did I go last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large wolfess laughs at the Pint Puncher's crazy story. Though his words did flood her mind with all manner of questions, most prominently of course what it would feel like to slide him up her backdoor. \"Maybe we should do it again then?\" Shenny suggests with a lewd tone in her voice. \"There's so much of me, you shouldn't need to hold back on playing with any of it. I promise I'll hold back on the tooting. Either that or I can push you in to meet the source of the tooting, in case you're feeling really adventurous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero smiles broadly. \"That reminds me, Dr. Wong told me another way I could've escaped your stomach. I couldn't quite believe it when she told me. Get this, she expected me to push myself further down your digestive tract. Just follow the natural route and finally get farted or pulled out your butt. I probably would've had to wriggle through your bowels all night long.\" The wolfess didn't have a response ready. Her ears twitched with interest and almost immediately the Pint Puncher wished he kept his mouth shut. Who knows what kind of crazy ideas he'd just given his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny was lost in thought, imagining the feeling of a tiny hero crawling through her intestines to finally find his freedom by pushing himself out of her butt. The whole story sounded as convoluted as it did enticing. She felt her loins react ever so subtly. The puny struggles back and forth, the slow, deliberate movement helping her inner muscles push him through to his smelly destination. Like a cork he'd seal up her pucker until she'd launch him with an eruption of gas. She even begins to wonder how far she'd be able to launch him. The wolfess licks her large chops at the thought of it, remembering well the superhero's exquisite taste last night. The Pint Puncher, growing increasingly worried by the lewd snickering coming from below him, tries to change the subject before his girlfriend attempts to swallow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who do you think will attack the city next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Shenny mused, thinking deeply. \"I reckon it'll be Helen. A greedy bankrobber like her will probably be out of money real soon. So I wouldn't be surprised if you came across a bank with a hippo-sized hole in the side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A solid choice, but I think I can do one better. I think it's gonna be Quaker. Someone who thrives on tormenting the innocent can't sit still for too long. She'll go stir-crazy without people to step on. If she's not about to stomp down the street she's probably looking to abduct new victims for her to stealthily play with, away from our attention and our ire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two look at eachother and the wolfess responds. \"Not a bad one yourself. Hey, how about a friendly little wager?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher raises a brow. \"What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, we both guessed a villain, let's see who's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero smiles. \"Fine, but If I win, you have to wash me every day for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, you lazy little bastard. Fine, but if I win, you have to kiss my butt. And not on the cheek, but right on my pucker. And you better mean that kiss or I'll squeeze your head between my glutes until you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped, picturing himself wedged deep between those cheeks to kiss that sweaty hole. For the first time in his superhero carreer he hoped Quaker would attack the city, if only to save him from the embarrassment. The two keep fooling around, the hero rubbing her ears fiercely, as though he could rub the stress right out of her brain. It even seemed to be working for a few precious moments. After at least an hour of occasionally lewd games and almost continuous lewd chatter the two begin to feel a bit drowsy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly alarms echo through the forest. The city needs its heroes. Without a moment's hesitation the wolfess plucks the Pint Puncher from her head and shoves him quickly deep between her tits. With haste she slips on her little bikini bottom and carefully tip-toes along the main road towards the center of the disturbance. Amidst the chaos they find their villain.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> As they approached the city, the heroic duo could see bits of fires scattered about randomly. That observation alone was enough to tell them that neither of their predictions were accurate. Helen wasn't the least bit concerned with how much property damage she caused on her outings, but she destruction for the sake of destruction didn't really fit her MO, and Quaker wasn't the type to leave any buildings standing. No, the villain waiting for them was none other than the muscular cougar known as Rowland. He stood among the wreckage with a weary expression on his face, his hands toying with a ball of fire as he walked the streets. The resistance that greeted him was not quite to his liking, as the authorities seemed to prioritize evacuating the citizens rather than fighting him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on out, you cowards! It's no fun if you're not here to resist!\" He snarled in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you try picking a fight with someone who can actually fight back?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The cougar raised a brow and turned to face his bold new challenger. He wasn't the least bit surprise to see Punt Puncher standing across from him. He was more than a little stunned to see the infamous Shenny standing side by side with him. He had heard rumors that his nemesis had acquired a sidekick in the form of a villain. The idea wasn't too hard for him to grasp, but he never would've imagined that he would manage to bring someone like <i>Shenny </i>over to his side. A tinge of jealousy was quick to enter his mind as he was quite fond of the curvaceous giantess, something that he made clear to her in their past interactions, much to her annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well. How's it going, hotness?\" he asked as he peered up at Shenny snuffed out the fireball and placed his hands on his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" the wolfess muttered as she looked away in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Of all the anthros she dealt with in her time spent fighting against Pint Puncher, Rowland might've been the one she disliked the most. He seemed to be under the impression that the two of them were meant to be together based on their similar size changing abilities. Even in her most self-indulgent and hedonistic moments, she found his ego and narcissism a complete turnoff and would often brush off his flirtations. Not that stopped him from trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta say, I'm digging the lingerie. I never took you for the type to wear clothes\" he said as he turned his attention to her lower half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny growled and opened her mouth to shoot back a bitter remark, but stopped herself. A snide grin crossed her face as she tugged the waistband of her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. My <b><i>boyfriend </i></b>got it for me as a gift!\" she said proudly as she affectionately nudged Pint Puncher with her foot. Her comment got the intended response as Rowland's face soured considerably. Getting rejected was one thing, but getting rejected in favor of The Pint Puncher was a slap to the face. He turned his attention to Pint Puncher, giving him a glare that would strike him dead if looks could kill. The hero swallowed at his angered expression. Rowland was yet another member of his rouges gallery that often got the better of him. The last thing he needed was to fight an angry, motivated Rowland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you got together with that scrawny puke? You've gotta be kidding me! What does he have that I don't?!\" he snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really need me to run down the list? He's sweeter, more selfless, more handsome, and he knows how to make me happy. Plus, he's more of a man that you can ever hope to be!\" she said as she turned her nose haughtily. The hero blushed as he listened to his lover gush over him, though he was motioning for her to stop as her praise only served to further enrage the villainous cougar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? I'll keep have to keep that in mind for later...\" he said with a chillingly calm tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can think it over while you're sitting in your cell! Right Punchy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh? Oh! Right! Um... come quietly and no one gets hurt, Rowland!\" Puncher ordered with as much confidence as he could muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rowland raised a brow and shook his head before getting into a crouched position. The crime fighting duo readied themselves to intercept his attack, but were caught off guard as he turned and sprinted in the opposite direction. It took the two them a moment to realize that he was retreating, though they were quick to give chase once the thought occurred to them. With her great size, Shenny refrained from running in favor of a brisk walk, though her strides more than compensated for it. Rowland glanced back at them and sucked his teeth before summoning a fireball and tossing it over his shoulder.<br>\r\n The flaming sphere struck the ground and sent a plume of smoke high into the air, obscuring their vision and allowing him to beat a hasty retreat. Thinking quickly, Shenny took in a deep breath and blew out a gust of air, effectively blowing the smokescreen (and one or two vehicles) away. Unfortunate for them, Rowland had managed to get out of their line of sight before they could respond in time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! He got away!\" Shenny growled as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He couldn't have gone that far\" Puncher said as he flew into the air. \"The best course of action for us would be to...\"</span></div></div>",

I'm not letting you alone for a second with that pervert. You're right though, with a move like that he can't have gotten far. From up here I should be able to spot him the moment he tries to run away. You just stay close and watch my back. I don't need him creeping up on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero nodded to his girlfriend. She was right. Going off alone only opened him up for a sneaky attack from Rowland, and that cougar didn't need any more advantages over him. The ability to grow bigger and stronger to match his foes would already cause enough trouble. He's one of the few villains that can wrestle Shenny to a standstill if given the chance to grow big enough. From the corner of his eye he saw movement, but by the time he looked, nothing was there. Maybe his mind was playing tricks on him. The dust and smoke from the ruined buildings around them didn't help much either. This villain would have a lot to answer for. At least he didn't see any wounded people in the streets. Rowland usually only toyed with those buff enough to make him feel insecure about his own muscles. The Pint Puncher flies a bit lower, peering through the smoke. His instincts tell him that the cougar is still close. He wouldn't escape justice for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong hand reaches out from the smoke and grabs his leg, pulling him down. Before the hero can yell out to his lover, another muscular paw covers his mouth. Dampened footsteps below tell the superhero he is being abducted into one of the buildings. The cougar is smart enough not to run far away, lest Shenny spots him. But here, right below her, in the wolfess' blind spot he was somewhat safe. Something the Pint Puncher was about to experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Pathetic Puncher.\" He seethed, speaking ever so softly. \"Congrats on the epic-sized tail you managed to catch. Just one itty bitty little problem with it all really... she. IS. MINE!\" Rowland hissed, fearfully looking up and hoping his emotions hadn't just brought down the wrath of Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's okay. In fact, I know someone who's been missing you something awful.\" He hoisted the hero up, pinning the Pint Puncher to his abs. His paw never left the superhero's mouth. With a satisfied grunt Rowland reveals his surprise guest. The heat of his manhood rubbed up against the Pint Puncher's leg, instantly sending a shiver down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. You remember last time, don'tcha? Oh the fun we had together. You managed to swallow the whole thing down that little neck of yours. Granted, it took a bit of pushing, but didn't that just make it feel even better? And then I grew and it got stuck. That was hilarious. Seeing you flail about trying to breathe and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero began to struggle more fiercely, but for every ounce of strength he exerted, the villain just grew a little to match his strength. The paw on his maw gradually took hold of more and more of the hero's face. The rod rubbing against his leg grew both from the cougar's villainous power as well as his growing sadistic arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butt... don't you worry. I'll spare that pretty mouth today. You'll need it to explain to Shenny why you're breaking up with her. After all, once you've been emasculated by a real man like me, even you must realize you're not worthy of her affection. And if you don't cast away this idiotic romance, I guess I'll just have to plow that little butt a little bit harder. You thought Shenny was a lot to deal with? Wait until you get a load of me inside of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher actively shook and struggled, but Rowland just grew bigger and stronger. If he didn't escape soon he'd get impaled on the cougar's rigid cock. But with all his monologuing the villain had neglected his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> A wave of fear and nausea washed over the him. Rowland always seemed to delight in dominating him sexually and he had more than a few memories of being pinned down and forced to endured the overpowering musk. Rowland wanted him to have one idea permanently sealed into his foe's mind: that no matter how strong he became or how hard he fought, Rowland would still be higher on the food chain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit struggling...!\" he hissed into Puncher's ear as his hand soon grew larger enough to completely envelop his head. His grinned as the hero's puny body was lifted up by the his growing erection. To further drive home the discrepancy between them, he pumped his hips a few times, laughing as his massive rod slid against Puncher's puny member. Despite the rough treatment he was dishing out, he could sense that the hero's body was acting against his best wishes as his length began to stiffen with each pump that Rowland made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone's enjoying this a lot more than they're letting on~. It doesn't really surprise me, to be honest. Weaklings like you get off on being dominated, especially by alpha males like me. Why else would you be with Shenny if not to be used and abused?\" he asked as he continued to shoot up in size. \"That's gonna change real soon, though. Once Shenny gets a taste of what a <i>real</i> man feels like, she won't even glance in your direction. Maybe if you calm down and behave yourself, I'll let you stick around as my personal cocksleeve! You'd love that, wouldn't you? Being constantly fucked by a stud like me. I know your type... You keep fighting against this because you know the moment you finally give in, you'll want nothing else...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n So preoccupied his taunts and threats the cougar was that he didn't notice the building starting crumple from his growing body until a bit of falling rubble hit him on the nose. He blinked and glanced up, though by then it was too late to stop himself. He erupted through the ceiling and way past the top floor of the building until there was nothing left of it. He stood feeling a bit stunned and disoriented as he held Puncher in a tightly closed fist. The noise didn't go unnoticed as Shenny stood across from him with her fists clenched and her teeth gritted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where. Is he?\" she growled angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rowland cringed and nearly stumbled back as the enraged wolfess took a step towards. Despite their equal height and his superior muscle mass, he was wary of his opponent. Shenny was no slouch when it came to combat and she had demonstrated more than once that she could not only hold her own against opponents of equal size, but completely dominate them in a fight. He glanced down at the hero currently concealed by his hand and he got an idea. He turned his back to Shenny and pulled the waistband to his speedo out before unceremoniously stuffing the hero in as deep as he could. Pint Puncher didn't get a chance to protest as Rowland released the waistband, letting it slam back into place and pinning the hero's puny body against his unimaginably large package. With him stored away he turned to face Shenny with the most charming smile he could manage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you mean that little runt? Beats me. Last time I saw him, he was with you\" he said with a shrug. \"By the way, have you lost weight? Because you are looking mighty fine today~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny narrowed her eyes at the flirtatious villain as she snarled her response. </span></div></div>",

Two mighty titans, ruling over this city and anyone in it? These people should be kissing the ground you walk on, and yet you're the one serving them. Together, we can take our rightful place in here. We'll have puny humans tend our every need. And the sex will be legendary. All can watch as we tear up one of their neighborhoods with our massive bodies entwined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny began to feel pangs of nausea at the mere thought of entertaining his lewd thoughts. Her concerns were far simpler. What had he done to her Pint Puncher? The hero wouldn't suddenly leave her. The cougar would have a lot to answer for and she didn't hesitate for a moment to make this very clear to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut your face, you tool!\" She snapped. \"Where is he?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, I don't know. Geez, has he got you mind-controlled or somethin? You sound like you're actually in love with that little squirt. Come on, play around with this for a bit and you'll forget all about him.\" Rowland stroked his package sensually, petting the smooth cloth of his speedo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher was trapped in the darkness of Rowland's crotch. His only companion was the cougar's enormous dick. The flaccid spire easily outclassed the hero's whole body in length several times. Even in this state it felt hefty enough to swallow the hero up. What little movement he had was spent trying to stay away from the tip and quietly groaning in disgust. The pit he was trapped in reeked of foul cougar sweat and musk. Fighting back was nearly impossible between the numbing stench and the huge mass of cock keeping him pinned down. He could hear the two arguing overhead. The villain's manhood throbbed with enthusiasm whenever he flirted with Shenny. Every pulse bore down on the hero like a steamroller. Just when it felt like things couldn't get worse Rowland's large hand descended upon him to fondle the monstrous rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cougar felt the little hero get pushed around in his speedo. It added an extra dimension of arousal as he played with his manhood. He knew Shenny couldn't resist this, no matter how much she rolled her eyes. She tried to hide her attraction, but when a man like him came along, how could she be anything but drawn to him? Greater yet was the feeling of shoving the pathetic hero between his cock and balls, letting his manhood slowly crush him into submission. He almost envied the shrunken hero, to be this close to a manhood like Rowland's could only be considered the highest reward for a puny human. He kept shoving the little human around, rubbing him all over his impressive cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy rubbing, pushing and jostling left the Pint Puncher disoriented. He couldn't make heads nor tails from it, trapped in the darkness. But with the cougar getting more erect by the second, opportunities arose too. From his new position on Rowland's junk, something was bound to happen. Did he end up squashed between erection and speedo, trapped between cock and balls or did Rowland manage to shuffle him close to the hungering tip of his manhood?</span></div></div>",

You can't seriously tell me you're least bit tempted... there's no way that worthless little beta male can satisfy you like <i>I </i>can\" he chuckled as he bucked his hips, his grin widening as he felt the hero's body being thoroughly smothered against his mighty shaft. Should she finally give into his charms, he fully intended to act on his initial taunts. His member hardened at the thought of impaling Pint Puncher and using him as a makeshift condom while he made sweet love to his woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I give a damn about your sorry excuse of a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny started to bite back with an emasculating quip when something caught her eye. Normally she wouldn't dare catch herself looking at Rowland's crotch, but her desire to insult his manhood lead her to glancing downward. It was a good thing she did, because otherwise she would've never noticed the tiny human shaped lump squirming helplessly against the cougar's gigantic bulge. Rowland blinked and shuddered at the expression the titanic wolfess gave him. In the span of a minute, she went from being irritated to completely deadpan as she stared at his bulge. He began to wonder if his flirtations finally won her over, though he couldn't be any more wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny was so utterly enraged by what he had done to her boyfriend that she basically came full circle. She wanted nothing more than to tear manhood off with her bare hands, though she managed to restrain herself. When she really stopped to consider it, she didn't necessarily need to use force to free her lover. Despite all his machismo and swaggering, Rowland was quick to devolve into a lovesick pup whenever she was around. She could easily use his lust for her to help Pint Puncher, perhaps restrain him while her lover got a few got shots in. Given her current state of mind, it didn't take her long to make her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher in the meanwhile was in absolute hell. His cramp, sweltering surroundings left him with very little air to breath and he found himself sweating and panting from the extreme heat emitting from Rowland's powerful manhood. He dreaded every breath he took, as he knew that the taste of Rowland's junk would be on his tongue for some time after this battle. The miasma of musk brought back memories of the last time the sadistic cougar had the upper hand on him. He could recall that details leading up to that particular confrontation, but that bared little relevance in comparison to what act committed against him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The horny evildoer had him literally pinned against the wall, his arms bound and his body bruised, beaten and reeking of numerous body odors, non of which originating from him. He tried to beg and when that didn't work he tried keeping his mouth clenched shut, but it amounted to nothing. Inch after inch of Rowland's monstrously large cock pushing past his lips and being forced down his gullet, the potent stench of pouring into his nose and taking root in his brain, and the rancid taste of sweat and cum forever staining his tastebuds. He so desperately wished he could forget it all, but given his present impediment it was impossible. The constant pressure around him constricted the air from his lungs. That coupled with Rowland's dominating musk resulted in him feeling lightheaded and delirious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You know... maybe this ain't so bad...' he thought to himself, his thoughts in a state of disarray as he continued to breath in Rowland's masculine scent. His oxygen addled brain was trying to do everything it could to ease the agony, even if it meant lying himself. It began to dig into Pint Puncher's not-so-secret fondness for being squished and dominated by Shenny and applying it to his current predicament. He found himself actually beginning to enjoy his surroundings, his arms wrapping around the pillar of flesh in front of him as his own member began to harden. His time spent with with his canine lover had conditioned him to stop shying away from his baser instincts... unfortunately, that conditioning opened the door for him, when pushed the right way, to potentially indulge himself in ways he normally wouldn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was quick to take notice of this fact and quickly shook his head, trying to push those thoughts out of his head. He'd never be able to forgive himself for even entertaining such nonsense. As if sensing his internal conflict, Rowland's cock pulsed ever so slightly, bringing his attention back to the massive wall of meat in front of him. He couldn't make it out in the darkness but he already had a mental image of what it looked like. Tall, thick, powerful... just like Rowland himself. He was so big and strong... stronger than Puncher could ever hope to be. His body was fighting to both stave off his disgusting thoughts and keep himself from passing out, and it was clear that it only had enough energy for the latter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He rubbed his hands long the smooth surface of Rowland's cock, admiring it immensity as he began to lean forward. He wondered if it would taste the way it did the last time Rowland had forced it down his throat, what with it being so much larger. Maybe he'd actually enjoy it this time around? There was only one way to find out. He slowly leaned in, his tongue slowly starting to snake out of his mouth as he leaned in. Before he could do something he would later regret, he heard his lover speaking from outside his hellish prison. He could scarcely hear, though her lovely voice was enough to bring him back to reality. He gasped and pushed back against the meaty wall in front of him, nearly vomiting at what he was about to engage in. He wasn't sure what his lover had said, but he made a mental note to thank her profusely once this was all said and done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Little did he know, the Shenny did more than just wake him out of his delusions. Her words came out in a calmed whisper, though the content of her words left Rowland wide-eyed and frozen in place. She had said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rowland's widening eyes nearly fell out of his skull with disbelief. Did he really just hear Shenny ask for it? Was she finally coming around to the truth? His mast throbbed almost painfully now against the restricting cloth of his speedo, mashing the puny hero trapped with it. The cougar wouldn't let any restraints stand in the way from showing his full glory. He stopped just short of ripping his speedo off completely, hastily shuffling out of it and dropping it on a nearby house. His erection jutted forwards towards the object of his admiration. Atop it was a tiny man, gagging and coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher held on to the immense cock as best he could whilst everything around him turned to a blur. He heard his girlfriend's words and could only hope it was a distraction of some kind. He prayed that she hadn't fallen prey to the temptations of Rowland's musk like he had. Then again, she wasn't currently being squished up against the cougar's piping hot rod. With the wall of cloth removed he experienced some semblance of clean air as he quickly found himself sitting atop the cougar's monstrous boner. Its nearly smooth surface was dotted with small veins, the only handholds the hero had. He tried to recover as best he could from the brutal mashing he'd endured, but Rowland was not waiting for anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's more like it. Free and ready for making hot love to you all night long.\" He smiled down at the recovering hero. \"And it even looks like your little boyfriend has accepted his role in all this. He will be our little toy. I will push him deep inside of you with my cock so you can feel him squirm for his freedom in your depths. Only once he's begged me will I swallow him up into my manhood and carry him to safety. And if he doesn't show his gratitude he can spend all night being crushed beneath us or inside of us whilst we make love unlike anything you've felt before.\" The cougar proudly boasted as Shenny tried her best to feign interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had far more eyes for her bruised boyfriend. After this she would pamper him and comfort him in the ways only an enormous wolfess could. She'd find whatever the human equivalent was of those ear rubs he gave her. But first she had to make sure Rowland was going to suffer. A devious plan hatched in the back of her mind and with a sultry, soft tone she stopped his monologue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that talk, why don't we skip straight to the action. Close your eyes, big boy. I want a little taste of the goods before you get anywhere near this.\" She pointed at her crotch, making Rowland's head spin with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm.... I love a woman of action. Alright, let me just put our little toyboy in position.\" Shenny's brow raised. She hadn't intended for the Pint Puncher to get involved in this too. Hopefully the cougar wouldn't inadvertently ruin her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bruised hero was clearing his head when Rowland's large hand came in and picked him up. His arms were pinned to his sides as the cougar carefully manipulated the hero, straightening him out. He was rolled a little between the large digits before he felt a disturbing slimy sensation on his feet. Warm goop coated his feet and soon the unnerving feeling began to crawl up his legs. He didn't want to acknowledge it, to remain blissfully ignorant of it. But the distraught look on his girlfriend's face and the subtle moans from his captor told him everything. He was being pushed into the villain's cock, deeper and deeper. The immense girth of Rowland's manhood easily kept him subdued as it engulfed more and more of the hero's body. With some effort the cougar slides the superhero's hands in, pushing a little to speed things up. Even the Pint Puncher's broad shoulders were no match for the slimy tunnel. He'd only been down the cougar's rod once before and it was nothing short of a miracle he escaped. The villain's balls had bathed him in cum potent enough to dissolve the spandex right off his body. He dreaded to think what might happen if he stayed in there too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the hero vanished completely the monstrous cock stopped pulling. Only the Pint Puncher's head remained poking out. With a big smile the villain taunted his nemesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, I'm sure you can use a little tongue from your former girlfriend too, Puny Puncher. A little prelude for when I pump you deep into her love tunnel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny kept her best smile, seeing her boyfriend defiled like this. \"Close your eyes, big boy. Focus on the heaven your cock is about to enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowland giddily obeyed, closing his eyes and waiting for her to give him the blowjob of a lifetime. He'd have to be careful not to launch the little toy hero down her throat. Damn it felt good when things went his way. He'd emasculated the Pint Puncher and claimed his girlfriend. He was riding a high that wouldn't soon fade, but Shenny had other plans. With the villain not looking she winked at the trapped hero, cluing him in on the ruse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher breathed a sigh of relief, knowing his lover was working on something. Though why that had to involve tempting the cougar into inserting him into his cock was still a mystery. She blew her warm wolf breath over his member, causing it to throb and shiver in anticipation. Little dribbles of pre washed over the pinned hero, soaking him in Rowland's anticipation. Then, with as little noise as possible she reared back a little, lifting one foot high behind her. Now it was the hero's turn to feel giddy as he saw precisely what was about to unfold. Her eyes were squarely on the prize: those two swollen, dangling orbs behind the raging boner. No doubt fat with pent up lust for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Shenny's anger and rage was unleashed in a single, devastating kick. Her foot swung right up between Rowland's legs and hit both bullseyes. The sheer fury and force behind her attack was enough to lift the entire cougar up into the air a few feet. The bellowing growl she let out along with the kick would haunt the villain's nightmares. His eyes shot wide open, filled with anger, betrayal and pain. He opened his maw in a soundless scream, the air shocked right out of his lungs. He fell to his knees, grabbing his aching balls as tears began to stream down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the Pint Puncher, trapped up to his neck in the villain's manhood, felt some semblance of sympathy for Rowland. Shenny's brutal assault on his balls was powerful enough to forcibly empty them a little, pushing a small sputter of warm cum through the deflating shaft. The hot slime pushed the hero free. He fell down into the waiting hand of Shenny, who quickly stepped back and hugged the messy hero tightly to her chest. He went from one squeezing tomb into another, but after the hell he was put through by Rowland, he'd take a slightly overenthusiastic hug from his girlfriend. Overhead he heard her speak to the villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to say this only once. I will never be your girlfriend and even the ugliest human in town would make a better boyfriend than you. Now, you're going to shrink down and I'm going to take you in. Either you come with us or I'm just going to keep kicking until you give up or pass out.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> The only reasonable option left for Rowland was to obey her requests and turn himself in. Her kick had left him stunned and short on breath, his hands clenched down on his privates as he struggled to even stand. He was in no condition walk, let alone fight. The thought of surrender never once entered his mind however, as it was superseded by a white hot burning fury. If there was any sense of logic or reason left in him, it certainly wasn't showing as he staggered to his feet with his fists clenched tight at his sides. Adrenaline was the only thing keeping the cougar standing, fueled by his wounded pride. Not only had she injured him physically, but she had thoroughly emasculated him by choosing Pint Puncher over him yet again. Such disrespect could not stand. His pride wouldn't allow it. Using was little energy he had left, the enraged villain lunged forward with his arms outstretched and poised to throttle her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny didn't so much as flinch as she reared her head back and waited for him to come in close. Once he was in arms reach of her, she darted forward and delivered a fierce headbutt to his nose. Rowland cried out in pain as he fell back onto his rear, unintentionally obliterating an evacuated house as he landed. The adrenaline fueling him had dissipated as he clutched his hands on his aching muzzle. He flashed her a bitter glare, though his rage gave way to fear as he saw her eyes. There was no anger behind them; only cold indifference<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny very gingerly placed her boyfriend the the roof of a nearby building, her a warm smile on her face as she leaned in and gave him a peck on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This won't take long...\" she said softly before her gaze snapped back over to Rowland. Without even the slightest bit of hesitation or preparation, she pounced on him with a mighty roar. To call what soon followed a \"battle\" would be a grievous mislabeling, as it would imply some level of retaliation on Rowland's part. While had a definite strength advantage, he wasn't battle hardened like Shenny. He wasn't the type of person who cared to use his muscle for combat, as he was far more interested in bullying those smaller than him. When it came to dealing with foes who matched him in size, he was quick to either excuse himself or bluff his way out of a confrontation, as he didn't even want to remotely risk the possibly of being outdone. His inexperience with genuine combat was on full display as Shenny fired heavy shots into his face and stomach repeatedly as he held his hands up to try and block them. Any attempt to stave off her punches proved fruitless as she would simply pick another point to hone in on and attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was by pure luck that he finally managed to create some distance between them as he bucked her off of him. The discrepency in their fighting skills had been thoroughly cemented by that point, so he opted to take that opportunity to try and crawl away to safety. In his weakened state, he didn't make it very far before he felt Shenny's hands grip tightly onto his ankles before pulling him back. He desperately clawed at the ground in an attempt to keep her from pulling him in, completely unconcerned with how pathetic he looked at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not finished with you!\" the fearsome wolfess snarled as she quickly turned him around and mounted him with her knees pinning his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait! Stop! I give--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny silenced his pleas with a right hook that rattled his skull. She could care less if he surrendered or not. In truth, she would've done this even if he hadn't attacked her. After everything he had put Pint Puncher through, she wasn't going to let him walk away unscathed. She would beat him so bad that he'd have nightmares about it while sleeping in his holding cell. She wanted him to break into a cold sweat at the very thought of her being near. Her assault was brought to an abrupt halt as her lover called out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenny! That's enough!\" he shouted sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enraged wolfess froze mid-punch and stared back at her incredulously. Why on earth would he take up for <b><i>Rowland</i></b> of all people? Especially after everything he had just been through! Still, she had come to trust his judgement and dropped her hands to her sides. If he was telling her to stop, he must've had a good reason for it. The hero flew down to Rowland's head, cringing as he surveyed the damage. Shenny had left his face swollen and bruised with a light trickle of blood leaking from his nose. He could only imagine how much worst the cougar would look had he not intervened. Rowland seemed to take notice to his presence as she peered over at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank... you...\" he wheezed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like for you to shrink down to a more manageable size so we can take you in. Can you still control your powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowland nodded weakly and soon began to diminish in size. Shenny was half tempted to use this opportunity to snatch him up and give him a taste of his own medicine, but thought better of it, both because of her respect for Puncher and her disgust at the very idea of Rowland being anywhere near her crotch. Soon enough the once colossal cougar had reduced himself to his minimum height of seven feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.. take me away...\" he muttered bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPint Puncher nodded as he walked over, but he wasn't going to let him get off so easy. Mirroring his lover's actions, he reeled his foot back and delivered a powerful kick to his still aching balls. The pain that shot through Rowland was so intense that he could no longer maintain consciousness and quickly passed out, his eyes rolling in the back of his head as head as mouth hung open in a soundless scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't very heroic of you\" Shenny said as she stifled a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well\" he replied as he looked down at suit. It was thoroughly coated in Rowland's cum, meaning he would have to replace it. The folks working at the institute would never let him live this incident down once they saw him. He sighed and hosted Rowland's limp body onto his back. Once they were done, he'd throw himself in the springs and stay there for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind getting his speedo for me?\" Pint Puncher asked as he began flying in the direction of the institute. He knew that he'd catch an earful from Dr. Wong should he leave behind any potential samples for her research. Shenny's nose curled at his request, though she was quick to oblige as she plucked the smelly undergarments off of the house it rested on. She felt bad for the family that lived there, as they would have to go back to a home that reeked of Rowland's musk. She shrugged it off as collateral damage and swiftly joined her lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two approached the facility, they noticed a woman standing out front waiting for them. Based on her clothing, they assumed it to be one of the scientists, though neither of them could recall ever seeing someone so... stacked, working for the facility. Once they were close enough to make out who it was, they could scarcely believe it. Standing before them was Tiffany, the rodent that had caused the two so much trouble in the past. Her fur was neat and primed, her normal attire exchanged for a skirt and lab coat which was opened just enough to give onlookers a view of her cleavage. Around her neck was a silver collar, no doubt the same type given to Shenny to regulate her height. Her eyes held none of the crazed malice that they usually did, as she regarded the two with an almost weary calmness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany...?\" Pint Puncher mouthed as he stared at her in disbelief. He could only imagine what type of experiments they had done to her to bring about this radical transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Wong would like to see you to discuss the results of the materials she presented you with\" Tiffany said before a group of staff members out of the institute to usher the unconscious Rowland to his holding cell. Once that was taken care off, the once villainous rodent turned around to head back inside. \"Right this way\" she instructed smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPint Puncher and Shenny stared at one another for a some time before the relucted and walked inside, Shenny quickly shooting down in size with Rowland's speedo in hand. The other staff seemed nonplussed at the sight of Tiffany, further confusing the couple. Eventually they were in Wong's laboratory where she appeared to be on her break as she leaned back in her chair with a large box of candy in hand. She glanced over at the three as they entered and raised a brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, what hell happened to you? You look like you fell in a vat of yogurt\" she joked in her usual dry tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not talk about it...\" the hero muttered as Shenny stepped up and placed Rowland's speedo on her desk. The good doctor was quick to put two and two together and almost smirked as she looked at down at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\". Puncher began, hoping to steer the conversion away from his humilation. \"You mind me asking what <i>this</i> is about?\" he asked as he pointed at Tiffany who simply stood with her hands clasped loosely together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've made her my new research assistant. It's part of some reformation project the higher-ups have proposed. Which reminds me, I need this stored in the testing chamber for later\" she said pointing to the speedo on her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away, Doctor Wong\" Tiffany said as she grabbed it off of the desk and made her way old. As she walked past Pint Puncher, she stopped to flash him a quick smile before leaving. Pint Puncher smiled back, though he nearly jumped as he felt her hand graze his butt. She was gone before he could admonish her and he could swear she saw her wink at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo, how did it go? The last time we talked you were sitting in her stomach\" Dr. Wong said, obviously referring to the anise she gave them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Do they tell her about that odd afternoon? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shenny was first to respond to the doctor's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the moment he sprayed that stuff into my nose my memory went all hazy. I can recall bits and pieces of it, but it all seems surreal, like it didn't even actually happen. And then of course the next day I wake up to discover my boyfriend is now in my belly. So yeah, make of that what you will, but if it's up to me, I don't think we need any crazy sprays to enjoy eachother's company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher smiled at his girlfriend. The way she described that rollercoaster of a night was quite amusing, but he wanted to add to it all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds pretty accurate. She got really weird basically from the start. Her speech started to slur, she sounded sorta drunk. Then she began to squish me flat with various bodyparts under the guise of toughening me up. And the grand finale was putting me in her maw and suckling on me before accidentally swallowing me as she fell asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting, so she didn't consciously eat you?\" Wong's brow lifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think she'd have reacted a bit more actively in that event, anise or not. She dozed off with me still in her maw and gulped me down as a result. The next morning I gave you a call and you know the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any further difficulties getting out?\" The doctor probed. Her brows were raised close to the ceiling with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, she just heaved me up like you said. Surprisingly easy, really.\" The superhero added, making Shenny blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very interesting, you've given me plenty of useful information. Though if you don't mind me asking, how was the inside of Shenny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which part?\" the wolfess asked with a smirk. The hero chuckled and answered the question. \"Well, it was what you'd expect a stomach to be. Dark, gurgling non-stop and smelly. The only thing that really changed was the size. It was big enough for me to hover in without touching the walls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Wong diligently wrote down every observation before putting away her notepad. She beckoned the two to follow her, but the superhero objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind, I'd like to get a new suit first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course. Probably best you don't leak that... stuff all over my lab. Just fill these for me please.\" She handed the Pint Puncher several large beakers, which he used to scrape the thick goop off his body and legs. He handed them back to the doctor, who looked strangely pleased to be given several liters of supervillain cum. The dripping hero left the room to get changed, leaving Shenny and dr. Wong alone for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor?\" She asked, am unusual hesitation in her voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Shenny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those collars, do they just keep one's size in check or do they have more functions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They stabilize molecules, allowing one to fix their size to a certain point. It's why Tiffany is about human-sized instead of her usual tiny height or titanic form. Let me tell you it took some effort to get that just right. That brings me to a question, by the way. Where's yours? I gave you one too right, so you could be at this height without needing to exert a constant effort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it got lost after the anise started muddying my brain.\" The wolfess lied. Seeing Tiffany so uncannily obedient made Shenny a bit weary of the collar. She deflected any further questions by asking another of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you'll ever be able to make others grow like me or Tiffany can? With a spray, or a collar or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for lack of trying. We all picture the Pint Puncher having a much easier task protecting the city if he could be the size of you. But the superpower you control has demonstrated to be very unstable. Artificially inducing it in even objects has proven difficult. However, it's not been entirely without results. Come, you might like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny followed the doctor to the back of her lab, where she saw a pair of bracelets. She was about to ask about them, but Wong already started her explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These allow you to transfer your power to someone else. Think of it as being able to share your growth with another. They're still a prototype though, and at this stage they only let you share at the cost of your own abilities. So you could let someone grow, but you wouldn't be able to maintain your own huge size. As the other person grows, you'll shrink down. You can either stop halfway or completely hand over your size to another. We haven't worked out their precise function, but if you're volunteering I won't say no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess sheepishly nods in agreement, taking the bracers and quickly noting how stretchy they are. She stuffs them in her bikini strap for later. They return to Wong's desk just as a fresh and clean Pint Puncher walks in. He poses a moment with his new undamaged suit before joining the two. Quickly he spots the strange items on Shenny's waist and inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are for some fun tonight. And don't worry, it won't involve me eating you.\" The wolfess replied, patting him on the head. She sniffed for a moment, impressed with her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a hint of Rowland on you, those cleaners know what they're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, turns out that with super endurance you can use a pressure cleaner on me.\" He replies with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more friendly banter the duo is on their way out. Up ahead they spot Tiffany, no doubt on her way to Dr. Wong's lab. The mouse seems a touch nervous, possibly remembering her parting words to the superhero. Instead of walking past one another all three of them stop, exchanging awkward glances. With an eerie confidence the mouse walks up to them. The duo still have difficulties wrapping their heads around it, moreso looking at just how quickly everyone else in the I.S.E.A. seemed to have gotten used to an anthro mouse in their ranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we didn't get much time to talk previously. I just wanted to say thanks for bringing me here. They've been really helpful in getting me to become a productive member of society.\" Neither the hero nor the wolfess could quite believe what they were hearing. The mouse giggled at their shocked surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's a big change, pun intended. But I'm really finding my place here. And besides, after what happened between you and Shenny, is it really that hard to believe there are more villains who could turn out good? Anyway, I've got to get these forms to Dr. Wong. Best not to let her wait. See you around, sweetie.\" She put her hand on the hero's cheek with those last words, earning her a suspicious glare from Shenny. The mouse moved on, her hand 'accidentally' sliding past the hero's butt again. He was still a bit too dumbstruck by Tiffany's sudden turnaround to comment on it, shaking his head and looking to his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose she's got a point, after you saw something in me who knows how many others can be redeemed? Still, she better not get any ideas. That little butt of yours belongs to me.\" Shenny said with a big grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of superheroes returned to their home in the forest, the superhero scratching his head. Some part of his new suit was making him itch. He fished around in the tight spandex until he discovered a folded up piece of paper. Only one word was written on it: Tiffany. The mouse had slipped him a note. He unfolded the paper to reveal an unexpected message. Tiffany had written him...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Two things were made clear to Pint Puncher as he looked over the contents of her note. The first was that Tiffany had atrocious penmanship. Not that it could be held against her, seeing as she's never been put in a position where she deemed it necessary to commit words to paper. The second was that despite coming off as calm and subdued in person, the former supervillain was still madly in love with him. Most of it was gushing over how happy she was to see him finally and how much she wanted them to be together as a couple, conveying all the subtlety of a teenage fangirl writing to her celebrity crush. There were even one or two faded kiss marks on the paper, really driving home how much she pined for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He couldn't help but find her enthusiastic ramblings endearing in an odd way. It certainly was a step up from the borderline psychotic lust she exhibited before. He thought of calling Shenny over to let her get a good laugh out of it when something caught his eye. Somehow he had missed the photograph taped to the bottom of the note. He pulled it off and went wide eyed as he examined it. The image shown was that of Tiffany, stripped down to nothing but her lab coat and panties, her back against the wall as she looked to the camera with a come hither expression. Her coat was unbuttoned at the top, granting the hero a perfect shot of her bountiful cleavage and her legs were spread open just wide enough to give him a glimpse of her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n While the hero's heart still belonged to his colossal wolf lover, he had to admit that the stacked rodent was quick a feast for the eyes as he could feel his spandex suit getting progressively tighter the longer he stared at it. It took him about a minute before he finally tore his eyes away from the photo, though by then it had already done it's job as his manhood was at full salute, pushing uncomfortably against his costume. He didn't hesitate in tearing the photo into pieces and throwing it into the wind. He certainly appreciated the gesture, but he wasn't comfortable with how quick he was to indulge in his fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His battle with Rowland had brought to light a growing issue within him. Had Shenny not been there to help him out, there was a fair chance that he would've willing given himself to the wicked cougar. He tried envisioning that exact same scenario playing out with her absent and it didn't bold well for him. Even when factoring in the sweltering heat and the thick cloud of musk hovering around him, he didn't like how easy it was for Rowland to seduce him; so easy in fact, that the horny villain didn't even notice that it was happening, as his attention was fixed solely on Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All of that raised brought to mind a very important question for Pint Puncher: Just how easy was he to control? He had managed to fight off Lovey's hypnosis with such vigor that she was left completely drained of energy, but his submissive streak went beyond the mental. He could fight off a psychological attack, but he couldn't help what his body reacted to. As he was trapped in the tight, swampy confines of Rowland's speedo, he could feel his dick grow stiffer with each passing second, even before the heatstroke kicked in. Why on earth would such a thing turn him on so greatly? Even as he stood there reflecting on the incident, he could feel his manhood twitch and harden at the memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Perhaps his countless hours of sexual exploration with Shenny had pushed him into this mindset. Such weakness could pose a serious problem later on down the line, especially if Shenny wasn't there to protect him. The only solution he could think of was to take a break from their usual sexual escapades for a while, at least until his raging libido calmed down enough to not be hindrance on the job. He cringed at the thought of waking up every morning without his love's maw tending to his morning wood, but he'd find a way to power on through it. Besides, there were plenty of ways the two of them could have fun without having sex... board games, maybe? Reading? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy, come on! I wanna try out the gadgets that Dr. Wong gave me!\" Shenny called from the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero smiled brightly and quickly made his way over to her, like a dog to it's master. Maybe someday he'd give their fun times a rest, but today was <i>not </i>one of those days. 'I'll start tomorrow' he thought to himself as he entered the clearing in time to see his lover leaning back against the plateau, a mischievous smile on her face as she crooked her finger twice. That smile alone sent chills down Puncher's spine. 'M-maybe next week... or next month...' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What do you think?\" Shenny asked with a giddy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... sounds a bit dangerous to me...\" Pint Puncher said as he sat between his lover's crossed legs. \"What if something happens to the bracelets while we're transformed and we can't change back to our normal sizes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You worry too much! Even if that happened, I bet Wong would be able to fix us up no problem!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher grunted and folded his arms, though he didn't voice any more complaints. In all the time he had known her, the good doctor always came through for him when he needed it. That said, her inventions didn't have a one hundred percent success rate. Most of the time they worked but when they failed, it usually didn't end well for him. There was instance where she had given him an experimental spray that was meant to nullify Helen's powerful flatulence, but instead endowed her farts with a special kind of pheromone that left citizens addicted to the horrid stench, himself included. He managed to defeat once it finally exited her system, though it proved to be a bittersweet victory as the cover of the front page news depicted him with face nestled lovingly between her cheeks with Helen laughing haughtily at him. Wong didn't see it fit to apologize for the blunder, claiming that the humiliating encounter had \"given her mountains of new information\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for us! Wouldn't you like know what it's like to be almost as big as me?\" she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess that would be pretty neat...\" the hero drawled as he rubbed his chin in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled! We're gonna try it out!\" Shenny giggled as she clasped her hands around her tiny lover and held him up in outstretched arms. Taking in a deep breath, she closed her eyes and began to concentrate. If this worked the way she hoped, she could finally act out her fantasy of them making passionate love as giants. She tried not to get her hopes up, as Wong stressed that the bracelets were still in the trial phase, but she couldn't keep herself from getting excited. As she used her usual size changing powers, she felt the bracelets beginning to grow warm on her wrists. She wasn't the only one feeling it, as Pint Puncher could feel his body tingling with some kind of odd energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n One thing was for certain: the devices were indeed changing the two...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher felt the first spurts of growth take hold in his body. Everything tingled and an alien warmth suffused him to his very core. The other sign of his rapid growth was a little more painful, as his spandex suit quickly tightened, especially around his growing boner. Before he would rip through his suit he quickly pulled it off. The superhero would no doubt get an earful back at the lab if he tore his suit to shreds again so soon after the last replacement. Clearly it wasn't built for the hero to suddenly grow ten times taller. What a stupid oversight, the hero thought sarcastically. Soon his attention returned to his still huge lover who was gazing amorously at his exposed body. He could feel her eyes linger on his manhood, the proud erection twitching with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny saw her boyfriend rising up before her eyes. Soon he'd see the world through her eyes and admire her size up close. Another titan for the city to look up to. His beautiful body would be the envy of many and the wolfess would be the only one to ever be close to it. She imagined most supervillains would just pack their things and leave at the thought of having to deal with a huge Pint Puncher. He'd probably be able to punch most of them straight into orbit. It would be the start of a new era of peace, free of villains. And with that peace would be all the private time the two of them could ever dream of. They'd make the trees in the forest shake with their passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess laid back and admired her swiftly rising man, but something was amiss. As he grew, her perspective changed. All the trees around her were growing too. No, wait. She was shrinking. With every bit of height he gained, she went down. Wong meant it when she said the wolfess could 'lend' her power to others. By the time the Pint Puncher would reach her size, she'd be reduced to his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she was distraught, but she quickly accepted the predicament she was in. Unfortunate as it may be, it seemed the superhero would have to wait a little longer for the full Shenny experience. But surely being half as tall would still be quite a step up for him. She sighed, reluctantly having to make due with only half her height. Merely being large instead of her usual huge shape would be a downer, but in the company of her equally sized boyfriend it probably wouldn't even register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher was nervous, seeing Shenny's face draw closer with every bit of height he gained. Soon the two would match eachother in size. How would she react to it? This must be so weird for her. Her face shows her nervousness too. At least he wasn't alone in feeling more than a little anxious about what was about to happen. It almost seemed surreal that he might get a shot at doing it with her. After all the weird, kinky stuff they've been through just regular plain sex seemed almost pedestrian. But given that each of them was now large enough to make their lovemaking heard and felt for miles around there was still something decidedly unique about this situation. Pleasant thoughts turned to surprise when his girlfriend didn't stop growing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Shenny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up, what the hell? I'm not doing anything anymore, it's these bracers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I got you.\" The Pint Puncher reassured her, quickly scooting back a little so he wouldn't accidentally pin her beneath his growing body. A large hand came in and scooped up the shrinking wolfess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny shivered a little, soaring through the air in her boyfriend's hand. She'd lost control of the growth process and given every bit of herself to the superhero. It wouldn't be long before she couldn't stand much taller than he would normally be, whilst he could now easily dominate her with just one hand. Was this what he always felt like? Powerless and helpless in the grasp of his much stronger girlfriend? She yelped as the large hand holding her raced towards his chest. With a hefty smack he brought his fist to his muscular torso. His fingers unfurled around the wolfess and he held her close to the near hairless surface. With his softest voice he whispered overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, don't be afraid. You'll safe with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the initial shock of her new size wore off the wolfess began to mull over why this had happened. Normally she's got a good grip on her abilities, but these bracers were messing with them. Maybe she focused so hard on making him as titanic as herself that they wouldn't stop until he was. It warranted more experimentation. But as she pondered her abilities her boyfriend had other ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher leaned back, shifting the smooth wall of his chest into a smooth floor. As he laid onto the grass he slowly let go of his lover, letting her stand on his chest. He looked on as she stared at the bracers in bemusement before meeting his gaze. It took a few subtle hints, but eventually he got her to look behind her as well. Jutting up straight towards the sky was his manhood. The wolfess couldn't help but look at it with a strange pang of desire. There was only one other man that could boast about being this big. And it'd be a cold night in hell before she'd be in any way interested in Rowland's junk. Seeing her own boyfriend now sporting an erection that had her whole body beat in height was sending all manner of weird thoughts through her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down one last time at the bracers. With some effort and elbow grease she can probably get them to do as she intended and push each of them to roughly the same size. But why rush things? She wouldn't soon get another change to experience this. For the first time the Pint Puncher was the towering giant. Any fears for him quickly melted away as he made soft cooing noises and patted her with a single finger. Perhaps some fun could be had before she tries to get some of her size back.</span></div></div>",

She had always felt tremendously uncomfortable whenever she was shrunk down to human size, but that discomfort waned as she looked upon the chiseled landscape of flesh and muscle that constituted her lover. Pint Puncher had once told her that her great size somehow amplified her beauty and while she had felt flattered by his kind words, she thought that he was just being cute with her. Standing atop his enlarged body, she finally understood his sentiment. She admired the finer details of his body in a way that she never would've been able to at her normal height. Her eyes lingered on one spot jn particular, that being the large pillar of meat which currently towered over her. A chill ran though her as it really hit home just how small she had become, that his manhood alone dwarfed her in size. It was just so... <i>big</i>. She could hardly wrap her mind around it... or her arms for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She took slow steps towards his immense package, her eyes wide with a curious hunger that she couldn't quite explain. She placed her hands onto it and flinched as it jerked in reaction to her touch. She glanced back at her titanic lover's face and grinned as she saw him biting down on his bottom lip. Even at his great size, his manhood was every bit as sensative as it normally was. Turning her attention back to his cock, she knew exactly how to proceed. Without any hesitation, she leaned in and wrapped her arms around it, pressing her body against the warm surface and giving it very ginger kiss. The very instant her lips made contact, she was nearly pushed back as his already stiff manhood pulsed and hardened. She felt something hot and sticky hit the top of her head and looked up at the swollen cockhead, her mouth watering as gobs of precum spouted out onto her face. She had gotten used to sampling her lover's spunk, but never at such a volume. Even his most intense of orgasms offered her only poultry sum for her to enjoy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny decided take advantage of the opportunity presented to her and lapped up the cum as it seeped down his mighty shaft. She shivered in delight as she swallowed several mouthfuls of hot jizz, an amused grin on her face as her giant boyfriend shuttered and gasped with every lick. For the hero, this experience was nothing short of surreal. He watched as his girlfriend worshipped his cock, squeezing, kissing and licking every inch of it's heated surface. He felt an unusual sense of empowerment watching her work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Huh... no wonder Rowland does this to people...' he thought with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero's attention was brought back to his pint sized lover as she began to pump his shaft with her body, her eyes glazed over and her tongue hanging as she practically humped the massive meat spire. It wasn't long before Pint Puncher finally reached his peak, throwing his head back and letting loose a loud cry the could be heard throughout the forest as he came. A veratible geyser of cum shot up high into the air before raining back down onto the duo. This lasted for nearly a minute and by the end of it, the Shenny and a large portion of their home was coated in a thick layer of spunk. Not that the horny wolfess particularly minded, as she sat with her back pressed against the his softening shaft, a content smile on her face as she surveyed the damage. Had she not known better, she could've sworn that winter had arrived early, as the area around them was bathed in white. It would certainly be a long cleab up, that was for certain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How're you feeling, big guy?\" she asked looking over to her boyfriend's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPint Puncher simply grunted in response, his mind and body still racked with pleasure. Even with their roles reversed, Shenny always knew how to leave him nearly comatose afterward. She laughed at his response and stood up, shaking some of the cum out of her fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got another one in you? If you're too tired, we could wash up and call it a day. Or...!\" she began with a lewd smile. \"... I can give these bracelets a crack and see if I can even out or sizes so we can... you know...\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher's eyes fluttered as he came back to reality. Looking down at the mess they had made, he decided to... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a content smile he looks down at his girlfriend and the mess she made. He'd not felt anything close to what she managed, utterly overwhelming his senses. But he saw that lustful look and knew she was far from done. Her body might be tiny, but her libido most certainly was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm far from finished with you, babe. But I know that look. You're all messy, that's no way to continue playing with all of this.\" He gestured at his vast landscape of a body. The wolfess smiled in response, prompting him to reach down and offer her a hand to step onto. \"Don't worry, I'll be gentle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny was in awe as she sat down in her boyfriend's palm. Carefully she was carried towards his face, getting a great bird's eye view of the smooth hills that were his muscles. Once she'd been hoisted up to his face his mouth opened a little and a large, stocky tongue slid out. The wolfess knew where this was going, smiling widely and reaching out for the approaching soggy muscle. It pressed her flat against the palm of his hand. The smooth surface tickled a bit, her giggles muffled beneath the slippery mass. Copious volumes of saliva washed away his cum and left her relatively clean in just a few licks. The Pint Puncher worked his hardest to keep a straight face. The combination of wolf fur and his cum wasn't very palatable, but he muscled through for his girlfriend. With her appropriately cleaned he returned her to his groin, setting her down near his still semi-erect mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're done being tiny already?\" He said seductively. The wolfess smiled nervously and nodded after a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't seem so convinced. Look at it and tell me you don't want to play with it a little more.\" She turned and stared at the meaty pillar, lewd thoughts racing through her head. Her silence told the superhero all he needed to know. He grunted a little, making his manhood throb with desire only his girlfriend's petite touch could fulfill. Shenny mumbled some vague justification before stepping towards the imposing column. This time she wanted more than just the shaft to play with though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy, gimme a boost!\" She yelled out. The hero smiled and brought his hand down to his groin. He placed it like a ramp against his boner, letting the wolfess climb up and caress his tip. Immediately he struggled to stay in place as a potent rush of pleasure shot down his shaft and into his body. Almost instantly the arousing touch of his girlfriend made his manhood leak again. She could see the well of cum with her own eyes, grabbing handfuls of the warm slime and rubbing it over his sensitive bulb. But Shenny wasn't done. Far lewder ideas came to mind and seeing that manhood react to her slightest touch made her all the more giddy to try them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher gasped in surprise when he felt a shot of pleasure and a tinge of pain running down his manhood. He looked down to see Shenny had pushed her head, muzzle first, into his manhood. Her ears still poked out of his urethra, but the rest of her face was plunged into the slimy hole. Inside it felt like she was licking something. The sensation was so alien it scared him. He quickly planted a finger on her back and pulled her out. Shenny looked up to her boyfriend with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stuffed your head down my dick!\" He said, surprised by her casual approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you like it? I'm thinking with a little effort and some help on your side I might get a whole lot further than just my head.\" Her tone was ever so suggestive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you want to be \u00edn my member?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I put you in my privates all the time. Now that our sizes are reversed, I kinda wanna see how it feels the other way around. That big manhood of yours, throbbing all around me. Swimming in your balls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... um... what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, I know you can do it. I've seen Rowland shove someone down his dick so many times when he was trying to woo me. And you're a lot more well-hung than he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero blushed at the compliment, but his concern remained. \"Yeah, but that's Rowland. I don't know how to do any of those things, and last I heard the people that go into his balls tend to not come out again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that was just a Rowland thing. I'm sure your balls will be safe.\" The wolfess' foolhardy confidence was inspiring, but the superhero still wasn't sure. He didn't even know where to begin in all this. Sucking his girlfriend down his shaft seemed like a complete impossibility. With a soothing voice Shenny called out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, we'll take it nice and slow. I'm sure it'll come naturally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't know what she's hoping to accomplish by this, but her optimism was infectious. Dicks weren't made to pull anything into them, but she'll be damned if she doesn't at least try. With some effort she clambers back onto his manhood, the narrow slit awaiting her. This time the hero was determined to help, providing her a nearby hand to hold onto as she prepared herself to take the plunge. She started calmly enough, poking the slit with her muzzle and pushing it in. Drops of cum bubbled up to lubricate her head and soon enough she'd pushed it in completely. Next came her shoulders and it quickly became clear she couldn't do this alone. With all the care he could muster the superhero grabbed her torso between two fingers and pushed. The pleasure was intense, but to his surprise it worked. Slowly more of her body was sliding down his shaft. But without him actively pushing her in, he didn't feel any kind of pull. Dutifully he kept going, his girlfriend gently wiggling within the sensitive flesh. If she wasn't careful his orgasm would send her rocketing out too soon. As her hips sank into his manhood he felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA throb, followed by a unique sensation. He let go of his lover and waited intently. Again he felt it, this time clearer. That feeling, right after the throb. He looked at the wolfess' legs still sticking out of his cock and with the next throb he saw them sink in a little deeper. Holy shit, he was actually doing this. Shenny had been right about it coming naturally and now he watched in awe as his member set about devouring his girlfriend completely. The sight of her legs slowly sinking into his member was surreal, but the feeling was amazing. Her whole body squirmed in such pleasurable ways inside of his shaft. He tried so hard not to blow his load too soon. But when her feet finally vanished from sight it became too much. He'd just let his cock swallow his lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny felt the walls quake with pleasure and she knew she wouldn't get to see his balls from the inside. Ahead of her was a torrent of cum. It crashed into her, pushing her back out with remarkable force. Her legs felt the cold air first, but in seconds her whole body was carried out on a rush of white slime. The flow was so powerful she actually shot up a little bit before landing in her boyfriend's palm. She didn't have the words for the experience she just went through. thankfully, neither did he. Both of them just stared vacantly at one another, amazed they'd been able to pull off such an act. The superhero couldn't believe his dick was capable of pulling things in, let alone his girlfriend. The wolfess was awestruck by the sensation of being engulfed by cockflesh, the warmth and sheer overwhelming strength of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero provided her with a quick tongue bath to wash away the worst of his release. She looked up to him expectantly, drool still leaking from her fur. The night was still young and though his body felt a little weary from the last two orgasms, a mere glance at the smoking hot wolfess was all it took. He was ready for more and with a confident grin he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then big boy, let's see how you fare when we're both the same size.\" Shenny smiled, concentrating on the bracelets.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Although she seemed gun-ho and optimistic in her speech, Shenny felt more than a little uneasy. Whether the bracelets had malfunctioned or she had somehow mishandled them previously, she didn't know if she could get them to work as intended. She had enjoyed their bit of role reversal, but what would she do if she couldn't change back? The wolfess tied much of her identity into her great size and she didn't like the idea of having to part with it for good. Not to mention her it would leave her lover stuck at a size he was not at all accustomed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her fears were immediately abated as she felt the familiar warmth stirring from the bracelets and she began to shoot up in size. The sudden shift in perspective was so jarring that she had to close her eyes and try to ease herself into it. She was so used to growing and shrinking on a dime that she almost forgot that she was also taking size away from her boyfriend. The last thing she wanted was to reduce him to the size of a grain of sand and lose him forever. She took deep and steady breaths, slowing her growth considerably as she shift her attention back to Pint Puncher. Her eyes widened in delight as they were soon at eye level, the warmth of the bracelets dissipating once they were on an even keel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two simply stared into each others eyes, unsure of how to proceed or what to say. For Pint Puncher, it felt utterly bizarre for him to look upon Shenny from the perspective of an equal. He had come to see her as a towering sex goddess, larger and stronger than he could ever hope to be. Now they sat across from each other, with him peaking over colossal body by a meager three feet. If he were to disregard the fact that the two of them were currently giants in the middle of a forest, this would be the closest thing to normalcy that the two of them had ever experienced up till that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny's expression mirrored his, but for much different reasons. After their little mishap from before, she half-expected something to go wrong yet again. Perhaps the bracelets would simply return them to their normal sizes, leaving her to put her fantasy on the back burner once more. Her mind went back to the first time she had dreamed of Pint Puncher making love to her as a giant. That mental image lit a fire beneath her as she lunged forward, pinning her lover to the ground as she straddled his waist and stared deeply into his eyes. Her expression conveyed a lust so intense that it actually made the hero uneasy. He could only recall one other instance were she looked at him in such a way and that was when she was high off of anise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna... Mmm...! I'm gonna fuck your brains out...!\" she murmured as her hands ran along his finely-sculpted body. Her voice quaked with excitement, her body trembling with anticipation. She had waited for this day for so long: the day that the two of them would make passionate love as giants. The intensity of their sex would shake the very earth beneath them, echoing throughout the land for all to hear. By the time she was done with him, the smell of the forest would forever be bathed in their combined musk, marking their territory and making it clear to any potential invaders who this land belonged to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The confused and worried look on her boyfriend's face brought her back to reality. It suddenly occurred to her that he hadn't been privy to that particular fantasy. He knew that she had a hyperactive libido, but was unaware of how badly she had wished for this to happen. She stared down at him and giggled, relaxing her posture and removing her hands from his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Got a little carried away...\" she said with a sheepish smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little?\" her lover joked, his voice breaking slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't mean to scare you like that. It's just... I've always wanted to be able to do this with you. Don't get me wrong, you're the best lay I've ever had no matter what size you are, but...\" she petered off as she looked back down at his body. \"... I think a small part of me wants to change things up every now and again. I'm so used to being the dominant one during sex... and... the thought of being taken by a big strong man gets me hot! I sure as hell wasn't going to let that pig Rowland do it. But <i>you</i>... I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night biting own on my fist to keep from screaming... because dreaming of <i>you</i>, holding me down and claiming me as yours...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher's face turned a bright shade of red at her words. While he knew that she loved him, she had no idea how deep her affection went. He delighted in being able to worship and please her in any way he could, submitting himself to whatever games and fantasizes she wished to act out. He never would've guessed that she secretly wished for him to dominate her on occasion. Then again, he could hardly be blamed for not coming to that conclusion. Their relationship prior to becoming a couple consisted of him slaving away at her feet in fear of incurring her wrath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After receiving such information, he was stuck on what to do next. He was so used to letting her take the reigns that he wasn't sure if he could satisfy her needs. Would he be able to overcome his ingrained submissive streak?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shenny stared at her boyfriend, amused as she could almost see the gears in his head turning. She was ready and waiting to be the submissive wolfess in his powerful hold, but he didn't quite seem capable of responding in kind. Maybe she was expecting a little bit too much from the hero. He's probably a bit too much of a boy scout to dominate anything romantically. For now Shenny was content to simply enjoy his embrace. Maybe he'd be able to work up something for her. He'd better not let her do the legwork, because the wolfess is ready to take her fantasies to eleven and he'll be feeling that in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero wracked his brain, looking up to the amorous gaze of his lover. She expected him to be the domineering one all of a sudden? What the hell should he do? He'd never done anything of the sort. He felt embarrassed to think this might even be as close to a girlfriend he's been. He'd wooed a few during high school, but none of that was very serious or lasted all that long. And ever since he's a superhero he's been single. It's far too risky for him to get romantic with anyone. The number of supervillains out there with a jealous streak made it too dangerous. If they caught so much as a whiff of another woman on him, they'd tear down half the city to find and destroy her. Just imagining someone like Tiffany showing up at his prospective girlfriend's house and squashing both it and her flat under her giant ass sent shudders down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large hand cradled his head and locked his gaze with Shenny. The wolfess smiled with pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you poor innocent thing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher had to act fast. If he could think of a good way to be dominant himself, maybe he could emulate another supervillain. They had this whole domineering shtick down pat. He cleared his throat and put on his best Rowland impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon babe, just lie down and let big 'ol me deal with ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny sat up a little, staring in bemusement before bursting into laughter. Both at the superhero trying to act like Rowland and the hilariously bad impression. She quickly put a finger on his lips to stop this embarrassing display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you're adorable Punchy. But maybe it's better if you don't say a word. Just promise me you won't hold anything back.\" The hero nodded. That he could do. The wolfess wasn't so sure. \"And I do mean <i>anything.</i> Now let's make love so passionately the whole forest will hear me howl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis girlfriend was demanding, but they were both confident he could deliver. She started off by shifting herself forward. He was no longer eye to eye with her, but instead looking up at a pair of soft, fuzzy boobs screaming for attention. The superhero didn't wait for her to tease him and wrapped his arms around her, pulling her down on top of him and burying his face in those soft mounds. She yipped in surprise before moaning. The hero's smooth face rubbing against her rack whilst he held her firmly in his hands, this was what she dreamed of. Normally his whole body would vanish between those mounds, but he wasn't going to let their altered sizes stop him from trying for the same result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below the wolfess felt his rising erection bump against her inner thigh. It yearned for a woman's touch and she was all too happy to oblige. Though depriving the hero of her pillowy chest was sad, the moment his tip made contact with her moist pussy all was forgiven. A powerful surge of pleasure shook his whole body. The greedy snatch quickly took in most of his manhood, his first thrust sealing in the remainder. He was up to the hilt inside of his girlfriend and it felt nothing short of divine. That huge love tunnel that had squeezed and massaged him so many times now did the same to his sensitive manhood. With each thrust it became harder not to blow his load right away. He was torn between giving in now and extending this absolute pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny couldn't believe her luck. Her wildest fantasy had just been realized. And as good as it felt in her dreams, the real thing was a thousand times better. She moaned louder and louder, tears of bliss forming in the corner of her eyes. Both of them were on the very edge, practically daring the other to hold on longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shen...\" The hero tried to utter a word but his lover quickly silenced him with a passionate kiss. They both closed their eyes and in unison they reached their peak. The hero felt his loins explode with sheer unfettered delight as he shot wave after wave into his girlfriend. In response the quaking pussy bore down on him hard, her own release lubricating the action. Their kiss was short-lived, interrupted when the wolfess broke out of his embrace. Her hands were on his pecs as she raised herself up and let out a howling moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she neared the end of her climax she flopped back down into the hero's embrace. He held her tightly, simply wanting to be close to his beautiful girlfriend. She shared the sentiment, basking in the afterglow of sex so epic most of Glam City might have heard it. She didn't care if the I.S.E.A. was going to give her crap for this. Fulfilling her deepest desires was worth it. Judging by his enamored smirk, her boyfriend thought the same. Both of them gave it their all. They laid together, spent and tired. Their smiles couldn't be bigger.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Words couldn't describe how happy Pint Puncher felt. It wasn't like this was his first time with a woman... well, a non-human woman a least. He couldn't even begin to list the amount of times a villain put him into a compromising position, either through mind control or brute force. It'd probably be easier for him to count the villains he <i>didn't</i> have some form of sexual experience with. This was an entirely new experience for him though, as it marked the first and only time he'd ever had sex with someone he genuinely had affection for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny shared his feelings as she nuzzled into his bare chest. So much had changed in such a short amount of time that she could hardly believe it. She used to view Pint Puncher nothing more than a pest for her to crush beneath her heel. He was a hindrance that seemed to only exist to prevent her from sating her overwhelming libido. Yet despite all that, he provided her with love and pleasure that she never even thought possible. She couldn't imagine going back to shoving helpless civilians into her pussy, not just because of her newfound respect for lives of others but because of how unsatisfying those sexual experiences were in hindsight. No, she had all the man she'd ever need with Pint Puncher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I think we'd better clean ourselves off and head to bed. It's been a long day\" Pint Puncher sighed as he began to pull away from his lover. He barely made it an inch before he was yanked back into her arms. She glared at him hungrily, a wide grin on her face as she wrapped her arms tightly around his neck. Despite being roughly equal in stature, he was startled at just how strong she was. It was no wonder why equally large villains didn't want to tangle with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think <i>you're</i> going? I didn't say we were done~\" she cooed before leaning in to lick his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you even have any energy left?\" Pint Puncher asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny didn't bother to answer his question as she pushed off of him and stood up to her full height with her hands on her hips. By the tinkle in her eye, Puncher could see that she already had something planned for him. He watched as she gracefully pirouetted and presented her backside to him. Pint Puncher's gaze turned to her flawless fur covered rear. Despite his prior incredulity, his length stood stiff in a matter of seconds as he watched her slowly bend over and sink to her knees. She glanced over her shoulder and smiled as she wiggled her ass at him enticingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. We gotta try this a least once\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher hesitated before sitting up and hunching over his lover. He was surprised that she would even think to let him take the lead again after he embarrassed himself the last time. Still, he was determined to show that he could be the dominant stud that she wanted him to be. He placed his hands on her hips and positioned himself with his tip nestled ever so slightly between her cheeks. Shenny shivered and bit down on her bottom lip in anticipation. Her enthusiasm gave the hero a much needed confidence boost and after prepping himself up mentally he proceeded onward, pushing his cock deeper between her cheeks until he could feel it brushing up against her anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was some cruel irony in what he was doing, as his only frame of reference to this type of sex involved him being on the receiving end. He shuddered to think about all the times his backdoor was stretched out by the likes of Rowland and Hank. He shook horrible thoughts out of his mind and enjoy being on top for a change. The aftermath of their last bout of lovemaking helped him along as his length slide in with relative ease, earning a gasp from his lover. Unbeknownst to him, Shenny was completely inexperienced in this particular type of intercourse. Even when using standing stones to get herself off, she never thought to use it anywhere other than her pussy. What she felt now was new and fascinating to her. Slight pain and mild discomfort, gradually shifting into pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Even with the absurd amount of lubrication, Puncher was caught off guard by how little give her pucker had. He barely managed to get less than half of his length before he began to encounter some resistance, as her spinchter squeezed and contracted against his length. Not one to turn down a challenge, the hero began to saw his length in and out of her ass, gradually easing more of his cock into her with each thrust. He listened with great interest as his motioned caused Shenny to whimper and moan, her fingers digging into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah... that's it...\" she murmured huskily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her enjoyment further spurred Pint Puncher to speed things up. The tightness that once acted as a hindrance for him had become euphoric, squeezing and messaging every inch of his length. He was already on the verge of climaxing, though he soldiered on, hoping to see how strong of a reaction he could get out Shenny. He gritted his teeth began to double his efforts, his hips slamming roughly into her as with each thrust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sudden aggressiveness came as a shock to Shenny, though she certainly wasn't complaining. The woman who once delighted in dominating others was reduced to a hot, panting mess beneath him, her eyes watering and her tongue hanging out as she was pounded into the ground. Her eyes shot open and she late out a hoarse cry as he completely slammed his hips onto her one last time, completely hilting himself inside her. That coupled with the torrent of hot seed shooting into her bowels was all she could take as she finally climaxed, her feminine fluids threatening to completely coat the ground beneath them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Their air became thick with the smell of sweat and sex as the two fell limp, their energy completely spent by that point. The intensity of her orgasm left Shenny teetering on the edge of conciousness as her eyes fluttered a few times. She had expected to enjoy this brief session of sexual exploration, but she hadn't expected to come away from it feeling changed. Her body felt heavy and for the first time she felt too tired to even think of going another round. A weak yet content smile cross her face as she gradually eased into slumber. Her dreams would take a different turn this time around. There was no longer a need for her to fantasize about this scernario playing out. Instead her dreams simply consisted of them sitting beside each other atop the highest structure in Glam City, holding hands and enjoying the sight of the sun rising over the place they swore to protect.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher looked over at his lover contently. He'd never seen her more happy and more tired. Admittedly he didn't have much to brag about, feeling a bit lightheaded from the intense action just a moment ago. After such a passionate night he wasn't surprised the both of them were drained. As the afterglow of their intense lovemaking faded the only thoughts left in their heads was sleep. The hero made himself comfortable on the soft surface of Shenny's bed. He wouldn't have her body to sleep on or in, but this wasn't too bad. The wolfess lay snugly against him, an arm thrown around his chest. He merrily reciprocated and slipped an arm around her body. The last thing either of them remember is hugging the other closely before they fall asleep intimately entwined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny's dream was vivid and colorful. She saw herself and her lover atop a tall skyscraper, gazing out over the town. From the distant streets she could hear a happy chorus of cheering citizens. \"She-nny, She-nny, She-nny\" They chanted. The wolfess looked to her boyfriend, sitting next to her. He was as tall as her, smiling lovingly and enjoying himself. He reached in and the two kissed long and passionately as the crowd lost their minds. The two fell back atop the skyscraper, which seemed entirely devoid of any structures they might smash. The cheering intensified as she climbed atop her boyfriend and pulled away those tight spandex pants. He was every bit as ready for this as her and his rod sprung up from its confines. Like a hungry beast Shenny's pussy bore down on the hero's manhood, swallowing it up in seconds. The cheers reached their peak as the whole city watched their two superheroes fuck atop the tallest building in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher's dreams showed him something different. At first he was disoriented, barely able to move a muscle. His body felt paralyzed until he realized he was pinned down. Tight fabric on one side and something soft and warm on the other. His immediate thoughts were overwhelmed by a rising heat in his pants. He looked down to see his boner at full mast. He looked at the soft surface. It felt somewhat familiar, a bit like Shenny's tits. He should know by now what those feel like, given the number of rides she's been giving him, but something's off. He couldn't quite put his finger on it until the clues hit him over the head with the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft fur caressing him was a different color from Shenny's usual wolfish hue. But far more importantly, if this was boobflesh pinning him, the fabric would be a bra. His girlfriend would never wear a bra. She was very much against hiding those beautiful mounds from anyone. With the realization that this wasn't his lover's enormous rack came the equally distressing notion that his dick only seemed to get harder. He tried to fight it, pushing against the fabric to distance himself from this vile temptation. With surprising ease he tore through, but when the Pint Puncher looked back he saw it was Tiffany's body he'd escaped from. Before he could reconcile the fact that he'd gotten every bit as hard from the massive mouse as he did his own girlfriend she faded into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large hand suddenly laid itself on the Pint Puncher's shoulder. He looked around to see Rowland, naked as the day he was born. The villain grew to his usual towering size and presented his throbbing cock. No effort was made to grab the superhero or force him to do anything. \"Go on, dive in. I know you want to.\" The cougar growled seductively. The hero was hovering in the air, but he couldn't control his flight. Instead he felt a strange pull from his groin. He looked down to see his manhood, still fully erect, pointing right at the monstrous member before him. He tried to fight it, but it seemed hopelessly drawn the the cougar's throbbing rod. The hero fought back as hard as he could, but his cock flew towards the awaiting slit, dragging him along. The moment it made contact Rowland's manhood opened up wide enough to swallow the hero whole. The disgusting embrace only lasted seconds before the cougar faded into nothingness just like Tiffany<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on it went, more and more obscure villains made their appearance. First Mare Storm, then Derek, then Helen and other villains he hadn't seen in weeks. Every time the Pint Puncher's manhood betrayed him and pulled him towards them, ending up inside every pussy, cock and asshole it could reach. The supervillains offered little more than gentle reassurances, but his mind screamed. This was wrong on every level. Had all the sex with Shenny really broken him? How would he be able to look at her anymore, knowing he'd fallen so low that even the foulest villains would get his dick hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero wiggled and squirmed in Shenny's embrace. Though still deep asleep, she responds by holding him even tighter, her warm groin pressing against his. His manhood was sandwiched between their bodies, hardening and throbbing erratically. Were the wolfess awake, she might well have gone down on the hero again, but her dreams were far too pleasant to interrupt. Finally his body seemed to stop shivering, a smile returning to his face. Deep down, the hero knew his nightmares could not prevail against the undying love of his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Shenny wakes up first, discovering a treat already waiting for her. The Pint Puncher gets up shortly thereafter to the soft, warm sensation of his girlfriend suckling on his member. He wants to chastise her, to blame her insatiable urges for his problems. But he knows she can't help it. He just jokingly berates her for starting whilst he was still sleeping and lets her finish. Both of them wash up rigorously in the spring, cleaning off the mess they made during last night's epic lovemaking. Lastly Shenny returns their sizes back to normal. Having used the bracelets a few times has given her some confidence in her abilities with them. She stores them in a cupboard for now, but she can't wait to use them again tonight. With her boyfriend back to his usual size she gladly dries him off inbetween her tits and carries him home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast the two of them sit around on her couch, thinking of what to do today. Does the Pint Puncher tell Shenny about his issues?</span></div></div>",

I've done my best to make this place as homey as possible, but there's only so much material you can get out of nature, you know?\" Shenny joked as she ran her hands along the makeshift couch beneath them. She looked over to her tiny boyfriend expecting him to give his two cents on the matter, but he didn't seem to be paying any attention to her. His gaze was focused ahead of him and she could tell by the look on his face that he had a lot on his mind at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A penny for your thoughts?\" she asked as she gently caressed the top of his head with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher blinked and looked up at his lover with a wide and disarming smile. The overwhelming shame he felt still hung over him and he wasn't certain how to approach the matter. He considered keeping his dream under wraps, but he knew that no good could come from trying to hide it. It was only a matter of time that she found out about his growing problem. Still, he couldn't bring himself to open up to her. Not just because of the overwhelming shame he felt, but because of how much emotional damage it'd bring to her. Her intimidating stature did little to mask her fragile heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I'm just thinking about what to tell Dr. Wong about our test run with the bracelets. It feels weird having give out details about our sex life in the name science\" he joked. His attempt at levity went on deaf ears as Shenny looked down at him with a concerned frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, is something the matter? You look like you're about to cry\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was then that the conflicted hero noticed the moisture gathering in his eyes. He tried to it away with his forearm, but it did nothing to stop the tears from coming. Her calling attention to his visible distress only served to eat away at him even more. The shame he felt turned into a deep self-loathing and it felt to him as though he had betrayed Shenny. She was the love of his life, the first and only woman he had ever been intimate with, and how did he repay her? By having lustful dreams of the villains that they were attempting to put away. He turned away from her, the tears beginning to stream down his face as his body shook slightly. He couldn't even bare to face her at that point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Shenny... I'm... so sorry...\" he choked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for what? Punchy, what's wrong?\" Shenny asked in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher bit down on his lip and after a moment of hesitation, he confessed. He told her all about his dreams in vivid detail. He went through the whole roster of villains that he dreamed off and how they casually urged him to debase himself over and over again. He admitted to being aroused throughout the whole ordeal despite his attempts to stop it. He even went so far as to talk about the blossoming attraction he felt towards Rowland when trapped in his speedo. By the end of his confession he was sobbing uncontrollably, his hands clasped onto the top of his head as he looked down at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to do this to you, Shenny...! I... I don't want to be this way...! It's so <i>wrong</i> but... I... I just couldn't help it! I don't know what's wrong with me!\" he wailed in despair. He half-expected her to grab him right then and there and swallow him whole. Whatever punishment she had in mind for him, it was entirely justified in his mind. He felt her powerful fingers wrap around his body, though the gentleness in which she grabbed him caught him by surprise. He was soon lifted up and pressed against her soft bosom, the top of his head getting petted by her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh... calm down, it's alright...\" she murmured softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher looked upward and saw his lover staring down at him with a soft, almost matronly smile on her face. If she was upset with him, it didn't show in the least. She patiently waited for him to calm down before gently sitting him down onto her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know why you're so shocked about this. Me and a whole lot of bad guys pretty much beat that desire into you. Think about it: before we even got together, how many times did a supervillain make you cum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher cringed at her question. It was fair to say that every villain he'd ever fought managed to elicit an orgasm from him at least once... that thought hadn't occurred to the hero. He was quick to assume that his growing hedonism was the product of their constant sex escapades, but that didn't explain why he seemed to have a specific attraction to his foes. That said, it did make some sort of sense that his body would start to pick up on this phenomenon. After all, his main frame of reference in regards to sex came from them... no pun intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Those thoughts were always in your head, Punchy. Being with me only brought them to the forefront\" she said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but... how are you not angry with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me wrong, I'm not happy about it... but I know that it doesn't matter. They might be able to get you hard, but I have ownership of the one part of you that makes all the difference\" she said before gently placing her index finger onto his chest. \"And mine belongs to you. If sex was all either of us wanted, I could've just ran off with that idiot Rowland and you could've given yourself to Tiffany. That hasn't happened because what we have is special... and no one, no matter how hard they try, can ever take it away from us...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher stared up at his girlfriend in absolute bewilderment. She spoke with such confidence and maturity that he could hardly believe that this was the same woman who tried to enslave him not long ago. Such inner growth in so little time... only true love could do that to a person. He smiled and rubbed her finger affectionately, his deep rooted shame quickly dissipating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" she continued as her expression turned lewd for a moment. \"We both know that none of them can make you cum as hard as <i>I</i> can\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher laughed and shook his head. That was the Shenny that he knew and loved... although she wasn't wrong in her boasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not wrong... but that doesn't really answer the problem though. What if we're out patrolling and my libido gets the better of me? What if one of the villains finds out about it and uses it against me?\" he said shuddering at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeeah... that could be a problem...\" Shenny drawled placing a hand on her chin. She thought it over for a minute before deciding...</span></div></div>",

If you really start losing it I've got the surefire way to bring you back to your senses.\" Shenny said with a mischievous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, does it involve cramming me into your pussy.\" The Pint Puncher rolled his eyes. His girlfriend nodded and gave him a sultry wink. As ridiculous as it sounded, it might just work too. If anything was going to pull his brain away from other villains it would be an involuntary bath in her musk. It did leave him with a different concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the I.S.E.A? should we tell them? They might be able to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think their first advice is going to be separating us. Besides, they're probably already aware too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" The hero was shocked. Was there anyone left that didn't know his secret yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I presume they observed you fighting, right? If so, they've seen all the times you've been abused by Glam City's gallery of villains. Hell, if we dig deep enough I bet you we could even find a tape of me giving you the business.\" The thought brought a smile to the hero's face. Not just of her referring to their past battles like one would a funny home video. But somewhere in the I.S.E.A. someone had to analyze all that stuff. Someone in there would have seen these villains' privates so often and with so much detail he could probably identify all of them just by a picture of their genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero regained a few scraps of his confidence. It was comforting to know their relationship was as solid as his super endurance. He cracked a broad smile and looked up to his lover. She'd given him an idea on how to pass the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, we don't need some crummy video, right? We can just re-enact it all right here.\" He stood up, facing the wolfess and puffing up his chest. \"Shenny! Justice has come for you! Surrender now and I'll make sure they go easy on you!\" Neither of them was able to keep a straight face and they burst out laughing. It seems almost crazy how just a few weeks prior he'd have said those words without a shred of sarcasm. The Pint Puncher wasn't done with his display yet. He flew up, soaring towards Shenny's face with an outstretched fist, moving at a snail's pace. She snorted with giggles before gently snatching him up in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... Some uppity hero in need of a lesson in humility? I'm sure I can oblige.\" The hero looked at her a bit bemused, but smiling from ear to ear. The wolfess realized her threats might have been a bit too coherent for her former self. She quickly corrected it and gave him a speech worthy of her villainous character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHENNY SMASH!\" She growled, waving the puny hero through the air like she was trying to swat a fly with him. She stood up and pretended to throw him down on the ground. Her arm moved in slow-motion and she gently released the hero, who immediately flew to the ground and pretended to slam into the dirt. \"BREAK PUNY PUNCHER!\" The wolfess roared, lifting a foot over the smiling superhero. The Pint Puncher rolled out from the impact zone and she brought her foot down hard. The hero wasn't even close to the impact, but he felt the reverberations in the ground beneath him. Even when playing around Shenny's size and strength found ways to surprise and awe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get to the good part.\" She said with a seductive tone before sitting down on the ground. A fuzzy hand took hold of the hero and brought him to her waiting pussy. As the hero had expected the large lower lips were engorged and glistening in anticipation. It was inevitable, but just as he was going to be plunged inside alarms sound. Shenny glares at her boyfriend with frustration. These fucking villains had a keen sense of timing, didn't they? No matter, she'd crush them into submission, hand them to the I.S.E.A. and continue this little game where she left of. She nestled the Pint Puncher between her tits and ran for the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher overlooked the city from his girlfriend's soft surroundings, quickly spotting the culprit. Felicia was wreaking havoc in one of the dense suburbs. She had inflated most of her body to stand twice as tall as the surrounding houses. Extra attention had gone to her butt, which was nearly comically large and currently resting atop several dozen struggling citizens. With each shuffle of that disproportionately huge ass she squashed her little prey just a bit flatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar worse was that the hero could see a completely different part of town getting terrorized by Quaker. The elephant had little mercy for those beneath her feet and gladly used her powers to remind any humans around her about that. It seemed only a matter of time to the Pint Puncher before the bulky elephant would hurt or kill someone with her antics. both these villains demand their attention. How do they tackle this problem?</span></div></div>",

Pint Puncher considered splitting up so they could deal with each villain individually, but Shenny would have none of it. They had a bad track record when it came to dealing with villains one on one and she wasn't about to risk him getting caught yet again. The two argued over it for a brief moment but Pint Puncher was quick to relent. He did however, propose a move that caught Shenny's interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds dangerous and entirely pointless\" she said as she peered down at the tiny man nestled within her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Ever since I became a superhero, I've always wanted to try it at least once! The only problem is I never had someone to be my pitcher\" Pint Puncher said with a sheepish smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what're you going to do if I end up chucking you into a brick wall or something? Seriously, just because you've seen it in a bunch of dumb comic books--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are <i>not</i> dumb!\" the hero snapped, his face turning red in a mixture of embarrassment and irritation. His indigence only got a bemused smirk out of Shenny. Her hair trigger temper had been significantly dulled since they'd been together, and it showed in how little it bothered her whenever he raised his voice at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just let me try this one time. If everything goes well, it'll be just another move added to our arsenal\" he prodded. He could see that he wasn't getting anywhere in prosauding her by the ambivalent frown on her face, but he wasn't the type to be deterred. \"If you let me try this, I'll do that thing you like when we get home\" he said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... that's a bit vague, isn't it? There's a whole list of things I like\" she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I'm talking about though\" Pint Puncher said as his smile widened. In truth, he didn't really have any specific games in mind for them. He was counting on her to fill in the blanks on her own and judging by the sparkle in her eye, it was clear that his gamble worked. She pulled him out of her cleavage and gave him a pat on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you got yourself a deal. You better be willing to pay up once we're done here\" she said before tightening her grip on his body and getting into position. Her face turned serious as she focused on the rampaging elephant in the distance. Her muscles tensed and she dug in her heels, and after taking in a deep breath, she reeled her arm back and hurled her boyfriend as hard as she could at Quaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Despite having shown a great deal of enthusiasm beforehand, he wasn't truly prepared for the sheer amount of power behind Shenny's throw. He moved through the air faster than he'd ever moved before, but it didn't take him long to adjust himself at focus on his target. As he rocketed towards Quaker, he straightened his body to increase his wind resistance and cocked his his back in preparation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The villainous anthro was so preoccupied with her prey that she didn't notice Pint Puncher zooming towards her until he was in earshot. Everything happened in a blur and she barely had a chance to prep herself for what was to come. An intense wave of pain shot through her chest and she was set flying. The impact of the blow sent shock waves that rattled every window in a four block radius and there was enough power behind it that Quaker blew through three buildings before the momentum eased enough for land with her back on the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Had it not been for her supernatural endurance, there was no doubt that such an intense attack would leave her severely injured. Her think hide showed no outward injury and she was certain that nothing was broken, but the pain in her chest and head left her feeling more than a little uneasy. Never before had she been hit that hard. Even in her most intense battles with Pint Puncher, the minuscule pest never struck her so hard that she couldn't move. More often than not, she'd get knocked out by a lucky shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Feeling dazed and confused Quaker stood to her feet and looked around for the source of the disturbance. She wasn't sure if she could even defeat such a powerful threat, but her pride wouldn't allow her to take this incident sitting down. It was then that she took notice to something...</span></div></div>",

She was still too disoriented from the massive hit to pinpoint its location, but something was definitely going on here. She was going to get to the bottom of this and crush whatever had dared to assault her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher was as confused as his victim. The last thing he saw as he rocketed towards the elephant at meteoric speeds was her heaving bosom. The weighty flesh surrounding him had to be those immense tits. For a moment he feared they had absorbed all the impact, but hearing the villain's muffled cursing told him enough. His plan had worked, but if he didn't act fast he was in for a world of trouble. Already he felt his manhood heat up at the mere thought of being enveloped by Quaker's tits. He struggled and shuffled between the swaying masses, praying to whoever would listen that the elephant was too knocked out to seize on this opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuaker looked around to see if there was anyone preparing another attack, but the itching feeling distracted her. She even missed the giant wolfess running to her in the distance. The elephant finally saw what was causing her so much trouble. Popping out from between her heaving tits was the Pint Puncher, quickly pulling himself free. The elephant saw red, knowing it was him that caused her such pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero had barely slipped out from between the heavy breasts when two large hands gripped him tightly. One wrapped around his torso, the other around his legs. Both squeezed his whole body hard, making him cry out in pain. His head was the only thing free to move and he looked behind him to see Quaker. He'd seen her glare angrily before when he sent her off to prison, but this was an all new level of fury. She was close to growling at him and the only question in her mind seemed to be whether she should crush the hero to paste or rip him in two. No, the elephant had other plans for him. With a deep, intimidating voice she asked the hero once simple question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell did you learn to punch that hard? That <i>hurt</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the Pint Puncher would love to give her an answer, mainly just telling her to get bent, his crushed lungs were empty. He gasped and gagged as best he could to illustrate his breathlessness, afraid of her retribution. But Quaker quickly made it clear she didn't care about his response. All that mattered now was to return her pain in kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should drop a whole mountain on you. Tie you to my feel and stomp around town all day. Maybe I should just cram you back in my tits since you like them so much. I'm sure they'd be happy to grind you into submission. But after what you did, I can think of only one place that can deliver punishment severe enough for the likes of you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe releases the Pint Puncher's legs and lifts him high before smashing her fist into the rubble. The hero was slammed repeatedly into the crumbling ruin of the building he'd punched the elephant through. Finally her other hand opened and the wracked body of the superhero flopped onto the ground like a ragdoll. Quaker took a deep breath and began to channel her earthen powers. A slab of rock behind the hero propped him up, but before he could make a move more rocks encased his body up to his neck. He became part of a small column of rock and rubble, his head forced to look up at his tormentor. The earthen grip on his body was tight, though it provided a welcome break from her vicious grip before. He felt his strength returning to him, but would it be quick enough for him to escape this rocky grasp before the elephant could shove him somewhere much worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her nemesis properly secured, the elephant let out a bellowing laugh. Her revenge would be oh so sweet. She was well versed in punishing puny humans with her hefty body. Already she could picture the hero squirming pathetically inside of her. But where to stick him? The earth shook a little with her every step as she walked over the column, lining herself up. What nightmarish prison looms over the hero's head?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Pint Puncher's head was in a slight daze from the beating he had endured, though he was quickly brought back to reality by a familiar stench wafting over his noise. He looked upward and taken aback by the sight of Quaker's dripping pussy hanging over his head. It wasn't like this was the first time Quaker had him in such a compromising position, but that was before he had been with Shenny. He felt his manhood stiffen, though he didn't feel too bad about it. He wasn't proud of finding her arousing, but his recent epiphany left him numb to the shame. If anything, he found his current predicament to be slightly amusing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once again he'd be coated in his foe's fluids before the day was over. He had no one to blame but himself. It was his idea to have Shenny throw him into the line of fire. The frequency in which he found himself in this position was starting to get to him though. He often had bad luck when on the job, but never with such consistency. Perhaps he'd been relying too much on his titanic lover to come and save him. He had been careless when charging into battle and the end result was always the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Quaker's fury was momentarily quailed for a moment as she looked down at the trapped hero in confusion. He expected him to be screaming and begging for forgiveness, but he didn't look the least bit intimidated. She knew nothing of the changes that he had gone through in the past few weeks, so his ability to stay calm in the face of peril struck her as odd. A sinister grin grew on her face as she knelt down slightly, her moist love tunnel mere inches from his face. The sudden heat surrounding his face forced his attention back to the present as he felt small droplets of warm slime hit his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're ready little man, because I don't plan on stopping til I'm satisfied. If you behave and play along, I just must let you live afterward\" she snickered as she dragged her wet snatch across his face. The bound hero coughed and sputtered, having the misfortune of having his mouth open when she did that, though he still maintained his his calm disposition despite it. He had been inside Shenny so often that he grew to enjoy the smell of feminine musk, although he was slightly turned off by the more earthy stench that emitted from her womanhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't think that's such a good idea\" he stammered as he spat out another mouthful of fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And why ever not?\" she asked coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're quite the lovely lady, Quaker. If you cleaned up your act, I'm sure there are plenty of guys who'd love to be with someone as voluptuous as yourself. But I'm afraid I have to decline. I'm already spoken for, you see. And my girlfriend isn't the the sharing type, if you know what I mean\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Quaker raised a brow at her trapped foe and for a moment she pulled away from him. There was quite a bit for her to unpack from what he had said. The first thing she took note of what his attempts at flattery. That wasn't something she had come to expect from the protector of Glam City, even in his most vulnerable of moments. What intrigued her the most about it was the earnestness of his tone; he was being entirely genuine in his praise. Of course, someone with her ego wouldn't be so easily placated by a few kind words, but the fact that they were coming out of the mouth of her greatest nemesis made it oddly endearing to her. She then considered the second thing said to her: the apparent news that the great Pint Puncher now had a girlfriend. That got a hardy belly laugh out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girlfriend? You? Please! Who'd want a scrawny little weakling like you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her taunting was short as a giant pawed foot came whizzing out of nowhere, collecting with her stomach and sending her flying yet again. Somehow, Quaker didn't see or hear the giant amazon running towards her until she was punted at full force. Shenny's sensitive ears had picked up on their conversation and she didn't take to kindly to Quaker taking down to her man. She looked down at her pint sized lover and frowned as noticed his slime covered face. She certainly wasn't going to put him into her mouth now, not until Quaker's scent was completely off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She ripped him free from his stone bonds and brought him up to crotch level. Wasting no time, she pushed her panties to the side and quickly shoved her lover inside of her. It took a fair amount of will power to pull him out afterward, as she was still pent up from earlier but she knew that there was still work to be done. Once he was out, she lifted him to her nose and gave him a quick sniff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Much better!\" she giggled before cleaning him off with her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure took your sweet time getting here\" Pint Puncher joked, wiping the spittle from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I just wanted to be able to say 'I told you so' after that stunt went wrong\" she said as she dropped him between her breasts to dry him off, his head poking out so they could still engage in banter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you talking about? Did you see how far she flew? That's the power of the Fastball Special, baby! I just need to work on my landing is all\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say\" she said rolling her eyes. \"Anyway. I think it's about time we get back to that matter at hand\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two looked over in the direction that Quaker flew. Shenny's kick had sent their hefty foe in an upward trajectory, leaving less of a mess for them to worry about as she came crashing down into an office building. Had it been anyone else, it would be easy to assume that it was the end for her, but Quaker wasn't the type to go down easy. Even after taking such a beating, there was a fair chance that she'd be able to put up a decent fight against the two. They could only hope that she was done and out so they could focus on the other threat currently terrorizing the city. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two superheroes approached the small hill of rubble that used to be the office building. Quaker's landing had completely destroyed it. Shenny was confident her overwhelming assault would be enough to deal with the elephant. Even after cleaning up the Pint Puncher there was still no movement from the ruined building, but that swiftly changed. With a loud rumble the rocks shifted and Quaker emerged clutching her head. The villain looked worn out, but determined. She stepped onto the street and pointed her trunk at Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing sticking up for this twerp?! He's a human! He should be grovelling in the dirt for your mercy! That's the only thing he's good for. It's the only thing any of these pathetic little worms are good for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the Pint Puncher nestled in her rack made the elephant retch with disgust. \"Seriously, you think he loves you? Here, lemme show you how easily a human can love you.\" She stomped the ground and a rumble echoed from down the street. A man was launched up by a pillar of rock, soaring towards Quaker. She caught him in her trunk and turned him to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love me, right?\" She asked intimidatingly, squeezing him slightly with her powerful trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... yes! Please don't hurt me...\" He whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny couldn't help but laugh at the elephant's pathetic display. The Pint Puncher didn't get much further than pitying her. Though he was mainly trying to waste time so his girlfriend could save him, he was genuinely open to the idea of Quaker finding real love. Seeing her threaten a man into loving her reminded him all too closely of his own lover. Not a month ago Shenny could've been in the exact same place as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Easy!\" The elephant huffed, mimicking Shenny by stuffing her 'lover' between her tits. \"And besides, what good is their worthless love when they make for such good playthings?\" She began to raise her hands, preparing to crush the trapped man with her heaving boobs. Immediately thoughts of pity were gone from the hero as he shot out from his comfortable perch, landing a swift blow to Quaker's head. The elephant did not expect such a lightning-fast reaction. Nor did she expect Shenny to follow up by grabbing her head. Her vision was filled with the wolfess' palm as she was pushed back, tripping and falling on her ass. She felt the hero quickly dart in and save the man from his impending doom. Blindly she commanded a handful of rubble to strike her attackers, but she just ended up hurling some bricks far away into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny didn't intend to give the elephant another chance and took her hand off Quaker's face, only to replace it with a fist. Several times she punched the elephant into the ruins. When the supervillain's consciousness seemed to only be holding on by a thread she stopped. The wolfess stood tall and proud over her defeated opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for trying to hurt innocent people.\" She raised her foot over Quaker's head, ready to stomp her lights out. \"This is for getting your stench on my boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! wait, please.\" The elephant coughed. Shenny's curiosity got the better of her, hovering her foot to the side so she could look her straight in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got me, you beat me fair 'n square. But please don't let them take me. I don't wanna be some guinea pig in a cage for those people.\" The elephant looked to be on the verge of sobbing. \"Tell ya what, if you let me go, I'll tunnel into the earth and you'll never see me again, I promise. I can't have any fun here with you two keeping an eye on things, so I'll just disappear. I'll go someplace that doesn't yet hate me. Who knows, maybe I can find something useful to do with my life there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny and the Pint Puncher look at eachother, unsure which of them is more confused. The hero knew the elephant was a villain, but he'd never once heard Quaker lie. She was always very upfront about the horrible things she was going to do to him. He looked up to his girlfriend, knowing none of what they had between them could've ever happened had he not given her a chance. Was this the time to give the elephant a chance?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Shenny kept her foot hovering over their beaten foe, though she didn't plan in finishing Quaker off until she got the greenlight from her partner. Pint Puncher thought it over for a minute before coming to a decision. He gestured for her to lower her foot as he walked over to the prone and helpless elephant. Quaker didn't know what to expect and given her less than pleasant history with the hero, she never could've predicted what he would say next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. You're free to go. But I don't suppose I could convince you to stick around, could I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Quaker stared down at him completely bewildered. Not only was he setting her free, but he was also asking her to stay? Just how hard did she hit him? She shakingly stood to her feet, her hand still clasping onto her aching stomach as she stared down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why... Why do you want me stay? So you can parade me around the city and brag about how you beat me? Is that it?!\" she snapped, the bitter sting of defeat still hanging over her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I just think it'd be a shame to never see you again is all\" he said with a sheepish smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-- are you mad?! I've stomped on you, sat on you, eaten you, and crushed you more times than I can count! I made you like the dirt from my heel! I literally made you kiss my ass! Why on earth would you be sad to see me go?! You should hate the very air I breathe! If the roles were reversed, I would've told Shenny to stomp you into oblivion before you could even get a single word out! How can you <i>not</i> despise me after everything I've done to you?!\" she screamed in irritation and incredulity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you want me to hate you?\" the hero calmly inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Quaker began to respond, but found she had no answer to his question. As much as she didn't want to admit it, the pint sized do-gooder raised a valid question. Why <i>did</i> she want to be hated? Come to think of it, why did she even list off all the wrongdoings she had committed against him? She had always thought that someone of her overwhelming power and stature was above such frivolous concepts like \"right\" and \"wrong\", yet she prove capable of recognizing that she had harmed Pint Puncher many times over and because of that, felt she didn't deserve forgiveness. Her train of thought was derailed as he piped up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want me to hate you, I'm afraid I just can't do that. I mean yeah, you beat me down pretty bad and whatnot but so did she\" he said pointing up at his gigantic lover. \"and now she's my girlfriend on top of being the best superheroine this city's ever seen. She chewed me up, stomped me flat and kidnapped me with the plan of turning me into a slave. Now she's the love of my life\" he said loving up at her with a smirk. He could see the beginnings of a blush beginning to form on Shenny's face as she twiddling her fingers bashfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Quaker could hardly believe what she was hearing. It seemed almost impossible to comprehend. When it came to brutally and cruelty, the Shenny was one of the very few villains that overshadowed her. The giant wolfess that stood before her wasn't the same single minded destroyer she remembered. She assumed that her change in behavior was due to some sort of foul play, either by Pint Puncher or that damned institute, but one thing just didn't add up in her mind: Shenny looked happy. More happy then Quaker had ever seen her before. How could she have changed so much on such little time? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quaker\" Pint Puncher began as he placed a hand on her leg. \"You can go if you'd like, but I'd much prefer if you stayed. I don't want to miss the day when you find that special someone like I did. I meant what I said before; someone as beautiful as you should be able to find someone easy\" he said flashing her a charming smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The villain's heart skipped a beat. Before she could write off his praise as a desperation tactic born from his compromising position. Now that he was free and had the upper hand, she could trust that his words were sincere. He called her beautiful... and she didn't even need to threaten him into saying it. Or course she didn't need to be reminded of her gorgeousness, but it certainly felt nice... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Quaker's blinked and looked away with a huff, trying in vain to hide her reddening face. That last she needed was for him to see that his pathetic attempts at flattery were actually working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks but no thanks. A queen needs no one else but her subjects!\" she before trouncing off. 'Not that I'll be able to have any with you two around' she thought bitterly. Just as she was about to tunnel away from this embarrassing scene, the hero called out to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to be clear. If we hear that you're causing trouble again, we'll be forced to send you off to the I.S.E.A! But if you ever just want to hang out or talk, you're more than welcome to come find us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Quaker bit down on her bottom lip as she felt conflicted. The thought of spending time with the two heroes as friends rather was... not <i>entirely</i> awful. But someone of her pride and power couldn't afford to waste her time mucking around with those lesser than her. Even if he did say some really nice things about her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. I'll keep that in mind\" she retorted coldly. And with that, she used her powers of earth manipulation to tunnel underground, finally seperating herself from the heroic pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The institute is gonna be real sore with us for letting her go, you know\" Shenny said with a tone that conveyed very little concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long as they get at least one test subject, I don't think they'll mind all that much. Speaking of which...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two turned their attention over to Felicia, still tormenting civilians off in the distance. Having wasted enough time speaking to Quaker, Shenny quickly scooped her boyfriend up and deposited him between her boobs before making a b-line towards the villainous vixen. </span></div></div>",

Over the last few weeks she'd gotten increasingly adept at getting around town without causing unnecesary damage. Before she got too close she slowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I've got a plan. This'll be amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boyfriend shared her mischievous smirk. \"What's the plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since not too many villains seem to know we're a thing yet, let's make it a surprise. I put you deep between my tits so she can't see you. We make small talk and then when she least expects it I pull 'em aside and you shoot out for a surprise attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you say my plans are weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny didn't dignify his doubts with a response, instead pushing him down. Her soft boobflesh completely enveloped him, hiding the superhero from the world. With a determined smile the wolfess approaches the evil vixen, ready to give her the surprise of a lifetime. She can already imagine Felicia's dumbstruck face when she reveals her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting comfortably in his musty hideout is the Pint Puncher. His lover was all around him, quite literally. The soft, malleable mass from her boobs held him firmly. He rested his head on her chest, listening to her heartbeat. Along with its steady rhythm he could hear the distant thumps of her every step, feeling his surroundings shift ever so slightly. This wasn't even the first set of breasts he was completely swallowed up by today. He'd already found himself wedged in Quaker's rack too. The superhero quietly wonders if he'll have visited Felicia's tits too by the end of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd have to be careful if that happened. The cruel fox could stretch and grow any part of her bigger than even Shenny could manage. Thankfully she didn't quite have the stretch to grow her whole body larger than the wolfess, but she had many tricks up her sleeve. From mile-long stretchy arms to even using her tongue as a wet tentacle to grab him and pull him into her maw. He'd been swallowed, sat on and stuffed up her oversized ass before. She even once crushed him flat as a sheet of paper between her super-sized boobs. He didn't much feel like repeating any of that today. Hopefully, with Shenny's help he wouldn't have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------------------------------------------------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia was having the best time with her little playthings. She had about thirty of them laid out in the street and was enthusiastically smothering them beneath her massive rear. The vixen had stretched her body to roughly half of Shenny's height, but her butt was almost comically oversized. The pathetic squirms of her victims was an experience she would never tire from. Feeling their struggles fade as they fell unconscious one by one. Glam City's never-ending supply of these little toys was everything the cruel fox could dream of. Her keen eye spotted another one hiding well out of arm's reach. Of course he didn't expect her arms to be able to reach him, but that made his horrified face all the funnier as she stretched an arm not just to grab him, but to coil around him like a snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, you wanna join your friends?\" The evil fox asked before completely ignoring any answer and leaning to one side. Beneath her buttcheek a dozen wailing and crying people were laid out. Before the man could even beg her to reconsider he was down on the harsh pavement, squirming against her overwhelming butt. With a quick shuffle and grind she felt more and more of her little victims go motionless. The cruel villain wondered if she should just grind them to paste or shove them up her butt for even more intimate playtime. Her thoughts were interrupted when a familiar face showed up. She cautiously raised her arm and waved to Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girlfriend, how're you doing? You seem... calm today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny giggled and got even closer to the fox. \"Yeah, I don't know why, but lately I've been feeling a lot more... in control if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a shame, you were always to much fun to watch as you tormented the humans. Angrily yelling at them and stuffing them in your pussy and whatnot. Speaking of which, nice bikini, really suits you. Didn't know they made them in your size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small blush the wolfess replied. \"They don't, but you'd be surprised what a tailor can do for you once you threaten to cram him and all his employees up your love tunnel.\" Both villains laughed at the mental image of Shenny ordering a custom bikini. The wolfess kept grinning even longer. This was going even better than she expected. The fox had no idea she was talking to a superhero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of cramming things in there, you wanna have some fun? I've been breaking in a couple dozen toys and I think they should be ready to do whatever we ask of them.\" Shenny feigned giddiness and asked to see them. The fox carefully stood up, feeling a bit unbalanced because of her expanded butt. She was beaming with pride. None of the humans dare to move in the face of the towering fox, but they could see the sly smile on the wolfess behind her. Felicia stepped back a little and turned to the wolfess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna sit on them for a while? It's okay if they all pop, there's plenty more around.\" All the humans looked up to the villains with a horrified expression. Shenny was easily twice as big as the fox. But with Felicia once again turning her back to the wolfess to admire her handiwork she gave Shenny all the time she needed for her surprise attack. But should she reveal the Pint Puncher straight away or keep him hidden just a little longer to use later?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Shenny managed to maintain her villainou facade quite well in spite of her growing irritation with Felicia and her lack of compassion towards the weak. Her lover's protective nature had gradually rubbed on her and she felt compelled to dish out some poetic justice towards the vile vixen. As looked down at the frightened citizens and flashed them her most menacing smile as she twirled around and presented her colossal rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready! Big bad Shenny's about to squash you flat~\" the wolfess sang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n What happened next came as a complete surprise to all observers. Shenny leisurely dropped back, letting gravity do all of the work as she fell ass first onto the ground. Such a sight would normally inspire fear in the helpless humans, though Shenny's aim was so far off that they could only look in tense confusion. Felicia was about to comment on their apparent lack of distress when she suddenly felt an enormous weight crash down on top of her. Even her impressive size was no match for Shenny's bulk as she was pinned beneath her giant rump. With her foe subdued, the heroine turned her attention back down to the humans. Her cruel visage melted away almost instantly as she smiled warmly at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys get to the nearest shelter. I've got this\" she said confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The humans didn't need any further coercing as they hustled away, the more noble among them stopping to collect the unfortune few who couldn't withstand the might of Felicia's oppressive backside. As they cleared the way, one teenager lagged behind, the same one that had tried in vain to keep out of the wicked vixen's line of sight. Something seemed to be eating awsy at him, preventing him from moving any further. He turned and looked up at Shenny, a light blush on his face as he beamed excitedly at their titanic savior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-kick her ass, Shenny! You're the coolest!\" he shouted before bolting off to join the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny blinked and a wave of giddiness washed over her. She had a fan! An actual fan! While she had recieved praise from curious spectators before, she was often so busy dispensing of criminals that their encouraging words flew over her head. It was nice to know that her efforts were appreciated. Her contentment was short lived however, as she felt a tingling beneath her. Using her shapeshifting abilities, the evil fox easily slipped out from underneath Shenny's rear before reforming several yards away from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. I can safely say I wasn't expecting that\" Felicia said with a slight smirk. \"Gotten into the hero business, have you? Never took you for the type\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither. Although I'd like to think I'm doing a pretty good job so far\" Shenny joked as she stood to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How unfortunate it is, that you would happen to bump into me so early on into your career. I'm sure you already know that I don't care for heroes, but the one thing I absolutely can't stand is a backstabber\" the vixen said as her smirk turned into a scowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Well why don't you come do something about it?\" Shenny taunted, cracking her knuckles before getting into a defensive posture. Felicia would prove a trickier opponent than her previous ones due to her unique ability, although she still had one ace in the hole should the vixen manage to gain the upper hand in their battle. Her thoughts went to the tiny hero nestled comfortably between her tits and she made a mental note to later apologize for the quaking that would ensue for him during the fight. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felicia inflated herself back to her previous size, saving a bit of her stretchy potential. The wolfess didn't wait for the fox to start throwing punches and unleashed a brutal haymaker. The large fist shot by just in front of the vixen's face. Her irate scowl only grew as she sidestepped more of Shenny's blows. Whenever she saw an opportunity she sent out a stretchy limb to knock the wolfess on the head, but it didn't seem to have much effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, you're a slippery one...\" Shenny huffed, her mighty swings wearing her down. Her nemesis just laughed, catapulting a fist right into the giant hero's face. The annoyed grimace on the wolf turned to a smile and she quickly took hold of the stretched limb. With a mighty yank she pulled the vixen off her feet and sent her flying towards an outstretched foot. The moment Felicia slammed into her foot the wolfess stomped it back down, stepping back to see a knackered vixen. But this fox was made of durable stuff and soon the foot-shaped crater in her chest re-inflated and she bounced back onto her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can keep going alllll day. At least I now see why the town seemed so quiet. How many of your former friends have you put behind bars, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends?\" Shenny repeated mockingly. \"All we ever did was beat eachother up. The only thing we didn't physically fight over was the Pint Puncher, and even then there was always an argument over who'd get to humiliate him first.\" She was about to boast about the superhero being her boyfriend, but that might ruin the surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, the humans want you for anything more than your ability to go hand to hand with us? Don't kid yourself, the I.S.E.A. will drop you like a bad habit the instant this town runs out of villains for you to step on. Speaking of which, allow me to return the favor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia let loose a mighty kick, inflating her foot mid-sweep to boot the wolfess in the midriff. Shenny gasped for a second, staggered by the impressive strength her smaller opponent managed to put behind that kick. The fox didn't let up for a second, pummeling the wolfess with a flurry of punches and kicks. Shenny kept up her guard, but she couldn't keep this up forever. The thought occurred that now might be the time to unleash her secret weapon. But the wolfess wanted to make her boyfriend proud. She would rough the vixen up and let him get the surprise knockout. Afterwards she could apologize for not letting him out earlier and keeping him put between her swaying boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero was kept firmly in place by the quaking flesh, listening closely to their words as well as the sounds of combat. His girlfriend was taking hits, but her heartbeat barely accelerated. Shenny was more than capable of shrugging off a beating, and by the sounds of it, Felicia's intense rain of blows had left the fox exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny quickly capitalized on her enemy's fatigue and grabbed the fox by the throat, lifting her off the ground. So many ideas bombarded the wolfess. This would definitely get her more fans. Especially the people that were tormented by Felicia. They got to see her sitting down on the fox up close. That must've been a real sight. Soon these people would adore her. Not out of fear for their lives, but genuinely. She could scarcely believe it, so absorbed in her fantasies that she didn't notice her enemy stretching out her neck until her body was right back down on the floor. A few angry jabs shook the wolfess out of it, causing her to release the fox in her confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough playing around, hero. It's time you learn why this town has so many supervillains. It's because no superhero is a match for our powers, not even a traitorous freak like you!\" Felicia spat with barely contained fury. She threw both her arms towards the wolfess' head but missed completely. Shenny was about to burst into giggles when she felt the vixen's plan take action. The arms had curled around and were now coiling themselves around her neck. The tight squeeze made the enormous wolf sputter with disbelief. She tried to rip the stretchy arms away, but they were strapped too tightly around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I squeeze your lights out, I'll stuff that hungry pussy of yours with all the innocent people I can find. I'm sure it must be hungry for some fresh meat after you went all noble. They won't last five minutes in those crushing depths. Then you can try and justify your casual mass murder to your fans. See how many of 'em will be cheering for you then.\" Felicia's every word was laced with venom. Maybe she was jealous that someone as impulsive and reckless as Shenny managed to become popular, even loved by these humans. Or maybe she just really hated humans. It didn't really matter anyway, the wolfess had more pressing matters to concern herself with<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with her mighty strength Shenny couldn't free herself from Felicia's grip. It felt like a giant elastic band was wrapped around her neck. She needed to think up a way out before she'd lose consciousness. No way was she letting Felicia use her like that. Her brain worked overtime trying to think up solutions Maybe it was the lack of oxygen, but each idea she had was crazier than the last.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shenny found herself fading fast. Every attempt at prying Felicia's rubbery grip from around her neck failed. It seemed hopeless. But she had to do something! She thought back to all of her battles against the Pint Puncher before switching sides and she remembered that every time, when things seemed over for him, he would find a way to pull victory from the jaws of defeat. Her only idea felt desperate, but maybe that was exactly what heroes did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe exaggerated the impact of Felicia's devastating hold and went limp within the fox's grasp. The wolf hoped that the vixen would sense victory and relax, giving the newest hero in town the window she needed to escape. But Felicia either wasn't fooled or was enjoying her victory too much to release her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all the fight you have in you Shenny?\" Felicia taunted, \"No wonder the Pint Puncher always finished you off so easily,\" the fox chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny felt her anger welling up within her, but she had to stick to her plan. She couldn't let Felicia out-fox her. Her patience and hope was running thin though, her act was growing very real as she started to feel herself blacking out in earnest. She slowly moved her hand to her chest, in a last act to reveal her secret weapon, when suddenly she heard a loud crack and felt her lungs will with air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf's eyes shot open. She saw Felicia moaning in a heap, surrounded by...rubble? Shenny's neck whipped around in a confused daze when she saw a massive boulder soar past her, breaking apart over Felicia's already injured body. Suddenly, rocks shot up from the ground and locked around the fox's wrists and ankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Q-Quaker?\" Shenny asked in bewilderment. Those powers could only be the actions of one creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous elephant revealed herself in her nude glory, towering over Felicia's defeated body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, it's me Shenny,\" Quaker said in an unusually shy, humble tone. \"I couldn't have some rubbery fox corrupting the city's newest hero could I? Especially after you and your pint sized hunk of a boyfriend were merciful enough to let me go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuaker paused, noticing that Felicia was starting to stir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, excuse me for a moment, it seems like our third wheel needs to be put away,\" she giggled, before dropping her bare ass squarely on Felicia's face, clamping her massive cheeks around her head. Shenny couldn't help but smile at the impact the elephant's ass made against the defenseless fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, don't get too used to this Shenny. You and Punchy are going to have to do this on your own after this. Let's just say this makes us even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf simply nodded and continued to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, it's like I said. What's a queen without at least one subject? As much as I hate to deprive the world of my au natural form, I do think that our elastic friend will make quite the worthy subject,\" Quaker chuckled, grinding her ass deeper into the dirt over Felicia's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, the rock confines turned to dust, and Quaker made quick word of taking advantage of Felicia's elastic abilities, fashioning her into a thong that left her face pulled deep within the elephant's round ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, the Pint Puncher had made his way clear of Shenny's cleavage, overhearing the conversation between the two former villains. He too had a satisfying laugh at the sight of Felicia's abilities turned against her. As Quaker turned to leave, he looked up at Shenny, the two heroes having the same thought on their mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould it really be heroic to leave Felicia like this? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Everything began to fade for Shenny as she dropped to a single knee, her hands still desperately tugging at the elastic vice cutting off her air supply.  Her thoughts went to the tiny hero safely tucked away in her cleavage, but her oxygen deprived brain had all but forgotten their plan. All she could do was bemoan her inability to subdue the villainous vixen. Her flawless track record had bolstered her confidence tremendously, so much so that she had begun to think that she was unbeatable. Needless to say, this fight was a brutal reality check for the proud wolfess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As things began to grow dark and her grip began to loosen, Shenny felt a wave of shame wash over her. She had Felicia dead to rights, but was too preoccupied with her self-indulgent fantasies to deal a decisive blow. She thought of those humans that she had aided and how she had given her word that she'd be able to defeat their tormentor. She had failed in serving as their protector, and if Felicia was true to her word, she would soon have a hand in their brutal demise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The once dominant heroine dropped down to both knees, her arms falling limp at her sides and her eyes becoming foggy. A single tear dropped from her eye as she lost consciousness, as her last thoughts were on her boyfriend. He had such high hopes for her superhero career and she blew it spectacularly. Only when Felicia's arms unfurled from around her neck was she finally about to croak out a sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Punchy... I'm... sorry...\" she whispered before dropping face first onto the concrete, the impact of her descent echoing throughout Glam City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy...? What, were you in league with him or something? Geez, you really have changed\" Felicia scoffed as she walked over to the beaten giant. She looked down at her with a satisfied grin as she placed her pawed foot onto Shenny's head. \"Looks like that do-gooder shtick didn't pan out so well for you, huh Shenny? It makes sense when you think about it. A great villain has no business playing hero. You were just out of your element is all. But don't worry, your deal old friend Felicia is going to make it all better~\" she giggled, grinding her foot on her unconscious foe's temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stuff your pussy full of those fans you love so much and once you're reminded of how wonderful it feels to play with humans rather than serve them, you'll come back around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, she took her foot off and looked around for any humans nearby that could aid her in \"re-educating\" Shenny. Unfortunate for her, Shenny's annoying little distraction managed to give them time to escape the immediate area. They were no doubt hiding away in one of the many emergency bunkers in the area. She let out an exaggerated sigh as she began the search for any stray humans still around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say I never go out of my way for you\" she called back at Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                       -----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher was clueless to the goings on outside of his fleshy hiding spot, but he knew something was amiss when the pressure increased twofold and Shenny's heartbeat hastened. His concern for her drove him onward as he wiggled and squirmed his way out of her cleavage. He escaped with relative ease, owing it to the many times where he'd have to worm his way out relieve himself in the middle of the night. As he wiped the sweat from his eyes, he turned back to properly survey the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was then that the hero discovered a new emotion that he'd never experienced before. The sight of his lover, beaten and unconscious with a single tear streaking down her face, filled with him with such anger and hatred that it looped back into a chilling calmness. His attention shifted to the horizon as he heard the sounds of thudding footsteps. Felicia was still out there, no doubt celebrating a job well done. The hero flew high into the air and spotted her almost instantly. He took in a deep breath and slowly flew over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                      -----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was a stupid idea. He <i>knew</i> it was a stupid idea, but there was no telling when another opportunity would present itself. Shenny's boisterous fan was the only human still walking the streets, a scrapbook clutched in his hands and a camera hanging from his neck. He had managed to slip away from the group as they fled in the direction of the shelter, his disappearance going unnoticed in the hysteria. He was putting himself in harms way, all for the sake of a photo and an autograph from his favorite superheroine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, look what we have here!\" a familiar voice chimed as shadow loomed overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The young man froze in his tracks and slowly turned around, his eyes growing wide. Felicia leered down at him as she leaned against house nearest to her. She looked none the worse for wear from her scuffle with Shenny, although that could easily be attributed to her unique shapeshifting abilities. She flashed him a brilliant smile, sending chills down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd have thought you'd have run off by now. Don't tell me you actually <i>wanted </i>to be pinned beneath my glorious butt?\" she giggled before turning around and wiggling her shapely rear end at him. \"I can hardly blame you. Most people would die just to get near--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to her?!\" the young man snapped, his hands tightening on his scrapbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Felicia raised a brow as she turned back to face him, her playful demeanor dropping for a moment as she glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left her in a broken heap. What, are you mad that I beat up your hero? Here's a newsflash kid, she's no more heroic than I am. She's just going through a bit of a phase is all. I would think that you of all people would understand that, considering how many people she's snuffed with that carnivorous pussy of hers\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wrong! That's not... Shenny's not like that! Not anymore! She's changed since the last time you've seen her!\" the young man shouted defiantly. The story of the once ruthless giantess redeeming herself and becoming a crime fighter was an inspiration to him and many others. After seeing her put away the worst of Glam City's villains, he refused to believe that her turn to heroism was anything but genuine. Felicia rolled her eyes at his impassioned words and quickly snatched him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you love Shenny that much, then boy are you gonna love where <i>you're</i> going\" she chuckled. She turned to make her way back over to Shenny when she was stopped in her tracks. Pint Puncher hovered several feet away from her, his hands to his sides as he simply stared at her. Felicia found his blank face rather off-putting, as he normally fluctuated from fierce determination to outright horror. She dismissed it as nothing as she flashed him a large grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough to show up, hero! I was beginning to think you were outsourcing the job to your enemies now! You know Shenny's walking around calling herself a superhero too now, right? I'm assuming you had something to do with that, but I can't for the life of me figure out how you did it. Not that it matters, seeing as how she's out for the count now. Really, you should've came to me with that job offer. I would've just laughed in your face before squashing you flat, but at least I'd be more of a useful partner than that meatheaded giant\" she chortled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher said nothing. There really wasn't anything <i>to </i>say. Felicia had outright admitted to hurting his girlfriend. Not only that, she was bragging about it. At that point, he had had enough. With blinding speed, he reeled his fist back and punched the cruel vixen square in the nose. So fierce was his punch that Felicia was sent flying back into one of the many abandoned homes. She was caught completely off guard, but even if she had time to prepare there was nothing that couldn't been done to prevent it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher's selfless nature still shined through as he caught the young man as he dropped from Felicia's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you...\" he stammered before trailing off. He looked up at his savior and shivered slightly. Pint Puncher had what could only be described as a thousand yard stare, his attention still on Felicia. He gently placed the young man onto the ground, gesturing for him to leave before marching over her with his fists clenched tight. The wide eyed fanboy simply nodded and scampered off, though he didn't get very far before his curiosity urged him to turn around and witness the battle that was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Felicia's hands were clutched onto her aching nose, her eyes watering slightly as she tried to collect herself. She'd been hit before, by Pint Puncher or other villains, but never before had something struck her with such overwhelm force. Her flexible body was capable of absorbing damage, but there was only so much it could do to protect her from harm. She looked back over to the tiny hero and shuddered as he approached her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n This wasn't the same Pint Puncher she fought before, not by a long shot. The very air around seemed to ripple from his overwhelming power, though it was hard to say whether or not she was just imagining it. One thing was very clear: Pint Puncher was out for blood.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cruel vixen was never one to back down from a challenge, and now would be no different. She'd beaten this brat into submission before and she saw no reason to stop doing so today. The superhero was going to need more than a little power boost to defeat this supervillain. Maybe she could even get his girlfriend to watch her as she finished him off. She even pondered cramming him into the wolfess' pussy, but if they were in a relationship he might just like it, the little pervert. Once thing was for sure, he'd not get another cheap shot in like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww... did I hurt your wittle feewings? Not my fault you've got no taste in women. Not a single human willing to put up with you, so you resort to the horniest villain in town?\" She kept taunting. Her face might've been punched, but her ego was stronger than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher shot towards the vixen, fist outstretched and his mind more focused that ever before. Felicia was going down. Slowly. Painfully. He flew faster than ever before without even noticing, his thoughts occupied entirely by the vixen's impending demise. The fox saw her opponent racing straight towards her. She threw up her arms to block the face. Furthermore she inflated her tits and gut to catch any impact there. He saw the upcoming wall and did nothing to stop or even slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a bullet the hero shot between the oversized tits of Felicia, their mass barely slowing his assault. He slipped right between them and landed a devastating blow to the vixen's chest. She gasped in pain, forced to take a few steps back just to deal with the immense force behind that punch. The hero shot back out from her rack, the same determination on his face. He had her reeling, now was the time to maintain his assault. He charged in an punched her in the face, catapulting himself past his nemesis afterwards, only to put a mighty punch right onto her spine. His hand stung from hitting the hard surface, but the fox's pained shriek made it all worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia tried to keep up her guard, but the hero was relentless. Every second another massive punch knocked her around. She'd throw out a fist, inflate it and land it square in the superhero's face but he just shrugged it off. In desperation she even tried growing her butt and capturing the hero mid-charge. He nearly flew straight up her butthole, adjusting only at the last moment to punch her right at the base of her tail. Her blows wore his spandex suit ragged, rips and tears covering the pristine white surface. She wasn't doing much better herself. Her stamina was wearing thin and maintaining her inflated size became harder and harder. Slowly she was shrinking back down, but the hero couldn't give less of a shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands were sore, covered in scratches. His arms felt like they were on fire. But nothing stopped the single-minded determination of the Pint Puncher. He would keep punching until it was done. With a chain of heavy blows to her head the hero finally knocked the vixen on her ass. Not even a moment's pause was granted before he hovered over her and dove down, fist first. Every loud thud echoed through the street as he darted into the fox. Her body merely shuddered under each merciless impact. Still she drew breath, and that simply wouldn't do for the superhero. He flew up once more, ready to put his all in one earthshattering punch when a large hand grabbed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny watched the spectacle unfold with a mix of awe and adoration. She'd never seen her boyfriend fight like this. His stoic determination was a sight to behold. She wished she could help him, but Felicia's brutal assault had left her in dire straits. She'd faded back into consciousness, but her every breath hurt and she was still seeing spots. All she could do was lie there and watch her boyfriend. Her fears that the vixen would overpower him too melted away, but she still didn't feel good about what was happening. The blank stare on the Pint Puncher's face was unsettling to say the least. She cheered softly when the vixen finally went down. But when the superhero wouldn't stop pummeling her body she knew this would end poorly if she didn't intervene. It took her great effort to crawl forward enough to reach them. She stretched out her arm and grabbed her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S... Stop...\" She sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero turned to see who had the nerve to grab him and looked at the begging eyes of Shenny. She felt mercy for this monster? Even after all she did to her? His thousand yard stare softened into a tiny smile, his girlfriend pulling him away from the fox and into her chest. Had she not interfered, he would've killed someone. Even villains as foul as Felicia deserved to be locked up. He burned brightly with shame, fidgeting nervously in her loving embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... okay... You d... did... good...\" the titanic wolfess brought him to her muzzle where she kissed and licked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Shenny's strength returned to her and with some help from her boyfriend she got back on her feet. Her legs were still a bit shaky, but she stood towering over the beaten fox. Felicia would be burned in her mind as a testament to never get cocky. It had been a few minutes and the vixen had shrunken down to almost her normal size. The Pint Puncher picked her up and began to carry her to the I.S.E.A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... let me 'carry' her.\" Shenny said with a mischievous smile. After everything she put the wolfess through, a little payback was due.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Pint Puncher chuckled and dropped Felicia back onto the ground. He stepped back and watched as his colossal lover reached down and picked the unconscious vixen up by the scruff of her neck. Feeling particularly vindictive, the wolfess decided to give her a taste of her own medicine as she opened up the back of her bikini and pushing Felicia's limp body deep between her massive buttcheeks before letting her bikini snap back into place. She looked back down at Pint Puncher with a toothy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think the institute will be upset if I bring her back smelling like my ass?\" she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The day they start paying us to do this is the day I start caring about what upsets them\" the hero said and seating himself comfortably atop her breasts. His adrenaline fueled onslaught had taken its toll on his body and he could feel a dull throbbing pain in his joints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what use would someone like me have for money?\" Shenny asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point\" Puncher said with a yawn. \"Still, it'd be nice if we got a bit of appreciation every once and a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny nodded, though after what she had been through, she wasn't sure if she truly agreed with that sentiment. The main reason why she lost was because of her nagging desire for approval. Had Pint Puncher not been there to take care of Felicia, there was a good chance that the villainous vixen would've snuffed out countless lives. Her skin crawled at the mental image of Felicia shoving helpless people into her pussy in the hopes of bringing her back to her evil, hedonistic ways. She quickly shook those thoughts away. She never wanted to be that way again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Excuse me! Miss Shenny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny broke away from her thoughts as her powerful ears picked up on a familiar voice. She looked down and was surprised to see the tiny fan that she had saved from Felicia. He stared up at her titanic form, his expression frozen in a state of awe and anxiousness as his hands were clutched tightly around a camera. She knelt down to get a better look at him, a friendly smile spreading onto her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you. Nice to see you managed to get away. What're you doing outside of the shelter though? You could've been caught in the cross fire!\" she scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just... I want... um... c-can I get... an autograph?\" he stammered as he reached into his pocket and pulled out a pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A warm tingly feeling washed over Shenny. She had dreamed of having hoards of admirers, but she wasn't actually prepared for the actually meeting one and thus was uncertain as to the dos and don'ts of superhero etiquette. She thought of asking Pint Puncher, but she didn't want to pester him while he was resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... it takes a lot for someone to change the way you did...\" the young man said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change? What's that supposed to mean?\" Shenny asked with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I didn't mean anything bad by it! It's just that... you used to be a bad guy and now you save people. The last time I saw you was on the blood moon. I saw you destroy nearly everything... but then you left... you came back a hero. That's just... amazing. So amazing\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny simply smiled in response. Her initial uncertainty melted away and was replaced by pure contentment as she reached down and delicately plucked the scrawny teen up, giving him a light kiss on the cheek before putting him back down. He had given her all the motivation she needed to continue on the path she had chosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I needed a pick-me-up today\" she said softly before she stood up and walked off in the direction of the institute, leaving her tiny fan completely starstruck and red faced. He had hoped to get a picture of the towering heroine to add to his scrapbook, but he was far from disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It took Shenny longer than usual to get to the institute, although there were a number of reasons as to why. The first was that she was trying to get her equilibrium back in check after being choked unconscious. The second was that she wanted to give Pint Puncher extra time to rest up before they went through their usual rigmarole with the staff. The third and most important reason was that to prolong Felicia's punishment as long as she could before turning her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The fox's malleable body was ground up into a paste like form between Shenny's boulder-like cheeks. By the time the trip was over, Shenny was certain that Felicia's fur would carry her scent for months. It didn't take long for the novelty to wear off and she made haste over to the facility, although not before letting loose a light fart to add insult to injury. As per usual, a group of staff members were stationed at the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Punchy... we're here\" she said as she gently nudged him with her finger. Pint Puncher groaned and opened his eyes, frowning at the very sight of the I.S.E.A building. He wasn't in the mood to deal with Dr. Wong or her crazy inventions, but he knew that she was expecting them. He reluctantly pulled himself free from Shenny's cleavage and lowered himself onto the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, come on. Give the people what they want\" he said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny nodded and hooked her fingers into the rim of her bikini bottom, flashing the staff members an apologetic smile as she lowered it and reached back to fish out Felicia. Once Shenny got a handle on her, she yanked the fox free and tossed her limp, sweat soaked body onto the ground with an wet splat. The staff were reluctant to collect Felicia in her present state as her damp body was ripe with a musky odor. After taking a minute to steel their stomachs, they hoisted her up and brought her into the facility, taking care to not track Shenny's residual ass sweat on their pristine white tiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, I'm pooped. Let's head on home and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy, come on. You know Dr. Wong wants to turn in our 'field report' on the bracelets\" Shenny said as she shrunk down to her minimum height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how comfortable I am with constantly divulging information about our sex life\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of it like this: if it weren't for the good doctor, you would've never experienced the joys of being a giant\" she countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you got me there\" the hero sighed as they stepped inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As always, the couple found the studious doctor stationed in her laboratory, although the sight that greeted them was far from what they would've expected. Wong stood by her disk, fiddling with a palm sized remote controller. Her guinea pig turned research assistant Tiffany had been stripped down to nothing but her underwear, although her bikini bottom was replaced by a glowing pink thong. Sweat poured from the mouse's body and her breathing was frantic as she groped and fondled her own breasts. She looked up at Wong with a heated, lustful smile but the doctor didn't even bat an eye to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-doctor... come on... let's cut the experiment short and go have some <i>real </i>fun~\" she panted as she pressed her heaving breasts together and batted her lashes in the hopes of enticing the stoic scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless your idea of fun involves more work and less talking, then I'm afraid I have to decline. Now hold still. I'm about to turn the juice up a bit\" Wong said as she turned the dial on her remote. The effects were immediate as Tiffany fell to the floor, moaning and squirming like an animal in heat. The doctor regarded the display with little more than raised brow. \"Hm. Better, but still not quite there...\" she muttered. \"Oh, and If you two could stop gawking for a minute, I'd like you enter the room and shut the door behind you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny and Pint Puncher cringed as they were addressed. They had been standing at the door for several minutes, watching the experiment in shared bewilderment. They were hesitant to step inside for fear of getting involved with whatever Wong was doing, but their curiosity compelled them to enter. At the very least they wanted an explanation as to what they had just bore witness to. The very moment they stepped foot into the room, Tiffany jumped to attention, her eyes lighting up at the sight of Pint Puncher. She quickly bolted over and gave him in a tight hug, one of her hands grasping onto the back of his head and pulling it down into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmpf! P-Punchy... I missed you sooooo much~\" she cooed as she shook the hero about like a ragdoll. Yet again the hero's body worked against his wishes as he felt a familiar warmth stirring within his loins. He couldn't help but take note to change in Tiffany's scent. Her fur carried the scent of lavender and strawberries whereas before it reeked of dirt and raw sewage. Whatever Dr. Wong did to eliminate the rancid odor, it was certainly effective. The plush, soft surface of her boobs along with with the intoxicating aroma made for a pleasant experience. Shenny however, did not share his enthusiasm as she pulled the two apart and yolked Tiffany by the fur on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really pushing your luck today, Tiff...\" she warned coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her threat went on deaf ears as the lustful mouse leaned in and groped Shenny's naked breasts. The wolfess was so surprised by her crass gesture that she released the rodent, although it was clear that Tiffany didn't intend to stop there. She stepped back in, her arms wrapping around Shenny's waist as tits were mashed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh... Shenny, I never noticed how <i>big</i> these were~\" she giggled;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny stared down the horny rodent, her eyes wide and her red with newfound embarrassment. While she couldn't describe what she was experiencing as unpleasant, she felt deeply uncomfortable with how things were going down. Her boyfriend didn't seem to keen on stopping it as he watched on with in curious awe, although she could hardly hold it against him. Two sexy half nake anthros pressed up against each other... how could he not be at least a little aroused? With that said, Shenny...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>whether it was Tiffany's new glowing undergarment brushing against her hips or the look of extreme embarrassment on her boyfriend she didn't know, but Shenny was losing the urge to fight off the mouse with every passing second. The more Dr. Wong's assistant rubbed herself against her body, the more she began to lean into the motions. The two giggled endlessly as their tits slid over, under and beside one another. Even more fun was feeling the mouse's slight gut bump into her own. Shenny might be the slimmer one of the two, but her strength let her stand toe to toe with the heavier mouse. The wolfess shot a glance around the room to gauge the reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Wong was unmoved by the sudden show, diligently making notes on the effects of her experiment. For a moment she was tempted to dial things up further, but that might just be excessive. Already she would consider her experiment a rousing success. Having a willing anthro animal around to help her around the lab had been the biggest boon to her science yet. The only thing better was the constant flow of new test subjects the superheroes brought in. Shenny was disappointed the doctor didn't seem to care much about her sexy display. Her boyfriend on the other hand was blushing bright red, trying and failing to hide his growing arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero couldn't believe his eyes. His girlfriend was putting on a show alongside one of her fiercest rivals. Tiffany wasn't exactly subtle in her continued desire for his love. But where he expected her to thrown the mouse through a wall she was now dancing sensually with her. Every time they moved in close he felt the heat in his crotch rise to new heights. His manhood was rising up, the spandex doing little to conceal his attraction to the sexy display before him. Both of them kept bombarding him with sultry glares. He feared that the moment they'd lay a finger on him he'd explode already. Anything but that, anywhere but here. What was compelling these two to do this? Tiffany's glowing bikini bottom sure seemed complicit in it all. Why the hell was Dr. Wong working on special underwear that makes things horny? Is it an unintended side effect or something else entirely? His questions were rudely interrupted when he saw the mouse staring at him over the top of his girlfriend's head. Wait, how was that possible? The two were even in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany was absorbed in her dance with Shenny. Their bodies felt as one and the ecstasy was palpable. She didn't care what or why, she just wanted to hold that sexy wolfess and rub her body against that soft fur. Only when Shenny's muzzle suddenly rested atop her rack did the mouse notice she'd grown. Shenny soon noticed too and tried to distance herself. Even Dr. Wong raised a curious brow. Tiffany's size-restraining collar was on, this shouldn't be happening. Wong furiously wrote down everything as she observed the mouse grow another foot taller. With panic in her voice Tiffany called out to the scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it down! Shut it down before I grow too big!\" This shook Dr. Wong into reality. Tiffany was going to smash right through the ceiling if she didn't do anything. Quickly she grabbed the remote and turned the dial back to zero. The bikini bottom stopped glowing and the mouse thankfully stopped growing. She stepped away from Shenny, now almost three feet taller than the wolfess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny felt deeply uncomfortable on many levels. What in the world convinced her to put on such a lewd display for her boyfriend in here of all places? And why was she suddenly so enamored by that weird mouse? But most of all the wolfess was deeply weirded out by not being the tallest one in the room. Even at her smallest she was used to looking down on just about everyone in the I.S.E.A. Now her gaze didn't reach about Tiffany's belly button. Seeing the amazonian mouse loom over her sent a weird chill down her spine. It wasn't often the wolfess was smaller than someone and she certainly didn't like it. Thankfully the bewildered stare on her boyfriend could always raise a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher had no idea what the hell was going on anymore. All he knew is that his spandex now had a conspicuous spot near his groin and he felt a dire need for a cold shower. Given the damage Felicia had done to his outfit he quickly excuses himself to get freshened up. Dr. Wong nods and sits down at her computer. She just gained a lot of information and it is critical she notes everything down as thoroughly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany sits down on a nearby crate, looking sheepishly at Shenny. Neither of them wants to be the first to break the silence. With the arousing effects of the bikini no longer active, both of them felt ashamed of their actions. How easily they still seemed to lose control with just a little bit of outside pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uhm... sorry?\" The mouse stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry too... I shouldn't have...\" Shenny replies, barely able to choke out the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just... well... I did mean it... You've got ehm... they're really nice...\" Tiffany said, making no effort to hide the fact she was staring directly at the wolfess' tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I guess? Yours aren't... bad either.\" She could barely believe her own words. Tiff used to be her sworn enemy, now they were complimenting eachother's tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Shenny continued. \"What's this all about? Why so horny? Isn't that <i>my</i> shtick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hehe. It's just a new contraption from the doctor. It's just a prototype though.\" The mouse said with a sly smile. The wolfess was well aware of the 'prototypes' the I.S.E.A. produced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I reckon I'll pass. Being excessively horny and huge is what got me into villainy, I don't think inducing more of that artificially is gonna produce anything positive. The last thing I want to do is disappoint the Pint Puncher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany nods wildly. With a cheeky smirk she continues. \"By the way, you two make a cute couple together. The way you carry him around... I feel a little jealous every time I watch you two on TV.\" Shenny smiles, knowing how much the mouse loved to cram innocent bystanders all over her tits. It all seemed so far away for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence fell over the pair once again. Shenny could tell that Tiffany still had something left to ask, but she didn't have the courage yet to do so. With a gentle nudge she tried to soothe the nervous mouse. Finally she looked the wolfess straight in the eye and asked her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind if I came to visit sometime? We could play with your boyfriend a bit and maybe... get to know eachother a little better?\" Shenny was taken aback by the strange request. At the very least the mouse conceded that the Pint Puncher was Shenny's boyfriend. And who knows... maybe having another giant to chat with wasn't all that bad. Now that she didn't smell like a sewer anymore the mouse seemed a lot more approachable. And with her desires to claim the Pint Puncher as her own diminished there were surprisingly few arguments against inviting her over. The wolfess found herself seriously considering Tiffany's request. She finally looked up to her, seeing the biggest puppy eyes the mouse could muster. Shenny rolls her eyes with a small, weary sigh.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Although Shenny had begun to warm up to the idea of inviting Tiffany over to their home, she wasn't sure if she could trust her own judgement in making such a decision. Ever since her turn to heroism, she had come to rely heavily on her boyfriend to be the voice of reason whenever she was uncertain what to do. She was fine with letting Tiffany visit, but first she would have to clear it up with Pint Puncher. She looked over to where he had been standing but was surprised to see that he wasn't there anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Wong, did you see where Punchy went?\" Shenny asked looking over at the busy scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He went to get changed out of that busted outfit of his\" the doctor said as she continued to jot down notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once again the room was filled with an uncomfortable silence as the two anthros waited for Pint Puncher to return. It didn't help things that the both of them were half naked, though it felt more awkward for Tiffany due to how much she'd gotten used to wearing clothes. Shenny certainly didn't mind her lack of clothing; in fact, she couldn't help but focus on her because of it. Now that the two of them were on approachable terms, it suddenly occurred to Shenny just how attractive her former rival was. While she didn't quite match up with the wolfess in regards to curvature and physique, she more than made up for it in her cute face and generous bosom. Shenny's attention seemed glued onto her hefty breasts specifically, a mixture of envy and admiration lingering in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did the bracelets work as intended?\" Tiffany asked curiously, completely oblivious to how the wolfess was leering at her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They worked out just fine\" Wong cut in, her eyes still glued to her computer screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how would you even know that? Did you put a hidden camera on them or something?\" Shenny asked accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I just have functioning ears\" The doctor responded flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It took Shenny a few seconds to catch the meaning behind her words, though once she did catch on she felt the heat rise in her face. She'd been so caught up in how much fun they were having with the bracelets that she didn't take into consideration the fact that two giants having sex would cause quite a bit of noise. She could only imagine how confused the citizens of Glam City were. Seeing the embarrassment on her face, Tiffany decided to change the subject .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I helped make those, you know. Miss Wong got a lot of mileage out of the experiments she did on me\" she said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear. Um... what... exactly was this particular experiment about?\" Shenny asked as she pointed down to Tiffany's glowing pink underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh. Well... Mr. Abbott wanted us to make something that can lower someone's sex drive. You know, just in case Puncher is going up against someone who knows how to... you know, push his buttons a certain way\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny's face soured slightly. As uncomfortable as she was with the thought of wearing a size regulating collar, she was even less comfortable with the idea of a device that could control one's libido at the flip of a switch. There was just something about that felt... <i>wrong</i> to her. Granted, she wasn't exactly the most impartial of minds as she spent most of her free time having sex. Tiffany took notice to the disdain on her face and quickly corrected herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, don't take it the wrong way! It's not like they're gonna force you to wear it or anything! They just want the option there in case you need it. Like the size regulating collar! You don't wear it, but we made you one anyway, ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's all the same to you, I think I'll pass on this one. Punchy may be a horndog, but he knows to keep it in his pants while on the job\" Shenny chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I just walk into?\" Pint Puncher's voice called with mild amusement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two anthros looked over to the door to see him entering the room. He had discarded his battle damaged suit and after being thoroughly decontaminated, was suited with a shiny new one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story short, they're working on something that'll make you less horny\" Shenny said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... something\" Pint Puncher said scratching his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, enough about that. I need to talk to you about something\" Shenny said as she walked over and pulled him out of earshot of the curious mouse. \"Listen. Tiff wants to come over and visit us every now and again. I don't have a problem with it, but I wanted to see if you'd be on board\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero raised a brow at her proposition. Given how infatuated Tiffany was with him, he expected his girlfriend to be apprehensive at the idea of her hanging out with the both of them at their home. Then again, it wasn't too much of a stretch for him to envision the two of them together on friendly terms. During their days of villainy, they'd occasionally work alongside each other and while they weren't necessarily friends the two of them bonded over how much they enjoyed tormenting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't have an issue with it, I don't see what the problem is\" he said with a shrug,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I just wanted to make sure you were fine with it\" Shenny said with a smile as she looked back over at the towering mouse with a grin. \"Alright. You can visit us\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany let out a delighted squeal as she jumped up and down in glee. Before the couple could say anything, they were hoisted up into a tight hug, their faces getting mashing beneath the mouse's heavy tits. They tried in vain to pull themselves free of her iron grip, Shenny feeling especially irritated given her distaste for larger people. Eventually they were released and fell to the ground gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankyouthankyou<b>THANKYOU</b>! We're gonna have so much fun together!\" she giggled excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast, Tits McGee\" Shenny said with a cough. \"You may be on the up and up nowadays but that doesn't mean that we're gonna let you do whatever you'd like in <i>our</i> home. You act up once and you're gone, you hear me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be on my best behavior! Scouts honor!\" Tiffany said placing a hand to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright we should get going then\" Pint Puncher said as he stood up and dusted himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, wait! I just need clear it up with the doctor\" Tiffany said before walking over to Wong. She still remained stationary at her computer, paying no mind to the distractions around her as she evaluated her notes. Tiffany knelt down, placing her hands on the doctor's shoulders as she peered over her shoulders with as cute a smile as she could possibly manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor~ would it be alright if I go out and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother finishing that sentence because the answer is 'no'. I've still got ten more experiments to run so I need you present and accounted for\" she said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come oooon, doc! I'm not the only size changer here! Why don't you just run some experiments on Rowland while I'm gone?\" Tiffany whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would but the higher-ups said that he needs a few more weeks of counseling and therapy before he's mentally sound enough for me to experiment on. I tried to push to have him to skip all that nonsense, but they gave me some garbage lecture about my 'lack of ethics'. Hmph...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Counselling? For what?\" Pint Puncher asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since you two brought him in, he's been having nightmares about Shenny coming to 'finish the job' or whatever. You should see how pale he gets when her face comes up on the news\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher felt a slight pang of guilt, although he could see that the sentiment was not shared by his partner as he looked over and saw a proud grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But back to the main point. I need you here, so the answer is no\" she repeated before turning away from Tiffany and looking back at her notes. For a moment it looked as though the matter were closed and Shenny could see the mouse's bottom lip shake as she fought off the urge to cry. Luckily, Pint Puncher knew the doctor's one weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two boxes of donuts and a bags of cookies\" the hero chimed in with a knowing smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor froze and slowly moved her hands away from the keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five boxes of donuts and ten bags of gummy bears\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven bags\" he answered back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Ten</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven bags and a chocolate bar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alright, she can go. Just make sure she doesn't break the collar. That comes out of my paycheck, you know\" the doctor said turning back to her monitor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany giggled and knelt down to give the doctor a hug from behind before turning her attention back to the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Just let me get changed and we can get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Pint Puncher said as a thought occurred to him. \"How are we going to do this? The people of Glam City are starting to get used to Shenny walking around, but they might not know what to make if it if they see you stomping along beside her\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany pouted and placed a hand on her chin. The pint sized hero had a point. As far as the citizens knew, she was stuck rotting away in a cell somewhere in the institute. They had no idea how much she'd changed since being brought in and the last thing she wanted was for Shenny's reputation to get dragged down because of her. Then again, the wolfess' work as a hero had planted a seed into the collective minds of the city-goers that transformed animals such as herself could redeem themselves if give the chance to. She smiled brightly and said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mouse looked at Shenny with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She hauls you around with ease, and I can be even smaller than him. Nobody will see me at all.\" The wolfess was a little flustered by the idea, but she liked the suggestion of the mouse being even smaller than her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is, once this collar starts playing nice again. Hold on, let me try something.\" Tiffany carefully removed the collar and focused her growing powers. She quickly sank back down to the same size as Shenny, the wolfess looking visibly relieved. But as a mouse anthro, Tiffany could take it up a notch. She kept dropping in size until she was only a foot tall. The last time the Pint Puncher had seen her at this stature she was being put in a cage and hauled off. He still remembers the almost rabidly possessive tone in which she proclaimed her undying love for him. She seemed almost unhinged at the time, obsessed by him. It amazed him he could have a casual conversation with her now. With a cute smile the little mouse looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, could one of you two giants carry me with you? I don't wanna get stepped on by someone here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth hero and wolfess look at eachother and burst into a fit of barely contained laughter. Hearing one of the biggest former villains in town refer to them as giants was just too much. The Pint Puncher excused himself, saying he had some bribes to collect real quick. With super speed he dashed out the nearest open window. Shenny extended a hand down to the mouse, still snickering. Tiffany quickly scurried up the wolfess' arm and perched herself on her shoulder. The mouse stared down at those freely swinging boobs and blushed a little. She looked up to Shenny's half-closed eyes. She'd been caught looking again, blushing even brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why Punchy likes to stay in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny politely smiled in return. \"Just so we're clear, this isn't going to happen every time you visit. We've gotta get the public a bit more used to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\" Squeaked the mouse. \"Last time they saw me I was causing untold destruction downtown and threatening to suffocate the Pint Puncher in my rack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the last time they saw me as a villain I was using my pussy as a car crusher and the Pint Puncher as a doormat. What I'm saying is that if they see you've changed, they'll come around. It'll take time, but I've been doing this hero stuff for about a month now and today I ran into a fan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?\" Tiffany stared at the wolfess incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. A fan. Of the giant wolf lady that terrorized so much of this town with her horny rampages. But also the giant that stomped out Mare Storm, Rowland and Derek to name a few.\" Shenny's face curled into a cheeky smile. \"The giant that stopped the evil Tiffany...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny.\" The little mouse huffed, looking away. \"So all I gotta do is get out there and flatten some villains?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's a little more to it than that. You gotta be really careful, especially the first time. Not much point in taking out a villain if you cause just as much damage yourself. You can usually tiptoe down the main streets to get around. And above all, it's not just some villains. I've taken out half a dozen and gotten a single fan. It'll take a <i>lot</i> of villains before people really start to support and maybe even forgive me. But as long as I have my boyfriend, I know it's a task worth undertaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany's \"aaaaaw\" was joined by a second voice. The Pint Puncher came back holding large boxes full of donuts, cookies and more. With a big smile he put them on Dr. Wong's desk. Wordlessly the scientist popped open a box and stuffed a cookie in her face, not even looking away from her computer. The three took it as their cue to leave and exited the building. Outside Shenny quickly rose up to her normal size. Tiffany's eyes nearly bulged out of her skull, seeing those tits swell up. The mouse was gently picked up by the Pint Puncher, who then nestled himself in his usual comfortable seat. Shenny smiled down at her boyfriend, but the happiest of the three couldn't even be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely encased by soft boobflesh and held against the hero's abs was Tifanny. The mouse couldn't believe what she was experiencing. The gentle waves of pressure from the jiggling masses around her was amazing. They were so unimaginably soft. She wanted to grow taller just to snuggle more of them, but she needed to stay hidden. The only surface around that wasn't as soft was the Pint Puncher. He held her close to his belly, making sure she wouldn't end up slipping into the near endless depths of Shenny's cleavage and fall out of the underside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her former nemesis as such a small speck between her boobs was immensely satisfying for Shenny too. She felt amazingly powerful. She could crush the mouse unconscious or worse just by squeezing her boobs together. But that wasn't who she was anymore. Now all she could think of was making the mouse explode with glee. The wolfess began to play with her tits as she entered the forest. The Pint Puncher looked up with a smile, knowing exactly what his giant girlfriend was up to. He felt the mouse in his hands squirm with delight as the walls surrounding her shifted and massaged her whole body. Finally the wolfess arrived at her home and set her guest on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny spoke with a serious tone, but failed completely to hide the giddiness in her voice. \"Okay, house rules for tonight. No playing with the Pint Puncher unless I'm involved too. Clothes are optional, don't worry about covering up. I mean, he does, but he's a little weird like that. Lastly, be whatever size you feel comfortable with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... as long as it ain't bigger than you, right?\" Tiffany interrupted with a cheeky smirk. She started growing, hopping off the table once she was big enough to do so without hurting herself. The bigger the mouse got, the more the Pint Puncher began to worry about tonight. Not because he expected the anthro mouse to do anything evil, but because he was now looking up to two giants wanting to play with him. Hopefully his super endurance was up to the task, because something told him he was going to need it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEqually undeniable was the rising heat in his pants. His girlfriend was looking sexy as ever. The giant mouse was alright, but that quickly changed when she took off her lab coat. Now that he wasn't trying to avoid being stomped or sat on by her, he had the time to look at her. She was a little pudgier than Shenny, but those tits looked almost as inviting. Her cute smile was infectious and with the sewer-like stench gone she looked strangely attractive, at least as far as giant mouse women go. His heart would always belong to Shenny, but he really hoped Tiffany would one day also find a boyfriend that could take care of her in all the ways she wanted and deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis enamored glance was interrupted by a heavy thump. The giant wolfess and mouse stood shoulder to shoulder, leaning on the table and looming over him with gleeful anticipation in their eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we play with him or... 'play' with him?\" Shenny said suggestively, making Tifanny smile broadly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pint Puncher swallowed nervously as he peered up at the two smiling giants looming over him. As nice as it felt to be the sole object of their affection, his past experience told him that nothing good could come from the two of them being together. They weren't the same city destroying monsters that he dealt with before, but that didn't guarantee his safety. Shenny had an entire month to learn how to properly control her strength when having fun with him, but could the same be said for Tiffany? The eager mouse noticed the growing concern on his face and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Part of the I.S.E.A's redemption program is learning how to handle those smaller than you\" she explained as she gently wrapped her fingers around his body and brought him up to her chest, her other hand lovingly caressing the top of his head. Pint Puncher was amazed at just how light and tender her touch was. Whenever he was in Shenny's grip, he was resting between the walls of a car compactor that had stopped halfway into crushing him. With Tiffany it felt as though he was sandwiched between to giant mattresses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I'd never do anything to hurt you...\" Tiffany said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sincerity of her words helped ease Puncher's concerns and he actually began to enjoy her affectionate gesture, though he began to worry that showing his contentment irk his girlfriend. She may have been the one to invite her, but that didn't necessarily mean that she would immediately approve of him being handled by another woman. He looked over at at her and to his surprise, she didn't seem all that bothered by it. If anything, she looked rather bored. A mischievous smile spread across her face as she slowly eased behind Tiffany and grabbed onto her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you so sure? Old habits die hard, you know...\" she snickered. Without warning, she suddenly pulled Tiffany's hand back, guiding it and her boyfriend over to Tiffany's colossal breasts. The mouse let out a startled yelp as she felt the tiny hero plunge deep into her cleavage, her face growing hot as he felt his body squirm against the soft yielding walls of boob flesh. She peered back at Shenny to reprimand her, but stopped once she saw the lecherous glint in the amazon's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Shenny... what're you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't pretend you've forgotten how good this feels~\" the wolfess cooed, her hands moving from Tiffany's arms to her heaving bosom. Tiffany's gasped and bit down on her bottom lip as Shenny squeezed and fondled her sensitive tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dontcha remember? How we used to be the big bad giants who'd beat up on poor defenseless Pint Puncher? Remember when we hand him laid out on the ground and we took turns sitting on him to see who's ass he'd stick to? Those were fun times, weren't they...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but... that was-- ah! T-that was when we were... bad guys... we can't-- mmph! We can't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hush. It's not like we're bullying some hapless citizen. We're just playing around with Punchy. Trust me, he <i>loves</i> this kinda stuff~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Tiffany felt something small poke the side of her boob. Pint Puncher's member had sprung to life almost immediately as the fleshy walls squeezed his much smaller body. He had already been in this position before, the memory of his accidental plunge into Tiffany's cleavage during their battle still lingering in his mind. He was actually able to enjoy himself now, as the horrid stench that once coated the mouse's body was replaced by a much more pleasant fragrance. It didn't take long for Tiffany to figure out what was jabbing against her boob and she couldn't help but smile at the effect her body was having on the tiny hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow... H-he really <i>does</i> enjoy it...\" she giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhm. Punchy loves to get played with big beautiful gals like us. Why else would he he constantly put himself in dangers way whenever we teamed up to cause trouble?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he's a superhero and we were supervillains?\" Tiffany posited in a confused tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to keep up, Tiff\" Shenny said rolling her eyes. She then plunged her hand into Tiffany's cleavage to retrieve her boyfriend. She pulled him out by the scruff of his neck and grinned in a manner that the hero had not seen since he'd last fought against her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The widdle hewo woves to get squished and bullied, doesn't he? Yes he does~\" she cooed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany was at a loss for words. How could she talk to her boyfriend in such a mean spirited way? Moreover, why wasn't he speaking up about it? She looked down at Pint Puncher as was surprised at the knowing grin on his face. It suddenly hit her: this was all just a game to them! Shenny was simply playing into her old self for a bit of good natured fun and it showed in the playful glint in her eye. Not wanting to feel left out, Tiffany tried to channel the old her as she leaned forward and smiled sinisterly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Punchy likes to get picked on by big strong women, does he? I always figured you for a perv, but I didn't know you were that pathetic\" she chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you expect? He's a slave to his dick! He wants stand up for himself but his libido won't let him!\" Shenny snickered as she placed her boyfriend flat on the plam of her hand. \"Watch. Punchy, if you don't strip out of that silly outfit right this instant, you won't ever get to sleep between my tits again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her words worked like magic as Pint Puncher hurriedly stripped out of his spandex suit, much to the amusement of two giants. Tiffany's eyes widened in glee as he soon stood naked before them, his man good standing in full salute in the face of all this taunting and belittlement. She knew that he had a bit of a submissive streak, but she never would've imagined that it extended this far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, look! His little pecker's all stiff!\" Shenny spoke condescendingly as she reached out and began to toy with his dick with her finger. It took an amazing amount of willpower for Pint Puncher to keep his knees from buckling at her touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a shame... we should should really do something about that~\" Tiffany giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny nodded and was about to make a suggestion when Tiffany suddenly reached down and plucked the hero from out her hand and held him up between the two of them. The two giants exchanged grins as they both seemed to have the exact same idea. She quickly released Pint Puncher, but before he could plummet to the ground, he was stopped as two giant pairs of breasts came crashing into him from both sides. Shenny and Tiffany hugged onto each other as they repeated their show from back in the institute, although it was made much better with Puncher playing an active participate <br>\r\nin their fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n For the Pint Puncher, it was heaven. Up and down his body went, massaged and squeezed at all sides by what felt like an avalanche of boob flesh. Occasionally he would bump into a protruding rough surface that he'd identify as a nipple and he'd given it a quick squeeze before he was jostled elsewhere by the constant movement. It was hard to even focus as his dick was dragged and squeezed, receiving what had to be the world's largest titfuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was not the only one enjoying himself as the two giants panted and moaned with each movement the made. They could feel the tiny hero desperately trying to service their tits even as he was being manhandled by them. His enthusiasm added to the overwhelming pleasure they got from dominating his diminutive form. Heat was building between them as they once again exchanged glances. There wad no need for words as they were about to communicate their desires with their eyes alone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher was in heaven, drowning in the endless ocean of softness between the tits of the playful giants. Only when they relented the overwhelming pressure for a moment could he hear them moan. He smiled, knowing Tiffany and Shenny were getting every bit as aroused as him. Now it was merely his personal challenge not to be the first to cum for a change. But the odds were stacked against him. When a passing wolf nipple started leaking some of her sweet milk into his mouth he knew there'd be no chance of keeping it in any longer. With a strained groan he feels his manhood spurt a tiny strand of cum onto the short fur. Almost immediately the two rubbed it into a large stain, smearing it on the Pint Puncher's legs. To his surprise the smothering and grinding never stopped. The pair seemed completely oblivious to his release. Was it that puny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few highly pleasurable minutes passed before the giants parted and Tiffany caught the superhero. He seemed entirely incapable of anything other than lying down and breathing deeply. Even twirling her huge finger around his manhood barely got a reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww... he's all tuckered out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already?\" Shenny asked, raising a bemused brow. \"Well, he better pick himself up, we're only just getting started. Why don't you put him on the couch, Tiff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that if he doesn't move, we can sit on him.\" Immediately Tiffany's smile grew ten times more mischievous. \"I've got an even better idea. Turn around.\" Shenny already knew precisely what the mouse was planning and happily turned her back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giants leaned down a little, putting their asses out and giggling loudly. The mouse grabs hold of one of the Pint Puncher's legs and dangles him between the two looming butts. With a nod they both bring their rear together, meeting in the middle and squashing the puny man trapped between them. The superhero's struggles were even more meaningless here, as the heavy duo leaned into eachother, pinning the hero between them. Even in this oppressive position they could feel his manhood throb. Heavy squeezing got interwoven with grinding their butts together for an even more unpleasant experience. The two giggled loudly, mocking the superhero's weak-willed indulgence. But they could hardly blame him. Standing before two towering beauties like them would make any man weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany reminisced of all the times she'd demolished the hero with her butt. How could he be so casual and friendly after all the horrible things she'd done to him? Countless accounts of her massive bottom squashing him flat, farting on him and wedging him deep between those buttcheeks. The many, many licks, kisses and other overwhelming acts of love, all whilst smelling like a burning sewer. All the things that made the little guy shiver and shake in disgust and/or pain. How long had he been looking for her to do so? How many times had he jerked off after a brutal stomping when she'd already left? Was he so aroused because she'd so often forced him to climax? Her mind reeled with questions and suggestions. For now she would just focus on the puny wiggles from the hero pinned between their butts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shen, wanna bet he sticks to my butt when we let him go?\" The mouse said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, you're on. He'll be plastered firmly to the butt of his girlfriend.\" Shenny boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Then I bet you that if he sticks to me I get to kiss him.\" Tiffany offered with a wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess paused for a moment. She didn't like her boyfriend kissing other women. no matter how well she was kicking it off with the giant anthro mouse, at the end of the day the Pint Puncher was <i>her</i> boyfriend. Begrudgingly she agreed, leaning onto him just a little harder to secure him. The superhero couldn't hear a word of it, trapped within the pulverizing confines between the two walls of buttflesh. He could feel himself slowly flatten out. Hopefully the giants would get bored of this soon, before they accidentally crush him unconscious. Thankfully the huge cheeks soon part. Through some miracle neither of them had started farting yet, but as the pressure relieved he fell down, quickly halting himself mid-air. He looked up to the wolfess and mouse and saw disappointment in their faces. What had happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, he didn't stick to either of us...\" Tiffany moped. She'd really hoped to secure a smooch with the pint-sized hero. But Shenny only saw opportunity. \"Well Tiff, you know what that means.\" The mouse raised a curious brow and the Pint Puncher gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means we gotta kiss eachother.\" Neither the giant anthro mouse nor the tiny hero had a clue what the wolfess was trying to get at. Shenny quickly answered their questions by grabbing the superhero and dangling him in front of her pursed lips. \"What're you waiting for?\" She asked Tiffany, who finally caught on. With a loud giggle she stepped close to the wolfess and put her arms around Shenny's waist. At first she was a little hesitant, but they had the perfect icebreaker hanging between them. The giant mouse gave the hero a little lick, the wolfess soon added her own streak of saliva to his body. Both murred in delight at the taste, perfectly seasoned by their own huge bodies. They opened wide and bathed the superhero in their warm breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher grew anxious seeing those huge maws approach. Shenny's rows of sharp teeth, Tiffany's dark gullet, ready for a meal. He knew this was just gonna be a French kiss for the ages, but he still wasn't entirely confident about being in their maws. He'd already been swallowed accidentally before, though Shenny wasn't entirely herself back then. He also found himself quietly surprised at how intimate the two giants were. It shouldn't be a complete surprise to him. Tifanny might well be one of the few villains big enough to play along with Shenny's ravenous lust. I mean there was Rowland, but he didn't quite seem to know what to do with women his own size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two drawn out moans the giants came together, sealing the hero in their interlocked maws. The hero was released and immediately fell onto a large tongue. It shot forward, meeting up with another tongue every bit as humongous. The two squishy muscles played with him relentlessly, squeezing him between their masses and swirling him around. Generous amounts of saliva lubricated his body, letting him slip and slide over the constantly moving surfaces. He couldn't tell up from down anymore, trapped in the wet cavern of their maws. The only sound available beyond the slimy squishing of his body being part of their kiss was loud moaning. The swirling tongues were in charge of his movement. Any escape attempt was swiftly subdued with more licks and squeezing. Worse yet, they bathed his cock in warm saliva and gentle licks. He had to hold out. If they tasted his cum on those sensitive tongues, who knows what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny and Tiffany looked at eachother amorously. They felt the little hero thrash about between their tongues and played with him mercilessly. Finding his tiny manhood to torment was a challenge. He was constantly being pushed around, never allowing them to home in on their target. But that was all part of the game. Whenever they got lucky and rubbed their tongues against his little superhero the giants took their sweet time, moaning as they felt his body shiver with pent up lust. Who would be the one to deliver the final blow? Finally they heard a tiny moan loud enough to escape their maws, followed soon after by a distinct taste. Neither giant relented for a second, determined to squeeze every last drop from their little mouth toy. Finally, after his special sauce had been tasted thoroughly they ended their three-way kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the giants parted, one of their tongues coiled around the hero's waist, dragging him along. Two lips soon pinched his torso, securing him and allowing his drool-soaked face a chance to see. Before him stood Tifanny, a strand of saliva still connecting her lips to Shenny's. His girlfriend held him firmly pinned between those soft lips, letting her own tongue venture between his legs. She wanted one last sample, but he'd been licked clean thoroughly. Not a taste was left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen perhaps it was time for him to sample some of their tastes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a struggle for Pint Puncher to properly collect himself after such an intense ordeal. Given his past experience dealing with the once villainous duo, he was confident in his ability to endure whatever games they thought up for him. That said, fighting two horny giants was a far different affair than being pleasured by them and while the latter was infinitely more enjoyable, it proved much more taxing on his stamina. Ten minutes in and he was already winded, yet they were just getting warmed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... that was... something...\" Tiffany giggled before licking the residual saliva from her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny didn't respond as the tip of her tongue continued to toy with her lover's spent length, the gears in her head turning as she did so. She had enjoyed that brief moment of intimacy more than she'e care to admit. In the back of her mind she still viewed Tiffany as the third wheel in their daily routine, but it was hard to deny that her presence added a new flavour to mix. Plus it was rather amusing to see her former rival so flustered and red faced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we better take a breather. Punchy looks like he's about to keal over\" Tiffany said as she stared at his limp body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny rolled her eyes and let out an exaggerated groan as she plucked her tiny lover from her lips before lowering him into her cleavage, his usual resting area. Hopefully he would gain enough energy to resume their fun unabated. With him safely tucked away, she turned her attention to Tiffany. With Pint Puncher temporarily indisposed, she had quickly shrunk back into a state of timid awkwardness as she looked around their home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. Um... This is a really nice place you've got\" she said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I did pretty good considering I had to make all the furniture by hand. You'd be amazed at how much time goes into building a giant sized chair out of stone\" Shenny said proudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, with all the work you two have done for the institute, you could probably get them to supe up this place a bit. Maybe install a bathroom, some lights--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahah-- I'll stop you right there. I might not be the most modestly dressed person in the world, but even I need my privacy. I don't need those people anywhere near my home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh. Well... I was just making a suggestion... didn't mean to impose...\" the mouse mouse murmured as she rubbed her arm bashfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny raised a brow at her sudden change in mood. She was so nebbish and awkward... nothing like the boisterous brute she used to be. No doubt the pressure of staying in their good graces was adding to her behavior and while Shenny appreciated her respectful demeanor, she didn't like it when people walked on eggshells around her. She sighed and placed her hand bashful mouse's shoulder, leading her over to the couch and sitting her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany, what's wrong? Talk to me\" she said as she sat down beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every time Punchy disappears and the two of us are alone together, you get all tense. I'd like to know why\" she said sternly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! I'm not... I didn't mean to give off that impression! I-It's just that, this is m-my first day off in weeks and I'm kinda tired after all those experiments, ya know? Miss Wong's a real taskmaster, let me tell ya!\" Tiffany said with a forced chuckle. Her laugh quickly faded as she saw the seriousness in Shenny's facial expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiff. I'm asking you to be honest with me. We're sort of coworkers, so I'd like for us to iron out any issues we might have with each other. Why are you always so nervous around me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany winced and looked away from Shenny and down at her fidgeting hands. It was impossible to deny, she was competely on edge. She sighed and closed her eyes, trying to find the right words to properly explain how she felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenny... you didn't really care all that much for me back when we were villains, did you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not really. But that didn't really have anything to do with you in particular. I hated EVERYONE\" Shenny snickered. \"Besides, that's just how most of us were. I hated you and you hated me, but we hated Pint Puncher just a little more. That kept us from being at each others throats\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't really see things that way...\" Tiffany murmured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you NOT? We argued and fought with each other all the time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't get along very well, but... of all the people I fought alongside with, you were the only one I thought of as a friend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her confession left the wolfess speechless. Tiffany could hardly blame her for being incredulous as she didn't exactly go out of her way to make her feelings known at the time. Silence hung in the air for a few minutes before Shenny spoke up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... if that's the case, why did you attack me? And why did you try to steal Punchy from me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your memory must be a little fuzzy because I recall you coming out of the blue and sucker punching me\" Tiffany said with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... right...\" Shenny muttered rubbing the back of her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for why I tried to seduce him... Honestly, I didn't even want him. I just needed to prove a point. To who, I'm not sure. I thought, 'there's no way that little pervert actually cares about her, not like <b>I</b> do'. I figured that if I could get him to give in to my feminine wiles, you'd see that he didn't really care about you... and then you'd start hanging out with me again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all in the past though. We've both changed from who we used to be, and I'm a lot more willing to make friends now that I have someone that cares for me. You and I have a clean slate and we can start building a <i>real</i> friendship now\" Shenny said brightly as she wrapped an arm around the timid mouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to be so nervous around me. We're cool now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know all that, Shenny... but... I dunno if I can really call myself your friend, because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She trailed off and looked down at wolfess' naked breasts, her thoughts on the pint sized hero nestled between them. Shenny didn't need an explanation to understand why she was staring at them, the pained expression on her face telling her all she needed to know. Shenny grinned and gave her a gentle squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you still jealous of my boyfriend? I mean yeah, he'll always be my number one but there's no reason you can't be my number two\" she chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not the one I'm jealous of...\" Tiffany muttered as she hung her head low, her face flushed in shame in embarressment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It took Shenny a moment to grasp the hidden meaning in her words, and soon her eyes widened slightly. It was the most obvious answer, yet she never even stopped to consider it. Her attraction to Pint Puncher went beyond just a simple crush. She really did love him as Shenny did. Still, one thing didn't quite add up to her: where did this intense infatuation come from? Tiffany seemed to have the same thought as she continued speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it was back during our battle, when he started messing with my nipple. I tried to use that to get into your head, but on the inside I was all flustered. I never thought I could get someone to do that without threatening to sit on them or something. Of course that was before he gave me the worst titty twister in the world, but that feeling still stuck with me. Then, after the fight was over and I was being locked up, I looked over at you two. You were crying. I'd never seen you cry before, not even once. And all it took to bring you out of it was hearing him say 'I love you'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought I just wanted to take him from you out of spite, to turn him into an obidient little sextoy like you planned to do, but that couldn't have been all I wanted. I'd fall asleep at night after a long day of testing and I'd dream about Punchy, but it was never anything dirty. In my dreams I imagined up looking at me the same way he looked at you and say those three words to me... 'I love you'. That made me wetter than any sex fantasy I could possibly think up\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n She paused as she looked up into the air, her lips curling into an amused half-smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He really is amazing. We spent so long fighting against him and now we're both trying to become better people because of him. I think that's what I love the most about him. Even after everything we've done, he could still the good in us that even we didn't initially see and he draws it out, bit by bit. It's like he was born to be a hero...\" she murmured. She turned her attention back to Shenny an was unsurprised to see the contemplative look on her face. Tiffany just smiled as she stood to her feet and brushed herself off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate you inviting me into your home, but it's probably best that I head  on out. As badly as I want us to be friends, I can't run the risk of hurting your relationship. I made you cry once before, and I'll never be able to live with myself if I did it again\" she said before she turned to leave. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hold up.\" Shenny said, putting her hand on Tiffany's shoulder. The mouse looked back and saw a brightly blushing wolfess, her eyes shifting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have oversimplified things when I said I hated everyone back in my villainous days. I mean, when you're driven into a horny frenzy by an ongoing burning desire in your loins it's hard to think straight. But whenever I had sated my hunger I would have a few minutes of clarity before the lust kicked back in.\" Tiffany cocked her head, curious what the other giant was getting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even back then, I felt a strange kinship with you in those moments. Maybe because you were among the few villains who could keep up with me and liked to play rough as much as I did. I mean, there was also Rowland...\" Tiffany finished Shenny's sentence for her. \"...but who likes him, right?\" The two exchange smiles, the giant anthro wolf pulling the mouse a little closer, back into her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm trying to get myself to say is that I like you, quite a lot even. So if it makes you the happiest little mouse in the world I might be able to stomach you having a thing for him. Don't get me wrong, he'll always be my boyfriend first and foremost. But if you want to play with him for a few minutes, just the two of you, I'll accept it. I know it's probably not what you were hoping for, but-\" Shenny was cut off by Tiffany throwing her arms around her. Not a coherent word came from the mouse's lips, but the wolfess smiled all the same. She patted the emotional giant on her back before breaking off the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one thing. I might be okay with this, but there's someone else you're going to have to convince. And I fear our little hug may have mashed him up a little.\" Tiffany burned brightly with embarrassment as the wolfess dug between her tits to find the superhero. Finally she retrieved him, pulling the Pint Puncher out by his leg and dangling him in front of the giant anthro mouse. He looked around skittishly, trying to figure out what was going on. His comfortable hideout had been shaken up by what felt like an earthquake and now he was plucked from the warm confines of his girlfriend's rack and into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Punchy... ehm... me and Shenny... ehm... had a talk and... well... she doesn't mind if we... ehm... played a little... together... like you two do. But she said that well... I should ask you... ehm... if you... well... want to play?\" The hero looked dumbfounded. Was this the same Tiffany for twenty minutes ago? The one who smiled broadly as Shenny showcased his perverted desire for punishment? What did he miss whilst he was nestled between the wolfess' tits? He twisted his head to look at his girlfriend, fearing this was some sort of trap. But the encouraging smile on Shenny's face was unmistakable. He had no idea what he was about to sign up for, but his curiosity drove him to look up to the giant mouse and nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany grabbed the hero with both hands, their gentle caress a blessing for the hero, who still felt a bit careworn after his last little adventure with the two giants. But this time Shenny stepped back and sat down on the couch. She kept a close eye on both of them. The giant mouse didn't care as she brought the superhero to her lips and planted a big smooch on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt awkward about the whole situation. He was Shenny's boyfriend, but now she begrudgingly agreed to let other giants kiss him? What was going on? Worst of all was that he was getting predictably hard. He didn't want to. Only the wolfess should be invoking these sorts of feelings in him. But he knew how much of a lost cause that was, and just how little she cared that he got turned on by every supervillain in sight. The giant mouse felt him fidgeting nervously and knew precisely what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over to Shenny and back to the squirming hero in her grasp. \"Oh my, you're getting all hard in my hands. What would your girlfriend think if she saw you like this? I mean, does she know how much you like it when I do <i>this</i>?\" Tiffany pressed her thumb down on the hero's crotch, gently pushing his manhood up against his abdomen. She slowly circled the soft digit atop his twitching member, rubbing him to near climax. But before he could finish she stopped, a wide smile growing on her face. \"She would punish you, but you like that, don't you?\" The hero squeaked and whimpered, yearning for the giant to finish what she started. But Tiffany only had eyes for Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be in so much trouble...\" She said, winking at the giant wolf woman sitting on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess cracked a huge toothy smile, seeing what her friend was trying to do. She'd been watching intently to make sure the mouse wouldn't do anything she didn't approve of. A bit of light fondling was no big deal, but the wolfess was amazed by how the mouse handled the hero. Her nimble fingers took hold of him like he was made of precious, delicate glass. Compared to her own brutish approach it seemed so unnecessarily refined. The Pint Puncher had super endurance, he didn't need to be coddled like this. Yet in spite of that Tiffany held him delicately, even as she teased him with her thumb. And now her game had reached the next stage.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Tiffany continued to fondle the helpless hero's privates, her smile growing as she relished in the control she had over him. Her gentle touch gave her an advantage the blunt and impatient wolfess, as she was able to meticulously bring Puncher to his limit with very little effort on her part. Her thumb traveled up and down his throbbing length, pausing only when she knew he was about to blow. With this method, it wasn't long before Pint Puncher was reduced to a desperate whimpering mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Shenny... make... make her stop...\" he whined as he looked over his shoulder at the amused face of his girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you expect me to do. I'm not the one with my hand on your junk right now\" she said with a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n A sudden pressure onto his cock forced a yelp out of Pint Puncher and brought his attention back to the giant holding him. She had sandwiched his manhood between her thumb and index finger and had given it a light squeeze. The overly playful mouse anthro grinned as precum began to trickle out of the tip and quickly went to work coaxing more and more of it out with each stroke. Even with her lubrication and an increased pace, she still managed to masterfully keep him from climaxing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking mighty pent up, Punchy. I'd love to help you out, but I don't want you to get into any more trouble with your girlfriend. She'd be reeeeal mad if she saw you cumming from another woman's touch~\" she teased.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n The hero looked over to his girlfriend and wasn't at all surprised by the sight of her wide, toothy grin. The two of them had engaged in a bit of roleplay in the past with her assuming her old villainous persona and dishing out punishment to his much smaller body, so she was more than happy play along with Tiffany's game. She leered down at him with the most convincing scowl that she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'd never even DREAM of letting another woman do that to him... especially in front of <i>me</i>. Isn't that right, Punchy?\" she said through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher swallowed nervously and nodded. Her act was a little too convincing for the hero, as he wasn't sure whether or not she'd actually follow up on her veiled threat. He shut his eyes tight and took in a deep breath to steel himself against Tiffany's relentless teasing. His determination was answered with an amused giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you sure are something. Most guys would've creamed themselves five seconds in\" she said as the tip of her finger pressed down onto his shaft. \"Not that it really matters. Even if you wanted to cum, I can make it so it never happens. In fact, I could probably keep this up for an hour without you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! Please! A-anything but...!\" the hero gasped, his eyes shooting open as he stared up at her. He was willing to hold out for a few more minutes but the thought of being edged for an entire hour was nothing short of nightmarish. His outburst came as no surprise to Tiffany as she looked down at him with a raised brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything but what?\" she asked with mock innocence as she continued to fiddle with his aching member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany, please... enough is enough...\" the hero whined as his eyes began to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you asking me to do?\" she asked as she raised a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... finish it...\" he muttered, feeling defeated. From the corner of his eye he could see Shenny leering at him with eager, hungry eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A giant, sexy mouse anthro is playing with your dick right now and yet you sound like you're about to get a flu shot. Could you try to sound a <i>little</i> bit more enthusiastic?\" Tiffany asked with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE JUST LET ME CUM!\" the hero pleaded desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany rolled her eyes and sighed. She had hoped to coax him into complimenting her appearance in front of Shenny, but all he could think about was getting his rocks off. Just as she was about to give him what he wanted, an idea sprung to mind. She smiled down at him as she reached down and lifted him up by his arm and brought him closer to her in such a way that he was hovering over her breasts. For a moment, his pained expression waned and as his attention was glued onto her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see?\" Tiffany asked coyly as she gave her shoulders a quick shake, her boobs quaking from the sudden movement. She giggled as his response came in the form of a slow nod as the hero was unable to take his eyes off of the entrancing display. \"Well, go on then. Twist one out while I'm feeling nice~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Much to her surprise, the hero offered no further protests as he began stroking his length vigorously. His intense need for release was what drove him to act, and the threat of dealing with Shenny's wrath had been pushed out of his mind for the time being. Tiffany was happy to egg him on as wrapped an arm around her stomach, mashing her tits together slightly. She didn't a chance to really put on a show for him as he quickly blew a massive load onto her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, so he DID have some left in him after all\" Shenny snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! Sometimes all it takes is a steady hand and lots of patience\" Tiffany stated proudly as she wiped the up the piddling amount of cum off of her breasts with her finger and lapping it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... now there's some food for thought...\" the wolfess muttered stroking her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher felt a chill run through him at those words. Shenny already held the dominant position when it came to their sexual escapades and the thought of her teasing him similarly to Tiffany wasn't the least bit appealing. He didn't have much time to let that idea resonate with him as he was quickly snatched up and brought to his girlfriend's giant face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's one thing to mess around with another woman behind my back, but you had the gall to mess around with my best friend... and you did it <i>right in front of me</i>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Shen!\" Tiffany chimed in, somehow managing to play the part of the wronged innocent effortlessly as she placed her hands on her cheeks. \"I didn't want to touch his dick but he kept begging me to do it! And when I finally mustered up the courage to stop, he started beating off while staring at my boobs! It was <i>horrible</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but that's not--\" Pint Puncher began before Shenny silenced him with a quick squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna hear any of your excuses, mister! You're officially in the doghouse, and you're gonna have to do a lot to get back into my good graces!\" she snarled. Seeing the growing anxiety on her lover's face, her volatile expression shifted to a playful smile. \"Relax, I won't go <i>too</i> crazy on you\" she whispered with a wink before swiftly getting back into character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now. What to do with you...?\" she muttered.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher was mostly certain his girlfriend was just playing around, but being held tightly in her grasp as she determined the best way to punish him was scary all the same. The wolfess' wrenching fingers were a big difference from Tiffany's subtle hold. Hopefully the next few minutes were enough recovery for him, because no matter what Shenny will think of, he's fairly certain it's going to be something he can only free himself from by cumming. Seeing the two lusty giants tower over him made it clear they both sought to use him in ways that would be exhausting at the very least. He knew it was going to be a long night the moment he agreed to let the giant mouse anthro come over, but it's slowly beginning to dawn on him that he wasn't prepared at all for what these two could get up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think I've got it...\" Shenny thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do tell, Shen! How are you going to punish that dirty little man for debasing himself in front of me? He just... he just grabbed his wang and... ew...\" Tiffany was taking her overacting to eleven, making it all too easy for Shenny to latch on. She spoke threateningly. \"Oh I know just what this little pervert needs. Let's go right back to basics and put him in the one place he loves most.\" She brought her free hand down and dragged a finger over her pussy, parting her lips and releasing a small dribble of arousal. The Pint Puncher audibly gulped at the sight of it. The two giants both snickered at his fearful act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany followed the hero closely as he was brought to his destination. The mouse had always been fascinated by Shenny's ability to pack her snatch with people. She saw what those unfortunate inserts did to the wolfess. Her face radiated pure bliss and her body was wracked with surges of pleasure. For years the mouse wondered what it could feel like, but whenever she tried to experiment things went wrong. Every time she tried to slip someone in, it took just a single fierce punch or kick for the sensitive walls to have the mouse doubling over in pain. Just seeing some of the more fighty victims of Shenny's snatch disappear into those slime-soaked depths was enough to make the mouse wince a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny looked down at the mouse, now sitting on her knees and shrinking down a bit to make sure the hero was at eye level. She'd seen her stare often enough when she was sating her hunger. She would give her friend a show she won't soon forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddayathink Tiff? Should we send him to the literal doghouse?\" The mouse didn't say anything, but nodded fiercely. The hero was held closer to the waiting lips, trying his best to maintain his calm. Something about the curious mouse's intense focus on him was off-putting. Moreso when he heard a distant wet squelch. It didn't take him long to realize the rhythm and soon his eyes wandered down. Tiffany had one hand firmly stuck to her crotch, busily massaging her own pussy. The hero didn't have time to cringe as all but two of Shenny's fingers unfurled and a wet, soft pair of fleshy walls pinched his feet. The warmth quickly traveled along his body as it was slipped into the wolfess' slickened vagina. Musky slime was smeared onto him by the quivering walls as they greedily accepted the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathlessly the mouse anthro watched as her friend pushed the little hero into herself. Once he'd been inserted just past his waist Shenny let go, leaving him hanging in her pussy's tight grip. \"Wave my big friend goodbye, puny man.\" Her overly dramatic tone made the hero smirk, holding out his arm and waving to the giant mouse. Tiffany sheepishly waved back, blushing as the wolfess' large pussy loudly slurped him in deeper. The superhero relaxed, letting his girlfriend do her thing and preparing himself for a comfortable stay. Like a ravenous maw the large pussy sucked in its prey and soon there wasn't a trace left of the hero bar a very aroused smile on his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany watched the whole spectacle unfold right before her eyes. She'd brought herself to climax and barely noticed, so completely focused on seeing that little hero vanish inside of her friend. When she looked back at her giant girlfriend, she couldn't think of anything better than a broad smile. Her mind was adrift in all manner of fantasies. She imagined what it must feel like. To exert such dominion over someone that even your most sensitive parts can be their prison. How good it must feel to experience him wiggling deep inside her own pleasure tunnel. Her thoughts even wandered to his perspective. What must it be like to be completely swallowed up by Shenny like that? Maybe if she shrank down and asked real nice... The mouse blushed, shaking off such crazy ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how we deal with creepy perverts in these parts!\" Shenny announced grandly, patting her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany raised an eyebrow for a second, forgetting about their little act and quickly stammered out a response. \"Y... Yes. That'll teach him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright there, Tiff?\" Shenny asked jokingly. Seeing the mouse stare at her pussy as it welcomed the Pint Puncher was amusing to no end for the wolfess. She could only imagine what might be going on in that weird little head of Tiffany. After a moment of silence the mouse speaks up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"C-Can you teach me to do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny stared down at her friend with a bemused smirk. At first she thought that Tiffany was just joking but she had a look of wide-eyed naivete that couldn't be anything but genuine. The wolfess found it rather hard to believe that she would lack experience in that particular area given her past, but upon further reflection she couldn't recall a time she had seen the once villainous mouse using humans to pleasure herself. She was far too busy squashing them flat beneath her giant rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I did was shove him in my pussy. It's not that complicated\" Shenny chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but... I dunno how to explain it... how do you get them to stop kicking and squirming?\" the mouse asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell would you want that?\" Shenny responded with an incredulous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it hurts like hell!\" Tiffany snapped defensively. In truth, she was a bit embarrassed of her inability to engage in such acts and she had always held a bit of jealousy towards Shenny for making it look so easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiff, relax. You're just a bit out of practice is all. Keep in mind, I've been shoving people inside me since forever and even <i>I</i> had a trouble dealing with it at first\" Shenny said as she walked over and rested her arm over the busty rodent's shoulder. \"But when you're constantly horny and desperate for something help take the edge off, you'd be surprised by how much pain you're willing to put up with\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany grimaced and slowly nodded her head. She wasn't burdened with an overactive libido so she couldn't really relate to Shenny's struggle. She could only imagine what it felt like to spend every waking moment constantly horny: her actions motivated by lust, her thoughts dominated by single-minded desire. Suddenly her friend's past actions didn't seem so amusing anymore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... when you put it like that, I guess it makes sense. You did it because you <i>had</i> to. I wanted to do it just <i>because</i>...\" she murmured, embarrassment hanging heavy in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get the wrong idea. I wouldn't do it if I didn't enjoy it\" Shenny said as she placed a hand on the mouse's inner thigh. She grinned as Tiffany's body tensed up, her legs instinctively closing around the playful wolfess' hand. She was far from prudish, but she was still a stranger to the concept of intimacy. Aside from her failed attempts at emulating Shenny's behavior, her only sexual experience came from whenever she was in the mood to pleasure herself, usually after a long day of tormenting humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't start getting squeamish on me now. We've gotta get you prepped up~\" Shenny whispered into Tiffany's large round ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Prepped? Like... like how?\" Tiffany stuttered, her heart beginning to race as a familiar warmth surged through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny just laughed and shook her head. Her nervous curiosity was nothing short of endearing. Still, the wolfess felt like things weren't going fast enough to her liking. The best way for Tiffany to learn would be throw her into the deep end of the pool and hope for the best. Without a word of warning, she moved her hand up towards Tiffany's groin shoved her index finger deep inside her snatch. The unsuspecting mouse let out a startled squeak as her body shivered at the new sensation. This was nothing like what she had experience before, as Shenny's finger was made much larger from their size difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She whimpered and fidgeted as the wolfess' digit rubbed along the her inner walls, pushing and stretching them with every movement it made. She wasn't sure how she was supposed to feel as she rode a wave of pain and pleasure with every motion Shenny's finger made. She wasn't accustomed to such a large insertion, nor what she accustomed to having something pushed in so far into her. Shenny could see the discomfort on her face and grinned as she placed a hand on one of her heaving breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax... you're in good hands...\" she cooed as she went to work massaging the yielding surface of Tiffany's tit. She watched with a pleased smirk as the bashful rodent squirmed and moaned in her grasp, her reservations gradually melting away with every knead and pinch. Shenny could feel her pussy squeezing around her finger, the heat beginning build as her inner walls grew more and more slick. The initial pain Tiffany felt had yet to subside, but she barely registered it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shen...\" she whined, her chest heaving as the sweat began to form on her brow. Shenny's teasing, while pleasurable, only served to ignite a fire in her loins that needed to be tended to properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhm. Sounds like you're nice and ready~\" Shenny chuckled before pulling her finger free from the mouse's dripping hot love tunnel. With nothing left to hold it all in, a small river of slime began to leak out and drip onto the floor, much to Tiffany's embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry!\" she gasped, her legs closing in a vain effort to stop herself from making a mess. She still remembered the warning that Shenny gave her, that if she in any way acted in a disrespectful or discourteous manner that she'd never be allowed to enter their home again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are just <i>adorable</i>\" Shenny chuckled as she gave her nervous guest a pat on the head. \"Now then... go lay on the couch so we can <i>really</i> get started~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany nodded and slowly shuffled her way over to couch, her step slightly stunted by the throbbing ache she felt down below. Shenny offered her a sympathetic smile, as she could relate to what she was feeling. She thought back to the early days of her life post transformation, her mind completely clouded by desire as she wandered the woods in search of anything that would help tame her insatiable sexual appetite. There were times where it got so bad that she could hardly walk and she'd uproot the nearest tree to plug her hungry snatch. Of course she would never wish such a curse onto anyone, let alone her closest friend, but easing Tiffany into that state of mind was part of the learning process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She watched as Tiffany laid back onto the couch with her legs spread wide open, her drooling pussy exposed and ready for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So... umm... what happens now...?\" she asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny smirked and...</span></div></div>",

Her hand was still wet with the mouse's love juices when the wolfess tended to her own nethers. A quick massage of the sensitive region and a whole lot of willpower were needed for her ravenous pussy to disgorge its prize. The Pint Puncher was utterly soaked in a thick coat of warm slime. He'd been enjoying his stay, the pleasant squeezing from Shenny's depths and the soothing tone of her distant heartbeat. He had expected to be put away in there for the entirety of the night as 'punishment' for his earlier actions. He wiped away the worst of the juices covering his face and looked up at his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you miss me?\" He asked, striking a pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already miss feeling you squirm, Punchy. But there's something I need your help with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany wants to learn to put people in her pussy too, so we need someone who isn't afraid to go in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher paused for a moment, a wave of concern washing over him. He didn't mind so much exploring the mouse's vast vagina, but he wondered if the two giants were overlooking something. Before his girlfriend could reach down and grab him he raised a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up. You do understand that I'm the only one you can do this to, right? Putting people in there, no matter how much they're willing volunteers, tends to kill them and if it weren't for my super endurance, it'd kill me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's just this once.\" Tiffany replied, her voice heavy with lust. The superhero had a bad feeling about this. The giant mouse wasn't bound by her urges like Shenny, but would she be able to stop herself from trying to repeat what she was about to do with him? Dealing with the wolfess' overwhelming desires was a big commitment already. Could he deal with two giants that wanted him as their sex toy? If his rock-hard boner could speak it would yell \"YES!\" all day long. Looking at the pair of puppy eyes begging him to nod he relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but you two listen closely. The only person that gets to be in there is me, are we clear? I don't want either of you trying to experiment with citizens. I don't care if they're willing fans, Shenny. You and I both know that most normal people that go in there don't come out.\" He pointed an accusing finger at his girlfriend's snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like any of them could satisfy me...\" Shenny sulked a little. As much as she didn't like her boyfriend's tone the wolfess had to concede that her pussy was still a dangerous place to be for regular people. After her little encounter with her fan today she quietly hoped she could show more people the intimate beauty of her body. A large hand patted her on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, maybe we should ask the doctor if she can fix that.\" Tiffany said with a goofy smile. Both of them giggled a little before Shenny finally picked up her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you greedy little man. Are you ready to help Tiffany overcome her fears of putting people in her pussy? Just try to be gentle.\" She dangled him over the mouse's leaking snatch, the large opening producing a steady river of slime in anticipation of its honored guest. Shenny's fingers unfurled until she only held him by his lower legs, steadily bring him closer. Like a diver about to hit the water the hero stuck out his arms, brushing them against the sensitive folds. Even this small initial contact drew a moan from the mouse. The wolfess rolled her eyes at how sensitive her friend was. Slowly she lowered the Pint Puncher down into the moist folds. His arms slid in without resistance, his head following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant mouse let out a loud moan as his shoulders began to enter her, stretching her love tunnel in all the right ways. She was still afraid it might hurt, but so far the superhero was going in nicely. She felt even the smallest movements he made. Every subtle wiggle and squirm sent a rush throughout her body. She wanted more. Her snatch began to pulse and squeeze around the hero, trying in vain to suck him in. When Shenny felt the gentle pulling she gave Tiffany a knowing smile. The mouse was as ravenous for the Pint Puncher as herself. Already she seemed cross-eyed with sheer delight, and she still had half a hero left to go in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his torso made its way into the mouse's love tunnel the superhero felt things speed up. On the inside the wet, squeezing walls felt oddly familiar. Though the inner walls bore down on him much like his girlfriend's would, the difference was noticeable. Shenny could give most car crushers a run for their money, but Tiffany felt more like an overly ambitious massage. It was uniquely relaxing for such a hot and humid environment. On the whole he still preferred the more spirited approach from his girlfriend, but this was pleasant all in its own ways. He returned the favor by wiggling calmly, sending shivers of joy throughout the mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He feels so nice in there...\" Tiffany said between moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? Best. Boyfriend. Ever.\" Shenny boasted in return. She'd already let go of his legs as the mouse's hungry pussy swallowed them up, sealing the hero inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't. Hold it in as long as you can. You're not gonna experience this very often, so you squeeze every drop out of that little man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't I hurt him like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me Tiff, if he can handle me at my neediest, your inner walls should be a walk in the park for him.\" Shenny's reassuring smile gave the giant rodent the confidence she needed to milk the superhero for as long as she could manage. Minutes ticked by and Tiffany felt the inevitable rush approaching. It edged closer and closer until she couldn't possibly hold it back another second. With a bellowing moan she reached an explosive climax. The giant twitched and writhed on the couch, her snatch sending waves of crippling pleasure throughout her whole body. Never before had she experienced anything like this. She felt the little man's every move as a tidal wave of thick slime pushed him back out again. Her pussy fought hard to keep hold of its prey, but the slippery hero was ejected amidst a torrent of pungent feminine juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany laid on the couch, completely exhausted and radiant with the afterglow of an orgasm she would never forget. To her side was Shenny, looking a bit smug that her help had delivered such a profound experience. The mouse had no words for what just happened, too worn out to say a thing. Steadily her heavy breathing paced itself again and she managed two words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank... you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny just gave her friend a big hug, quietly enjoying the moment. The Pint Puncher flew away from the two giants and wiped off most of Tiffany's release. Tonight had been quite the adventure for him. For the first time all night his dick was deflated, his own orgasm having been lost in the intense rush that was the mouse's climax. It was heartwarming to see the two giants cuddle, but he couldn't help but feel a little worried. Would Tiffany be able to resist the urge, now that she knew how good this felt. He'd put much on the line in trying to get these former villains on the right path. If she indulged herself and got someone hurt or worse, everything he built up would come crashing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose concerns were for another time as the pair of giants beckoned him closer, inviting him to join in their hug. With a bashful smile he nodded and flew between their vast boobs. As he was getting smothered in soft titflesh, the two giants had a brief talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should probably get moving.\" Tiffany said with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, it's late already. You can stay here for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't want to over-\" The mouse was interrupted by Shenny, who put a finger on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've invited you over and even let you use my boyfriend to pleasure yourself. You're staying and that's final.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany just blushed, happy to be close to her friend again. The two eventually decided that it was time for bed, but there were some issues that needed resolving. On the matter of where the giant mouse would sleep the opinions were unanimous. Shenny's bed was big enough for two giants. But what to do with the Pint Puncher?</span></div></div>",

Tiffany smiled sheepishly as she gently lowered herself onto the surprisingly soft surface of Shenny's makeshift bed, exhaustion finally setting in as she laid down beside her. The Pint Puncher followed suit, floating over to Shenny's breasts and slowly easing his body into her immense cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Watching him work himself between Shenny's breasts amused Tiffany, though she couldn't help but feel a slight ping of envy. Her infatuation with the hero was still ever present and while she intended to respect his relationship with Shenny, that didn't stop her from pining for him. The mind numbing sexual encounter only served to further fuel her love for him and she couldn't help but wonder what her life would be like if she had been the one he had fallen for. She sighed and brushed those fantasies aside as she laid her head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It was just a one time thing... get over it. </i>she thought to herself. <i>Thinking about that kind of stuff can only lead to trouble...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her thoughts were interrupted by pleasurable pinching sensation on one of her boobs. She looked down and went wide eyed as she found the Pint Puncher leisurely push against her breast with both hands in an attempt to part them slightly. As excited as she was to have him touching her tits again, she was rather confused as to what he was trying to do. He looked up at her with a smile and gave her chest a light nudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I'm used to just squeezing my way in. Would it be alright with you if I slept here?\" he asked pointing to the seemingly endless bottomless valley that was her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany stared blankly at him, unsure of what to say in response. While her heart soared at the thought of him sleeping between her tits like he did with Shenny, she couldn't help but feel that allowing him to do so would be overstepping their boundaries a bit. Shenny wasn't the least bit fettered with the thought of him being involved sexually with other anthros, but that type of intimacy was purely on the physical level. Resting in her afterward cleavage seemed a bit more...personal, at least that's how Tiffany saw it. The hero could see the conflicting emotions on her face and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the one day off you've gotten since we brought you to the institute and you've been nothing but respectful to us. Just for tonight, relax and enjoy yourself...\" he said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany could feel the butterflies in her stomach flutter from his reassuring words, but there was still a lingering thread of doubt in her mind. She looked up at Shenny, half-expecting her to be glaring angrily at the two of them, but instead found her friend staring at her with a playful half-smile. The wolfess knew that she had nothing to worry about, as she already had laid claim to the Pint Puncher's heart and she could trust in Tiffany not to take things <i>too</i> far with him. Looking between the couple's smiling faces, Tiffany couldn't help but shed tears of happiness. Despite everything she had done to them, despite all the physical pain she had brought to the Pint Puncher over the years and the emotional pain she caused to Shenny not too long ago, they were still going out of their way to make her feel as comfortable as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we gonna go to bed now or what--\" Shenny began before she was cut off by Tiffany's arm wrapping around her and pulling her into a tender embrace. She did the same to Pint Puncher, though his much smaller size resulted in him getting buried deep between her mountainous breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you both... so much...\" Tiffany whimpered softly, her head nestled gently against Shenny's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The wolfess chuckled as she returned her friend's affection, wrapping her around her with her hand gently rubbing the back of Tiffany's neck. It didn't take long for the both of them to drift asleep, their combined warmth helping them ease into a peaceful rest. It took a bit longer for the Pint Puncher to fall asleep, as he was trying to get accustomed to his new, softer environment. He eventually found a spot he was comfortable with and joined the two giants in their slumber, the beating of Tiffany's soothing him as the giant walls of pillow-like flesh molded seamlessly around his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher awoke to an earthquake, the soft walls of Tiffany's cleavage jiggling wildly. He worms his way out to discover the anthro mouse rushing onto her feet. The distant alarm catches his ears too. The city is under attack. Did her boobs really manage to muffle all that noise? The superhero wasn't sure if he should be worried or impressed. Shenny also got up, awoken by the alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonofa... That guy better be tough, because I'm going to rip him in half.\" She grumbled to herself. The superhero quickly flew up to inspect the source of the calamity. It didn't look too harrowing just yet. No billowing columns of smoke or signs of large-scale devastation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm... Pint Puncher?\" Tiffany called out to him, her voice still a little croaky from just waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you're naked, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero blushed a little, only now realizing he hadn't put his spandex back on after last night's wild adventures. His privates were swinging in the wind for all to see, but this was more important. As soon as he was finished he flew down again to join the two giants. Shenny handed him back his suit and with the hero back into his white spandex the three rushed to Glam City. Just outside town they stopped to see if they could determine who was causing such mayhem. Suddenly a loud fart thundered in the distance and a distinct shape flew through the air. It was the stocky frame of Rhanier, the gassy hyena. He was up to his old tricks again, using his super jump to hop around the city and letting out big farts to torment whoever was unlucky enough to be near the landing zone. The Pint Puncher knew he had to stop this foul beast fast. If he ran out of gas he would often cram a helpless civilian up his ass to recharge his batteries. The hero couldn't let that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll herd him towards you. You do your thing and we'll have this sorted in a flash.\" He said to Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I've got an idea. Tiff, you wait here. I'll help Punchy snatch that villain and then we smash him together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you sure?\" The mouse stuttered. She was expecting to get back to the institute, not help Shenny with her heroics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like old times. But now we crush supervillains for the good guys. Trust me, it'll be fun.\" The wolfess said with an infectious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... I'll wait here, go get em Shen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero flew off in hot pursuit of the smelly hyena whilst Shenny carefully tip-toed down the main street. She saw people panicking and pointing at the giant mouse, so she stopped for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be afraid, citizens, she's with me. She won't harm you.\" She said in her most heroic voice. It helped ease the tension somewhat, but she could tell there were still plenty of concerned faces. Worries for later as she picked up the pace once more and followed her boyfriend into the fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all his speed the hero raced towards the hyena. But he knew better than to just chase him. With those powerful jumps Rhanier could give the hero a run for his money and chasing something that smelly made even the Pint Puncher's stomach feel uneasy. Thankfully he'd have some help this time. He just had to keep the hyena distracted long enough for Shenny to strike. Once she got her hands on him, it'd be over. Seeing a park ahead of the soaring hyena the superhero quickly shot down there and awaited the smelly landing with a clenched fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhanier saw the unwelcome guest waiting for him and grunted loudly. Why did that damn Pint Puncher always have to ruin his fun? He pulled out all the stops and unleashed a nightmarish fart right as he came down in the park, shrouding the immediate area in a noxious green cloud. He jumped up as fast as he could, but something grabbed his leg on takeoff. Rhanier flew through the air with the Pint Puncher holding on to his leg, trying to steer him off course. The intense stench radiating of the villain's body made the hero's eyes water and Rhanier's incessant kicking made it hard to hold on. When the hyena released the last few farts he had in him the hero's grip loosened. But the supervillain wasn't done. He grabbed the flailing hero and pulled him into a tight hug, forcing the Pint Puncher's nose into his damp fur. The sweaty stench could strip paint and the hero was unable to recover as the hyena came crashing back down to Earth. He made no attempt to land on his feet, instead slamming into an alleyway with the hero to break his fall. He stood over his dazed victim and prepared another devastatingly smelly fart, but as much as he tried to force it, not a hint of gas came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, already? Well, plan B it is.\" Rhanier huffed as he sat himself down on top of the hero's face. Though the hyena was only a few feet taller than the average person his ass didn't seem to have gotten the memo. It's ability to swallow up things that shouldn't be able to fit inside the villain was infamous. And it was soon put to terrifying practice as he began to suck the squirming superhero in. The smelly pucker greedily engulfed as much of the hero as it could reach whilst powerful inner muscles drew in more. Rhanier panted loudly, enjoying the hero's failing struggles as he pulled him in ever further. He only paused when the alley suddenly got dark, the shadow of a looming hand making his eyes widen in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny reached down and grabbed the hyena. His reactions were too dulled by the hero still half dangling out his butt. The wolfess' tight grip was merciless, but her scowl wasn't just for the hyena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Not even a minute and you're already in trouble?\" She said, her grimace turning into a big smile as she pinched the hero's legs with her other hand and pulled him free. With an audible <i>pop</i> the hero was released from the hyena's smelly butt, still dazed but able to smile up to his girlfriend. His distraction had worked like a charm, even if he hadn't quite planned for it to get out of hand like this. The wolfess, never one to miss an opportunity, ordered the hero to recover in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you better believe you're cleaning those tonight, mister.\" She chided him with an insincere voice. He already looked forward to it, giving her a big smile and nodding eagerly. Shenny's attention turned to Tiffany, who was still at the edge of the city, looking awestruck. The wolfess carefully walked towards her friend, the smelly hyena in hand. She gave him a little squeeze now and again to stop him from trying to wriggle free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhanier's luck just couldn't seem to get worse. He was held up like a prize before the giant mouse. The two giggled loudly as they mocked his small form and the ease with which Shenny had captured him. He wanted to show them what for, but in the wolfess' tight grip there was little he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what shall we do with him?\" Shenny said with a sultry smile. The hero spoke up, suggesting they hand the beaten villain to the I.S.E.A. right away, but his girlfriend objected. \"If I hand him over now, he'll wreak havoc in there and escape. We need to beat him down a little first so he won't put up a fight. So you just sit back and let us deal with it.\" She playfully planted a finger on her boyfriend and shoved him deep between her tits. Now it was just Shenny, Tiffany and a supervillain in need of punishment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hows about we do the thing where we lay him on the ground and dance on top of his body?\" Tiffany suggested enthusiastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. All that stomping would shake things up here in the city no matter how far away we are. If you're gonna be on the side of good, you gotta be mindful of the citizens\" Shenny explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True... Ooh! We can have another makeout session with him in the middle~\" the mouse giggled as her face reddened at the memory of the night prior. Her friend didn't seem to share her enthusiasm as her nose curled in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna put this in your mouth?\" she asked pointing down at the fist which concealed Rhanier. Tiffany cringed at the thought of his musky, filthy fur touching her tongue. She hadn't thought that suggestion through all that well, but in truth she was mainly looking for an excuse to repeat that particular game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n While the two giants bandied ideas back and forth, Rhainer was trying to wrap his head around what was happening to him. He wasn't the sort who cared to look into current events, so Shenny and Tiffany's turn to heroism caught him completely off guard. Not that it really mattered to him what side they were on, as he was never all that concerned with the affairs of his fellow anthros unless it directly pertained to him. His anger stemmed not from their betrayal, but from their interference. After a bit of struggling, he managed to free his head from Shenny's grip, his teeth bared and his eyes brimming with anger as he glared up at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What's the big idea butting in on my fun!? I was about to put that little punk away for good and then you two bimbos show up and ruin everything!\" he growled furiously, his outburst immediately drawing the attention of his captors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stinking up the city and trying to shove my boyfriend up your fat ass are activities that you'd consider fun?\" Shenny asked narrowing her eyes as her grip tightened. Rhanier didn't quite pick up on the veiled threat in her question as he continued to snap at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya darn right it's fun! And what doya mean 'boyfriend'? You two datin' now? Quit messin' around with that bootlicker and find yourself a real man!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like you?\" Shenny asked with an amused smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, you wish! Like I'd want anything to do with a sex obsessed tramp like you! Nah, you need to deal with someone your own size, like Rowland--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The moment Rowland's name exited his mouth, Shenny's fist clenched down onto him fiercely, completely squeezing the air out of his lungs. Tiffany cringed slightly as she couldn't help but feel sorry for the villainous hyena. Calling Shenny names was one thing, but lumping her together with a meathead like Rowland was a mistake that he'd live on to regret for some time. Before she could commence to brutalizing him, Tiffany placed a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it alright with you if I take care of this one?\" she asked with a wide grin. She already had an idea of how she was going to dispense of him, though she was mostly concerned with making sure that her friend didn't do something that she'd later regret. Shenny raised a brow at her request but was happy to oblige her as she dropped him into him into her outstretch hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-dammit!\" Rhanier wheezed as he took in deep, greedy gulps of air. \"You coulda killed me, you crazy bit--\" his rant was cut off as Tiffany placed her thumb over his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's absolutely no way to speak to a woman\" she scolded in the most condescending tone she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss my ass, you fat bimbo!\" he snarled back at her as he managed to free his mouth for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany winced at his hurtful words as they hit home a little more than she'd like to admit. Falling in love with the Pint Puncher had the added effect of making her significantly more self-conscious about her body and she often wished that she could have a flawless physic like Shenny's. The hurt she felt was quickly replaced by anger as she wrapped her digits tightly around his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat, huh? You really think so?\" she asked before bringing him face to face with her colossal bikini clad rear. \"I like to think I do a pretty good job of keeping fit, but it's always good to get a second opinion\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Rhainer's eyes went wide as Tiffany slowly pulled her bikini bottom down to her knees, exposing her naked ass for all to see. Trash talk aside, the couldn't help but drool at the sight, his more lecherous side showing as he leered at it hungrily. Tiffany rolled her eyes at his perversion and without a word of warning, shoving him deep between her cheeks. For someone like Rhanier. this seemed like nothing as he enjoyed faint muskiness of his surroundings, but his enjoyment would gradually fade as he felt the soft, meaty walls tighten around him. Even someone as disgusting as him needed clean air and he found it becoming more and more scarce as his body was squeezed at all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, that takes care of that. Wanna head back to the institute now? Chances are Dr. Wong's come up with some gadget we can mess around with. If not, we can all sit together and watch old recordings of our fights with Punchy\" Tiffany said with a bright smile, returning to her normal chipper self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... fine I guess, but don't you think we should make absolute sure that he's out for the count?\" Shenny asked as she tilted her head to look down at Tiffany's butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I wasn't finished with him\" the mouse explained as she hooked her fingers onto the straps of her bikini. She took a deep breath and pulled upward, wedging bikini deep between her cheeks as though it were a thong. As she did this, she also clenched her cheeks with all the might she could muster. Shenny cringed as she watched on, as she could only imagine the amount of pressure being exerted onto the hyena's body. She vaguely recalled another time she'd seen Tiffany do such a thing and that was in a fight against the Pint Puncher, after which neither of them saw the hero for almost a week as he had to take time off to recuperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a minute of clenching, she eventually released her grip on the straps and unclinched her cheeks. There was no doubt in her mind that Rhanier was unconscious, his puny body plastered on one of the walls of her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. Now that little matter is taken care of, let's get back to the institute! It's still early and I still haven't had breakfast!\" she giggled as she began towards the facility, her stride having a bit more of a switch to it, her buttcheeks continuously grinding Rhanier's unconscious body. All Shenny could do was laugh as she followed from behind. Being woken up so early had put a bit of a damper on her mood but seeing a display like that was more than enough to pick her back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the two giants approached the institute, they could see several staff members waiting for them as per usual. One of them stood out from the bunch, as they recognized their face from a distance.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Tiffany winced as she spotted the good doctor standing among the retrieval team, her face deadpan as usual as waited for the group to arrive. No doubt she was in a sour mood due to the absence of her research assistant. Tiffany didn't want to be on her bad side, both because of her near limitless resources and because she was the final say on whether or not she was allowed to go out and hang out with her two friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should've bought some sweets while I was gone...\" Tiffany muttered under her breath as she reached into the back of her bikini bottom to retrieve Rhainer. It took a second for her to pull him free, as his limp body was practically plastered to her right cheek. Shenny watched with an amused smirk as he was slowly peeled free from her sweaty buttcrack before before being carefully lowered down into the extra large stretcher beneath them. As the retrieval team ushered the unconscious villain away, Tiffany quickly shrunk down to meet Dr. Wong eye to eye with a sheepish smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey doc! How's the research coming along?\" She asked nervously. She had expected to be reprimanded for wasting valuable testing time, but her question was answered with a nonchalant shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well enough, I guess. Did you have a good time?\" Dr. Wong inquired. Her voice carried its normal level of enthusiasm (or lack thereof), so it was difficult for Tiffany to gauge whether or not she was upset or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yeah, we had fun. Me and Shen played all sorts of games!\" the mouse said, her face getting hot at the memory of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice\" Wong said before she turned around and started toward the facility. \"Bring them into the lab in an hour. I still have a few finishing touches to make on my newest invention\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany nodded slowly as she was stuck for words at her boss' curious behavior. Normally when she asked any questions pertaining to the mouse's personal life, it was made clear that they were being asked for the purposes of research and study. The lack of any follow-up questions came as a surprise to her. She decided to just count her blessings as she looked up at Shenny and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doctor say she's got a new toy for you! It'll be done in an hour!\" She called up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny grinned excitedly at the prospect of having a new gadget to tinker with. Occasional shoddiness aside, the doctor's inventions never failed to bring a touch more excitement to her and Pint Puncher's sex life. She quickly reached down into her cleavage and yanked the hero free, placing him down onto the ground before shrinking down to her base height of eight feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just when I was starting to get comfortable...\" The Pint Puncher muttered as he stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about that. Wong is making something new for us to play with!\" Shenny said with a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher returned her grin, though his enthusiasm didn't quite match hers as part of him remained leery of the doctor and her inventions. The last time he was asked to test something out for her, he somehow ended up getting swallowed whole. His apprehension went unnoticed as he and Shenny were herded into the facility by Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Let's get something from the cafeteria and watch some old recordings of Punchy's fights!\" she giggled eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The couple snickered at her childish excitement, though neither of them could fault her for it. Given how most of her days were spent working, it made sense for her to want to extend their visit as long as possible. As trekked down the long winding halls, they were surprised by the overwhelming amount of personnel who called out to Tiffany. Most of them offered a friendly greeting to her, though she received more than a few catcalls from the men as she walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... you sure are popular around here...\" Shenny said quietly, her voice carrying a hint of jealousy in it. After all she had done for them, she had hoped to be greeted in a similar fashion whenever she came around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! Everyone here is super nice to me! Especially the guys!\" Tiffany chimed happily, not at all noticing her friend's annoyance. The Pint Puncher was quick to pick up on it though, as he nudged Shenny with an amused smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ' forget, you and I aren't around these people nearly as much as Tiff. It only makes sense for them to be more friendly with her than us\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny huffed and folded her arms with pout but opted to change the subject as they continued onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what kind of food do they have in a drab place like this?\" she asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than you'd think. Ever since Mr. Abbott started the redemption program, he's done everything he can to make sure all of our needs are met in the workplace\" Tiffany said with a bright smile. \"Of course, there are only two of us working in the facility at the moment, but Mr. Abbott thinks that we might be getting more anthros working here soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's he basing that on?\" Pint Puncher inquired with a raised brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? After you managed to get me and Shen to walk the straight and narrow path, how can he not think that?\" Tiffany giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher laughed with her, although her words deeply resonated with him. In such a short amount of time he got two of the city's most dangerous villains to turn over a new leaf. Not only that but he managed to convince the infamouQuaker to seek out a peaceful life elsewhere. He couldn't help but wonder how many other anthros out there just needed to someone in their life patient and willing enough to lead them down a more noble path. He kept such thoughts to himself as the three of them approached the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See right there? He's totally pitching a tent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, just from getting stepped on? Damn Punchy, you were a horndog even back then, weren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher said nothing as he sat between to his two giggling lovers, his face bright red in a mixture of embarrassment and arousal as they watched the screen in front of them. The institute was more than happy to let give them access to the video archive, mainly in part to their high rankings as employees. When Tiffany suggested that they watch his previous battles, he had assumed that she wanted to admire his past exploits but most of the footage they had on hand consisted of him getting beaten and humiliated by his foes. While he wasn't at all ashamed of his past blunders, the amount of times the two took notice to his apparent arousal on screen was genuinely disconcerting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He initially believed that his  not-so-closeted desire to be dominated was the result of being at the wrong end of a beating one to many times at the hands of lecherous supervillains, but the footage all but proved that he had such desires for years. He grimaced as he watched his past self get trampled on by Quaker, his limp body stuck to her foot as she marched down the street. Even without the camera focusing on it he could clearly see the stark erection his past self had, made worse by the raging hard on that he had from watching the footage in the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we shooed Quaker away a bit too soon, Punchy~\" Shenny teased as she playfully placed a large finger on the tip of her boyfriend's spandex covered dick. \"I'm not too fond on constantly sharing you with other women, but if you wanted I would've let her step on you a few times\" she snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times did she make you cum from that, Punchy?\" Tiffany asked with wide-eyed curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I counted three times in the last seven minutes\" Shenny said with a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I ever make you cum from stepping on you?\" Tiffany asked as she leaned in, her innocent tone becoming heated as she leered at him hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we can find one or two videos of that. What do you think, Punchy?\" Shenny asked as she leaned in as well, her expression becoming lustful as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sheepish hero couldn't think of a way to respond that would help maintain his dignity, but fortune quickly shined on him as a knock came on the door and a scrawny intern poked his head into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys? Miss Wong called. She says she's done putting things together\" he said before swiftly disappearing and shutting the door behind him. The Pint Puncher pulled himself away from the two and stood to his feet, his face remaining stoic as he let out an inward sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we should get going. Don't wanna keep the lady waiting, huh?\" he said with as much enthusiasm as he could muster as he walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I'll forget about this...\" Shenny muttered as she and Tiffany went over to join him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to stress. We can always give you some copies to watch at home\" the mouse suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good! I can't wait to reenact some of the more... racy moments. Won't that be fun, dear~?\" she cooed seductively as she breathed into the back of the Pint Puncher's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero remained stonefaced, though Shenny could tell that she was getting to him by the subtle twitch between his legs. She decided not to press him any further as they continued onward. Her mind immediately went to Dr. Wong as she speculated what type of unique gizmo she had for them. As they arrived at her work station, they found the doctor sitting at her desk sucking away on a lollipop as she typed up some report. On her work desk there was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher saw the strange ring on the doctor's desk. It caught his eye immediately by the lack of clutter around it. There was something unusual about this ring and as he took it Dr. Wong smirked for a moment before restraining her emotions. She watched the hero inspect the ring closely. It was a plain band but the different metals used formed an intricate pattern. Etched within this pattern was only one word: clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'll love this one, Pint Puncher. Recent combat analysis has shown you getting caught underneath feet, butts and worse a lot.\" Immediately two high-pitched bursts of giggles erupted from behind the hero, making him blush. It made him wonder how much of this 'combat analysis' was just their bedroom fun. Dr. Wong cleared her throat, silencing the pair of anthros, and continued her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just point it somewhere within a kilometer away and it'll teleport you there, leaving a clone behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's impressive.\" The hero mused, sliding the ring onto his finger and pointing it across the lab. A brief flash of light blinded him and suddenly he was there, looking over at the desk where another Pint Puncher stood idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Impressive.\" The doctor sighed. The superhero noticed her apprehensive response and asked her what's wrong. Dr. Wong sighed even deeper. \"Well, there has been more than a few issues in getting all this tech into a wearable package. For one, those clones have no brain. All they do is stand there, so it will be easy to see which is the real Pint Puncher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so hard on yourself, doc. It'll still get me out of dodge before something bad happens to me, that's something. And I'm sure just seeing loads of Pint Punchers standing around them will be enough to confuse a bad guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... that's where problem number two arises. Everything the clone feels is also transmitted to you. Shenny, if you could please help me demonstrate this by assaulting the clone. Make some good use of that brute strength for once.\" Dr. Wong said disdainfully. The wolfess put on a toothy grin, cracking her knuckles and pacing towards the clone. The Pint Puncher was shocked to see his girlfriend getting ready to punch him in the face, but Shenny had a surprise in mind. As soon as the clone was in arm's reach she pulled it towards her and kissed it on the mouth. The superhero tried to make sense of it, but he couldn't believe what he was feeling. It was like his girlfriend was kissing him, but not really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mwah... That's what you had in mind, right?\" She gave the doctor a sly wink before looking over to her boyfriend. His confused expression was endearing. Dr. Wong cleared her throat and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, as you see, whatever the clone experiences will also be what you experience. I've been trying to cut this neural link but without success so far. The ring will get you out of impending doom, but you'll still experience it. And in case you're wondering, this only gets worse if you clone yourself again.\" The Pint Puncher was curious what the doctor meant with again and used the ring to zip back to her desk. He stood next to his clone and a third Pint Puncher was now staring idly in the back of the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny saw what needed to be done immediately and nodded towards Tiffany. The mouse was already making her way to the clone in the back of the lab and in unison the two of them grabbed the nearby clones and gave them a big smooch. Dr. Wong just rolled her eyes but the Pint Puncher was dumbstruck by this strange sensation. He felt both their kisses on his mouth at the exact same time. It took every ounce of his willpower not to grow an immediate boner in front of Dr. Wong. She just grabbed the bridge of her nose in frustration and waited for the two anthros to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, if I may conclude...\" She grumbled, making her annoyance clear with the pair. \"... you can get rid of the clones by touching them with the ring.\" The Pint Puncher put his hand on the shoulder of his clone and immediately it disappeared into a small puff of white smoke. He walked to the back of the lab and cleaned up his other clone too. Shenny and Tiffany hadn't stopped giving eachother suggestive looks, already imagining all the things they could do with this ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In its current state I would advise against using the ring in a combat scenario. But outside of that I would like for you to... experiment a bit. The data gained might help me optimize the process to make it a more effective tool for you to avoid getting stepped on. As much as it might seem to excite you, getting flattened doesn't do much to further your ability to keep this city safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero turned beet red upon hearing the doctor talk about his shameful secret like that. She must've been watching back his fights and seeing what the pair of anthros were keenly aware of too. He could only pray that the doctor hadn't shared these findings with anyone else. Already the thought occurred of pillaging a candy store to bribe her into silence. His daydreams were interrupted by Dr. Wong snapping her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, leave me. I've got work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two go ahead, I'll catch up.\" Tiffany said in a cheery tone. The Pint Puncher and Shenny looked at eachother in confusion before shrugging and leaving the lab. They were curious to see what this ring could do and especially what it would feel like. Neither of them said a word, but the were both busy dreaming up new activities to do once they were back home. As they walked out the door and Shenny grew back to her normal size the mouse anthro caught up with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was fast.\" The Pint Puncher remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I still had some favors running with the others. They'll cover my shift. And as for you.\" She pointed up to the wolfess. \"Here's something for tonight.\" Tiffany smirked and held up a small data carrier. No doubt the recordings of past fights. Already the superhero felt his face redden again, floating up and letting his girlfriend stuff him between her boobs. Shenny gave her friend a sly smile, beckoning her to follow. They were going to have fun tonight. The mouse grew to her titanic posture as well and with careful steps the three of them headed home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> The two giants wasted no time in heading back home, all the while talking about the footage they'd already seen. There was some level of irony in their discussion as it wasn't that far the ones they would engage in back when they were supervillains, but where as before they were boasting on how much pain they could inflict on the minuscule hero, their enjoyment now came from the amount of pleasure their actions brought him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was thinking that maybe we could try that thing Debra did that one time\" Tiffany suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you talking about when she stuffed him beneath her tits or when she started dancing with him stuck between her cheeks?\" Shenny inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two went into a fit of giggles at the prospect. It wasn't as though they couldn't do both at the same time, as the good doctor had supplied them with just what they needed. They went over a number of scenarios during their walk home, the two of them dipping into their old villainous mindsets to think of creative ways to play with their tiny lover. So enraptured they were by their discussion that they didn't take immediate notice to the large stranger that sat at the entrance of their home. Shenny was the first to pick up on it, pausing from their conversation as her nose caught wind of a familiar earthy smell. She looked over at her home and was surprised to find Quaker seated on a makeshift throne of rock and mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough. I was beginning to think that I got the location wrong\" the towering pachyderm said with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a lot of damn nerve, you know that?\" Shenny growled, her posture becoming defensive as she glared down at the unwelcome intruder. They might've departed on amicable terms, but the quickest way to get on the amazon's bad side was to encroach on her territory. Quaker blinked and jumped up from her seat, raising her hands up nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! Calm down! I'm not here to cause any trouble, honest! I just...\" she trailed off as she looked over at Tiffany who simply watched the two in mild interest. \"What're <i>you</i> doing here?\" she asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was <i>invited</i>\" the mouse said with a slight smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but... since when have you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean to interrupt, but I'm starting to lose my patience. You've got three seconds to tell me what you're doing in my home before I turn you into a doormat\" Shenny threatened darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... wanted to... um...\" the normally confident elephant anthro looked down, her grey skin reddening ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out with it, Quaker!\" Shenny demanded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... wanted to talk to Pint Puncher. I have an offer for him...\" she said after clearing her throat and straightening her posture slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The wolfess raised a brow at her request, her confusion taking place over anger. What could she possibly want with him? The last time the two of them were together, the hero had encouraged her to go and live a happy, peaceful life. Granted, he <i>did</i> invite her to stick around, but Shenny assumed that the her pride wouldn't allow her to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As with all decisions, she decided to put her trust in her boyfriend as she plucked him from her cleavage. Before he could even get a word out, she pointed down at their unexpected guest who seemed to wince at the mere sight of him. To Quaker's surprise, the hero's immediate reaction to seeing his long time nemesis was to smile and fly down to greet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there! Didn't think you'd show up again so soon! How've you been?\" he asked in a chipper tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Quaker narrowed her eyes and glared down at him. How could he speak to her with such fondness? Did he somehow <i>forget</i> their prior history? She hated it; she hated how nice he was to her... more importantly, she hated how good it made her feel. She folded her arms and snorted as she met his gaze, though doing so proved surprisingly difficult. Just look at him put her stomach into knots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that. I've come here with an opportunity of a lifetime for you, little man. I'm giving you the honor and privilege of being my personal stress reliever\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. And what does that entail exactly?\" the hero asked with a knowing grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means that you'll have the personal responsibility of worshiping my gorgeous body!\" she said in the most haughty tone he could manage. The facade waned a bit as she glanced down at him from the corner of her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... if you want to... when you're not busy...\" she muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher raised a brow and glanced up at his two colossal lovers. By that point Shenny seemed more amused than angry, although that had less to do with Quaker's request and more to do with her boyfriend's sudden ability to make his foes pine for him. Tiffany nodded her head vigorously, excited at the prospect of having yet another person to play with when it came to their games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm flattered Quaker, really I am, but if you don't mind me asking, where brought this about?\" the hero asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's none of your concern! Either except the offer or don't!\" she snapped, her face growing hot again. The last thing she wanted was for him to know that she'd been thinking about him ever since their last battle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Several Hours Ago</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Barely a day had gone by since the last time she'd terrorized the city and already Quaker was bored. With no real home to call her own, she settled for building a lair underground, her furnishings made from stones and dirt. She sat on a giant throne with her massive legs crossed and beneath her there was a human slavishly licking away at the bottoms of her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Of course she had no intention of honoring the agreement she'd made with the Pint Puncher, as she was quick to snatch off a random citizen when the chance presented itself. She envied the adoration that he held for Shenny and he wanted to replicate it by having a little human servant of her own. Oddly enough, his continued worship of her body didn't seem to bring her the happiness that she thought it would. It probably wouldn't been better of he had the Pint Puncher's enthusiasm for servitude, but it was clear from the start that he was only acting out of fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-am I not doing a good job?\" the young man asked nervously as he peered up at his kidnapper's unsatisfied expression. He grimaced as she turned her attention to him, though he couldn't help but notice the lack of malice on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, you're doing fine. It's just... do you even want to be here? You can be honest. I won't punish you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The young man swallowed nervously, unsure as to whether or not he was being asked a trick question. Quaker's appetite for cruelty was well known, so he couldn't imagine her even entertaining the thought of caring about how he felt. On the off chance that she was being sincere, he opted to take a more diplomatic approach in his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'd like to go home to my wife, if that's okay with you...\" he answered fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Quaker stared down at him for a moment, her expression conveying little emotion yet somehow unnerving the young man even further. After a while she sighed and waved him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on then. The tunnel I made should lead you back to the city\" she said as she slumped back in her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The young man hesitated for a moment as he stood to his feet and slowly made his way to the tunnel entrance. At any moment he expected her to lash out and reveal that she was testing him, but it didn't happen. She just sat there with a wistful look on her face. He stammered out a quick thanks as he shuffled away, leaving Quaker alone with her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it... what am I doing wrong? Shenny managed to get that runt to fall for her in less than a day... how can <i>she</i> do it and not can't? What does she have that I don't?!\" she growled. Her heart sank as an answer came to mind. Did the Pint Puncher only like slim girls? It made sense. Shenny had a body that most could only dream of. How was she supposed to compete with that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her worries were quashed as she thought back to the last time they fought. He had called her beautiful, gorgeous, voluptuous... those words echoed through her mind and brought her immense comfort. That wasn't the only thing it did for her as she looked down to see that her hand was resting on her now wet crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That little punk... what did he do to me...?\" she grumbled beneath her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>The Present</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher mused on her offer, taking note to the constant her constant nervous fidgeting as he looked at her. He <i>did</i> extend the offer for them to hang out, though he hadn't expected her for come around for some time. He assumed that she would warm up to the idea after a few months of mulling it over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After thinking it over for a minute he gave her an answer...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The superhero looked up to the two titans awaiting his answer too. Neither of them looked very happy with this development. They were looking forward to a night of intimate fun with the hero, but the elephant made it weird. Shenny and Tiffany were good friends, but neither of them knew Quaker all that well. And though there was always time to remedy that, now just didn't seem like the right time. Shenny looked even more distraught that this fat pachyderm would have the nerve to come in and claim her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time he'd made a promise and it didn't feel right to just send the elephant packing empty-handed. The last thing the hero wanted to do was push her back into the alluring grip of evil. He'd given her a shot at redemption, he didn't want to be the reason she fails to redeem herself. Beads of sweat began to appear on his forehead as he felt like he was forced into an impossible position. Suddenly his face lit up as he'd finally thought up a reasonable solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Quaker. I can't just commit so something like that. I've got a girlfriend and she'd be heartbroken if I went with you.\" He calmly explained. Probably best not to mention what a heartbroken Shenny might do to the pachyderm. \"But, if it's a worshipper you seek I may have a solution.\" All three girls raised their brows in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few years back after fighting you and getting stomped flat into the dirt I was approached by someone. He looked like a regular interviewer, but he asked me all manner of strange questions. He wanted to know what it felt like to feel your weight on my back, how soft your butt was, it really weirded me out. Later I found out that he wrote a blog all about big bootied supervillains. He even called me lucky for having been squashed beneath so many of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny and Tiffany exchanged amused smirks. Knowing how horny the little hero gets when they squash him made his speech sound a little disingenuous. Quaker was giving the Pint Puncher a blank stare. Where was he going with this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm willing to bet there's people out there who would lay themselves at your feet for you to walk on. As long as you're careful not to injure them they'd worship you more fervently than I ever could. If word got around that you were looking for someone to admire your curves in those circles they'll line up across the block for a chance to worship you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right, you know.\" Tiffany chimed in. \"I'm fairly sure one of the interns at the I.S.E.A is into that kind of thing. He once snuck onto my chair in the lab so I would accidentally sit on him. I'm a far cry from my full size in there, but the weight was still enough to make him moan. You wouldn't believe how awkward it was. I'm sure that if I told him about your situation he could get a small group of worshippers together online in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuaker's initial tepid reaction began to warm. She'd looked forward to having the hero serve her every whim. But it was clear that his heart wouldn't be in it. Shenny had stolen his love already and though she didn't care much for the wolfess the elephant couldn't deny that she would feel a bit guilty about breaking that up. But this idea of people out there that would willingly throw themselves at her feet was new. If the hero's words were true, they might be what she's looking for. Someone to appreciate every inch of her huge chunky body is what she looked for in the superhero. Maybe these humans might do an even better job. The Pint Puncher and Tiffany made it sound too appealing not to at least give it a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll give these people a shot. But you're not getting out of this unscathed, little hero. I'll be on my way, but I want a little goodbye.\" She said cryptically, holding out her hand. The Pint Puncher raised a curious brow, but he trusted the pachyderm enough not to try and abduct him. He grabbed her hand and was immediately pulled into Quaker's hefty bosom. Each of her jiggly boobs matched the hero in size and he sank into her cleavage until only his head stuck out. Shenny and Tiffany looked down on the spectacle with an amused smirk, eager to re-enact the boob squishing he was enduring later this evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong elephantine hand grabbed the hero's head and guided it towards her own. She planted a big kiss on his face before pulling him out of her rack and wrapping him into a big hug. Quaker was uncharacteristically gentle, neatly setting the Pint Puncher back down after her overwhelming show of affection. With a cheerful smile she told them where her new lair was located so Tiffany could tell her little intern friend where to find her. The pachyderm hoped he would be as fun as the giant mouse girl made him out to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we'll visit too, get to know eachother a bit better.\" The Pint Puncher added, optimistic about adding another former supervillain to his circle of friends. They all waved Quaker goodbye as she went back to her lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, where were we?\" Shenny asked the other two, rubbing her hands with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we wanted to watch these...\" Tiffany replied, carefully holding up the data carriers with footage from their old exploits. \"...or we could just skip them and go straight to the re-enactments.\" She added with a broad smirk.</span></div></div>",

I might need a refresher course\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany's smirk widened and she nodded. She was certainly eager to jump into the heat of things, but having a little bit of inspiration never hurt. The trio hurried inside Shenny's home and took their seats at giant sized couch. As the hero sat between the eager anthros, he was hit with an important realization: they had nothing to watch the footage on. Just as he was about to address this concern, Tiffany reached into her cleavage and fished out a (relatively) small metal cube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider this a gift from the institute\" she said before tossing it in front of them and snapping her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny and the Pint Puncher watched in awe as the cube gradually swell up, growing before their very eyes until it nearly encompassed the wall in front of them. Once it reached its apparent limit, the walls of the cube fell, revealing a giant flat screen television. The couple was absolutely stunned, Shenny in particular reacting with gleeful smile, as she would've never dreamed that she'd have an actual television in her home. At least not one made to accommodate a giant like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How on earth did you do that?\" the Pint Puncher asked in bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the words of the good doctor 'you wouldn't even understand'\" Tiffany said with a grin. \"The institute hands these out to field agents so they can review the footage they collect. I got Miss Wong to make a custom one for me, seeing as how this technically counts as field study\" she explained as she plucked a giant remote from her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher grimaced slightly. Dr. Wong already made it clear that she was in the know when it came to their sexual escapades, but hearing it referred to in such scientific terms made him uneasy. Tiffany giggled at his embarrassment and gave him a gentle pat on the head before getting up to insert the data carrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are gonna love these! I picked most of em out myself~\" she tittered as she jumped back down onto the couch, the resulting impact sending the hero into the air a few feet before landing on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you even sitting down there, Punchy? You'd probably miss half of the action from all the way down there!\" Shenny teased as she reached down and lifted the tiny hero up, once again placing him into between her boobs. With her boyfriend nice and secure, she nodded at Tiffany to tell her to start playing the footage. The mouse grinned and without another any further delay, pressed the start button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>-Entry #54-</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Tiffany stood atop one of the highest buildings in Glam City in her smaller form, a sinister smile on her face as she anticipated what was to come. Squashing humans beneath her ass was fun, but every now and again she felt it was necessary to change things up a bit. She took a step back, prepping herself up for the long fall ahead of her. With a running start, she leaped of the building and shifted to her giant size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The citizens of Glam City had little time to prepare themselves as the sky suddenly went dark. They looked up and screamed in horror as a they saw Tiffany's giant as came careening down at them like a comet. There was a rush to try and get out of the way of the encroaching threat, but it would've made little difference. Even if they managed to flee, the shock wave alone would catch them in the end. All they could do was pray for a miracle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Their prayers were swiftly answered as their masked protector swooped from out of nowhere, poised to save the day yet again. The Pint Puncher gritted his teeth as he flew up to Tiffany, his mind racing as he tried to think of a way to stop her descent. He could've flown up and used the momentum to give her an uppercut so fierce that it knocked her out cold, but that wouldn't solve the issue of her falling toward the earth. With little time to deliberate, he flew beneath the rodent and pushed against her colossal rear with all his might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n So caught up in the excitement of her impending impact, Tiffany didn't feel the tiny hero pushing against her ass. It was only when she felt herself slowing up that she noticed that something was right. She could see the ground getting closer, but her initially meteoric drop had become as slow as a leaf dropping from a tree. Eventually she hit the ground with no even so much as with a gentle thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the big idea?! That was 'spose to level at least half the city!\" she snapped in a fit of juvenile rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her problems paled in comparison to the tiny hero as he struggled to hold Tiffany's mountainous body off ground. He had managed to successfully save the city from destruction, but his hasty act left him completely unable to get away in time. The immense weight was bad enough, but the rodent's putrid stench completely encompassed him, leaving him unable to properly catch his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just when it seemed like things couldn't get any worst, he heard a familiar rumbling from above. His blood ran cold and his eyes went wide, but there was nothing he could do to prevent what was to come. He was practically in the direct line of fire went Tiffany let out a loud, window rattling fart. That was all he could take as his body collapsed and a mountain of rat ass fell on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany yelped at the sudden dip and looked around for the cause of the disturbance. Had the ground given way beneath her? No, that couldn't have been the case. She would've heard it crumbling. She let out a huff as she stood to her feet and brushed herself off. She wasn't sure what it was that slowed her down, but it had successfully managed to kill her enthusiasm. She was dead set on leaving a lasting impression on the city and somehow, they found a way to put a halt to her plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, screw this. I was getting hungry anyway...\" she muttered as she stomped off, paying little mind to the cars or people around as she returned to her home in the sewers. Throughout it all, she somehow managed to completely miss the unconscious hero laying in a giant butt shaped grove in the ground. His body was completely coated in her sweat and reeked of her noxious gas... but in spite of it all, a very noticeable tent could be seen between the Pint Puncher's legs.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>-Entry Concluded-</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, you really got a boner from that?!\" Tiffany asked, her tone less mocking and more excited as she peered down at the embarrassed hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be too hard on him. You might not have been the most hygienic of bad guys, but you still had a great ass. How could he <i>not</i>  pitch a tent from getting his hands on it?\" Shenny asked with a chuckle as she rubbed the top of her boyfriend's head with her finger to try and comfort him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany blushed and giggled as she gave her friend a playful jab on the shoulder. Amusing as it was, it was nice to know that the object of her affection had been attracted to her even back when she never bathed. She leaned in and gave him a quick kiss on the top his head before scrolling through the numerous other entries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's see what else we can find...\" she muttered.</span></div></div>",

There's something I've been meaning to try out!\" Shenny said as she looked down at the Pint Puncher with a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany mirrored her friend's enthusiasm as she tucked the data disk away in her cleavage for save keeping. She assumed that they would save the reenactments for later in the day, but she certainly wasn't complaining. They had seen enough tapes to get a general idea of what they wanted to do to their pint sized lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh do tell! What do you have in mind?\" the mouse asked giddily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet Punchy will recognize this...\" Shenny snickered as she began shrinking down. The hero raised a brow as she came down to a modest sixteen feet. She continued to leer down at him as she slowly pulled her panties down and casually hanging off of her finger. The Pint Puncher narrowed his eyes, his mind drawing a hazy image of the villain she was emulating. It was only when she started to twirl her panties around her finger did he realize who she was taking after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came up with a new trick Puny Puncher! Just for you!\" Shenny sang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero's eyes widened as he memory hit him. It was a month ago when he arrived at Glam City International to foil a bank robbery. True to form, Helen was there waiting for him, although something was amiss. She stood in front of the building with her panties in hand, twirling it around her finger as she waited for the him to finish his usual heroic monologue. Once he was done, he bolted towards her only to be ensnared by the cunning hippo's trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Out of instinct, he turned to flee from Shenny but she was too quick to the draw as she used her panties as a net to snatch him up and twisted it to prevent him from slipping out. The hero was completely cocooned by walls of velvet, his cock instantly springing to life at as he was surrounded by his lover's feminine musk. Shenny laughed as she watched him twist and squirm in a vain effort to free himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, <i>hero</i>! All that talk of beating me and you can't even win against my underwear!\" Shenny cackled in the best Helen impression that he could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher winced as her mimicry was a little to spot on for his liking. It went without saying that someone of his immense strength could've easily broken through his prison, though he didn't break the immersion of their game. If they were going to reenact his battles, that meant that he had to stay in character and act out the events as they unfolded. Of course, that meant that much of their games would revolve around him being on the bad end of a beating, but that aspect of the game further added to his arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n An excited grin touched the wolfess' face as she brought her ensnared lover down to her crotch, pulling her panties taut between her thighs. A shiver ran throughout her body as she tugged it upward, wedging it deep into her taint. Her knew exactly what was coming and he could feel his prison grow tighter and wetter as Shenny dragged her panties back and forth from her pussy back to the crack of her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher's mind went back to the first time he had endured this treatment. He remembered exactly how it felt. The snug walls of fabric holding him in an uncomfortable seal, the constant friction adding to the already intense heat, the air becoming heavy as his captor's sweat, musk, and feminine juices all melded together to create a scent so pungent that he could once to cut through it with a knife, and the overwhelming sense of shame he felt in being used in such degrading manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And much like it did back when Helen did it do him, this humiliating treatment brought the hero to an intense, mind-numbing orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Back then he enitially believed that the constant grinding sensation against his crotch was the cause of it, but he knew that was just him denying the obvious. As much as it still pained him to admit it, he found great pleasure in being dominated and toyed with in such a way. If anything, the only thing that bothered him was the fact that it was Helen with whom he first shared that experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! Looks like someone's enjoying themselves! I can feel your itty bitty cock getting all hard~\" Shenny cooed. \"In fact, I think you might be enjoying yourself a little too much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Those words managed to jostle the hero out of his orgasmic high as he suddenly recalled how the fight ended. Shenny replicated Helen's action to a tee, bringing her rubbing to a halt as she left her wedged between her cheeks. The hero cringed and braced himself, as he prepared himself for the worst. His titanic lover was dead set on completely recreating his fight against the gassy hippo, so that would require her to release an earth shattering fart that would knock him out cold. Of course, she could never hope to match Helen in that regard, but he knew how competitive she could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Indeed, the horny wolfess was doing her best to build up the latent gas inside her and release it in a powerful blast. Unfortunate for her (or fortunate for her boyfriend), her body wasn't at all like Helen's and she couldn't simply break wind on a whim. After a minute of clenching and gritting her teeth...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher grew slightly concerned as he heard his girlfriend grunting and growling. She was really going to 11 with this fart. He braced himself for impact as best he could within the tight, wet prison of the soaked panties. Tifanny smirked as she saw her friend put in everything she got to create a faithful recreation of Helen's dominant gas attacks. She'd dabbled in doing them herself, but after an unfortunate accident a few years back she didn't bother anymore. One of her victims slid halfway up her butt during her fart, which made her panic so badly she ran off and hid in shame for a week. Nowadays she was a bit more comfortable with that sort of thing, but farts didn't really fit in her villainous repertoire anymore after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny's efforts finally reached their apex and at the end of all that struggling and straining herself the result could barely be heard. A cute little toot that would barely ruffle the hero's hair. The Pint Puncher could feel the brief burst of stench wash over him, dissipating almost before he had a chance to even smell it. The piercing musk of the feminine juices soaking his prison quickly overwhelmed the tiny fart. The wolfess blushed, surprised at the lack of results. Before anyone could ask questions she quickly tried to spin this turn of events. \"Hah, scared ya good, didn't I?\" She said awkwardly. Tiffany rolled her eyes and smiled, extending a hand to see the results of their re-enactment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero was pulled out from between Shenny's legs and dropped in the mouse's palm. \"It's okay Punchy, you can come out now.\" His towering girlfriend cooed. With a noisy tear he ripped open the fabric like it was nothing. The two giants smiled amicably, impressed by his willingness to play along. He hardly looked worse for wear too. Maybe they could take this up a notch. Tiffany already had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shen, you remember when we had a little argument and he got caught inbetween our butts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, how could I forget? We stopped fighting and just ground him to paste. You were already good at conflict resolution back then.\" She gave her boyfriend a sly wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddayathink?\" The mouse said in a sultry tone, swaying her colossal hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad choice, but how about the time he got shrunken and caught by Melinda? She had each of her clones take turns to sit or stomp on him until he was flat as a pancake. He came so many times...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laughed as they thought back to watching the footage of that humiliating act. The Pint Puncher just sat on the mouse's open palm, sweating nervously. It sounded like he was going to get squashed one way or another.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hm... decisions decisions...\" Tiffany muttered as she delicately stroked the top of her tiny lover's head. It had been so long since she'd felt him squirming beneath her colossal rear. She had worked so hard to quash the occasional temptation she felt to recreate those magical moments, but she didn't want to run the risk of hurting the man she loved so dearly. His masochistic streak turned out to be a blessing in disguise for her in that respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me oh my, what do we have here?\" she suddenly chimed as she looked down at the Pint Puncher with a smug grin, her fingering curling around him in a tight grip. \"Hey Melinda! Check out what I just found~\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero sighed inwardly as he prepped himself for what was to come. He remembered that day vividly. He was in the midst of an intense battle with Fiona and was everything was going swimmingly for him until the alluring flamingo performed one of her trademark dances for him, the kind that caused him to shrink down in size. Through sheer determination and heart, he managed to overcome the odds and get the better of her, though it did nothing to alleviate the issue of his reduced size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He tried flying back to the institute to see if Dr. Wong had anything that could restore his height, but he didn't get far before getting snatched out of the air by one of Melinda's clones who had spotted him just out of the corner of her eye. For hours he was forced to endure the malicious bunny's games as they all took turns stomping and sitting on him. In hindsight, that was one of earlier instances where he could recall his lust for punishment coming to the forefront as each Melinda managed to force an orgasm out of him. Eventually the group grew bored with their brutal games and they settled for having him clean and worship their feet with his tongue. Were it not for the institute stepping in and aiding him at the last minute, there was a good chance that he could've been reduced to a willing slave for Melinda and her clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that 'sposed to be? Some kind of stupid Pint Puncher doll?\" Shenny scoffed as she glared down at the hero. Between the two of them, the wolfess seemed to have a knack for impersonating other villains. Not that Tiffany was bad at it, but her voice carried hint of innocent eagerness to it that kind of hurt her ability to come off as intimidating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, look at his eyes! Only the real deal could look so scared~\" Tiffany giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shoot, you're right! I dunno what he's so scared for. We haven't even done anything to you yet!\" Shenny said with a grin as she snatched the hero from Tiffany's hand. \"Here, I'll give you something to be afraid of, little man!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that she dropped the hero onto the ground and planted her heel onto him before he could even so much as think. Shenny thought back to the last time she had him underfoot, back when the blood moon had embued her with even greater strength. As shameful as her behavior was, she couldn't help but find it amusing as that was the exact day that she made a decision that eventually spiraled into an intense and unlikely romance. For the time being she pushed that thought to the side as she focused on getting into character as she ground the ball of her foot into him. She felt no need to worry about his safety, as she had a solid grasp of what he could and couldn't take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Besides, she didn't need to be able to see her face in order to determine how the hero felt about what was happening as she felt something stiff poking into her sensitive paw pad. True to form, the hero was trying his best to play his role as a hapless victim, but the raging stiffee between his legs was making it difficult. His mindset was markedly different from back when he fought Melinda, as he now embraced his desire to be flattened and abused. If anything, the only real difficulty he faced was resisting the urge to immediately give in to the urge he felt to kiss and lick the bottom of her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't hog em! The rest of us want a crack at him!\" Tiffany said as she nudged the wolfess with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. Just don't break him <i>too</i> bad. We gotta split him five ways\" Shenny replied with a smirk as she took her foot off of the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher took in a deep breath of fresh air, though his reprieve didn't last long as an enormous shadow loomed over him. He looked up and swallowed as he saw Tiffany's frighteningly large ass hovering over his head. As arousing as the sight was, he knew first had just how destructive her ass could be. He screamed as it came careening down towards him, though it stopped abruptly once it was an inch away from him. In the heat of the moment, he had momentarily forgotten how the video played out. Tiffany laughed at his reaction as she wiggled her shapely rear at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the noise? I thought a big bad hero like you wasn't afraid of anything~\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm n-n-not afraid of you!\" the hero stuttered, mirroring the faux bravado he displayed back when he Melinda had him in that exact scenario. \"You j-just wait! The institute will-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Booooring!\" Tiffany yelled as let her ass drop down onto the hero, effectively silencing him. She bit down on her lip and shuttered at the feeling of his tiny body pinned beneath her right cheek. The enjoyment she derived from sitting on him had increased tenfold and she could feel the front of her panties growing wetter by the second. It took a bit of willpower for her stand up to her feet to continue the reenactment, though she was surprised to find that the hero was nowhere to be seen once she went to retrieve him. She began to worry that he had gotten fed up with the games and stormed off, but those fears were quelled once she felt something hard jab into her rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny stifled a snicker as her boyfriend was plastered against Tiffany's generous ass, his body completely spread eagle and his body slightly flattened. Despite having very little momentum in her descent, the mouse managed to do something that took Melinda several attempts to do, though there was element to their reenactment that had yet to be fulfilled: their pint sized lover had yet to cum from his treatment. Not one to leave a job half completed, Shenny peeled the hero off of Tiffany's butt and dropped him back onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Try and stay conscious for me, will ya?\" Shenny cackled as she fell back onto him ass first. The hero's pained cries were completely muffled by several tons of wolf flesh, his body trembling as he was brought to yet another orgasm. His first climax went completely unnoticed by the two giants as the back of Tiffany's panties had a small, barely visible cum stain on it. Shenny was quick to pick up on it the second time around, though she drew no attention to it. One orgasm wasn't enough to satisfy her; she wanted to either mirror Melinda's record or surpass it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero was in daze as Shenny's giant ass lifted off of him. Part of him wanted to try and call for a timeout, but at his heart he was a gluten for punishment. Even as Tiffany's foot came plummeting down towards him, he could feel his still hardened dick twitch in anticipation. And as the voluptuous mouse stomped down on his body over and over again, he could only hope that his super endurance was up to the task, not just for his own health, but because he didn't want the game to end early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><u><b>Two Hours Later</b><br>\r\n</u></font><br>\r\n <br>\r\n The lengthy bit of roleplay had left the two giants completely winded as they sat down beside each other. They had run their lover completely ragged as they stomped, sat, and even jumped on his puny body. By the end of their game, the hero was even flatter than he was in the footage and was once again left stuck onto Tiffany's butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well... that was... that was fun...\" Tiffany panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... should we do... next?\" Shenny asked curiously as she wiped the sweat from her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno... maybe we should give the little guy some time to catch his breath?\" Tiffany asked as she glanced down at the pint sized hero decorating her left cheek.</span></div></div>",

But this time let's try our hand at something a little more... recent.\" Her voice dropped into a seductive tone as she held the hero up between them and pursed her lips. The towering wolfess caught on quickly and moved in to kissing range. The flattened hero knew what they were planning, but he was still too squished to offer any words. He was in for this ride whether he wanted to or not. But after being stomped and sat on for two hours, this was hardly something to object to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny and Tiffany locked lips around the hero, slurping him into the middle of the action. Their giant tongues suckled and lapped at eachother and the hero trapped in there with them. Slowly they felt him turn back into his regular shape, rewarding him with thorough and intimate licks. Even after two hours and countless orgasms the Pint Puncher was as ready to blow his load as ever. The moment the titans felt their little boy-toy's manhood rising their huge tongues got even more combative. They wrapped around him like hungry snakes, only for the other tongue to pry in and save him. Finally he came, his climax spraying all over both the saliva-soaked appendages. The pair of giants moaned in unison, finally letting the hero out of his damp prison. Shenny quickly caught the hero, setting him down on her end table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better, Punchy?\" She cooed. The Pint Puncher only offered a thumbs up in response, still breathing heavily from the intense experience. The wolfess smiled broadly, looking up to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's good to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, you got something in mind for him?\" The mouse asked with a giggle. \"Oh, maybe you should let him pick something. I bet he knows precisely what encounter turned him on the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worn hero slowly raised an arm, pointing at Shenny. The wolfess instantly went beet red. She kinda expected him to say something along those lines, but she still wasn't ready for it. Tiffany didn't seem too surprised either. \"Hah, figures it'd be his girlfriend that would be responsible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you're the cutest, Punchy. But we've had more than a few scraps, which one are you thinking of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany burst into laughter. \"I think I know, look closer. Look where he's pointing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unmistakable now that Shenny was clued in. His finger pointed directly at her crotch. She laughed along with her friend. Of course it was going to be her pussy. She knew it was irresistible. \"Haha, the 'ol Shenny classic. Well, I'm not one to deny my boyfriend his moments of pleasure. But if I'm going to re-enact our old scraps it might be a little more... cramped than you remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation had given the superhero enough time to recover and form a somewhat coherent sentence. He pointed at the ring on his finger. \"I'm not going in, but I am.\" He said cryptically before activating the ring. He flashed to a point a few meters away from where he was sitting, a clone left in his stead. It stood unmoving as the wolfess reached down to grab him. The superhero felt the unique sensation of her grip around his body, even though he was sat on the table. Tiffany watched the wolfess handle her boyfriend's clone with care, slowly lowering him to her pussy. Shenny cleared her throat and prepared to put on her best growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think one of you DUMB HUMANS could finally pleasure me already?!\" She roared. Tiffany was surprised at first, but she knew how irritable the wolfess could be before she settled down with the Pint Puncher. With a gleeful smirk Shenny gave the clone a squeeze before slamming it against her nethers. During the whole act she kept an eye on her boyfriend. She saw him squirm and writhe, the sensation of her soft folds pressed against him all too real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero couldn't find the words to describe what he was feeling. He was just sat on the end table, but it felt like his girlfriend's enormous alluring pussy was right there in his face. The only thing missing was the smell. But as his girlfriend got more aroused it didn't take long for her feminine scent to spread to him. Before he got too overwhelmed by lust he turned his attention to Tiffany. The giant mouse was watching with rapt attention, oblivious to the superhero's calls at first. When she finally looked down to him he gave her the most salacious little grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna try the Shenny classic too?\" He said in a sultry tone? The giant mouse girl just raised an eyebrow in confusion. With a sigh the hero activated the ring again, leaving behind another clone. \"Go on, treat yourself.\" He suggested, pointing at the copy of him. Tiffany was still a bit nervous about putting people down there, but after her experience with the Pint Puncher the other day she felt a whole lot more confident. She swallowed her fears and grabbed the little hero clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now YOU listen here, unless you're making me cry with PLEASURE you're not coming out!\" She yelled in her best Shenny impression. Unfortunately the mousey squeak in her voice made both the superhero and Shenny look up in amused surprise, both of  them struggling not to fly into a fit of giggles. Thankfully Tiffany was the first to lose it and burst into laughter. She didn't expect her impression to be so unintentionally hilarious and soon all three of them were teary-eyed with laughs. Once the two titans had regained their composure they sat back again, bringing their hero clones back to their pussies. The Pint Puncher was overwhelmed by the strange sensation of feeling both Shenny and Tiffany at the same time. And neither of them had even pushed him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny and Tiffany moaned together as they rubbed their soft pussies with the little clone. It wasn't as good as the real thing squirming in their inescapable grasp, but it felt great all the same. The sloppy squelches got louder and louder until the wolfess let out a lewd moan and pushed the little hero in. Tiffany followed suit seconds later, moaning as she felt the little body inside of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> The Pint Puncher was intimately familiar with his girlfriend's tight love tunnel and the memory of Tiffany's drooling snatch was still fresh in his mind, but he wasn't at all prepared for the euphoric bliss that greeted him as the his clones were completely enveloped. As the good doctor said, the sensation was multiplied twofold as he felt body being pushed and squeezed at all sides. He fell back and started writhing around on the table, his two titanic lover looking on in a mixture of amusement and arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He tried his best to hold out and extend the experience, but it was completely out of his hands. While his clones weren't able to think for themselves, their body's responded accordingly as their dicks were dragged and squeezed without rest. In a matter of minutes, the hero reached what had to be one of the most intense orgasms of his life, his eyes shooting open as he let loose a hoarse scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How DARE you blow your loud before me, you little punk!\" Shenny growled, fully committing to the role of her past self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You're not finish until I say-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany stopped herself as a surprised gasp escaped her lips, her face turning red as the pleasure she felt suddenly intensified. Shenny was about to ask her about it when she felt a familiar wiggling feeling inside her pussy. She wasn't certain what was happening, but it felt as though her tiny lover was actually inside of her, doing his usual routine of rubbing his body along her inner walls. That couldn't have been the case, as her boyfriend was right in front of her, still squirming on the table as his body was wracked with pleasure. Her first thought was to reach into her pussy and investigate, but she was far too caught up in the feeling to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two giants weren't the only ones experiencing the odd phenomenon, as the hero's hands were growing warmer by the second. Aside from the lack of slime coating his hands, it was as if he was really inside of their pussies, his hands pushing and rubbing against every inch of flesh he could reach. He tried to think of a how this could be, but he like his girlfriend, his mind was preoccupied by the overwhelming pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany was the first to reach her breaking point as she cried out in ecstasy, her eyes nearly rolling in the back of her head and her tongue hanging from her mouth as the clone was expelled from her snatch by the sheer force of her climax. Shenny followed suit, though she managed to stifle her scream by biting down her her bottom lip. The hero was soon joined on the table by his slime soaked clones. The three of them were left completely winded from the experience but Shenny was quick to collect herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... something...\" she panted with a pleased grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany could only grunt in response as the intensity of her orgasm left in a high that had yet to fade. The Pint Puncher was focused on trying to catch his breath, but his attention was quickly drawn to a familiar taste in his mouth. He lifted his head up and was stunned to see his clones lapping up the residual slime off of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... didn't the doctor say that these guys had no brain...?\" the hero asked concernedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny blinked and raised a brow at the curious sight. She reached down and nudged one of the clones to gauge it's reaction and to her surprise it turned to face her with an expression of pure lust. The clone knelt down before her, bowing his head as though he were addressing a monarch of some kind. As flattered as the wolfess was, she wanted answers as to what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiff... can you call Dr. Wong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhm...\" Tiffany slurred, her face still red as she sat back with a sex-drunk smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ ___________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they started moving, huh?\" Dr. Wong asked as she sat at her desk, furiously taking notes as Shenny described the incident in great detail. Tiffany had handed her a touchscreen phone comprised of the same nanite technology that allowed her clothes to grow and shrink with her. She had the doctor on screen and as expected, she was sitting at her desk hard at work when they called in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I have one of em at my feet right now. He just flew down there and started massaging them, no prompting whatsoever\" Shenny said with a chuckle as she looked down at the clone who was diligently worshiping her feet,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. What about the other one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's  um... with Tiff right now\" Shenny said as she looked across the table at her friend. Tiffany was in complete bliss as the other clone was in her bikini top, licking away at her hardened nipple as his dick dragged along the her soft fur. The hero himself was seated on the table, his body tingling as he was unable to focus with all the different feelings his body was experiencing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. I think I know what's happening. If you can, get the two of them on the table and put the phone down in front of them. I want to test something\" the doctor instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny nodded and reluctantly plucked the clone from her feet before placing him onto the table<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Tiff, you heard the lady. Give em up\" Shenny said with a smirk. Tiffany pouted and fished the clone out of her bra and placed him beside the other one. The Pint Puncher sighed as he was finally given a moment of reprieve. As instructed, Shenny placed the phone down in front of them, though it looked more like a large screen television from their perspective. From the other size, Dr. Wong turned the camera over to her right, revealing the muscular cougar Rowland. He sat atop an examination table with a bitter scowl and a size regulating collar around his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we done yet? I haven't eaten all day and I'm startin' to get cranky!\" he snapped angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit your bellyaching and listen. I need you to do be a favor and strip\" Dr. Wong state bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rowland blinked before a lecherous smile crossed his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady, if you wanted a taste all you had to do was ask. Granted, you're not really my type, what with me being a ten and you being... eh, I'd give you a soft six\" he said as he stood to his feet and started to remove his speedo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Just look into the camera and give yourself a few strokes\" the doctor said irritably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, you're one dirty girl, aintcha?\" Rowland chuckled snidely. He obeyed her nonetheless as he stripped out of his speedo, letting his large cock spring free. He huffed as he hand a hand along his girth, bringing it to fell mast in a matter of seconds. The lewd display had a noticeable effect on the Pint Puncher's clones, their eyes growing wide and their mouths watering as they watched the cougar stroke his meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Get to it. It's not everyday that I let a human suck me off. Count yourself lucky~\" Rowland cooed as he held his length out to the doctor. Wong paid him no mind as she turned the camera away from him and looked at the two clones. The cougar narrowed his eyes and began to lash out at her for leading him on, only to be silenced as she pressed a button he console in front of her. From off camera the three could hear him yelp in pain before falling silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as I thought. It seems as though the neural link is beginning to have an influence on their cognitive processes\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... that means what?\" Shenny asked curiously. The doctor sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that that their brains are starting to function. As I said before, ring bearer feels whatever the clones feel, but it goes the same in reverse. Whatever the Pint Puncher feels, the clones feel, although in this case its less physical and more psychological. They seem to be driven by his most basic, primal desires and nothing else\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So these guys are just clones that're constantly horny?\" Tiffany asked with an amused grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and no. Think of it like this: whenever Puncher gets squashed or sat on, his body immediately experiences a state of arousal. Most of the time its involuntary, but that doesn't matter when your body is programmed to respond a certain way. Those two clones are a physical embodiment of that immediate reaction\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, are you saying that his clones are basically walking boners?\" Shenny giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A rather juvenile way of phrasing it, but yes\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher's face turned bright red as his two lovers laughed uproariously at this revelation. It was no secret that he had a lust for punishment, but there was something extra demeaning about seeing his clones immediately fawning over Rowland's exposed dick. Of all people to get a stiffee from, it <i>had </i>to be Rowland. He'd never be able to live that shame down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I need to cut this call short. I still have ten more experiments to run on romeo over here. Be careful with that ring\" Dr. Wong said before dropping the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once she was gone, a silence hung in the air as the three reflected on the information given to them. The Pint Puncher was rather irritated, as he saw some practical applications for the ring while on the job. This recent development rendered his plans moot. He could use the teleport function to escape from harm, but the clone left behind would no doubt jump at the chance to submit to whatever foe he'd face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n While he thought that over, his lovers were debating with themselves as to whether or not that should still mess around with the ring. Clearly it had some kinks to work out, though the prospect of having a group of Pint Punchers eager to worship their bodies seemed too good to pass up. Still, they had to think about their tiny lovers health. No matter how super powerful he was, even he had his limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After thinking it over, they decide to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shenny looked down at her boyfriend with pity. He was blushing bright red from the unrestrained lewdness his clones were demonstrating. Maybe this little adventure had run its course, but the wolfess couldn't help but be stuck with a few questions. She turned to Tiffany to see the mouse girl staring vacantly at the clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's on your mind, Tiff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I've been around Dr. Wong too long, but I'd say this warrants a little... experimentation.\" The titanic mouse responded in a seductive tone. The superhero groaned in anticipation. He could already guess his girlfriend's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, I did dream once of having an army of Pint Punchers serve my every whim... Do you think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly, but I want to work on something else first. Little Punchy here has already given us so much. Let's see if we can give him a break.\" The mouse girl turned her attention to the superhero, who looked at her with a puzzled expression. \"Let's start simple. We know that the clones transfer their feelings to the ringbearer. So what happens if you take off the ring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero's curiosity was peeked and he quickly removed the ring. He expected the clones to go up in smoke but to everyone's surprise they were still there, looking as lively as ever. But even though he didn't bear the ring, would the clones still have their neural link? Shenny suggested she'd help uncover that mystery and without hesitation poked one of the clones onto his back. With two fingers she squeezed and massaged the clone's dick, causing him to squirm weakly as she brought him to orgasm. She looked over at her boyfriend to see him be seemingly unfazed by the whole experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very interesting...\" Tiffany mused, writing down some hasty notes on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" The wolfess asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the lab we've tried to bust the neural link by removing the ring, but whenever we did the clones would dissipate almost immediately. I guess your boyfriend's super endurance is adding to their longevity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long will they last?\" Shenny was rubbing her hands with glee, envisioning all the things she'd like to do with these clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea. They might last years or they might go poof in the next five minutes. I suggest we keep one of them apart as a control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, but that means we've only got one clone to play with...\" The wolfess pouted, but Tiffany just laughed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shen, we've got the original right here. Punchy, think you can whip up a few more clones? On that note, was making them tiring in any way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero shook his head and popped the ring back on. He could still feel the lingering afterglow of his clone's orgasm. It was a warm and strangely unpleasant experience. The sensation that he'd had sex, but it wasn't him specifically. He couldn't quite put into words what made it feel off-putting, but that was for another time. Right now he just focused on creating more clones. If it would keep those two horny giants busy for a while he could have a proper rest up after all those re-enactments. He blinked back and forth across the table until there were nearly two dozen Pint Punchers standing around. The superhero was breathing heavily, raising his finger to get Tiffany's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... am tired now. Lotsa clones... is kinda... taxing...\" He panted heavily, taking a knee to recover. The mouse smiled and nodded, adding his observations to her notes. Next she picked up one of the clones and put him aside on the end table. She asked the wolfess for a tall glass and put it down over the clone like an improvised prison. Before she went any further she pointed out that the Pint Puncher should probably take the ring off before the collective boner his clones would be having could endanger him. He didn't need to be told twice and quickly slid the ring off his finger. Tiffany carefully picked him up and gave him a big, thankful kiss. She passed him over to Shenny who added her own sloppy smooch. Finally the hero was given some time to rest on the side of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess turned to the group of clones standing about on the table. With a stern voice she started barking orders. \"Alright you little copies, listen up. I want you lined up and ready for tonight. We don't know how long you'll be around, so get moving!\" Quickly the clones rushed together to form an orderly formation. Shenny continued her instructions. \"You will split up into two groups.\" The clone formation immediately split down the middle, forming the two requested evenly sized groups. The two titans were surprised by the discipline on display from these 'walking boners'. Nevertheless Shenny finished her commands. \"You will go to Tiffany and do whatever she tells you to. The rest of you, you're mine now. Let's go, boy toys, momma needs some spoiling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny eagerly reached down and picked up one of her servants from the formation, bringing him to her still dripping wet loins and sliding him inside. He squirmed delightfully, but she felt a desire for more. Both giants set themselves down on the couch and the clones begin to travel towards them. They don't seem capable of flying, but at least they inherited the hero's super endurance. At least, that's how they explained them surviving being shoved into their pussies the first time. In no time the little men were crowding all over them, gently tending to their feet, bellies, boobs and wherever else they were guided. The wolfess had already slipped a second clone into her snatch and was carrying a third to his musky destination. Finally it looked like the Pint Puncher could get his time to recover.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> The Pint Puncher could do nothing but stare on in bewilderment as he watched the surreal display. He had seen many oddities in his career as a superhero, but this incident completely overshadowed all others and he wasn't really certain how to feel about it. On one hand he was thankful to finally have a moment of rest after the physically taxing games he had just endured. On the other hand, he couldn't help but be slightly envious of his dopplegangers as they tirelessly worshiped the beautiful bodies of his two lovers. He was half tempted to put the ring on just so he could join in on the experience by proxy, but he didn't want to risk the potential damage it would cause to his health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Still, he could find some enjoyment in watching the normally insatiable wolfess drool and go cross eyed as his clones squirmed inside of her. One Pint Puncher was enough to bring her to the best orgasm of her life, but two? She couldn't even bring herself to scream as they licked and humped her inner walls, the others tending to her feet and her breasts all the while. Tiffany wasn't quite as demanding to her half of the clones as she allowed them to move at their leisure, kissing, licking, and humping every inch of her body they could reach. Above all else, she enjoyed seeing the man of her dreams lusting after her the same way he did Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eventually, Shenny came to an intense, mind numbing climax, her eyes nearly rolling in the back of her head as the two clones were expunged from her dripping pussy by the sheer intensity of her orgasm. For the first time should could remember, Shenny was left feeling winded. She looked down at the two and smiled broadly as she reached down to give them an affectionate pat on the head. She didn't expect them to appreciate the gesture, but to her surprise their immediate response was to beam in pride at their hard work. Then again, it wasn't too surprising. They were manifestations of her boyfriends lusts and desires, so no doubt that meant they shared his desire to obey and be dominated. It was an amusing contradiction to say the least: a man of his unshakable moral character possessing such a deep seated love of being manhandled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny was about to make mention of that when she saw the other clones run up to her, pushing and shoving each other to see who would be the next to enter Shenny's cavernous pussy. As entertaining a sight it was, Shenny had to put a quick halt to their fighting. Even someone with a libido like hers needed a moment to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! No fighting! I didn't even give you permission to go on in yet!\" she said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The clones quickly brought their squabbling to a halt as they stared up at her. Shenny could see them brimming with anticipation, eager to take more orders from their towering goddess. She sighed and leaned back against the cough, her chest still heaving from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just take five guys. You'll be up inside me again in no time\" she said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The clones seemed to register her comments as their expressions brightened, though some of them weren't quite as enthused. There wasn't much going on in their heads collectively other than overwhelming perversion. The depth of the inner thoughts could be boiled down to \"step on me\", \"chew me up\", \"sit on me\", and various other lewd and obscene desires. As much as they enjoyed obeying the sexy amazonian anthro, they could only keep still for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Shenny sat back thinking up new games for them, she felt a jolt of pleasure surge through her and interrupt her thoughts. She looked down and went wide eyed as she saw them crowding around her legs. While she wasn't paying attention, they had all rushed forward in an attempt to submerge themselves into her pussy only to get stuck as they all tried to enter at once. It took Shenny a greet deal of willpower not to reach down and pushed them all in, but her outrage managed to peak past her lust as she yanked them away from her snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I just tell you? Don't do anything without my-- hey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before she could even begin scolding them, five clones ran forward yet again. Shenny growled and batted them away gently, though she could see by the grins on their faces that they didn't intend to stop anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-guys! Quit it! D-d-don't...!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny blinked and looked over to Tiffany. Her portion of the clones had all but swarmed her body  lavishing it affection as the mouse squirmed and giggled uncontrollably in her seat. Tears began to form in her eyes and her face was reddening as their worshiping tickled her body from to bottom. What started as a delightful experience had turned into mild torture session as she struggled to catch her breath. Shenny huffed angrily as she stood up and walked over to her friend, plucking the clones off of her body as though she were plucking ticks off of her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks Shen...\" Tiffany panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny nodded and turned her attention to the clones laying on the table. They had no real understanding of the wrong they had just done as they looked up at her with perverse grins. If anything, they were hoping that she <i>would</i> lash out against them so they could experience the joys of being punished by the beautiful giant. Shenny had other ideas as she looked over at her tiny lover who had been watching the display in mild amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy, I think we've had enough to now. Would you do the honors and get rid of these guys?\" she asked with a sheepish smile. It certainly was fun while it lasted, but this was one of the few times where they couldn't work past the shortcomings of Dr. Wong's prototypes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a lesson to be learned here, but I'm not nearly clever enough to think of it\" the hero joked as he put on the ring. Almost immediately, he felt his body grow weak as he was senses were overwhelmed. He didn't have to worry about it for long though, as he only needed to keep it on long enough to get rid of his dopplegangers. He walked over to the group of clones who still stood by waiting for Shenny to issue some sort of punishment.</span></div></div>",

The others, seeing this happen, immediately scatter. The Pint Puncher smirks, chasing after the clones. It was hardly fair as the superhero flew from clone to clone, tapping them on the shoulder or head. Shenny and Tiffany tried to block either escape, careful not to accidentally step on them. The clones were unable to flew, but they managed  to run off at a decent speed. All of them ran for the woods, the Pint Puncher giving chase. By the time Shenny's home was cleared a good dozen of the clones had escaped into the woods. The hero sighed, preparing to go after them. But before he could fly off his girlfriend called out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave them?\" He reacted, surprised by Shenny lackadaisical attitude. \"I feel every bit of trouble they get into, and there's a good ten of them getting into trouble in the woods now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So take off the ring again. They'll either expire in the forest or make themselves useful in the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Useful?! How are these idiots going to be useful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'll wager that they'll make a beeline for the nearest supervillain to worship, which hopefully means said villain will be too occupied playing with you to do evil. And if any of them are dumb enough to sneak back to us, you can deal with them then.\" The wolfess said with an amused smirk. The Pint Puncher couldn't fault her logic, but it still felt wrong to let these horny little bastards roam free. The hero reluctantly shrugged and took off the ring. With a smug grin he flew back to the wolfess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... did you ladies enjoy the army of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany laughed. \"You lot knew how to pamper a big girl like me, that's for sure. Ain't that right Shen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, you know it. I'm still sad I didn't get to try and wedge a few more in me. It felt good while it lasted though. But let's be honest here Tiff, none of them could beat the original.\" The mouse nodded fiercely, making the hero blush. \"Speaking of which, now that mr. Original is looking all rested and ready, what shall we do next?\" Shenny mused with a lewd smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's still a few more things I'd love to re-enact.\" Tiffany said, rubbing her hands gleefully. The hero gulped at the sound of those words, but Shenny just offered a smile in return. Maybe they could think of a few more things. But after all this fun she was more than ready to take it a little easier. The three argue a little back and forth before deciding to...</span></div></div>",

She sat down and kicked her feet up onto the table before looking at Tiffany and nodding her head towards the space beside her. Tiffany pouted but didn't complain as she took her seat. They had put the hero through the wringer for hours, so the least they could do was give him a moment to unwind. Besides, they still had a disk full of recordings to keep them entertained while they relaxed. She dug into her cleavage and retrieved the data disk, getting up to deposit it into the colossal monitor that rested in front of them before jumping back to her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't bother to skim through this beforehand, so we might need to skip through the boring bits\" Tiffany said as she used her phone to scroll through the videos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you say 'boring bits' you're not referring to the parts were I'm winning, are you?\" the Pint Puncher asked accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maaaybe~\" the mouse giggled mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero rolled his eyes and smiled before turning his attention to the screen. His smile waned a bit at the sight of his most disliked nemesis Helen standing tall over his beaten body. Of all the villains he had fought, very few of them could boast such a high record of wins against him like her. In many respects, she was the closest thing to an arch enemy that he had. Oddly enough, the mere sight of her was enough to get an immediate reaction from his member as it began to grow stiff. A familiar feeling of shame washed over him, though it somehow was worse than it was with Rowland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, this is one of my favorites! Watch what Helen does here!\" Tiffany said excitedly as she nudged Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n On the video, Helen reached down and hoisted the hero up into her arms, looking down at him with an oddly affectionate smile. The Pint Puncher winced as he had come to understand that Helen's smile usually meant that she had something special planned for him. True to form, the hippo dug into her cleavage and pulled out a vial of purple glowing fluid. The hero on screen was too exhausted to stop her as she poured the sinister looking concoction into his mouth and gently tilted his head to allow him to easily swallow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero's body immediately turned rigged, his body becoming completely stiff as his face froze in a state of pure horror. At first Shenny wasn't sure what was happening, but it all became clear as Helen grabbed the hero by his ankles and lifted him up, his entirely body standing straight as though he were made of stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't mind being my loofah for the day. I was about to take a night long shower in my lair and I realized that I had completely misplaced the one I had! So instead ordering another one online, I decided to do the more sensible thing and volunteered you for the job!\" she said with a laugh. \"Hmm... I worked up such a sweat catching you and my lair is so far away... I think we can improvise a bit\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The frozen hero could do nothing but watch as carried his ridged body over to the nearest fire hydrant, Helen stripping out of her clothing all the while. It took no effort whatsoever for her to uproot it from the ground and releasing a geyser of water into the air. She frowned at the cold emitting from the rushing water but shrugged as she stepped into the stream She looked at her \"loofah\" and smiled as she reached into his mouth and pulled out his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time I need to make it so you can still move your mouth. Ah well. Beggars can't be choosers, am I right? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher screamed internally as he was brought down to the villainous hippo's rear and was dragged face first across the smooth surface, his tongue being forced to endure the taste of her sweat. Helen was content to disregard him entirely as she used his body to thoroughly scrub herself down. Not an inch of her body was left untouched as she brought the hero up and down her back, between her legs, across her armpits. The hero watching in the present shuddered at the memory of it all as he vividly remembered just how awful the experience was. That wasn't even the worst of it as he saw his past self begin to wiggle and squirm as he was pushed deep into the crack of Helen's ass. The serum was starting to wear off and it showed as he struggled against the meaty walls of flesh that surrounded him. Helen wasn't the least bit perturbed by his sudden movement as she looked back at him with a mischievous glint in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, just in time\" Helen said with a smirk. She didn't give him a single moment to prepare himself as she unleashed a powerful skull rattling fart that instantly rendered him unconscious. Helen knew he was out when she looked back and saw that his once kicking legs were completely limp. As amusing as it was, she felt a little peeved that no one was around to see her utterly humiliate the hero (obviously being unaware of the hidden security footage watching her at the moment). She decided that the next best thing would be to keep a souvenir of her victory as she reached into her cleavage and fished out a camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher's face grow hot red with anger as he watched his Helen use his past self's body as a plaything, putting him into all sorts of embarrassing positions before taking a photo to preserve the memory. He was posed with his face to her cheek, with his head beneath her armpit, and most galling of all, with his legs spread open to reveal the stark erection that pushed against his costume. She seemed to take a special amount of amusement at the sight as she fiddled with his member playfully with the tip of her finger, though she quickly tired of the game before standing up and putting her clothes back on. Before she walked away she took a moment to look back at the hero's beaten, stinking body and blow him a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two giants watched the display in a mixture of amusement and awe at the creativity Helen had displayed. Back when they were villains they were used to relying on their brute force in order to beat the Pint Puncher, but the hippo was in a league all her own when it came to thrashing him. She didn't rely on her superpowers as a crutch and instead used her wits and cunning to get ahead. If she wasn't on the side of evil, they would have loved to have her around to think up some games they could play with their tiny lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She always was the sharpest one among us\" Shenny said with a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! You saw her face when Punchy started to move again, right? She didn't even look worried! Almost like she had planned for him to start moving again!\" Tiffany said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Helen for ya. Always a step ahead\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, if you two love her so much why don't you just go join her fanclub...\" the hero muttered bitterly. He could stand for a lot, but he couldn't stomach all the praise Helen was receiving. Tiffany saw the annoyance on his face and smiled as she reached over and patted him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't be such a grump. If it weren't for Helen, I wouldn't even be here right now!\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher blinked and looked up at her with a confused frown. He remembered what Tiffany said the day he and Shenny fought her. That \"a little birdy\" had told him that he had gotten together with Shenny. He assumed that it was just hearsay based on their first battle against Derek, but that no one else seemed to be in the know other than her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" the hero asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen was the one that told me that you and Tiffany had gotten together. She said that you love getting beaten up, although I didn't believe <i>that</i> part at the time\" Tiffany responded with another giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero's face was drained of color at this stunning revelation. Not only was Helen in the know of his fetish, but she was the first to comment on it! He thought back to the video they had watched and how Helen took immediate notice to his hardened member. How many times had she gotten such a reaction out of him? Even worse, how long had she known about his kink? She was aware of it long before the Pint Puncher discovered it, but that was barely a month ago. Hell, she could've known about it long before he and Shenny ever got together!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... she locked up right now?\" The hero asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. We had her in captivity, but she managed to break out during lunch\" Tiffany said nonchalantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero winced. Helen was out there somewhere planning heaven knows what, and she knew just how much he got off on being dominated. She had always been a pain to deal with, so this revelation made his job all that much harder. Then again, if she knew about it for this long, that might've meant that she had no interest in exploiting this weakness. It still struck him as odd that she wouldn't even bother to comment on it once. Before he could press the issue any further...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The giant mouse pointed at the screen excitedly. \"Ooooh, here's one you might enjoy too, Punchy. This one's hilarious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footage switched over to the Pint Puncher standing amidst a handful of ruined buildings. It wasn't clear at first, but as the image zoomed out it turned out the rubble was set in a large paw print. The hero looked haggard and worn out, and soon it became clear why. The culprit behind all that devastation shot back into view, a huge paw stomping down where the Pint Puncher stood. The screen rattled and a nearby shop collapsed from the shockwave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that looked painful.\" Shenny commented with a mix of concern and glee. Stomping people flat wasn't really her style, but she could appreciate seeing it portrayed like this. Curiously she looked on as the giant paw lifted to reveal the hero once more. He was laid flat on his back, his white spandex torn and his body motionless. A huge voice boomed overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third time's the charm... hehehe.\" The distinct growl of Rowland was unmistakable. Shenny and the Pint Puncher looked over to the mouse in unison. Why was Tiffany so excited to watch him of all villains? They hated that dumb cougar. The mouse could read their expressions clearly and giggled. \"Just watch, trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny and the superhero exchanged confused looks before shrugging and turning their attention back to the TV. Rowland had grabbed the hero and was stroking his own massive erection with him. The Pint Puncher winced at the memory of being rubbed against that huge, smooth shaft. But just like before he could feel it happening again. His manhood was reacting to the lewd display on the screen. Shenny smirked nonchalantly, no longer surprised that she could feel his little boner wedged between her tits. Getting stomped into the ground repeatedly by someone as big as Rowland must be a wet dream come true for her boyfriend. Maybe she could do the same, but when it came to throwing her weight around, she really preferred just sitting on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now he's gonna channel his inner Shenny.\" Tiffany chirped. The wolfess was a little annoyed that she was getting compared to that dirtbag Rowland, but she was far too amused at her embarrassed boyfriend to care. They watched as Rowland held the hero by his foot, letting him dangle just above the massive cock tip. The slit looked big enough to slide the superhero inside and the foul cougar did just that. He dunked the hero into the sensitive passage, his greedy shaft swallowing up its prey until only his legs were still visibly. With a loud, growling moan he pulled the hero back out, revealing a Pint Puncher soaked in off-white slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vile supervillain dipped the hero in several more times before laying back and grabbing the superhero's drenched arms. He lowered the Pint Puncher back into his shaft, feet first this time. Once he had pulled her nemesis in up to his waist he let go, allowing him to struggle and fight as the monstrous cock slowly swallowed him. The weakened hero's hits only served to arouse the giant cougar, speeding up the process. Before long the Pint Puncher's head sank into the throbbing manhood, his arms still sticking out, frantically flailing for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero burned with embarrassment, watching the cougar feed him to his cock. It wasn't the worst way to go, but it definitely ranked high. He looked up to see his girlfriend quietly concentrated on the screen. He wondered what she would be thinking off, though with the camera lingering on the massive cougar shaft he didn't have to guess very hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny sighed internally. The manhood seen on the screen was probably just about the only one in this city that could satisfy her outside of the time she and the superhero started fiddling with those size-altering bracelets. It made her yearn to repeat that experience, but it also made her wonder something else. Would she have been into Rowland if the cougar wasn't such a massive jackass? His personality alone was enough to nullify any positives about him, but that huge body could've been a lot of fun to play with. She smiled wryly as she pondered whether she'd have given the Pint Puncher the light of day if she and Rowland were together. What if Dr. Wong's rehabilitation treatments finally succeed and he becomes all kind and well-adjusted? She was snapped out of it by Tiffany pointing at the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... oh... here it comes!\" She squeaked excitedly. Rowland was busy jerking himself off, the superhero lodged somewhere deep in his immense shaft. The cougar had laid back and was about to splatter himself in the face. Given how self-absorbed he was, the stink of his own cum was like a fine perfume to him. The image was detailed enough that the three could practically see the orgasm rushing up his manhood and with a loud splurt the first of many thick ropes of cum shot out onto the villain's chest. It just kept on spewing out more, cum flying all over Rowland's chest and face. There was a small interruption, but with a lewd moan he kept it going. Suddenly a white streak burst out of the volley of cum. The superhero had been launched out, using the momentum to his advantage and slamming fist-first into the supervillain's jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ferocious impact knocked the villain out cold. The superhero could barely contain the might of his attack himself, cartwheeling through the air and landing on the pavement. He had pulled it off, though he dreaded to think how long it was going to take for him to stop smelling like cougar cum. Shenny and Tiffany both burst into laughter whilst the hero carried a smug grin. He'd forgotten about this one and watching it from the outside was a lot funnier than the perspective he had from inside the villain's dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that for a punch?\" He boasted a little. \"I'd love to see you try and re-enact that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero gasped a little and put his hands on his mouth. The last thing he needed to do was give these two giants more ideas. Though unless either of them has been keeping some truly dark secrets there was little chance of him having to experience what he just saw on the screen.</span></div></div>",

As much as he loved and admired every part of her body, he wasn't entirely comfortable with the prospect of her having male parts, fake or otherwise. Shenny scoffed and leaned back against the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks but no thanks. I'll usually try anything once, but some things are just too weird, even for me\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher breathed a sigh of relief. He knew how infeasible it was for either of them to recreate that particular bout, but he wouldn't have put it past either of them to try. Shenny in particular prided herself in being able to do the impossible when it came to making her fantasies a reality. All it would take would be a handful of snacks and a quick visit to the good doctor's lab. Lucky for him, she wasn't really interested in recreating that particular moment, nor was she interested in... \"packing a little something extra\", as they say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough about that. How's about we watch one more video before bed?\" she added as she turned her attention back to the screen in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany nodded and looked to her phone for another video for them to enjoy. That last video managed to satisfy both Shenny and Pint Puncher, so she decided to look for another fight where he won after enduring a lot of punishment. She scrolled through the dozens of videos as she tried to recall out each of them went. Eventually she found the perfect video and put it up onto screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't too often that we see this guy out and about!\" She quipped excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The video began with the Pint Puncher walking down the empty and battle ravaged streets of Glam City in the middle of the night, his expression that of pure focus as he remained on the lookout for any potential evildoers. Several unconscious police officers were scattered around the area, their bodies either flattened, coated in saliva, or both. Other than that, they didn't appear to have much in the way of battle scars, almost as if the perpetrator went out of their way to refrain from seriously hurting them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero on screen walked for a few seconds before something came plummeting down on top of him. The hero had no time to brace himself as he suddenly felt himself getting pinned down by a massive scaled foot. He looked up to see his seldom seen adversary Taurus in his anthro form standing above him with an annoyed scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumb superhero always trying to lock me up!\" He growled. \"You just like mean scientists! Want to keep me locked in cage!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher gritted his teeth and pushed the foot off of him before jumping back into a defensive stance. Taurus was quick to close the distance between them as he charged forward with his arms poised to snatch his prey. His hands were but inches away from the hero's waist before he suddenly jumped up and delivered a powerful uppercut that caused the villain to stagger back and shake his head. While he was trying to collect himself, the hero bolted forward with the intent of throwing a punch to Taurus' gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n While his manner of speaking might've indicated a lack of intellect, the prehistoric anthro was a lot smarter than most assumed. His response to the encroaching threat was to quickly shift into his feral form and lower his head with his massive maw wide open. The hero gasped and tried to turn on the breaks but could do nothing as the momentum of his charge sent him tumbling into the dinosaur's open mouth. He stumbled and slipped along the surface of Taurus' tongue as he desperately tried to exit out of the way he came, but that option was quickly taken from him as the dinosaur slammed his mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naturally, the two giants couldn't see what was happening inside Taurus' mouth as the camera was focused on the villain. From their perspective, it looked like he was simply swishing the hero around his mouth. The Pint Puncher didn't need to guess what was happening though, as he remembered it as though it were yesterday: the rancid and hot breath filling his lungs, the his body being getting absolutely soaked in saliva as it was prodded at all sides by Taurus' tongue, and the powerful teeth grinding him to a pulp as he was chewed on like a piece of gum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a minute of enduring that hell, Taurus slowly opened his mouth and rolled the hero's soaked and mangled body onto the ground. The Pint Puncher whimpered and pleaded for mercy as the dinosaur turned around and presented his frighteningly large rear to him. Taurus looked back and him and narrowed his eyes angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop whining. You try to cage me, you get punished\" he said in a matter-of-fact tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, he dropped down onto the hero with an audible <i><b>splat</b></i>, the pavement giving way to the metric tons of dinosaur ass that just dropped down. The villain sighed in content as he rubbed his butt back and forth, reveling in the crunching and squelching noises his victim's body made beneath him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... how exactly does this end?\" Shenny asked with a smirk as she looked over to Tiffany. \"Seems like a pretty one sided fight, to be honest\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't you worry. Little Punchy has always been... resourceful~\" Tiffany teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny raised a brow and turned her attention back to the screen in front of them, though her boyfriend did the opposite as he buried his head in his hands. He did indeed come out on top in this fight, but it done in a less than heroic manner. On the video, everything seemed to be lost for the hero when something odd happened. Taurus came to a sudden halt, his body tensing up as he looked down at the hero beneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what... what're you- oh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He yelped and shuddered slightly, his tongue hanging out of his mouth as his eyes glazed over. At first Shenny wasn't sure what was happening but it quickly became clear to her as Taurus fell back with his legs spread wide open, his frighteningly large member exposed for all to see. At the base of the dinosaur's massive cock was the Pint Puncher, his hands weakly stroking away at the large slab of meat in front of him. When Taurus brought his ass down onto him, the only parts of the hero's body that managed to remained intact was his right hand and head, both of which were positioned beneath Taurus' crotch. In an act of desperation, the hero reached out something, anything, to grab onto so he could try to pull himself out. He didn't intend to grab onto Taurus' cock, but it turned out to be surprisingly effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny tried her best to keep from laughing as she didn't want to rub salt in the wound for her boyfriend. She managed to hold herself together even after Taurus blew his load all over the hero. Her breaking point came when the hero attempted to crawl away to safety, only to get snatched up and held tightly against Taurus' chest as the orgasm lulled him into a peaceful slumber. She cackled at bizarre image as the Pint Puncher's face burned bright with embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Wong told me that it took ten men to pry him from Taurus' grip\" Tiffany giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you two look real comfy there, Punchy. Are you sure I'm the first supervillain you've gotten with? I didn't break up something special, did I?\" she asked mockingly as she stroked the top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I did watch I had to do in order to get away!\" The Pint Puncher snapped, although he couldn't bare to look either of them in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that, but your boner is telling me a whole different story~\" Shenny snickered. Throughout that whole ordeal, she could feel her boyfriend's cock poking into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. Let's give Punchy a break. It's getting late and I don't wanna end up costing Miss Wong some valuable research time. I'm sure she's not having fun having to deal with Rowland instead of me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny huffed but she couldn't argue with that point. As blunt and unfriendly as Dr. Wong could be, the wolfess wouldn't wish Rowland's company on anyone. Still, she couldn't help but think back to how she felt watching the fight between him and her boyfriend. Were it not for his repugnant personality, she wouldn't hesitate to admit that there she found him rather attractive, her attention focused on his enormous cock. If he were turned to the side of good somehow, she could think of a dozen ways that she and the Pint Puncher could have fun together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shen? You coming to bed or what?\" her boyfriend called from the other room. Tiffany was already on the bed, stripped down from her clothes as she waited for the other to join her. Shenny sighed inwardly and shook the thoughts from her head. The likelihood of Rowland turning over a new leaf was nonexistent, so there was really no point for her to entertain such thoughts. Then again, the same could've been said for her, Tiffany and even Quaker. How many people thought the same thing about them? That they were horrible thugs with no redemptive characteristics to speak of? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n That question resonated with Shenny even as she got into bed and snuggled close to her friend, her boyfriend resting comfortably between them as he was sandwiched between their giant tits. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning the superhero woke up in complete darkness. Soft-furred flesh pressed into him from all sides. Overnight Shenny and Tiffany had gotten a little closer to eachother and the Pint Puncher had gotten lost between their bountiful chests. He thought about struggling free for a moment, but he didn't want to disturb the two titans. Besides, this was almost unreasonably comfortable if it weren't for the pressure. He tried to sneak in another quick nap, but mere minutes later the soft environment stirred. Daylight finally broke in as Shenny shuffled backwards, freeing the hero from his cozy prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany was still asleep and Shenny carefully picked up her boyfriend, leaving the mouse for now. Suddenly she noticed that the phone she'd left on the nightstand had several messages. The wolfess didn't read them, but she saw the sender. Dr. Wong apparently needed them, and if she left this many messages it might be an emergency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiff... Tiff! Wake up! I think Dr. Wong is in trouble!\" She said, a tinge of panic in her voice. Though the giant mouse was about the only part of the I.S.E.A. that Shenny really cared about, she couldn't sit idle if there was an emergency over there. With the number of captured villains in that facility a breakout would be disastrous. The wolfess hurried to put on her superhero attire whilst the Pint Puncher helped push the giant mouse onto her feet. In no time the three were ready, running to the edge of town before walking briskly down the main road. Traffic dispersed almost immediately as the citizens seemed to have turned clearing the roads into a routine whenever these giants show up. In the distance was the facility and mercifully it still appeared to be in one piece. No ruins or columns of smoke in sight. The heroic trio began to wonder what was causing such a stir if everyone looked normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, you've arrived. I was about ready to sound the alarm.\" Dr. Wong said, her voice sounding deflated and exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay doc, we're here. Now what's the big emergency? Did someone escape?\" The superhero had flown in through a window, carrying Shenny and Tiffany, both down to more human sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Escape? It's worse! You walked right in!\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Wait, what are you talking about?\" The superhero's brow was about ready to hit the ceiling. But in the pit of his stomach he felt he knew exactly what was about to happen. He began to blush a little bit already, fearing the spectacle they were about to witness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over a billion dollars in the finest security systems and you just barged in pretending everything's normal. You said you wanted to see Rowland. By the time we realized what had happened it was too late. This is gonna set us back weeks.\" Dr. Wong lamented, motioning for the heroes to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached Rowland's containment cell they could scarcely believe what they saw. The cougar was huffing and panting, hanging in his restraints. Near the feline's throbbing cock was a familiar white figure. The Pint Puncher stared in annoyed disbelief at the scene, his fears proving entirely correct. One of the escaped clones from last night had made it all the way here and was currently jerking the cougar off. The white spandex was coated thickly in slimy cum, a large pool of the stuff nearly covering the entire floor of Rowland's cell. Shenny and Tiffany exchanged amused giggles as the hero could feel his face redden with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe haggard looking villain looked up, unsurprised to see a second Pint Puncher. He let out a dry laugh before being overwhelmed by another involuntary moan. The clone kept rubbing until he could feel a powerful orgasm surge up from the supervillain's balls. He aimed the large shaft directly at his face and opened his mouth. With a growling moan Rowland shot a thick load of goopy cum right down the clone's throat, the excess splattering into his face. It sprayed all over the cell. Though the cougar's manhood deflated a little, the cum-soaked superhuman barely paused before starting to rub it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pint Puncher... I suppose this is yours?\" The villain let out another short laugh. \"I knew you couldn't resist me forever. But I wonder... which of you two is the real one? The one trying to milk me dry or the one pretending he's not getting turned on by my musk right now?\" The thick glass was enough to contain even the smelliest villains, and there wasn't a hint of the cougar's scent surrounding the Pint Puncher, but the villain could probably see a little bulge in his pants all the same. 'Curse this overactive libido' The hero thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's proven nearly impossible to rehabilitate and this setback has made it even harder.\" The doctor said, exasperated by the lewd display. They all looked at the chained up villain and he gave them a knowing grin. \"Get me something to drink and a little snack, me and Puny Puncher here still got a lot of fun planned ahead of us and I'm almost running on empty.\" Shenny coldly wondered if it were possible for the clone to literally milk the cougar to death. Dr. Wong sighed and turned to the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please get rid of him, will you? Here's some nose plugs, even you will need them.\" She handed the hero the plugs and the mouse gave him the cloning ring. The Pint Puncher nodded and flew to the top of the cell. He walked through the airlock and the ceiling hatch, entering the cell. The musky stink of the pool of cougar cum was so dense the hero could practically lean against it, even with his nose plugged. He braced himself as best he could, hovering down to the clone. It was completely occupied trying to get Rowland back up to full mast. Curious to see if he could spare himself the horror the Pint Puncher tapped the clone on his shoulder with the ring clenched in his fist. Nothing. The superhero let out a deep sigh. He knew that the moment that ring went on his finger he'd be experiencing everything that clone was going through. As well as everything all those other clones were going through. He dreaded to think what they would've done. In one quick motion he slips on the ring, smacks the clone across the face and takes the ring off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero clone disappears in a cloud of white smoke, the caged villain saddened by this development. \"Aw, c'mon man. He wasn't hurting anyone... If nothing else, he's stopped me from harassing the guards for almost all morning. My behaviour has never been this good. Oh well, back to normal... You three just gonna stand there and gawk or are you eager to a turn playing with 'ol Rowland?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Wong grabbed the bridge of her nose in exasperation and suggested the hero hover backwards a little. She slammed a button at the front of the cell and the villain cried out in pain. A little shock to teach him some manners. \"Heh, fine. You don't know what you're missing.\" Rowland mused between coughing up smoke. The hero left the cell and joined the others in returning to Dr. Wong's lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid your trouble with these clones is far from over.\" She stated dryly. The superhero nodded. He only wore the ring for a split second but the broad array of smells and feelings was overwhelming. He couldn't match the jumbled mess of experiences to any specific villains, but it was clear the clones had sought out some of Glam City's worst and offered themselves up. Shenny saw her boyfriend's discomfort and mulled the situation over for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we just let them do their thing?\" She said, finding herself at the center of a crowd of confused looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though I hate to give Rowland credit for anything, he wasn't wrong. If these clones are keeping villains preoccupied by serving them, is that such a bad thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theoretically, no, but unfortunately there might be some other consequences attached.\" The doctor responded, flipping on the TV in the corner of her room. She switched channels until a news broadcast showed up. It showed footage of Helen lazily strolling down main street. She held a leash, a haggard looking naked man following her obediently. His hair was a mess and his body covered in hippo sweat and worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She hasn't endangered or destroyed anything yet... well, except your reputation.\" The doctor said to the Pint Puncher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this fun, Punchy? I can't wait to show these people how eager you are to please me. Just like you did all night long...\" The hippo cackled cheerfully.</span></div></div>",

He didn't get far before getting yanked back by his girlfriend by the collar of his costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a plan, but I can do you one better. How about all three of us go down there <i>together</i>, and drag her fat ass back to the institute?\" Shenny asked placing a hand on her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Nothing personal Punchy, but your track record when it comes to fighting Helen is... splotchy at best\" Tiffany said with a sheepish smile as she patted him on the shoulder. She didn't want to wound his pride, but her words came from a place of concern. Helen touted an impressive number of wins against the hero and she had quite the talent for finding new ways to embarrass him publicly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said anything about fighting? I'm going over there to talk with her. If things go smoothly, maybe we can find some kind of common ground\" the hero said as he pulled himself free from Shenny's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I'm all for you trying the diplomatic approach, but is Helen really the villain you want to try it out on?\" Tiffany asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's too far out of the realm of possibility. I mean, I don't expect her to completely turn over a new leaf overnight, but maybe...\" he said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Above all else, why can't we tag along? Helen's more likely to listen to me and Tiff than you. We <i>did </i>use to be villains after all\" the wolfess added with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I don't need any more eyes being drawn to that horrible display. I want to end this as quietly as possible and having two sexy giants standing in the middle of main street will only succeed in drawing more unwanted attention. I'll go by myself and you ladies can watch me from the monitors. If things start to go south, then you can jump in and help out. Does that sound fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I guess\" Shenny muttered as she folded her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay but... you be careful, alright Punchy?\" Tiffany said softly before sitting down in front of the television screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doc, I need the institute to call in the news station and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're already on it\" the doctor said dismissively. \"You're a representative of the institute so the last thing we need is for you to be seen acting like Helen's pet\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero nodded his thanks and flew in the direction of main street. Already he could feel a sense of dread wash over him as he approached his destination. He talked a good game, but he wasn't sure if he could talk Helen into turning herself in. Helen didn't have any vices that motivated her actions like Shenny or Tiffany. She was just a greedy individual all around. He tried his best to push the doubt out of his mind as he spotted the hippo and his clone in front of an abandoned hotdog stand. She had taken a brief pause from their stroll to get a bite to eat, her pet hero nuzzling her rear lovingly as she blasted fart after fart directly into his face. Like Rowland, she didn't appear the least bit surprised as another Pint Puncher hovered over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Helen...\" he said meekly, his gaze resting on his enslaved clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we have here? Another Pint Puncher? Here do throw yourself at my feet as well?\" Helen asked before swallowing three hotdogs whole and letting out a loud belch. \"No, that can't be the case. You're actually talking to me. If you were here to worship me, you would've gotten onto your knees the first moment you saw me, just like your double here did last night\" she added with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so you knew that wasn't the real me?\" The hero asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I did! I know you love getting put in your place by a strong woman, but you're at least subtle about it. There's no way that you'd just come on out and beg to be my pet\" She said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right... I guess that makes sense...\" the hero muttered. \"So... did you um... have a good time... with him?\" he asked cautiously. He wanted to stay in the villain's good graces and he figured that talking about her escapades with the clone was a good start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we had a wonderful time! As you can plainly see, I have the little fella a full tour of my beautiful body~\" she cooed as she reached back and patted the clone's head. She wasn't exaggerating in the slightest as the Pint Puncher could see that his body was coated in sweat and dried slime. He had introduced to Helen's pussy on more than a few occasions and he recognized the familiar earthy scent as it radiated off of his clone. The hero could only begin to imagine what he experienced under Helen's care. No doubt she had his face buried between those thick, meaty cheeks for hours as she used his face as a seat cushion. Perhaps she used him to clean the sweat from her body using nothing but his tongue; up and down her powerful thighs, along her generous gut, in between the deep chasm that was her cleavage--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what brings you here in the first place? It isn't like you to just stroll on up to your most hated rival and strike up a conversation\" Helen asked curiously as she finished off the last hotdog in the stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What?\" The hero stuttered as he was brought out of his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daydreaming, huh? I can't imagine what about~\" the villain teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher didn't need an explanation to discern what she meant as he could feel the spandex around his crotch growing tight as he was lost in his imagination. His perverted nature had briefly taken root and for a brief moment he almost envied his clone for the treatment he had undergone. He cleared his throat and took a deep breath as he tried to clear his mind of those filthy thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen, I don't mean to cut into your fun but... would you mind taking him someplace else?\" he asked sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, am I not allowed to venture out of my home every now and again? Is that what you're trying to say?\" Helen asked with a tone of mock offense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I'm not saying that! It's just... I see that you're having a good time with my clone and... if it's keeping you from hurting anyone, then I'm more than happy to let you have your fun with him but...\" the hero paused and took a deep breath. \"... I still have a reputation to uphold. I'm not telling you what to do, I'm just asking a favor. Please... don't let people see me like this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen raised a brow as she watched the once proud hero descend onto the ground and bow his head in an act of submission. It was hard to say whether or not his words would take hold, but the fact that she didn't immediately laugh him off and stomp him flat was a positive sign in and of itself. After moment of mulling it over, she spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One submissive slave to pamper me, and another that's a little more fighty for when I want to get rough.\" The greedy hippo smiled from ear to ear. She didn't need to hear the Pint Puncher's answer, cracking her knuckles. The superhero could tell this was about to go south, but he had one last trick up his sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I get you more of them?\" He said with a strangely seductive tone, pointing at the clone. It paid little attention to the conversation, lapping away at Helen's prodigious ass and moaning whenever she farted. The hippo stopped in her tracks, surprised by the offer. \"Think about it. You've already had lots of fun with just one, imagine having a dozen... As long as you keep them in your lair I'll get you all the submissive clones you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, you do know how to tempt a lady. That new girlfriend of yours taught you well.\" Helen replied, smirking broadly as the hero blushed. It wasn't exactly the height of subtlety to see Shenny run about with him wedged in her cleavage. She wondered what it would be like to be served by a dozen Pint Punchers. Their little hands massaging her butt, their tongues eager to taste her pussy. She could even swallow a few so they can spoil her from the inside. The pleasures she would feel at their hands were uncountable. For a while she stood there, daydreaming about it. That little brat's offer was almost too tempting to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero waited patiently, hoping he'd convinced her to take the deal. But deep down in his gut he knew her greed would probably not allow it. Even getting almost everything she wanted was not enough for Helen. He sighed softly when he saw her devious smirk returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your offer is great, but I think I'll take you instead. A slave that can make more slaves sounds like an even greater bit of fun to have. Besides, just between you and me, I have no idea how long this guy's gonna last. I know he's got super endurance like you, but we both know even that has its limits.\" She cooed, malice dripping from her every word. There was only one way this was going to end. Helen grabbed her slave by his arm and pulled him away from her ass. The clone tried to shuffle back to that immense butt, but the hippo commanded him to quit fidgeting and listen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave, you want to make me happy, yes?\" She stated, the clone nodding fiercely. \"Then help me subdue the Pint Puncher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher shuddered as the clone suddenly stared him in the eye, a murderous scowl on his face. Helen stood back as her filth-soaked slave stomped towards the superhero. He'd do anything to please her, even beating up himself. The real superhero prepared put up his fists, ready to square off against the clone. Fighting off one of these copies shouldn't be too difficult, but he had to be vigilant. Helen wasn't one to sit back and let others do the fighting. Especially not when the it meant beating the Pint Puncher into submission. The news crews were still recording, so Shenny and Tiffany probably already saw things had turned bad. The hero grit his teeth. Even if he couldn't beat her outright, if he could just last a few minutes the two titans would be here to make this a very unfair fight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> As expected, the clone's approach to fighting The Pint Puncher was to simply charge forward. He completely lacked the poise and technique of the original hero but that didn't really factor in it's thought process. The only thing on his mind was pleasing his voluptuous owner. Strategy was an alien concept to the simpleminded doppelganger and it showed as he was parried and countered with each lunge. The Pint Puncher didn't so much as break a sweat as he fought his mirror image, though much of his focus was on the villainous hippo we stood watching with an amused smile. Despite the poor performance of her loyal servant, she wasn't the least bit concerned. Whether or not she was just putting on a poker face, the hero couldn't tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, Punchy! Keep on fighting! Do a good job and I'll let give you one of my spare panties~\" the hippo cooed as her hand trailed down to her crotch. That one offer was enough to double the clone's efforts as it began punching at the Pint Puncher with renewed ferocity. The hero continued to parry and dodge but every now and again a blow would connect and stagger the hero. The sheer force of his strikes made it clear that they also shared his super strength along with his super endurance. He couldn't help but feel an iota of pride in his clone's power as he hit harder than most of his past foes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Their fight had the potential to last for hours, but was suddenly cut short as the Pint Puncher was distracted by a familiar noise. Helen let out a belch loud enough to be heard a block away. Instinctively, the hero stopped and braced himself but that opened himself up to being tackled and pinned down by his clone. Helen smiled coyly as she placed a hand on her mouth. She had burped into the sky and away from the the fight; a simple, but effective diversion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me. Hotdogs tend to give me gas~\" she giggled before leisurely strolling over to the captured hero. \"Hold him down nice and tight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Fighting against his clone's grip proved more difficult than the Pint Puncher thought. The devotion he showed towards obeying Helen showed as his already inhuman strength was intensified by the adrenaline running through his body. He could only watch nervously as Helen loomed over him with her hands on her hips. He braced himself for the worst as he expected her to plant her massive ass down onto his face and knock him unconscious with a nonstop barrage of farts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny isn't it? Tiffany didn't believe me when I told her about how much you loved being beaten but here you are, pitching a tent just thinking about all the stuff I plan on doing to you\" she taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero cringed as he followed her gaze down to his crotch and true to her word, his cock was standing firm and pushing against his costume. He looked back at the hippo with narrowed eyes, though he could say nothing in his defense. It wasn't as if she were saying anything he didn't already know, but this was the exact type of scenario he wanted to avoid. He hated giving his enemies even greater leverage to mock him, especially when it was being broadcast for all to witness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why you're making that face. Isn't it so much better being honest with yourself? I'm sure you and Shenny have all sorts of stories to tell\" she giggled before looking behind her. \"Speaking of which, she should be here any minute now. I know you would've be stupid enough to come here trying to bargain without having her on standby... and if I'm a betting girl, I'd say that she was watching all this unfold from the I.S.E.A. building\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher said nothing as he continued to glare at her, though the nervous sweat trickling down his cheek was a dead giveaway. Helen might've been greedy and single minded in his desires, but she was incredibly perceptive. She grinned at his response and leaned down to meet him eye to eye as she smiled brightly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At her max size, that's skill at least a ten minute walk from the building to here. Meaning you and I have nine minutes to play before the calvary arrives...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero's stoic facade broke immediately as Helen slowly pulled her panties down, revealing her enormous, sweat slick rear end for all to see. She didn't have much time, but she didn't seem at all concerned with that as she brought her undergarment to the hero's nose. He recoiled as his senses were thrown into disarray by a combination of potent stenches. The most prominent was the musky scent of Helen's buttcrack but he was also greeted by the heady scent of her pussy. Noxious as it was, it was hard to deny the effects it had over him as he could feel his body growing warm, the blood flowing his cock and causing it to throb with need. From above him his clone whimpered and moaned, envious of the treatment the hero was receiving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, Punchy. You'll get your reward soon enough\" Helen said softly as she patted the clone's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The clone pouted, but acquiescence to his master's whims as he nuzzled into her hand affectionately. It pained the Pint Puncher to watch himself feed into Helen's influence, even when it wasn't really him. Every demeaning action his sycophantic clone undertook reminded the hero of what he could potentially become should he give into his sexual urges. For the time being however, his attention was focused on Helen as she moved the clone out the way and tossed her panties to the side. His eyes went wide as watched Helen turn her back to him, her massive ass looming mere inches away from his face. Without her usual taunting or ceremony she dropped down onto him, completely encasing his head in between two walls of sweaty hippo ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She grinned as she looked between the hero's legs and watched as the tent grew dark at the tip. She had intended to gas the him into unconsciousness and take him back to her lair, but it was hard to focus with such a distracting sight in front of her. She nudged it once with her foot, forcing a muffled groan out of the hero as his body trembled with desire. He wasn't the only one hungry for release as she could feel her crotch growing wetter and wetter as she rubbed her ass back and forth along his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... maybe there's a bit more time for fun...\" she muttered as she continued to eye his crotch. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hippo felt her victim squirm and shudder with every loud fart she blew in his face. It made her pussy wetter than ever. Normally it was just the hero that got turned on by this, but after all the fun she had with the clone, maybe she was lusting after the real thing more than she cared to admit. Every second counted for the vile hippo and after one last noxious squeaker of a fart she stood up, pulling the hero's head free from her sweaty asscheeks. She hadn't knocked him out completely yet, but he was so dazed he just laid there as she turned around, looming over him threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the way I like them... submissive and begging for more.\" She said, her voice wavering under her own mounting lust. The Pint Puncher's suit was torn open just enough to reveal his throbbing boner. It stood up like a monument to his desire. Helen laughed briefly before sitting herself down. Her large frame engulfed the hero's legs and her pussy swallowed up his manhood. It was like pushing a hotdog down a train tunnel, but the hippo didn't care. She'd been doing this to the clone several times over last night, but there was something far more satisfying about having the original at her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher moaned and gasped, his head swimming in the powerful stench of Helen's feminine musk. His cock was assailed from all sides by her inner walls. They squeezed, rubbed and pulled at his length, desperate to plunge it even deeper into her. But the hero was already in up to the hilt. Even the hippo's pussy seemed possessed by her trademark greed. It felt so large all around his manhood. In that moment he had no doubt that Helen would be able to emulate Shenny and fit his whole body in there, though that may just be the musk hazing his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monstrous hips held the hero firmly in place as Helen leaned forward, her rotund belly slowly smothering more and more of the Pint Puncher's torso until only his head still poked out from underneath the flabby mass. Her hefty chest stopped her from looking the hero in the eyes, but she knew the lost and happy expression that would be on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying yourself down there?\" She cooed lovingly. His answer was a shameful climax, a tiny rush of warmth into the hippo's sexual embrace. Helen moaned loudly, her own orgasm not far behind. She beckoned for the clone to get closer. He eagerly obeyed his master and rushed towards the scene. When he was in arm's reach the hippo grabbed him by the throat and pulled him into an overwhelming kiss. The clone held onto her head as her lips smothered most of his face and her tongue was given free reign. Helen was in heaven, molesting two Pint Punchers at once. The sheer bliss of her brutality finally pushed her over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher felt the villain's body shudder and quake as she unleashed a warm, slimy torrent all over his crotch. Helen gasped and moaned, throwing the clone aside and feeling the familiar rush of pleasure washing over her. She could feel the little manhood inside her deflate a little. Clarity began to return to her and a tinge of panic set in. It wouldn't be long before his reinforcements arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither Shenny or Tiffany was already a formidable challenge for the hippo. Together the two of them would be nearly insurmountable. Helen did not fancy the risk of putting her skills to the test against the two. Especially after what she'd done to Shenny's boyfriend. Discretion was the better part of valor and it was time to lay low until those titanic spoilsports had left the area. She got up, leaving the hero on the floor in a pool of her release. But as she stepped back and saw the hero conflict started to brew in her mind. She had him practically unconscious already. Was she really going to just leave a golden opportunity like that behind? She was reasonably confident that if she left him there the two titans would care more about retrieving their hero than chasing her down. But at the same time she had felt just how much fun could be had in a mere five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen's greed and better judgement duked it out before she finally made a decision. She would take the chance and grabbed the hero off the floor. Then a devious thought sprang up. Maybe she could use the hero to protect her against her pursuers. Smiling widely at her own cunning the hippo lifted the hero up and opened her maw wide. His dangling legs hit her tongue and with a quick gulp he was trapped up to his waist down her gullet. The Pint Puncher barely recognized what was happening, the farts and sex from earlier clouding his mind. It wasn't until he had sank down her throat that he realized what had happened. One final gulp sealed the deal and Helen proudly patted her big belly. Shenny and Tiffany wouldn't want to hurt their precious boyfriend. The clone just stood and gawked at the display, stroking his manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo could hear heavy footsteps far in the distance. Time was running out. She grabbed the clone and unceremoniously wedged him deep between her asscheeks. With two Pint Punchers secured she ran down the nearest alleyway. The most high-stakes game of hide and seek in the hippo's life had just started.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> It took a moment for the Pint Puncher to gather himself and access his surroundings. The panic that he normally felt was no where to be seen as he calmly tucked his legs in an attempt to make himself comfortable. Helen had no intention finishing him off, that much he was certain of. Her momentary lapse in judgement illustrated just how dead set she was on making him her slave, although he couldn't but think that there was more to it than she was letting on. Helen's actions over the years had ranged from cruel to extremely perverse, but this was the first time he could recall her ever engaging him in such a direct manner. She derived sexual gratification from beating him down and using him as a plaything, but there was an uncharacteristic sincerity in her voice when she spoke to him; almost as if his enjoyment was a factor in her normally self-serving mind.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n That thought was oddly amusing to the hero as he sat in her stomach, his nose curling at the odor surrounding him. Circumstances had caused yet another one of his foes to pine for him, though he wasn't sure if this was to his benefit or not. Shenny was driven by her insatiable sexual appetite, Tiffany was spurned by an intense inferiority complex, and Quaker wanted to be revered. Winning them over was a matter of appealing to their motives but he wasn't certain if he could do the same with Helen. Greed was her primary motivator and it made her rather hard to converse with. No offer he could extend to her would be good enough and that much was made clear when she rejected his generous proposal to make more clones for her to play with. Still, there was still some hope in his mind that he could end all of this as amicably as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n While he was reflecting on his predicament, his captor was doing all she could to keep from getting caught by the two giants. She had journeyed fair from her lair in order to show off her new pet, so she had quite a bit of ground to cover in order to stay hidden. She ducked into an alleyway and managed to squeeze her large body into the nearest manhole. This situation was nothing new for her, as she was accustomed to having to flee from the law on the rare occasion when her repertoire of moves proved ineffective. As a result, the cunning villainess endeavored to thoroughly memorize the layout of Glam City in order map out any and all potential escape routes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sewer should keep Shenny from sniffing me out. Now lets get you home before you end up digested, shall we?\" Helen said with a chuckle as she she patted her generous gut. That was easier said than done as every movement she made jostled him around her stomach. He couldn't even begin to count the amount of times Helen had managed to swallow him whole, but usually that was done with the intention of doing away with him. He always managed power on through and escape her clutches, though this time around he opted keep still. He trusted Helen to be true to her word in retrieve him before her stomach acids reduced him to nothing. Even as his costume was being eaten away, he remained absolutely calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After what felt like hours, he was finally freed from his uncomfortable surroundings. He feared that she would release him through the backdoor (as had been the case more often than he would like to admit), but that concern was quickly culled when he was suddenly launched upward towards her throat. Helen propelled the hero out of her stomach with a powerful belch, sending him flying out of her mouth and tumbling onto one of the many money piles she had strewn about her lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to excuse the mess. I wasn't expecting another guest so I haven't had time to get this place nice and tidy\" Helen said as she reached back and yanked the clone free from her buttcheeks. Glancing back at him she smirked when she saw a small trail of cum seeping from the crack of her ass. \"Really Punchy? You couldn't hold it in for ten minutes?\" she scolded playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The clone simply responded with a smile as he obediently sat in place, eagerly awaiting his promised reward for subduing the Pint Puncher. Rolling her eyes, Helen reached into her cleavage and retrieved her panties. The clone's eyes went wide at the mere sight of his, his spent member growing hard in an instant. Helen waved them to and fro, watching with glee as his eyes followed it as though he were a starving man eyeing a turkey leg. The moment it left her hand he pounded on it, grabbing it right out of the air and burying his nose into the crotch of the fabric and breathing deep. With that taken care of, Helen turned her attention to her newest acquisition. To her surprise the hero had yet to jump to his feet. He lounged back against her ill-gotten goods, watching the hippo with mild curiosity. His lack of concern was... unnerving, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem awfully calm for someone who's just been kidnapped\" Helen said with a raised brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I'm just curious to see how this is going to play out\" the hero said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How quickly we forget! Remember, from this day forward you're my my little slave making machine~\" she cooed as she reached down and pinched his cheek. The hero frowned and struggled to keep his comments to himself. All that time spent in Helen's stomach was spent thinking of a way to get out of this without coming to blows. As much as he hated it, he decided to play nice for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" he asked with a sigh as he leaned back. \"I'm a little disappointed, Helen. After that last little romp with had, I thought we really had something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cute Puny Puncher, but let's not kid ourselves. A lady like me needs a <i>real</i> man to satisfy her. You may be a big deal among humans, but you just don't measure up to my kind\" Helen taunted as she patted the top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't saying that when you had me inside you\" the hero retorted with a confident grin. \"From where I was, you looked plenty satisfied\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen's constant smirk faltered ever-so-slightly. She wanted to brush his comments aside but it was hard to refute them when she had taken the time to have sex with him before escaping. That lapse of judgement could've lead to trouble for her, but she was blinded by overwhelming lust. She winced slightly as the hero so to his feet and walked over her, wrapping an arm around around her expansive waist as he looked at her with a confident smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me wrong, I'm certainly not complaining. I've never considered myself much of a catch, but having the attention of attractive women makes me feel good. And know better than anyone else how much I like strong women\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen stared down at him with a bemused smirk, her arms crossing beneath her massive chest. She was no fool. This flirtation was just another thinly veiled attempt to try and talk her down. He might've been able to sway the likes of Quaker and Tiffany, but she was an entirely different prospect. Still, she was too curious not to humor him. She reached down and placed a hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you've got another offer for me Puncher, let's hear it. There's no need to embarrass yourself like this\" she snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Offer?\" the hero asked with a laugh. \"No, this isn't an offer. Consider it more... an appeal\" he said cryptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? An appeal for <i>what</i> exactly?\" she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to make that moment we shared into something much more. If you want a harem of clones waiting after you hand and foot, that's fine by me. I'll be your clone slave factory for as long as you'd like, but I'd much rather take on a more... hands on role\" he said softly as his hand trailed along her inner thigh, sender shivers through Helen's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... not really up for discussion, little man. You're... you're just here to... make more clones...\" Helen trailed off as she felt a familiar hunger surging up from below. The hero could practically feel the heat radiating from her privates. Seizing the opportunity, he hovered up to Helen's face and stared deeply in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To hell with the clones. You have me now\" he said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Any sense of restraint left Helen right then and there as she brought the hero in for a tight embrace, immediately bringing him in for a wet, sloppy kiss the hero shuddered as his face was completely smothered by her massive lips, her heavy tongue battering his face and as her hot breath washed over him. His ploy had worked better than expected, as he had hoped to goad her into giving into her lust yet again. Little did she know, he had already called in backup. As shoddy as her inventions were, Dr. Wong was the type of person who always wanted to keep track of where they were. After his giant lovers failed to find him or Helen, the doctor would lead them on the right path using the built in tracker installed on the ring. All he had to do was keep Helen busy until they got there. He just hoped that they arrived before Helen decided to do anything... raunchier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Almost as if on cue, the Helen carried the hero into her opulent bedchambers and tossed him onto the triple reinforced bed she had sent up. He wasn't given any time to get comfortable before she was on him again, straddling his waist before ripping her bra off and tossing it to the side, letting her giant breast spill free from their tight confinement. The Pint Puncher swallowed nervously at the almost crazed look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me what you got, little man~\" she growled as she ripped the remains of his costume off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>T-they should be here any minute now... come on guys, hurry up...!</i>, the hero thought with growing desperation. Helen liked to play rough, so he dreaded to think how aggressive she would be when she was in such a sex-crazed state of mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The horny hippo straddled her new toy, his body wedged loosely between her thick thighs but spared the brutal weight of her flabby mass. As terrifying as it all looked, the Pint Puncher was on full mast, his tip brushing up against the swaying undercarriage of the villain. Every second drove Helen wilder with lust until she simply let herself drop down. In an instant his cock disappeared into her cavernous pussy as the impact knocked the air from his lungs. Sweat began to bead on his forehead. Where was his rescue? They should be here by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen was completely absorbed by the moment. She used her reinforced bed to bounce herself up and down, pounding the hero in ways she'd never done before. With every hop his cock nearly escaped her pussy completely, only to be forced back in up to the hilt in mere moments. She could feel the superhero flattening beneath her and it only drove her to bounce harder. She would take this opportunity to its very limits before anyone could try to stop her. Whatever would happen next, this was going to be worth it. Right now she'd keep smashing herself into him until his groin was as flat as the bedsheets. But before these cruel plans could come to fruition Helen got bored of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cum for me you little pervert.\" She commanded, stopping her bouncing and feeling his throbbing shaft inside her. It wasn't much, but her sensitive folds were still delighted by the attention. \"If your cheap knock-off of a clone can do it, you've got no excuse.\" She kept goading. Finally she felt a tiny spurt of warmth erupt from him. She pouted at first before shooting the superhero an angry glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all? One little squirt? You had plenty of time to recharge your batteries in my belly. You're not getting out of this bed until I'm satisfied, Punchy. Now do it right!\" She huffed indignantly. Even his clone wasn't tuckered out this quickly. It just kept going all night long. Maybe she needed to change her approach. Squashing him flat with her big bouncy butt could perhaps damage his performance. The cruel hippo flung herself around, laying on her back with the hero between her legs. She brought her monstrously thick flabby thighs together around him, pushing his cock as deep into her as possible and locking him in place. Only his head and shoulders poked out from between the two large thighs, his arms pinned to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher shuddered as he felt the hippo's pussy attempting to milk him, squeezing and relaxing all around his manhood. He moaned involuntarily, his tormentor ratcheting up the pressure. It felt like she was trying to crush him flat enough to fit the rest of his body into her pussy as well. But as profoundly arousing as that thought was, he belonged in Shenny's pussy, if only because his girlfriend didn't need to pulverize his body to fit first. Speaking of his girlfriend, where the hell was she?! Suddenly a wave of relief washed over the hero as his sensitive ear caught a most welcome sound: the thump of heavy footsteps in the distance. They were getting close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny and Tiffany tiptoed through the narrow streets. The mouse was on her phone, getting instructions from Dr. Wong, whilst the wolfess used her keen sense of smell to try and find her boyfriend. Failing that, a building that stank of Helen would do fine too. She was ready to tear that fat hippo's lair to splinters, but she couldn't just start ripping up warehouses until she was certain she'd found the right one. The Pint Puncher didn't work this hard to get her on the right path only for her to throw it away in a fit of rage. Though when she would find him, the wolfess had some choice words ready for her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way.\" Tiffany said, pointing at a cluster of disheveled looking warehouses. Dr. Wong was giving her directions, though for all her academic knowledge, navigation was not one of her strong suits. Though whenever the mouse got testy with her she could expect and earful about how hard it is to fit this kind of tracking equipment into a damn ring. With a few ups and downs the two giants were now getting tantalizingly close to Helen's infamous lair. the I.S.E.A. had been looking for it for years. Not just to retrieve all the stolen valuables, but also to learn how the hippo kept it hidden so well. Shenny huffed at the thought. If they could find anything in the shattered ruins she was about to leave behind she'd be impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen felt the hero's throbbing shaft edge closer to another climax when a low, distant thump caught her attention. Then another, closer this time. She was confused at first, but quickly things fell into place. Suddenly the hero's easygoing attitude, the lack of escape attempts, the willingness to fuck her, it all made sense. Okay, the last one was still a bit much, even for the Pint Puncher, but the rest of the facts turned her face bright red with fury. Shenny and Tiffany were coming straight for her lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were just distracting me! You had a tracking device on you! You led those two dumbasses straight here! Son of a BITCH!\" She cursed loudly, her thighs upping the pressure by a thousandfold. The realization that she'd been caught out and her lair was about to be discovered made her blood boil. \"Well I hope they'll be happy to find your fucking corpse!\" Helen spat. The hero sputtered, his pinned body unable to provide anything else as it was crushed between the hippo's thighs. Even her pussy seemed out for blood, squeezing his member as harshly as possible. It proved to be the final push the hero needed and his manhood blew another load, only enraging Helen further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You evil little bastard! I'm gonna melt your fucking face off!\" She leaned in, her belly rumbling as her maw came as close as possible to his face. She was about to unleash her most vile, corrosive belch ever at point blank range. But before she could execute the superhero a deafening rumble shook the whole building. Large digits tore through the bedroom ceiling, grabbing it and casting it aside. Stood towering over the hippo was Shenny, her eyes burning with murderous rage. Helen had to act fast or she would end up in the same state as her bedroom ceiling. Suddenly a glint caught her eye. Amidst the discarded scraps of white spandex, a ring. That must've been how they tracked her. But more importantly, was that how the hero planned to make more clones? It was her only shot at getting out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo leapt onto her feet, making a desperate dive for the ring. The superhero was discarded like a used tissue, his mostly flattened form falling to the ground like a ragdoll. He'd need a few minutes to put himself back together, but mercifully his girlfriend had arrived before things got deadly. He smiled, his aching crushed body not letting him do much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny reaches in to grab the hippo and punish her, but Helen ducks underneath the grasping digits, rolling across the floor. She hops back onto her feet and shows off her prize: the cloning ring. She wedges the small band on her little pinky. Now she just had to figure out how to create a squad of Helens to fight off these titanic attackers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Helen had no idea how to operate the ring but that she wouldn't let a detail like that stop her. No gadget was beneath her understanding, even something as complicated as a cloning ring. She didn't have much time to try and experiment though as Shenny was dead set on delivering her usual brand of justice. The villainous hippo managed to dip and dodge the hands, sweat pouring off her enormous body as she was forced to keep moving. She concentrated on the the ring, hoping that her thoughts alone would trigger its power but nothing happened. It was only when she saw Tiffany's hands coming towards her that she figured it out. In a moment of desperation, she threw her hands out to try and fend off her impending capture only to find herself in an entirely location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It took a second for Helen to realize what happened, but she quickly noticed that she wasn't in Tiffany's grip. She turned around and was astonished to see that she had teleport ten feet away from Tiffany's waiting hands. Not only that, but another Helen stood where she once was, her expression mirroring the blank look that the Pint Puncher clone had when it first approached her. A silence filled the air as all eyes rested on the clone as no one was sure what to make of this new development. Shenny was the first to act, realizing the potential threat that had just been introduced. One Helen was no problem for her, but an army of Helens was an entirely different proposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen seemed to reach the same epiphany as her mouth stretched into a sinister grin. Before Shenny could reach down and incapacitate her, Helen began pointing the ring in all directions, sporadically teleporting around her lair and leaving a clone behind each time. The lair was soon filled with dozens of her clones, each of them looking around as they gradually began to develop sentience. The Pint Puncher watched everything unfold with a look of concern. It had taken some time for his clones to grow in such a way, but for Helen it took only minutes. He could only wonder what would happen next, given the erratic nature of his own clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not looking so cocky now, huh? Ladies, I want you to... uh...\" Helen tried to maintain her usual confident attitude, but she suddenly found it hard as she was overwhelmed by so many odd sensations. She knew nothing of the complicated neural network that kept her tethered to her clones and how the effects stacked up with each one. \"Go... get them...\" Helen ordered as she staggered back against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny flinched as the small army of Helen's turned their attention over to her. She began thinking of a plan of attack, expecting them to come charging at her any moment. As strong as the wolfess was, even <i>she</i> was apprehensive at the thought of dealing with the combined potency of Helen's gas. Much to her surprise, the clones turned their attention away from her with a shared look of disinterest. Their eyes scanned the room for something of interest and soon enough their collective gaze rested on one person: the lone Pint Puncher clone. He sat in the corner of the room draped in Helen's panties, completely uninterested in the events unfolding around him. At the sight of him, one of Helen's copies surprised everyone by speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine!\" she shouted suddenly as she ran over to him. The Helen copies followed suit, surrounding the clone with looks of unabated lust. The clone that had spoke snatched him up abruptly, snatching the panties off of his head and bringing him in for a sloppy kiss. The real Helen watched the display in a mixture of confusion and embarrassment. Given her prior experience with the Pint Puncher's clone, she expected her copies to focus their energy on serving her. It all the more confusing by the sudden wave of intensive pleasure that she felt as she could somehow feel the hero's lips pressing against hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop! What're you d-doing?!\" She cried. Her protests were silenced as she felt the familiar sensation of the clone's cock penetrating her. Her copies made good use of the Pint Puncher's clone, one mounting him from above, one sitting on his face, and two being fisted by the hero's enthusiastic doppelganger. She bit down on her lip, trying to maintain an air of control only to drop down onto the ground moaning in euphoric bliss. The Pint Puncher looked over at Helen was a look of sympathy before walking over and sitting down beside her. Helen looked up at him, unable to maintain her initial anger at his deception as she struggled to keep her wits about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... why...?\" she managed to squeak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably should've told you. The cloning ring is a prototype, so the clones they produce have a few... kinks to them. All they knew how to do is act on impulse\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen's face contorted as she processed this information. If that was indeed the case, then that would mean that her clones prioritized having sex with the Pint Puncher over potentially defeating the intruder in their midst. Thinking back on her previous actions, it made sense: when put in a situation where time was of the essence, she put her safety at risk just for a quick round of sex. It pained her to think that someone like the Pint Puncher managed to seduced her, but there was no other way of examining the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Watching her conflicted expression, the hero couldn't help but empathize with her. No doubt, her sudden lust for him was formed by all the fun she had with his clone. In a way, her story mirrored his in regards to how he was conditioned to pine for Shenny. He remembered being ashamed for having such intense sexual desire for someone he perceived as irredeemable. He tried to think of a way to make the hippo feel better but his focus quickly shifted on her clones as he heard one of them pipe up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine...\" She murmured as she looked over at the hero. He swallowed nervously as she began to approach him with a gaggle of other clones. From where he stood he could see his own clone, his eyes almost rolled in the back of his head, his body covered in various fluids and his face frozen in sex-drunk smile. He shivered at the thought of sharing his fate and looked back down at Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I know that you're going through some stuff right now and I feel for you, but could you do me a favor and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up... I know...\" Helen muttered as she struggled to her feet, her legs still wobbly from experiencing multiple orgasms via her copies. \"How... how do I get rid of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just have to touch them with the ring\" he explained as he backed way from the approaching group of Helens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen wasn't in that much of a hurry to get rid of her clones, especially when it was done at the behest of her most hated rival. That said, she couldn't stomach the sight of her own clones. They were a reflection of a part of her that she wasn't comfortable with and the sooner they were gone, the better. They were driven with such intense lust that they didn't even so much as blink when Helen banishing them. Only one managed to get by her, quickly approaching the hero and lifting him up into her arms. The clone smiled at him lovingly, licking her plump lips before she gave him a quick peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine~\" she cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was then that Helen came up from behind and angrily slapped her clone on the back with her ring hand, letting the hero drop onto the hard cold floor as it disappeared in a puff of smoke. Once all of her clones were gone, she walked back over to her reinforced bed and sat down with her head buried in her hands. So much had happened in such a short amount of time and it gave her a splitting headache. The Pint Puncher cleared his throat as he walked over and sat down beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. This is the part where you and your giant girlfriend haul me off to the institute, right?\" she asked coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less\" he replied sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Just get it over with\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero nodded, although he was hesitant to act. The whole reason he had gone through all of this was to see if he could make an appeal to his arch nemesis. Watching Shenny transition from an city destroying juggernaut to a noble champion of justice had endowed the hero with a sense of empathy for his foes and seeing Helen in such a dejected state made him feel bad. He looked around her lair, eyeing all of the stolen goods she had acquired over a period of time. Were he to let Helen go, he was certain that the institute would cut their losses if he returned all the items and money she had pilfered. It seemed unlikely given her notorious greed, but something told him that she wasn't in the mood to be picky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He looked up at his girlfriend and Tiffany who both seemed to grasp his intentions. Shenny was none to pleased at him thinking the situation over and Tiffany looked concerned as she didn't want her friend to potentially lose her cool and do something that she would later regret. After a moment of thought the Pint Puncher stood to his feet and patted Helen on the shoulder.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hero got on his feet and motioned for Helen to follow. It'd be nice if they could hand in one villain that wasn't soaked in pussy juices or butt sweat. She looked up to Shenny's angry glare and Tiffany's mildly concerned expression. Helen could feel herself getting emotional, but she didn't want any of them to see it. With as much indifference as she could muster she addressed the hero again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we cut a deal or something? There's gotta be something stashed here that'd make you look the other way? I promise I'll lay low for a while. And I won't let the clone outside the building anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three heroes raised an eyebrow. Even the clone, still laid out on the floor and covered in ten Helens worth of sexual fluids, looked up in shock. The Pint Puncher never expected the greed-fueled hippo to even suggest parting with her hoard of wealth. But at this point in time there wasn't really much to barter anymore. He'd experienced first-hand how quickly her greed could escalate. He couldn't risk putting the city in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Helen, but I got to keep the city safe.\" He said, the slightest tinge of doubt in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't make me do this...\" The hippo replied, sounding unsteady. The hero braced himself and Shenny clenched her fists, ready to squash Helen if she tried anything funny. \"Make you do what?\" The Pint Puncher asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me beg you.\" The hippo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take me back to that place, please. I really don't want to go back there.\" Helen put on her best puppy eyes, but none of the heroes were buying it. The superhero was puzzled why she seemed so scared though. The hippo wasn't one to scare easily. What has happened in the Institute to warrant this kind of response?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't leave you roaming around freely, and there's no other place to hold you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take me with you.\" The hippo said, surprising everyone. \"As a prisoner, I'll stay in whatever cage you have for me, as long as it's not in the Institute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny groaned, seeing her boyfriend seriously milling over the hippo's suggestion. Sometimes it felt like she was the only voice of reason around here. And knowing her background, that was saying something. She pointed an accusatory finger at the hippo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why should we trust you? The last time Punchy trusted you, you molested him, kidnapped him and then immediately molested him again! Don't try and deny that, I caught you literally in the middle of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I step out of line in any way, you can punt me straight over to the I.S.E.A... Literally if you want to.\" The hippo replied hastily. The towering wolfess chuckled a bit at the mental image of kicking Helen so hard she'd fly all the way from her home in the woods to the Institute, crashing through the wall and into a cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting crazy. Why don't you like the Institute?\" The Pint Puncher interjected. He'd worked for them ever since he got his superpowers and this was unlike anything he'd expected. Most villains were annoyed to be beaten and sent off, but the hippo seemed... scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do experiments on everyone these days. I don't know precisely what they're planning and to what end, but I think they're trying to harness our powers for themselves.\" The hippo took the cloning ring off and threw it at the hero's feet. He didn't know what to make of this new information. He wouldn't have given it another thought before. The villains that routinely squashed, ate or fucked him get experimented on, big deal. But after managing to free Shenny and Tiffany from their villainous ways this suddenly didn't sit so well with him. If there was any hope of redemption for Helen, it would be dashed if she were to be put back in the Institute's cells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think having me as your warden will be better?\" Shenny said with a devious growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even being your sex toy beats going back to that place.\" Helen replied, catching all of the heroes by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not joking... are you?\" The Pint Puncher asked in a sympathetic voice. He could see a small tear well up in the hippo's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell 'em that you're keeping me at Shenny's place to try and get me to join your side or something. They'll believe you.\" The desperate villain turned to him, stopping just short of falling to her knees. \"Just please don't put me back in the Institute.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  At the end of the day, only one person could sign off on such a decision. All eyes turned over to Shenny, much to her annoyance. As much as she trusted her boyfriend, she knew that he had a habit of either thinking with his dick or thinking with his heart, and on rare occasions both. He put himself into so much trouble just to try and see if he could talk things out with Helen and after all she had witnessed, Shenny wasn't sure if she could trust him to think things through. She looked down at Helen wordlessly, raising a brow at the tenseness in her expression. It was unusual to see the normally unflappable queen of crime looking so uneasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She thought it over to for a minute before sighing and placing her hands on her hips. As much as she bemoaned her boyfriend's endless capacity to forgive, she wasn't too far behind in that respect. Granted, she was still quite sore at Helen for what she had pulled not twenty minutes ago, but she was somewhat intrigued by the prospect of helping a villain clean up their act like she did. Of course, she didn't intend to make it easy for the hippo. Helen felt a lump form in her throat as Shenny reached down and yanked her off her feet by the nape of her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're willing to be my sex toy, huh? I don't think you know just what you're getting yourself into, miss. Ask Punchy. He can give you an idea of how demanding I am in the bed\" she said with a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher kept silent, though prominent blush and his sheepish smile spoke volumes. Helen certainly didn't need to be reminded of Shenny's intense sexual appetite. In the past she would bare witness to the wolfess' horny rampages through Glam City with greet enthusiasm. With all of that pent up energy focused onto her, suddenly it didn't seem so funny in hindsight. Shenny was pleased to see the doubt and fear beginning to take shape on Helen's face as she brought her face to face with her drooling love tunnel. Truth be told, she wasn't too enticed by her offer as she knew that no one person could satisfy her as much as her boyfriend, but there was some catharsis in using the pudgy hippo as her sex toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burn this sight into your memory, because you're gonna be seeing it a lot!\" she said with a grin. She gave Helen a moment to drink the sight in before unceremoniously plunging the hippo face first into her pussy. She shuttered at the strange new feeling, shivers running down her back as she felt Helen's thick body fighting against her tightening inner walls. Helen wasn't the largest thing the wolfess had ever shoved into her, but she was by far the largest living being to have entered her cavernous snatch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just squirm! Use your tongue!\" Shenny ordered, momentarily taking on her old villainous persona. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen could hear her command reverberating all around her and it only compounded her misery. As humiliating as she found this whole ordeal, she did all she could to appease the horny giant as she licked away at her surroundings, wincing as she forced herself to stomach the taste of Shenny's pungent slime. It was either this or going back to the institute to be poked and prodded ad nauseam. Her compliance didn't go unnoticed as Shenny moaned in delight with every lap of her tongue. It didn't quite measure up to the Pint Puncher, but it was a wonderful sensation all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It didn't take long for Shenny to cum as she was still quite sensitive from the night prior. The force of her orgasm was still powerful to push Helen's thick body out of her pussy and down onto her reinforced bed. She groaned as the smell of Shenny's pussy still surrounded her, no doubt seeping into her expensive linen sheets. Not that it really mattered, as she was certain that they had no intention of letting her keep it since she bought it with stolen money. Shenny gave her a moment to recover before snatching her up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get comfortable now. You're not even close to done with your daily duties\" Shenny growled as she leered at the hippo with hungry eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Daily?\" Helen whimpered with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. All day, everyday. If you do a really good job, I might be generous and give you half an hour to recuperate before I shove you into one of my holes! Speaking of which, I think it's about time that I show you where all your time and energy is going to be spent\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen's heart sank as she was brought back to Shenny's colossal ass, her nose curling at the subtle musk emitting from her crack. The irony of this scenario wasn't lost on her in the slightest and for the first time in her entire life, she felt what could only be described as a small ping of empathy for the Pint Puncher. After all of the times she had buried the his face into her ass and forced him to service it, this was most definitely a fitting punishment. Before things could escalate any further, the Pint Puncher spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Shenny. I think she's had enough\" he said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The wolfess rolled her eyes and sighed, her hungered expression dropping almost instantly as she dumped Helen's body back onto the bed. She had no intention of following up on her threat and she really wasn't all that interested in Helen sexually,  but she got a great deal of satisfaction from having someone as proud as Helen working to please her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen,\" the Pint Puncher began as he walked up to the gasping hippo. \"I know how hard it can be to put your trust into someone you've been feuding with for so long but I really do have your best interests at heart. I'm willing to keep the I.S.E.A. out of this, but I'm not sure if you sticking around our home is such a good idea\" he said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen frowned and looked away from him to hide the tears that were beginning to form in the corner of her eyes. She certainly didn't like the idea of being Shenny's plaything, but at least it would grant her more freedom than being a guinea pig. She hoped that the Pint Puncher's noble nature would allow him to look past his loyalty towards them, but that didn't appear to be the case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may make a suggestion?\" Tiffany piped up quietly, wincing as all eyes turned towards her. \"As of late, the Institute has been very vocal about all the work that Shenny and I have been putting in, so much so that they're seriously considering a recruitment drive for anthros. I've heard Dr. Wong speak highly of your scientific knowledge in the past, so maybe you can get a job working as her partner!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two things wrong with that. First of, I rarely manufacture my own tech. I use the money I steal to pay other eggheads to make it for me. Second, I'd rather chomp down on a brick than work for that hellhole!\" Helen snapped bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To answer your first point, your homemade tech still manages to be on par with that of a multi-billion dollar facility, so that fact alone makes you more than qualified. As for your second point... well, I can't really blame you for feeling the way you feel. I wasn't too big on the place myself at first... but things have changed since the last time you've been there. Ever since Punchy got Shenny to change her ways, they've been putting policies in place to make sure that our rights aren't being violated\" Tiffany explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen's skepticism was quite evident as she furrowed her brow at the chipper mouse. The last time she was locked up in the Institute, she didn't stick around long enough to really take in all the changes that had taken place. It didn't help that she made it her business to be as much of a hindrance to them as possible, using her keen wit to find knew ways to torment the staff whenever the opportunity presented itself. That said, she still was reluctant to put her trust into the I.S.E.A. after her past experiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you really don't want to take up Tiff's offer, than I guess I can let you crash at my place for a while...\" Shenny said with a sigh as she folded her arms. \"Let me make one thing very clear though: if you so much as <i>look </i>at Punchy in a way I don't care for, that place is going to seem like a safe haven by the time I'm finished with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen knew Shenny well enough to understand that that was no idle threat. She was feared for her volatile temper long before she became a hero and she had proven herself able to channel her villainous nature in a heartbeat. The conflicted hippo took a moment to ponder her options while the three heroes patiently awaited her response. As thought it over, her ever loving pet clone hobbled over to her and rested his head onto lap, somehow sensing the stress that his master was going through. His presence brought her a small bit of comfort and after thinking it over for a few minutes, she finally came to a conclusion. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'll come with you.\" Helen said, her voice heavy with resignation as she pointed at the wolfess. All three heroes were shocked, but the hippo was quick to elaborate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything is better than the Institute, even being used as your damn toy every day.\" The hippo spat. She wasn't happy with her future, but if it meant not having to go back to her old cell she would grin and bear it. Who knows, maybe she and the Pint Puncher could chat a little more. That seemed to be how villains turned to heroes these days. She couldn't imagine her greed ever letting her pursue a heroic lifestyle, but she could've said the same about Shenny's lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher was the first to pick his jaw up from the floor. He reached out to the hippo, but he had no plans to give her a hand. Instead he pulled the clone off of her, throwing him to the ground. He quickly donned the ring and gave this embarrassing reflection of himself a monumental slap across the face. It disappeared in a puff of smoke, the superhero regaining some of his confident smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw...\" Helen bemoaned the loss of her little distraction, but the superhero responded sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do understand that you're coming with us as a prisoner. That means no little sex slaves in your cell. You better learn not to overstep your bounds or the warden up there is gonna make you regret it.\" He pointed up to Shenny, who flashed the hippo a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, look at you getting all serious. You'd be scarier if I hadn't just felt your boner inside of me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero wasn't given the time to formulate an indignant response as a large grey-furred hand crashed down, grabbing the hippo. She was rocketed through the air to meet the wolfess' angry gaze. \"Now you've done it, bitch!\" She snarled. Helen was brought down to Shenny's toned asscheeks and wedged firmly between them. The wolfess added insult to injury by letting out a nasty fart on top of her prisoner. Her gas wasn't the strongest, but she could feel the hippo squirm in disgust all the same. She wondered how it must feel for her, to be on the other end of this sort of gassy torment. Judging by the vigorous wriggling she was not a fan of tasting her own medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess that solves transport. Let's go home.\" The hero cleared his throat. It was a little disturbing to see Shenny able to fall back on her old tricks so quickly when she was allowed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go ahead.\" Tiffany mused. \"I'm gonna dig through this place for a bit to see if anything useful can be found. She may not have made much of this tech, but I reckon we can use it all the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two heroes nod and depart. Helen's lair was on the outskirts of town, so the travel back to the woods was over in a flash. Soon they were back on familiar grounds, the wolfess taking a seat on the couch. Helen felt her world shift before it came crashing down. An infinite ocean of soft-furred buttcheeks flattened her. Shenny ground her victim down into the soft seat of the couch before the Pint Puncher finally interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough, Shenny. We still need her sort of alive.\" She returned his goofy grin and fished the worn-out hippo. Helen was covered in sweat from head to toe, stinking of wolf farts and shame. Shenny put her down on the ground, right in front of the Pint Puncher. He'd put on a fresh suit of white spandex, looking like his usual heroic self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's lay down some ground rules. You do no leave this place unless we tell you otherwise. If I catch you sneaking out I will personally have Shenny here punt you right down into the deepest darkest cell the Institute has. You do exactly what we tell you when we tell you. I've got to be strict on this, because there's no way in hell the I.S.E.A. would allow even half of what we're doing here otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last sentence raised a curious brow from the hippo. In spite of all the harsh bluster, she got the impression that the Pint Puncher was still trying to be gentle. How could he possibly manage that? Did all the things she'd done to him today magically drop out of his memory? Though again, if he was able to forgive Shenny and Tiffany for all the foul things they did to him in the past there'd be no reason to assume she'd be an exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two play nice for a while, I'm going to check in with Tiffany to see if she's found anything useful.\" The superhero announced, flying up to the wolfess' face to give her a big smooch on the cheek.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> A small part of Helen was tempted to call out to her former rival and plead him to stay in order to keep his girlfriend in check. Her pride kept her from speaking out as kept her attention on Shenny who returned her gaze with a disconcerting smile. Immediately, Helen thought back to all of the promises the giant made and a chill ran down her spine. The wolfess laughed at the tense expression on her face as she leaned back on her couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. I don't plan on using you <i>that</i> much. I was mostly just hamming things up a bit. That said, my other comments still stand. If you do anything I don't care for, I'll do everything I can to make your life a living hell\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her statement was delivered in such a lackadaisical manner that Helen was inclined to believe that she wasn't bluffing. Shenny's time spent with the Pint Puncher might've tempered her aggression, but it somehow made her much more intimidating. Still, Helen counted her blessings. Considering all that she had done to her boyfriend, Shenny was showing an admirable amount of restraint. There was no telling how long the cordial tone would last given how often her temper fluctuated, so the nerous hippo decided to try and break the ice with her giant warden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I ask you something?\" She asked before sitting down with her back resting against the leg of their giant table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. One more snide comment though and I'll send you right back into solitary confinement\" Shenny said as she ground her as deeper into the couch, making clear the implications of her threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I learned my lesson after the first time, trust me\" Helen said with a uneasy laugh. \"I just gotta know... how did all of this happen? Never in a million years would I have thought that the Pint Puncher could not only get your sex drive under control, but could convince you to become a super hero yourself\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny frowned and for a moment Helen was worried that she had unintentionally offended the giant. Her frown gave way to a light chuckle, her eyes taking on a soft quality as she thought back to the day that she decided to kidnap the Pint Puncher. She wasn't at all proud of the destruction she caused that night and all the pain and suffering that she brought to not only her future lover but the entirety of Glam City. Still, it gave her a warm feeling in the pit of her stomach. After all she did to him, he still saw fit to shower her with such affection and praise that she could do nothing but swoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly? I have a hard time answering that myself. I hate so sound so cliche, but I think being with him made me realize that all I ever wanted was someone to love me. Mindless sex is one thing, but he was the only person who I've been... intimate with\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Normally Helen would dismiss her words as tripe, but it was hard was hard to deny that the Pint Puncher had a sort of... pull to him. Why else would she allow herself to be so easily seduced into what was, in hindsight, an obvious trap? It wasn't even like he was that good a lay, but his energy and enthusiasm was a welcomed change from all of the unwilling citizens that she tormented on a regular basis. As she had him pinned down on her bed, his throbbing member getting swallowed by her hungry pussy, she found herself in a state of contentment that she'd never been in before. Even as she admonished his lack of stamina and the paltry amount of cum he produced, part of her was genuinely looking forward the next few hours that she would spend milking him dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At that memory, the hippo felt a familiar tingling down below and as she felt the crotch of her panties grow moist. She couldn't help but ponder: was she aroused at the thought of dominating the Pint Puncher, or was she beginning to fall for him just like Tiffany and Shenny did? She quickly dismissed that idea. Even if she wanted him as a lover (<i>which she didn't</i>), Shenny would pound her into the dirt if she caught her making moves on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it like going from one extreme to another?\" Helen asked curiously, desperate to get her mind off of the images that were beginning to take shape in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It felt like... I had woken up out of a long trance. Before Punchy and me got together, all I could think about was feeding people into my pussy.  I was so horny that it legit hurt and in a weird way, it made me see <i>him</i> as the bad guy for keeping me from doing the only thing that could keep my libido under control. Once he became my lover, I didn't have that problem anymore and it allowed let me see how much harm I was causing because of my habits\" Shenny said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you ever miss shoving people in there?\" Helen asked with a grin, hoping plant a seed of doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not really\" the wolfess replied with a shrug. Her lack of hesitation caught Helen by surprise. She didn't even need to think it over. \"I'll take one Pint Puncher over every human in Glam City multiplied by ten\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen huffed and averted her eyes from Shenny. She didn't care to hear so much praise for her most hated nemesis. What made it worse was her inability to completely dismiss the idea that the Pint Puncher was any more special than all of the other humans in Glam City. She was quick to presume that their relationship was rooted in an unhealthy combination of perversion and Stockholm Syndrome but there was more to it than she realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't strain yourself thinking about it too much\" Shenny joked as she stood up to her feet and stretched. \"I'm gonna hit the spring and grab a bite to eat. Come on\" she ordered before reaching down to gently pick the hippo up. Despite their adversarial approach to looking after their prisoner, Shenny handled the her with great care as she walked out of her home and over to the spring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe living here won't be too rough after all</i>, Helen thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Helen feels her stomach turn a little as she sways back and forth as the titanic wolfess holding her is leisurely strolling towards the spring. The trees all around her gave way for the familiar clearing. The hippo was surprised to see such a picturesque site emerge in the middle of the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Helen, you even wonder how it would feel to fly like Punchy does?\" Shenny asked with a devious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo only chuckled in response. Her butt drops would be the stuff of horror stories if she could fly. It'd also help haul loot off much faster. Before she could daydream any further she felt herself get lifted up to the wolfess' face. Helen's amused smirk turned to fear as she caught on to the titan's intent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare thr-\" Helen was cut short as Shenny reared back and threw the hippo into the pool. She flailed wildly and screamed loudly as she arced through the air, landing in the deep end with a mighty splash. A few moments later she emerged again, sputtering and coughing. By now Shenny had closed the distance and was gently sliding herself into the cool waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you fucking crazy?!\" Helen yelled, but Shenny didn't seem fazed in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably? I've turned the town superhero into my boyfriend and became the world's tallest crimefighter. Besides, that was fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun?\" Helen spat incredulously. She could feel herself blush so brightly her face was burning, and her 'warden's smug grin told her Shenny was well aware of it too. As scary as that was, she couldn't deny it was kinda fun to fly like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm, now wash up, you smell like ass.\" Shenny giggled at her own cheesy joke whilst Helen sighed deeply and just got on with it. As she busied herself with washing her large belly her eyes fell on the smooth standing stones in the nearby field. They seemed out of place in a way, looking too polished and uniform in shape to occur naturally, especially standing up like that. The longer the hippo stared the more questions arose. Did Shenny put them there? If so, why? What would this sex-crazed fiend need... Helen's thoughts shorted out as she realized what they must have been used for. A mix of disgust and embarrassment washed over her. She wasn't prudish by any standards, but leaving one's toys out like that just seemed untidy in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I see you're eyeballing my collection. It's true, before me and the Pint Puncher were a thing I had other ways to temper the fire between my legs. When a random citizen isn't worth the hassle of dealing with pesky interfering superheroes, one can get really creative when it comes to sating their needs. It couldn't compare to the real thing of course and ever since I have Punchy they've been mostly decorative.\" The towering wolfess mused before giving the hippo a sly grin. \"But with you around, maybe we could give them another go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen gulped as a large hand came in and picked her up. Shenny got onto her feet and wandered over to the standing stones. She set the frightened hippo down next to one of them and squatted down. She rubbed two slender fingers against her sensitive folds, stimulating them and parting them a little as the tip of the stone got close. With a loud wet squelch Shenny lowered herself down. Helen stood dumbstruck, impressed that this column of rock taller than her whole body was sliding into the wolfess with such ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that scrawny hero accomplish anything in there when you're comfortable with this kind of size?\" She asked, oblivious to how rude that could be perceived. Thankfully the wolfess didn't take offense and humored her with a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Size ain't everything. Sure, this is bigger, but the way he squirms and wiggles... that kind of love can't be found in a stone.\" She chuckled, wholly aware of the irony that is the city's tallest hero saying size isn't everything. Shenny had more important concerns anyway. She rose up and lowered herself, the large stone mass entering her over and over until she reached a powerful climax. The hippo slowly backed away, not wanting to be this close to such a lewd act. Even at a distance she nearly got splashed by the pungent release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaahhh... that's the stuff. Amazing how much more you can enjoy it when you're not suffering from crippling need all the time.\" Shenny spoke in a mellow tone. Helen wasn't as enthused by this, but things could be worse. It could've been her instead of that stone, so best to count her blessings for now. These fears increased tenfold when Shenny picked the hippo up again and held her in front of her dripping pussy. The aftermath of her previous orgasm still clung to the inside of her legs, glazing them with odorous slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for round two...\" Shenny flashed a toothy grin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Many a time would Helen watch with great amusement as Shenny used random citizens to sate her monstrous sexual appetites and not once did she feel an ounce of empathy for them and now that she was on the receiving end of such treatment, Helen finally realized just how frightening it was. The heat washing over her face, the powerful, nose curling scent, mixed with the looming sense of dread; it was hard for her to fathom how the Pint Puncher willingly put himself into such a position day after day. She began to mentally prep herself for what was to come when the hand holding her was pulled back. She looked up to see Shenny peering down at her with a smug smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's times like this that I wish I had a camera. That look on your face was hysterical!\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen blushed furiously at her taunting. She didn't like being laughed at, nor did she care to be made a fool of. Were it not for the extreme disrepency in their sizes, she would've jumped at the chance to physically lash out against her captor. With that option off the table, she settled for mouthing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is <i>wrong</i> with you?! What, do you get off on torturing me?!\" She yelled as she wiped the sweat from her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a pot calling the kettle black if I ever heard it\" Shenny replied with a sneer. \"You always got a kick out of watching me torment humans, but when it's done to <i>you</i>, THEN it becomes an issue\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't start up with that holier-than-thou nonsense again! Being with the Pint Puncher don't make you any better than the rest of us! You just traded up from disposable sex toys to a sturdier model! That's all!\" the hippo spat back.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Shenny answered her bitter words with a blank stare and for a moment Helen's fury was replaced with unease. The wolfess had proven to be quite protective of her boyfriend and besmirching their relationship seemed an easy way to provoke her wrath. Instead Shenny just shook her head and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all that time you spent with that clone, I would've hoped that by now you'd have learned\" she said softly. The tone of her voice carried a hint of pity, something that Helen couldn't recall ever hearing from the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Learned what?\" she asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you can have your fun without it being at the expense of someone else. Think back to all the times you messed with Punchy. Think about all the times you put him in a compromising position and how he would either fight to escape or would beg you to stop. Compare all of that to the ONE day you spent with his clone and then tell me with a straight face that you didn't enjoy it more\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen glowered at her and refrained from answering. As much as it pained her to admit it, she was absolutely right. She thought back to the many hours of entertainment she got from the clone and the innumerable times he had managed to bring her to an intense, toe curling climax. When he first turned up at her lair, she treated him no differently than she would've treated the real deal. She demeaned him, she humiliated him, she used him as nothing more than a sex toy. Yet unlike his predecessor, he took it all with a smile. Not only was the clone not deterred by her rough handling, but he delighted in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis enthusiasm was contagious, and for the first time ever Helen began to derive joy from seeing someone else happy. She adored the excited look in his eyes whenever she announced yet another game for them to play and when it became apparent that he not in fact the real Pint Puncher, she would often think back to her past dealings with the hero and wonder how much better they would've been had he been a willing participant. That line of thinking was rooted into the back of her mind when he propositioned her back in her lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get what I'm saying, don't you? Forcing people to please you only feels good for so long. Having someone around <i>wants</i> to please you never gets old\" Shenny explained. \"You got to experience that feeling firsthand with the clone. Now that you've had a taste for it, you won't settle for anything less. Forcing yourself onto regular humans just won't do it for you anymore and you'll constantly be wishing to find someone, <i>anyone</i>, who can recreate that feeling. That's what happened with me, that's what happened with Tiff, and even Quaker can't bring herself to pick on random strangers anymore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Don't lump me in with the rest of you overly-sentimental weirdos\" Helen huffed. She tried her best to dismiss Shenny's words, but the mention of Quaker made it rather hard. Shenny turning over a new leaf was one thing, but Quaker was one of the few villains who topped the wolfess in regards to sadism and cruelty. For her to have renounced her evil ways, there must've been some merit to what Shenny was telling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, you'll see soon enough. For the time being, hows about you and I have some real fun?\" the giant asked with a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on what you constitute as 'fun'\" Helen said suspiciously. Entertaining as it was, she didn't want to be launched into the air a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't seem fair to me that I'm the only one to have gotten off in the last few minutes...\" Shenny cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her sudden flirtation caught Helen completely by surprise. Not two hours ago, she had caused the giant to fly into an intense rage before being shoved deep between her cheeks. That ill will was no where to be seen as Shenny stared down at her with bedroom eyes. Helen was never big on women, but part of her couldn't help but find the offer oddly tempting. A brief jolt of pleasure ran through her body and she looked down to find Shenny's thumb pressing gently against her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your call\" she offered.</span></div></div>",

Though it was without doubt a scary proposal to let someone this big play with her like that, the hippo's curiosity clamored to find out what it would feel like. She has only ever been on the dominant side of the relationship, her human 'partners' unable to deal with her size and weight. With a bright blush she looks up to the giant and coyly nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny gives her a big grin. \"It's okay, I won't tell anyone. But after this, I wonder if you'll want to do the same...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo tried to think about what the wolfess could've meant with those words but her thoughts were scrambled when another finger rubbed along her crotch. Her panties were soaking wet now and she hastily discarded them before Shenny would have to try to remove them. Helen expected another finger to tease her newly exposed pussy, but the giant had lewder plans in mind. She brought the hippo up to her face and gently blew between Helen's legs. The hot air was but a precursor for the next step. The hippo gasped when she felt the distinct wet sensation of Shenny's giant tongue lapping between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic wolfess slowly dragged her tongue along the wet folds of Helen's crotch. It tasted strange, yet familiar. She relished the hippo's shivers and wriggles as she could hear nothing but shallow moans from Helen's direction. Being tended to by someone her size must be a unique experience for the hippo and Shenny was determined to milk that novelty for all its worth. Her huge tongue eagerly licked away at Helen's snatch. It felt long and wide enough that the hippo could probably emulate her special trick too with a human, though only barely. She struggled to suppress a giggle as she pictured Helen trying to shove her latest victim in there. It probably was quite the ordeal for her to get off just fucking her victims. A regular man-sized dick couldn't hope to satisfy those depths. Maybe that's why her tongue was so effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen's breathing was shallow and ragged. The large tongue between her legs sent shivers of pleasure throughout her body with every wet stroke. It wouldn't be long before she'd reach her own climax, but the wolfess seemed to be holding back just enough to keep her on edge. It shouldn't surprise her that such a lust-fueled creature has this kind of expertise, but she was annoyed and impressed all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the love of... just... do it...\" She stammered between moans, a knowing smile curling onto Shenny's face. The wolfess held all the cards and she had a finish in mind the hippo won't soon forget. Instead of her tongue's actions getting more intense she backed away, bringing the hippo back down. Helen was still cross-eyed with lust, barely grasping what the wolfess was doing until she felt the soft grass behind her back. She was laid out on the ground, the towering giant getting down on her knees with heavy thumps. Helen had never felt smaller in her life than right in this moment. Her eyes widened a little with fear as Shenny's giant pussy loomed overhead. A few drops of arousal leaked down onto her and far above she heard the wolfess speak in a reassuring tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hold still, I promise this will be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the greatest care Shenny sat herself down. She paid close attention not to rest her weight on top of the hippo, merely resting her own, vast pussy on her. It easily covered the hippo's body up to her neck, blanketing it in a pungent, wet warmth. She ever so gently rocked herself forwards and backwards, rubbing against Helen's big gut with her smooth folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen couldn't believe what she was feeling. Was the giant really trying to pet her using her pussy. She didn't know what to think of it at all, her mind struggling to form a coherent thought. The dense smell of arousal clouded her judgement. All she knew was that this was the single weirdest thing she'd been a part of and she loved every second of it. Pleasure mounted at breakneck pace and soon she let out a bellowing moan. Shenny just smiled smugly, feeling the hippo twitch and shake as her orgasm reaches its peak. Hopefully Helen would appreciate what she was doing. She had to fight off her natural urges to let her pussy swallow up that plump hippo body at every turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarity slowly began to return to the hippo as the afterglow of her intense climax wore off. Did she really just let this happen? Moments ago that enormous pussy was a source of fear and now it had brought her such pleasure. Wasn't she supposed to be a prisoner in this scenario? Not that she was gonna complain, but it seemed so very odd for the wolfess to treat her like this. Maybe Shenny didn't quite know how to handle this situation either and they were both just kind of winging it. Whatever the reason, she had to admit that this was a rollercoaster of an experience so far.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Shenny bit down on her bottom lip as she fought against her natural urges. While she still wasn't too fond of Helen, she was determined to bring the hippo around to her way of thinking. It took a fair amount of willpower for her to pull away from her prisoner, but she managed it. She grinned at the sight of Helen laying in a puddle of her slime, her chest heaving as she tried to catch her breath after what was undoubtedly the most intense orgasm of her life. Even the Pint Puncher couldn't boast such a feat, a fact that the wolfess took some pride in. With both hands she reached down and picked Helen up, cradling her in to arms as she walked back to her abode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I think we've earned ourselves a quick nap. Hopefully Punchy will be back by the time we wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen responded with a nod and a yawn. The hours spent playing with her the Pint Puncher's clone had already taken a toll on her and Shenny managed to push her just far enough to where she felt it necessary to take a break. As her 'warden' laid back on her colossal couch and she was pressed firmly against her taut, muscular stomach, Helen was surprised at just how comfortable she felt. She spent thousands to obtain the most luxurious bed possible, one that could properly hold her gorgeous frame and as much as she valued it, it lacked the warmth of Shenny's fur and the subtle, soothing rhythm of her heartbeat. It took only minutes for her to fall into a deep, pleasant slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________________________________________________________-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what exactly are we looking for?\" The Pint Puncher asked as he and Tiffany rummaged through Helen's possessions. Maneuvering through her home was a task in and of itself as they had to handle her ill gotten goods with great care while moving them out of the way. Tiffany had used her collar to shrink down to a more manageable size though she still stood at least too heads taller than the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mayor of Glam City is going to have all of Helen's stuff repossessed, so Miss Wong wants us to collect any interesting bits of technology that we can find. She hates the idea of advanced machinery falling into the hands of people who don't even know how to make use of it\" Tiffany explained as she lifted up an expensive looking vase to peer inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's one to talk given all the inventions she's given us to play with\" the hero said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She gave you that stuff for field testing. You were the ones who decided to use it to fool around\" Tiffany said in a slightly defensive tone as she glanced back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I suppose everything that goes on inside the lab between the two of you is all squeaky clean then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany huffed and looked away as she felt the heat rising in her face. She held a deep respect for the doctor, but it was hard to deny that most of her tests were a bit on the... questionable side. All of the times she had been tickled, pinched, prodded, and penetrated; were it not for her completely dispassionate nature, one could be forgiven for thinking Miss Wong nothing more than a pervert with too much time and resources on her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep your eyes peeled for anything that looks like it might be useful\" the mouse said as she continued to dig through the assortment of stolen goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero smiled and chose to keep his comments to himself. It was hard not to notice how close she had gotten to the doctor and he saw it as a positive development. He looked away from her and focused on the task at hand as he flew around Helen's spacious home in search of anything that would peak Dr. Wong's interest. It was difficult for him to discern what would fit such a criteria, as his understanding of all things scientific was amateur at best. He didn't expect Tiffany to fair any better, although there was no telling how much she picked up from working as a research assistant. It wasn't until half an hour passed that she finally stumbled on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Take a look at this!\" she called as she ran up to the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher turned around expect her to have found a truly mind-blowing gadget but was surprised to find her holding an ordinary looking key. Tiffany saw the confusion on his face was was quick to explain her thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen's the kind of person who likes to flaunt her wealth. For her to have this lying around, that means that there's something in this place that's important enough for her to keep hidden\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero nodded, impressed by her deductive reasoning. At the very least, being an environment with intellectuals served to better broaden her often simplistic way of thinking. Of course, that only left the matter of finding out what the key was meant to unlock. It would take hours for the two of them to scour through the clutter and even then they had no idea what to be on the search for. Luckily, the Pint Puncher had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mice have an acute sense of smell, right? Take a whiff of the it and see if you can pinpoint its lock\" he suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany felt rather offended by his proposal, though there was some merit to it. Her sense of smell had helped her more often than not in her past days as villain, as she would use it to help her find the hero whenever he tried to hide to recuperate after a particularly painful beating by her hands. Bringing the key to her nose, she took in a deep breath. She winced slightly as she was hit with the not-so-pleasant scent of Helen's sweat, though she decided to save her complaints for another time. The hero watched curiously as she fell down her her hands and knees, sniffing the ground with a look of pure focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way. Come on\" she said as she pushed past an expensive marble statue and a stack of priceless paintings. The hero followed behind, making sure that she didn't accidentally bring harm to any items as she went along. The last thing he wanted was to be brought into city hall and lectured for damaging objects that they had waited so long to have returned to them. Tiffany went all over the place, at times seeming to go in circles as she followed the scent trail over to their destination. The hero though about complaining, though he found it rather hard to concentrate on the task at hand with the tantalizing sight of Tiffany's plump ass waving to and fro as she continued to crawl on her hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The mouse's voice broke him out of his trance and brought him back to the present. He looked past Tiffany and raised a brow at what she had found.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The superhero was baffled at first. The mouse seemed to have led him to an empty corridor. But after a little more sniffing around she tapped one of the tiles on the wall and it slid inwards, revealing a keyhole. The Pint Puncher was impressed that Tiffany could find something this well concealed through nothing more than smell. The mouse eagerly used the key, twisting it to produce a loud click. But as they looked around expectantly, nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... did we do something wrong?\" The hero wonders aloud, scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe there's a second key?\" Tiffany suggested, sniffing the walls to see if there are more hidden keyholes. Both of them are brought to a stop when a loud hissing is heard below them. The smooth surface of the linoleum floor suddenly splits as a trapdoor opens. It's as wide as the hallway, a necessity to fit Helen's wide frame, and a large staircase is revealed. The steps were large, again built with the hippo in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... didn't figure Helen for the secret lair kind of villain. Then again, it is pretty smart.\" The hero thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, because when your lair is all open and out there to show off your bounty, who would think to look for a secondary secret lair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I guess... Didn't stop us though.\" She gave him a flirty wink before motioning for the superhero to go in first. She followed close behind, ogling the hero's cute little butt. The mouse knew he'd been staring at her rear when she was on all fours, so he wouldn't dare complain when she returned the favor. Her thoughts filled with all the funny and lewd ideas she had in mind for the hero and his butt. Those would have to wait though as they descended into the depths. The staircase ended at a large, but plain looking door. It wasn't locked, and the hero carefully pushed it open. He didn't know what to expect. A high-tech cave of gadgets and other toys? Nah, if Helen had gadgets like that she'd be using them, not hiding them. A prison for those special few she wanted to keep as more than toys? That seemed cruel even by Helen's standard. His mind was racing as he reached for the light switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights flashed on to reveal a sight neither hero would have expected in a million years. The room was surprisingly small, especially considering all the effort that'd been put in to hide it. There was no treasure or technology to speak of. But square in the center of the room was a small pedestal surrounded by a decorative table. It looked a bit like a shrine, but the Pint Puncher could only blush brightly upon taking a closer look. On the pedestal was a framed picture of him. It even had an autograph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Helen, my biggest fan.\" The hero read aloud. Suddenly he recalled signing a picture for an adoring teen. They'd joked together that she shared a name with the villainous hippo. Had Helen really paid someone off to get an autographed picture of him? Tiffany struggled to keep a straight face, seeing the otherwise aloof hippo in a whole new light. Along with the picture there were also more sinister keepsakes. A small tuft of hair, no doubt procured during one of their many fights and a vial of some unknown substance. The hero shuddered to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the table surrounding the pedestal were many scraps of white spandex. The Pint Puncher didn't need to guess how she got a hold of those. His suit was usually the first to perish in many of his fights. Helen was no exception. She enjoyed humiliating him by tearing away his clothes. The hero wanted to pick one of the larger scraps up, but recoiled when the cloth felt eerily damp. He shuddered as he picked it up and brought it to his nose. His sense of smell might not be as keen as Tiffany's, but it was hardly needed to catch the familiar smell of Helen's arousal. After what happened earlier today he'd been thoroughly acquainted with it. He dropped the fabric immediately, causing the mouse to giggle a little. Tiffany could unfortunately sense from quite far away what those pieces of white spandex smelled like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone's been having quite the secret crush on you, Punchy. No wonder she was so eager to pick you up on your... 'negotiations'.\" She teased, making the hero blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say, my adoring fans love me.\" He boasted insincerely. Now Tiffany was blushing, a little ashamed to think that she'd been fantasizing about him on the way down here too. but as the smiles faded the hero got back to the business at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that about covers everything. Not much useful stuff in here, though I didn't picture Helen as someone who'd hoard technology. She more about the valuable shiny things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Tiffany replied, still a little red-faced. She had a few bits and pieces with her that Dr. Wong might have interest in, but it wasn't a lot. \"But before we leave...\"</span></div></div>",

You know, just to make sure that it's up to snuff\" Tiffany said as she dug into her cleavage to retrieve what appeared to be a small ray gun. Her suggestion was met with a unamused frown from the hero as he folded his arms and glared at her. It wasn't hard to see why he would be so reluctant to test out Helen's devices given his history with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Miss Wong has me testing tech all day and it doesn't bother me one bit!\" She said with a chipper smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you're forgetting one pivotal thing: Helen and Dr. Wong are two different people. Wong might be a little... unethical in how she goes about things, but she'd never invent something that was meant to hurt anyone. Helen on the other hand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair point, but I don't know if Helen ever made anything that was outwardly dangerous. Can you think of a time were one of her inventions hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher balked at her question, though upon further reflection, he couldn't remember a time where one of Helen's devices cased him injury. Inflicting pain wasn't really her modus operandi as she only concerned herself with amassing as much money as possible; that and publicly humiliating him whenever possible. Her inventions reflected her motives as they either aided her in alluding the authorities, or warped the hero's body and mind in for her personal amusement. This revelation did little to ease his worry as he eyed the device in Tiffany's hands. It didn't look like anything he'd seen Helen use before and he wasn't sure if he wanted to find out what it was meant for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Tiffany began as she placed her hands her hips. \"A large chunk of my work day is spent being a guinea pig for all the neat little toys that you and Shenny get to play with. I think it's only fair that you return the favor every once in awhile. Besides, if things go south, you know that Dr. Wong can patch you right up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. It <i>did</i> seem unfair to for her to carry such a burden all by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Maybe we can test out one or two of them...\" he muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany smiled brightly and immediately went to work fiddling with the ray gun in her hands to see how it worked. Were it not for her confidence in Dr. Wong's ability to resolve whatever problem presented itself, she would've been much more hesitant to mess around with such a trinket. After fumbling with it for a minute, her large fingers accidentally pressed a switch on the but of the gun. A light buzzing noise filled the air as the device came to life. A purple glow radiated from it as it began to get warm in Tiffany's hand. The hero winced at the intimidating display, though it didn't seem to register with Tiffany as she pointed the gun at him with gleeful grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm start to have second thoughts-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was given no time to opt out as Tiffany pulled the trigger. The hero's body was enveloped in the same purple glow. Aside from the unusual warmth that surrounded him, he felt no different. As the glow faded away, Tiffany began to examine him head to tow for any abnormalities. While she was glad to see that he appeared to be unharmed, she was disappointed at the lack of any results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... guess it's a dud\" she said with a sigh as she tossed the gun to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher wanted to scold her for being so nonchalant in regards to his health, but he found himself unable to to. Whatever device was meant to do, it apparently had a delayed effect as he began to feel odd. He would soon discover that the ray gun was meant to tamper with...  </span></div></div>",

Tiffany was still examining him and when she began to pat various bodyparts to gauge a reaction she was surprised to notice a bulge in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, are you on that much of a hair trigger these days? I'm just inspecting you for any effects of the ray gun.\" She was a little upset, but couldn't help but giggle at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...\" The hero stammered, feeling his spandex get uncomfortably tight. \"I'm beginning to think this might be the ray gun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure it isn't the cute mouse girl feeling you up for science?\" Tiffany joked back. She gave him a sly smirk before running her hand along his shaft again. But this time she too began to suspect the device had affected it. The Pint Puncher felt big. Bigger than she'd ever seen him. And her gentle touch only further stimulated his member's growth. When she could hear a sharp tearing sound she pulled her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero gasped as his cock literally burst out of his pants. It felt big before, but seeing it now made the effects of the gun crystal clear. His manhood had grown to match his lower arm in size and it was visibly growing. It wasn't even fully erect yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah... that's... I was going to say unexpected, but after what we learned here today I'm not sure why Helen hasn't used this on you before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's real cute, but can you try to stop this now?\" The Pint Puncher blushed, feeling uncomfortable about the sudden show he was putting on for Tiffany. The mouse turned her attention back to the ray gun, but the dial on the butt of the gun only seemed to be able to specify a rate of growth. She grew increasingly nervous as she realized she might have screwed up. She put the dial back to 1 and fired the gun again. The superhero was enveloped by the familiar purple glow, but his manhood only seemed to be growing faster. In just over a minute his cock had grown to the size of his arm. If it weren't for his super strength and endurance he'd probably be feeling a little light-headed and off balance by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not working!\" She exclaimed, panic in her voice. The Pint Puncher wanted to chastise her for her reckless behaviour, but that wasn't going to solve this. Instead he took a deep breath and calmly spoke to her. \"Tiffany, think with me here. How would you solve this problem if you didn't have the ray gun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving the gadget from the equation was enough to make the mouse rethink her strategy. She began thinking aloud. \"If I couldn't use the ray to change it, I would take you to someone that could. Dr. Wong springs to mind, but she's probably never seen this sort of tech either. Alternatively we go home. Helen should be able to fix this, but she's Helen, so that's not gonna be a guarantee either.\" The superhero let out a deep sigh. He knew that either option would have complications for him. But the mouse girl wasn't done yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alternatively, it could be that I am overthinking this. What if the ray just makes you really pent up, growing your sex to match your desire. If that were the case, it could be resolved right here and now, by...\" She looked over to the hero, who gave her a concerned look. Tiffany turned to face him and straightened herself out as best she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you trust me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, are you thinking what I think you're thinking?\" The Pint Puncher asked half-jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this could be solved by us having sex.\" She stated with surprising bluntness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you can handle this?\" He gestured at his oversized manhood. The mouse girl rolled her eyes, growing a little to loom over the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let me worry about what I can handle, little man.\" She leaned in and whispered in his ear. \"But if you'd rather we go see the Doctor or Shenny and Helen that is fine too.\" She stammered afterwards, not wanting to push the hero into doing something he didn't feel comfortable with. Before she could move her head back she felt the Pint Puncher's hand on her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded at him. \"So, what'll it be?\"</span></div></div>",

He looked up at the mouse with a sheepish smile which she then returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Shenny probably wouldn't like that, would she?\" she said softly as she shrank down slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's to say? I'm sure once we get home we can have some fun with this\" he said as reached down and took hold his oversized length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I just... was hoping to get first crack at it is all...\" the mouse said with giggle as her face reddened slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good things come to those who wait. Now let's go see if Helen can do something about this\" the hero said as he started back towards the secret staircase. He was abruptly halted as Tiffany reached back and placed a heavy hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Helen? Why don't we just go and see Miss Wong?\" she asked incredulously, her tone carrying a hint of annoyance. No doubt, she viewed his decision as an unintentional slight against the doctor's abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not Helen? She's the one who made the gun, she'll know how to fix it\" the hero explained calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but... you said it yourself! She's a villain and Doctor Wong isn't! Don't get me wrong, if anyone can make her change her ways it's you, but it hasn't even been a day! You go over to her now and she'll probably make it worse just to laugh in your face! Why on earth would you want to put your body at risk like that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher took in a deep breath and closed his eyes. Going to Doctor Wong was indeed the most rational course of action. She would mock him endlessly for the situation he found himself in, but that was to be expected no matter what he did. He had confidence in his ability to negotiate with Helen, but as Tiffany pointed out, old habits die hard. He wanted to make an impassioned speech about the merits of giving wrongdoers a chance a redemption, but that wasn't why he wanted to go see her. No, his reasoning was self-serving and pigheaded, two traits unbecoming of a superhero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany,\" he began as he turned to face her, his face completely deadpan as he tried his best to maintain his dignity. \"I know that if I go over to Wong, she'd have this fixed up in no time\" he paused as he looked down at the beast resting between his legs. \"I don't want it fixed. Not yet. Not until I've... given it a test run\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany stared down at the hero in a stunned silence. Part of her wanted to scold him for being so reckless in his decision making, but the other half of her was brimming with lust. She bit down on her lip, debating on how to respond before her thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the hero's footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope that she and Shenny are getting along right now. Lord knows what they've been up to since we've been gone\" he said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany laughed at the thought, though she trusted Shenny to keep things under control. Things were a little hectic when they were last together, but so long as Helen didn't do or say anything to provoke her, everything would be just fine. Her attention turned to the hero as she watched him waddle up the stairs, his enormous length swinging between his legs with each step. That sight alone eliminated any second thoughts she had as she quickly tailed behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ _________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The trip home proved rather awkward from for the Pint Puncher as his body wasn't quite used to the extra weight. Tiffany offered to carry him between her breasts, but he politely declined. If the size of his member was effected by his arousal as she hypothesized, then riding in her cleavage would only make things more complicated. It didn't take long for them to reach their destination and to their surprise, Helen and Shenny were no where to be seen. They were stiff on the premises, as Tiffany's acute sense of smell tipped her off to that fact. She didn't need to rely on it to find them though, as she could hear noises coming from Shenny's home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As they entered the wolfess' abode, they were greeted with a most unusual sight.</span></div></div>",

He's got a real nice taste to him. Not sure why I didn't swallow the guy right after though. Maybe that was a sign of things to come.\" Shenny replied nonchalantly. The towering wolf was laid out on the couch, her tiny hippo 'prisoner' sitting on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And after all that you didn't finish him off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, I guess you could say he made me an offer I couldn't refuse.\" Both supervillains flew into giggles. When Shenny composed herself again she concluded her story. \"He promised he'd be my boyfriend for a day without fighting it. Turned out later that his offer was some half-baked plan to stall me until the Blood Moon had passed. But after a day it just sorta... stuck. The rest is history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... he got lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both did.\" The wolfess laughed a little before turning her head to see Tiffany and the Pint Puncher standing in the doorway with their jaws on the floor. \"Hey guys, did you find anyth-\" Her words were cut short when her eyes fell upon her boyfriend's groin. The superhero was packing a cock almost as big as the rest of his body. Shenny's eyes widened with a mix of joy and concern. She hopped onto her feet, almost forgetting about Helen. The hippo was picked up before she could fall and set down on the coffee table, giving the two a devious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher and Tiffany didn't expect to find this scenario. The superhero would've put money on his girlfriend having shoved the hippo up her pussy or ass. Perhaps not the most heroic thing to do, leaving Helen with her, but after what the hippo had done to him she was due some comeuppance. Instead they were talking? And if he heard their conversation right, they were talking about him. About how he met Shenny. The titanic wolf sprinted over to her boyfriend and picked him up. The hero smiled awkwardly, trying to soothe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy, what the hell happened?\" She tried to sound concerned, but the undertones of desire were clear as day in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we found some interesting tech in Helen's lair and when we tried it out this happened.\" He gestured at his cock. It had been steadily growing on the way home and by now he was struggling to stay on his feet. They could hear a tiny snicker escape the hippo, but paid it no mind. He could feel the towering wolf get more giddy by the second. He wouldn't leave her hanging a moment longer. \"So, you want to try it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero was fairly certain he heard a yes amidst the burst of gleeful giggles coming from his girlfriend. but she had something in mind that not even the hero could've conceived. With him in hand she asked Tiffany for the ray gun. She didn't hesitate for a moment to hand it over to Helen, who was surprised by Shenny's trust in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make him as big as the standing stones near the spring.\" The wolfess ordered cheerily. Helen looked at her with disbelief. The Pint Puncher comes strolling in with a cock the size of his body and the first thing she wants is to make it bigger? The hippo didn't even know if it was possible. She told Shenny as much, explaining she'd only just stolen it. After some fiddling with the dials she aimed it at the hero and pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surge of energy coursing through the Pint Puncher felt familiar, but he worried this might push his endurance to its limits. He remembered the size of those stone pillars. Hopefully nothing would go haywire at this stage. His concerns are alleviated a little by the overwhelming sense of pleasure rushing through him. Shenny held his enormous member in her hand and was slyly playing with it already. Her soft fingers rubbed against the sensitive shaft and teased the tip. When it seemed like he couldn't possibly get bigger the wolfess brought him down to her drooling pussy. She was as lustful as the day they got together, greedily pushing him into her. The hero tried to help, but even with his super strength he didn't add much to the action. Instead Shenny took charge, pulling him out and thrusting him back in over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany and Helen watched the lewd display. They were a little disgusted by it, but the sheer otherworldliness made it impossible to look away. The mouse shuddered to think how that enormous manhood would feel. Even at her biggest that thing looked painful. She snickered a little picturing Helen trying to handle it. When the novelty started to erode, their attention turned to eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that raygun... how do you reverse it?\" She asked timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be honest, I don't think you can. All I remember from the eggheads I stole it from is that they said you'll shrink back down if you climax. Kinda surprised you didn't know this.\" The hippo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany's smug grin would be insufferable for the hero if he weren't tied up in far more overwhelming affairs. She'd figured it out all on her own. But what the hippo said did confuse her. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen chuckled. \"Well, I stole it from an I.S.E.A. compound. Nobody told you? I pinched some tech and gassed everyone unconscious. A little payback for everything they did to me. Kinda strange Wong never mentioned it to you. I wonder what else she's hiding...\" The hippo formed a sly smile, but the anthro mouse shrugged it off. Dr. Wong was a very busy woman. She probably forgot to tell her or she just figured it wouldn't be relevant for their science.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany and Helen continued chatting whilst Shenny lived out sexual fantasies she never thought possible. The superhero was merely along for the ride at this stage, just smiling and letting her have her way with him. The vastness of her pussy was filled almost completely by his manhood and its warm embrace was nothing short of divine. He tried to push it as long as possible, holding himself on the edge against the onslaught of pleasure provided. His oversized balls ached with pent up desire and finally he let it all flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny cried out with unfettered joy as the torrent of her boyfriend's cum sent a wave of pleasant warmth through her. Her inner walls squeezed and massaged the enormous shaft and soon after she reached her own orgasm. Any words they tried to say fell apart into vague muttering, but they both wished this could last forever. The amazing intensity of his climax nearly caused the hero to pass out, but as he came down from the most spectacular orgasm ever he began to feel more grounded. His thoughts wandered to trying to shrink his oversized cock back to normal. Hopefully the hippo would provide a solution. But as he's recovering his senses, he feels a strange sensation running through his length. Was Tiffany right all along? Did he just need release in order to reverse the ray gun's effects?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> A tingling sensation washed through the Pint Puncher's body and for a moment he was worried. It was just conjecture as to whether or not this would solve his problem and who's to say that it wouldn't worsen it? Fortunately for him, that didn't seem to be the case as he could feel Shenny's inner walls becoming more and more loose around his cock; what once was large enough to completely stuff her titanic pussy was soon back to its respectable size, hanging limp between his legs. As he stepped back, he couldn't help but admire his handiwork as he peered over at Shenny. Not since they first experimented with the Dr. Wong's bracelets had he seen her so satisfied as she was sprawled out on the couch completely sprawled out with her tongue hanging from her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like somebody enjoyed themselves...\" he said with proud smirk. His boasting was rather half-hearted as he could barely gather the energy needed to walk away from her. He staggered off the couch and gently floated down to the ground. As enjoyable as all of that was, it felt good to not have to carry around such a heavy load. He looked over at Helen and Tiffany and raised a brow as he caught wind of their conversation. Judging by the blush on Tiffany's face and the number of times he heard his name uttered, he figured that she was recounting how she became infatuated with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a hard time following the process of events here. You start off wanting to seduce him to spite your best friend, then you want to make him a sex slave, and then you fall in love with him?\" Helen asked with a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah. It sounds crazy but that's how it went down. Funny thing is, if it weren't for Dr. Wong I probably would've been stuck on crazy\" Tiffany said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, did that quack give you some shock therapy or something?\" Helen huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to badger her all the time to let me see Punchy and eventually she got fed up and broke things down for me. She told me that Punchy was a boy scout at heart and would never go for a smelly, self-centered bully like me. That cut deep... but it got me thinking about what kind of person I was. I would have these dreams of Punchy looking at me the same way he looked at Tiffany and I wanted so bad to make it real. I didn't want him as a sex toy, I wanted him to love me. And when I made peace with him being with Shenny, I wanted to be the kind of woman that he could <i>potentially</i> love\" the mouse said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen rolled her eyes and looked away as she folded her arms. She was beginning grow weary of all this talk of \"love\". She had no use for something so immaterial and vague. Her face soured slightly as the subject of their conversation walked up to her. She thought about what Shenny told her, how he offered to be her boyfriend for a day to stall for time. That information did little to endear him to her. Seeing the bitterness in her expression, the hero smiled and patted her on the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Helen? Mind if I talk to you for a minute?\" he asked. The mental image of her little shrine to him was still fresh in his mind and it helped him see the hippo in a new light. The anger she had previously displayed no doubt was in part due to her secret crush on him. He could only imagine how hurt she must've felt to have something so personal used against her in such a heartless manner. Had he been aware of how she felt back then, he never would've acted out his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're here to admit that you like having your face shoved up against my ass, I already knew that\" she said with a sneer. She expected him to either snap back with a retort or turn completely red face and was caught off guard by when his response came in the form of a light chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, but that isn't it. I just wanted to say I'm sorry for tricking you the way I did. It was wrong of me to play with your emotions like that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen's heart skipped a beat as she stared down at the hero. She didn't want to admit it, but his facade really did cut her deep. She had spent so long secretly lusting after him and she was elated at the prospect of having him around as her lover. It was hard to pick up on given how loud and demanding she was as she rode his puny body atop her bed, but that was just another part of her greed. She wanted to pick the hero up and plant one of her trademark sloppy kisses on his face, but she thought better of it. How was she to know that it wasn't just another trick? Maybe he was planning on buttering her up so she'd feed him info for the Institute. She glowered at him and turned her back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spare me that mushy nonsense. I appreciate you not turning me in, but don't take that to mean that you and are gonna be friendly with each other\" she spat angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious. As it stands you're a prisoner here, but this is a matter that needs to be resolved. I manipulated you and you deserve an apology\" the hero pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you give it a rest already? You've already won, you're already keeping under lock and key. You don't need play good cop anymore, Punchy. If I so much as sneeze in a way you don't like, you can always sic your lady friend on me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen,\" the hero began. \"I know it's hard for you to believe me, especially after the stunt I pulled. I just want to make amends for any pain I might've caused you. If there's anything that I can do to earn your forgiveness sans letting you out of here, just let me know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That offer roused the hippo's curiosity as she looked over her shoulder at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" she asked cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Anything</i>\" the hero repeated with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen bit down on her lip in thought. He seemed dead set on winning her favor and while she still wasn't sure if it was another ruse, this seemed too good an opportunity to pass up. After thinking it over for a minute, she turned to face him with a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Punchy. I'll take you up on that offer\" she said with a snicker. \"If you really want my forgiveness that bad then...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Helen mulled over her options. She suddenly found herself with her nemesis and/or secret crush willing to do anything she wanted. All the many ways in which she wanted to fuck him into next week passed her mind. But as she peered around she caught Shenny staring at her harshly. Something told the hippo that she might have to reign herself in. The Pint Puncher may be willing to throw himself into this completely, but it didn't sit right with his girlfriend one bit. And in spite of their differences, the hippo did strangely enjoy the wolfess' company. She had expected Shenny to squash and humiliate her every moment of the day and so far her 'imprisonment' had been surprisingly pleasant. But that glare told her that the titanic wolf had no issues making her stay here much less comfortable if she overstepped her boundaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, pucker up and give me a big smooch.\" She said, her voice dripping with desire. The Pint Puncher was surprised to see the hippo propose something this modest, but he wasn't one to question her. He straightened himself out and walked up to the hippo. Helen was practically drooling with anticipation. Vague memories of their recent encounter bounced through his mind. Did she eat him at some point? It was all too muddled to pay much attention to, especially when the hippo snapped him back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mere, you.\" She practically whispered, leaning down to grab the hero by his shoulders and lift him to his destination. Her big maw was eager to show him some love and with gusto she planted her thick lips on top of his face. Like two greasy slugs they wriggled, opening a little to let her probing tongue slather his face with drool. Helen might have settled for only a kiss, but she was going to put her everything into this kiss. She had no idea when she would get a free pass with the superhero again, so this was a moment to make count. She quietly regretted not just fucking the Pint Puncher's brains out, but she curtailed her greed for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo was unrelenting. When the hero felt like she might have reached the end of her kiss, she kicked it up another gear. Overwhelmed by her intensity, the hero parted his lips and let her tongue play around inside his mouth. It tasted uniquely foul, but having endured kisses from the two titans overlooking them it was relatively manageable. What was less ideal was the hippo's nasty tendency to get a little gassy, small burps escaping her during their kiss. The hippo's belches could knock down walls, but thankfully these tiny bursts only managed to assail his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at her go. You'd think she's afraid this'll be her last kiss ever.\" Tiffany cooed, standing next two Shenny and watching the two go at it. The wolfess smirked awkwardly. She was happy the hippo didn't abuse her over-eager boyfriend's trust immediately, but she wasn't too happy seeing him offer his body up so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this guy ever manage to stand up to us in a fight? I'm fairly sure we could've seduced him to a standstill by blowing a kiss at him.\" The mouse continued, making her friend chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I did a lot more than just kiss him when we first met.\" The wolfess laughed. She still felt embarrassed by how out of control she was back then, but those intense wriggles from when she first managed to shove him into her pussy were something to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany thought back to her first encounter with the superhero too. Her mind was a little foggy, but she was sure she either ate him or squashed him flat under her butt. The look on his face when he saw this little mouse turn into a towering collosus would stay with her forever. The titans looked at eachother, blushing a bit. Their attention quickly turned back to the relatively small hippo on the salon table kissing the superhero like her life depended on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher began to feel a little nervous that Helen would simply keep on kissing forever, using his offer as some clever loophole to claim him for her own. She was unrelenting in her amorous advances, even briefly slurping his head into her maw. Her tongue explored his whole face, ruffled his hair and even coiled around his neck for a moment. The playful hippo finally pulled back, a loud <i>MWAAAH</i> as her puckered lips detached from his drool-soaked head. Helen smiled from ear to ear, pleased to see her romantic advances had left the hero looking so haggard. If he wanted so badly to show her the power of friendship, she'd make him work for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero shook his head a bit and wiped away the worst of the hippo slobber. He gave Helen a broad smile. \"You should've opened a kissing booth. You'd have made all the money in the world with smooches like that.\" He joked. She just huffed and crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't think you're in the clear yet, Punchy. I'm fine for now, but I may need more 'convincing' in the future to buy into this crap.\" A greedy glint caught her eye. \"A <i>lot</i> more convincing...\"</span></div></div>",

He wasn't so naive as to expect her to be satisfied with just a kiss. Winning her trust was a tall order, but he more than willing to put in the effort. The only concern he had was making sure that he didn't take things too far. It felt good to have so many of his former foes pining for him, but his heart would always belong to Shenny. Tiffany and Quaker respected the couple's boundaries, but he knew that not every villain he made peace with would be the same way.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You talk real big for someone who's supposed to be a prisoner\" Shenny quipped as she stood off the couch. If her boyfriend was unwilling to assert himself, than she would pick up the slack for him. The last thing they needed was for Helen to run roughshod over them during her stay. Helen smirked as she wrapped an arm around the Pint Puncher and pulled him in for a tight embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a bit of banter between friends. What, is that a crime now?\" she said with a playful pout as the hero struggled against her plump body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you're friends now? I happen to be very selective of who I let my boyfriend pal around with and to be honest, I'm not sure you make the cut\" Shenny said as she walked over to the hippo. Helen's smug attitude faded almost immediately as the towering wofless was upon her in seconds. At times she forgot to keep her mouth in check when speaking to her warden. The hippo didn't resist as Shenny picked her up off the ground and brought her back over to the couch. The giant flopped down and placed Helen between her legs, inches away from her drooling pussy. Helen's winced as her nose was hit by the familiar heady scent, though it was for her to hide how she truly felt as her own crotch grew more and more moist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany? Would you be so kind as to lend me a hand?\" Shenny asked as she gestured for her friend to sit across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A deep blush formed on the mouse's face as she realized what her friend had in mind. There was a small bit of hesitation in her movement as she sat with her attention focused squarely on Helen. Between the her and Shenny, Tiffany had held very little ill will towards the villainous hippo and she didn't want to engage in any acts that would result in her harm. That said, she trusted Shenny enough to know that she would never coerce her friend into doing anything that she wasn't comfortable with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're gonna be intimate with Punchy, I think it's only fair you treat us the same way\" Shenny said before licking her chops lustfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Tiffany added with a giggle. \"We can be just as fun as Punchy, you know!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n Helen's apprehension gradually melted away as she felt the heat radiating from Tiffany's crotch. She still wasn't certain as to whether or not she trusted Shenny but after the intense orgasm she experienced earlier, she was much more receptive to her warden's games. It didn't take the hippo long to recognize what was about to happen and she made sure to take in a deep breath as she braced herself. Once Shenny was certain that Helen was ready, she closed the distance between her and Tiffany and planted a passionate kiss onto onto the mouse's lips. Tiffany responded in kind as she wrapped her arms around the wolfess' neck and pulled her down on top of her. Down below she could feel Helen's thick body being pushed against her wet snatch as Shenny ground their hips together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen moaned as the her body was soaked with the giants' fluids, her senses being assailed by the intense musky aroma surrounding her. A few days ago, she would've wretched at the idea of being placed into such a vulnerable position, but it was impossible to deny how pleasant this all felt. In a matter of minutes, she was brought to a shuddering orgasm, her eyes nearly rolling in the back of her head as the giants continued to mash their lower lips against her. Shenny and Tiffany followed suit as they hit their respective peaks at the same time, completely coating the hippo in their slime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two rested for a minute as their passionate bout of lovemaking left them winded. Shenny was the first recover as reached down between her legs and peeled the hippo off of her crotch. She stifled a giggle as she brought Helen up to eye level with a pleased smirk on her face. It would take days for Helen to get the smell of their arousal off of her, though she didn't necessarily see that as a negative thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... maybe having you around my boyfriend won't be so bad\" Shenny said with a snicker as she laid back and placed Helen onto her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She looked over Tiffany expecting her to join in on taunting the hippo, but she was still in the process of collecting herself as she laid back on the couch with a blissful smile on her face. Shenny rolled her eyes and looked over to see how her boyfriend was reacting to everything he had witnessed. As expected, he stood there completely wide eyed, a tent pitched between his legs as he watched the three have their fun. His libido never ceased to amuse her, as she expected him to be completely drained after the fun they had with his enlarged cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, you never turn off, do you Punchy?\" she asked with a tone of mock disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that the pot calling the kettle black?\" the hero joked as he flew over and sat down beside Helen. He wasn't there to witness the fun she had with Shenny, so he expected her to be coughing and gagging after it was all over. To his surprise, Helen seemed content, her hand trailing circles around her nipple as she breathed in the scent of Shenny's potent slime. She looked up hero and smiled at his bewildered expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jealous?\" She asked coyly as she flinched a few drops onto his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Just a little bit\" the hero responded with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two shared a good laugh as they relaxed atop the towering wolfess. It was all so surreal to Helen. When she gave herself up to the hero and his towering girlfriend, she thought that her life was pretty much over; she fully believed that the two would go out of their way to make her suffer. She never would've imagined that she would be sitting beside her arch nemesis and enjoying his company. If this how things would be going forward, then she was certain that she made the right choice in choosing them over the Institute.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hero and the hippo both were shaken as the soft belly beneath them stirred. Shenny let out a loud yawn. It was getting late and the heroes were tired. Helen too could use some rest after a day this intense. She was still uncertain what tomorrow would bring, but she was no longer dreading it. She'd expected Shenny to be as kinky as her at least, but Tifanny was just as eager to get nasty and the Pint Puncher seemed to almost revel in it. The way he was looking at her was bordering on the disturbing. But if he wanted to get weird, the hippo had just the idea in mind. With a dramatic flourish she stood up, pointing an accusatory finger at the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have you now, Pint Puncher! You've let your guard down! It shall be your last mistake!\" She announced theatrically, hamming up her lines to make sure the others knew she was just fooling around. \"Mwahahahahah!\" She bellowed out the classic supervillain laugh, making it hard for everyone to keep a straight face. She grabbed the hero by the throat, but her grip was as light as possible. The Pint Puncher played along, pretending to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo held the hero in front of her and walked down along Shenny's belly towards her crotch. The wolfess watched with a big smile, curious to see how Helen's bit would end. She continued with her grand speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All these years of foiling my plans will come to an end, superhero. I have found your one weakness: Your girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, leave her out of this!\" The hero pleaded mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest assured, she will very much be in to this. And you will be in to her! Mwahahahah!\" The hippo laughed maniacally as she stood before Shenny's drooling snatch. \"Gaze upon your doom, hero! It lusts for you with such intensity that even you won't be able to escape its grasp! Who would've thought that of all the beasts I've tried to feed you to, your precious girlfriend would be the most ravenous!\" Shenny's amused smirk grew wider whilst Tifanny was already laughing herself silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"now DIE!\" The hippo roared as she shoved the hero between Shenny's lower lips. She quickly pulled her arm back, not wanting to interfere in what would happen next. The wolfess played her role perfectly, though she hardly needed to act at all. The Pint Puncher squirming inside her love tunnel gave her all the stimulation needed to let her pussy do its work. It produced a series of wet squelches as it pulled the superhero in completely, his legs sinking into her folds like they were a hungering maw slurping up their food. Helen let out one last maniacal laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifanny had tears in her eyes from laughing and Shenny was stuck producing a mix of laughter at the hippo's silly antics and moaning at her boyfriend's squirming inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo clambered back onto Shenny's belly, feeling her lower body twitch as her inner walls bore down on the hero. She pointed a finger and both titans and announced grandly: \"And now, with that damned hero gone, join me and we shall go on the biggest crime spree this puny city has ever seen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them had a hearty laugh. Even lodged in his girlfriend's nethers, the superhero could chuckle at Helen's theatrics. It confirmed to him once more that bringing her here was a good idea. With night falling quickly he didn't bother trying to squeeze back out, opting to use these comfortable surroundings as his bed. Shenny felt him quiet down and followed suit, inviting Tiffany to climb in close. Helen wasn't sure what the huge wolfess meant until she looked over to see the giant mouse girl lie down on top. The hippo was buried between their enormous bodies, smothered with soft fur and warmth. She squeezed her head out from between them to breathe and inform the giants that she was okay. They all said their good nights and quickly fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning broke calmly. For once no alarms in the city waking them up. Helen felt a strange chill run along her back. The giant mouse was already up, a gentle breeze now running past the hippo's exposed back. The soft-furred bed also shifted as Shenny stirred. The hippo quickly hopped off before the wolfess would sit up and catapult her by accident. The titanic wolf rubbed her eyes and stretched her arms. Sitting in the chair beside her was Tifanny, reading on her tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, sleepyheads.\" She said in a chipper tone. Shenny just mumbled something under her breath whilst Helen waved. With a gleeful smirk she turned her attention to the hippo. \"So? How is 'imprisonment' here treating you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, a lot less torturous than I thought. You guys are a bunch of goofs, you know that?\" The hippo chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, look who's talking. That was hilarious, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now what? We just keep doing this until I decide to join you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of? It's not something planned. It just sorta... happens.\" Tifanny said with a shrug. \"Some of us opt to stay here, others just continue living their life. Speaking of which... Shen, get Punchy out, I think he'd love this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess' eyes sprang open. She'd had her boyfriend inside of her pussy all night long. It didn't even need any coercion. Maybe he wanted to make up for his reckless actions before? After that much fun it was all just water under the bridge for the wolfess. She needed a few minutes to coax the still half-asleep hero from her pussy. He zipped over to the spring, dipped in and out real quick and returned to the others. \"Listen to this.\" Tiffany said and she excitedly read a passage from the news on her tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two robbers were arrested yesterday after they were found in a small crater with their hands and feet bound together by stone. They confessed on the spot, claiming the 'elephant woman' who did this would step on them again if they didn't. Police are left in the dark as to the nature of this incident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero chuckled, imagining Quaker as a force of righteousness. It seemed so ridiculous, but he would've thought the same about Shenny or Tifanny. Even Helen seemed to be slowly adjusting to their way of things. Who knew what today was going to bring?</span></div></div>",

I think we're long overdue for some off time, don't you think?\" Tiffany said giddily as after taking a moment to stretch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? We've had plenty of off days\" Shenny responded curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I mean in the sense of... you know just hanging out. When's the last time you and I spent time together?\". She raised her hand to cut Shenny off just as she was about to answer. \"WITHOUT Punchy\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny wasn't prepared for such a question. Her friend certainly had a point, but she had grown accustomed to having her pint sized lover around her at all times. Tiffany smirked as she watched her friend struggle to think of an answer. She could hardly blame the wolfess for being so flustered. Ever she got together with the Pint Puncher, the two have been all but inseparable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been ages since we last hit the town together. Why don't we go out shopping or something?\" the mouse suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would we wanna do that? Glam City doesn't have any shops that would interest me and even if they did, I don't have any money\" Shenny said putting her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forget, I'm an <i>employee</i> of the institute, not a volunteer. I've got more than enough cash to spend, trust me\" Tiffany giggled before wrapping an around around her friend's neck. \"And I wouldn't be so quick to turn your nose at shopping malls. I always hear women at the Institute talking about going there after work, so it must be a pretty nice place to visit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but... remember the last time you and I went to the mall together? I don't think they'd welcome us with open arms, especially after all the damage we caused\" Shenny said. She wasn't referring to any particular instance. Prior to becoming heroes, the two of them had a track record of demolishing large structures for fun and Glam City's shopping district was a prime target for their destructive games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was before we reformed! The Institute already paid off the damages and they've been working 'round the clock to make sure that the people know how hard we've been working to make amends. Plus...\" she grinned as she leaned in to whisper into Shenny's ear. \"... I hear that you've got more than a few male admirers in the city...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That revelation peaked the wolfess' interest as a blush formed on her face. It had been her dream to acquire fans over time, but she was always too fixated on her new role to take time to enjoy the adulation that came from it. She wasn't all that interested in shopping, but she couldn't pass up a chance to meet her fans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess it couldn't hurt...\" she murmured softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany squealed in delight before grabbing Shenny's arm and leading her out of the room. As they approached the door, the wolfess stopped as she thought of her boyfriend. She glanced over her shoulder at the smiling hero, doubt beginning to surface in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy, are you gonna be okay here on your own?\" she asked worriedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenny, it's fine. You don't need me around to keep you in check. You're your own person\" he said softly. Shenny winced as her ears lowered. He saw right through her. Over time, he had become something of a security blanket for her, a fact that wasn't lost on her best friend. She took in a deep breath and nodded with a smile. If he was confident that she could handle being out in public on her own, then she trusted his judgement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. If anything goes down while I'm gone, you call me. And you,\" she turned her attention to Helen, her face becoming stern. \"Don't forget that you're in <i>my</i> home. It'd be in your best interest to treat it as such. Are we clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm smug but I'm not stupid\" Helen retorted with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. Also, watch what you do with <i>my</i> boyfriend. I can tolerate you two having fun, but I have limits. You do anything to seriously hurt him-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenny, relax. Everything'll be fine\" the hero interjected. \"Go and enjoy yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The wolfess narrowed her eyes before letting out a sigh and following Tiffany out the door. She would leave it at his desecration as to how far things went with their prisoner, but as greedy as Helen was she wasn't sure how much faith she had in his ability to reign her in. He was a glutton for punishment and Helen was the kind of person who knew just how to take advantage of that fact. Still, her trust in the Pint Puncher ran deep, and she wouldn't let her doubts get in the way of having a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Inside the home, Helen was conflicted. After that intense makeout session last night, she was dying to have some alone time with the hero. With Shenny gone, she was free to do as she pleased with her crush, and given his submissive streak she doubted that he would rat her own to his girlfriend. That said, something held her back. It wasn't just the fear of reprisal from Shenny. It was something else; something that she never would've thought she'd experience: shyness. She watched as the hero fell back onto the ground and placed his hands behind his head. He looked over at her with a friendly smile, and that simple gesture caused her to feel warm all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's just you and me today, huh? To tell you the truth, I'm not used to having free time these days, at least not without Shenny. I almost don't know what to do with myself\" he said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenny really kept you busy, didn't she?\" Helen asked with a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. And that's one of many reasons that I love her\" the hero said with a fond sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen raised a brow as a thought came to mind. Getting together with Shenny had caused the hero to rethink how he handled things. She remembered how he approached her prior to her capture, how he attempted to negotiate and talk things through. A few weeks ago he never would've thought to take the diplomatic approach for someone like her. She bit down on her lip as a feeling of jealousy suddenly washed over her. If only <i>she</i> had enslaved him first. Then maybe it would've been <i>her</i> that he'd be confessing to love to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Punchy. Mind if I ask you something?\" she began as she sat down beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire away\" the hero responded as he looked at her curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hypothetical. Let's say you never got together with Shenny and <i>I</i> was the one who kidnapped you. Think you and I could've been an item?\" she asked with a grin. She tried her best to hide the hopefulness in her voice, but acting was never one of her strong suits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero's brow furrowed in thought as he took her question into consideration. It wasn't as if he hadn't thought of that before. With all the anthros he had fought in the past, he was sure to find more than a few of them who were wayward souls like Shenny. After thinking it over he looked up at Helen with a sympathetic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly? I don't think so\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n His words wounded the hippo deeply and she couldn't even try to hide the hurt on her face. Seeing the pain in her expression, the hero continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me wrong, you're one of the sexiest enemies I've ever had. I actually got a little jealous at all the attention my clone was getting when you were playing with him\" he admitted with a chuckle. His face turned serious as he looked ahead. \"But  when it comes to our personalities, I just don't think it'd work. You and I are perfect bed partners, but our relationship couldn't go any further than that. I like you a lot Helen, but you don't have the selflessness that Shenny does. She's a needy girl, but she was willing to meet me halfway when it comes to my career as a hero. If you and I got together, I would have to quit being a hero because you'd want 100% of my attention.  If you had kidnapped me like Shenny did, I have no doubt that eventually I would've become a loving partner for you, but there's a key difference: Shenny would win me over, you would <i>break</i> me. The former is love, the latter is stockholm syndrome\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen frowned and looked away from the hero. As much as she hated to admit it, he was right on the money. If she had the hero as a lover, she would've coveted him like a one of her many horded treasures. Still, the truth hurt more than she would care to admit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... when you put it like that...\" she muttered as she turned her back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher sat up and stared at the hippo sullenly. He was just being honest, but he could've done a better job letting her down. She might've been their prisoner, but he didn't want to bring any harm to her, physically or otherwise. Thinking quickly, stood up to his feet and patted the hippo on the back. He wanted to bring her spirits back up, and the best way to do it was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Helen stared blankly into the distance, sitting on Shenny's salon table. Suddenly she felt a small body lean against hers. She looked down to see the Pint Puncher offering a kind smile, patting her back as best he could. The enormous environment might make the hippo look small, but she was still large compared to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be sad. Just because you can't have me full-time doesn't mean something can't be worked out.\" A devious smirk crept onto his face. The pudgy hippo raised a curious eyebrow, prompting the hero to elaborate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can get you on the side of justice, I don't see any issues with providing you a clone or two to satisfy your desires for me. And who knows, maybe we can even sweet-talk Shenny into letting you have the odd bit of fun with the original.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen smiled, but scoffed at the mention of justice. The temptation of getting some clones to play with was there of course, but of all the people the Pint Puncher could have to fight for justice, why her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, good one Punchy. Me? Fighting for justice? I don't look good in spandex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero chuckled. \"Heh, Shenny said pretty much the exact same thing when I first proposed this to her. Trust me, being a hero is so much different from putting on some tights and shouting 'justice!' at supervillains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you've also got to pop a boner at every supervillain butt you see.\" The hippo quipped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you bring in criminals without killing or maiming them law enforcement will slowly warm up to you. And you don't have to be very public or flashy about it either. I imagine most petty criminals would gladly waltz into a police station to give themselves up than face your wrath. And a fair number of supervillains too, come to think of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen laughed a little. The Pint Puncher could tell a good story, but she wasn't sold on it. He could tell the hippo still had her doubts, but there was a glint in her eyes that he hadn't seen before. He paid it no further mind as he continued his story. The pudgy villain would be a tough customer to sell this whole superhero thing to, but he knew how to speak to her sensibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or perhaps petty criminals ain't your wheelhouse. Imagine using the tech in your lair to track down some wanted people with big bounties for their capture. And don't worry, me and Tiffany made sure the I.S.E.A. packed away your things before anyone else could make off with them. You nab some of those most wanted guys, and you'll be living well. Maybe not so much a superhero, more a vigilante helping to remove the worst of the worst from Glam City. It won't get you as much public recognition, but I reckon that as long as you have your big heap of rewards and some clones to pass the time with that's not gonna be much of a concern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo begrudgingly had to admit that all sounded quite nice. A way to match her lust for shiny things with his mission to make a hero out of her. Hunting people down and capturing them didn't sound very heroic, but apparently if someone is wanted enough the law will settle for sending someone as horrifying as her after them. She already felt a little pity for whatever unfortunate fool would discover her noxious belches and farts first. She would stow him or her between those big, wobbly asscheeks of hers when bringing them in to make sure they'd appreciate a stink-free jail cell all the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher could tell he had her attention, but amidst all her daydreaming the hippo's thoughts veered back to one thing. Something she wanted here and now, not later. She laid her arm on the hero's shoulder, pushing him a little into the yielding flab of her large flank. \"That all sounds very nice indeed. Do you think there's any more you could do to... persuade me?\" She gave him a big wink. The superhero couldn't quite divine if her greed was kicking in or if she was just messing with him. either way, the hippo seemed very keen to get more intimate, as though their last kiss hadn't been enough of a signal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me ring up Shenny real fast. Just to make sure she's okay with this. No offense, but I really don't like seeing her sad.\" The hero apologized whilst Helen let out a deep sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save yourself the hassle, Punchy. There's no way she'd let me do that to you. You're hers, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that, but you wouldn't believe what she allowed Tiffany to do to me the first time she was over. I'm telling ya, there's a very real chance she's just gonna shrug and tell us to just have fun together.\" The hero tried to soothe the hippo, but Helen was still moody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, Shenny and that mouse go way back. But we have barely exchanged more than a few words from time to time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher sighed. \"Look, what I'm about to tell you... you didn't hear it from me, you understand?\" Helen raised a curious brow. \"I'm serious. If Shenny or Tiffany find out I told you this, I'm in big trouble. Okay, here goes. Did you know those two admire your actions as a supervillain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen stared at the superhero like he'd lost his mind completely. He quickly expanded on his story. \"They really love how creative you are with your assets and how much you flaunt your stuff.\" The hero fell silent before adding the next part of his argument. \"... and they... like to watch you dominate me...'takes em back to the old days' apparently.\" The hippo's eyebrows were raised so far up they nearly popped off her face. She didn't expect the two titans to be that interested in her. It certainly put Shenny's earlier affection in a new light. She also feels the hero squirm a little at the thought. The two exchange a sly glance and Helen leans towards the Pint Puncher a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to finish what we were in the middle of earlier? Minus the me planning to murder you for setting me up of course.\" The hippo offers in her most seductive voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the good parts then.\" He jokes in return. \"But let me just call Shen and make sure she's on board with this too.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> The Pint Puncher sighed inwardly as he reached into his pocket and fished out his phone. He felt a bit silly calling in like this, almost as if he were a teacher contacting a parent to see if their child could attend a field trip. Still, he didn't want there to be any secreta between the two of them. If she denied them the chance to get intimate, he would drop the subject with regardless of Helen's feelings on the matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Punchy~\" Tiffany's chipper voice sang on the other side of the call. \"Is everything alright? Helen isn't causing trouble, is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, everything's fine on our end. Can you pass the phone over the Shenny for a minute? I need to ask her something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A snort came from the other line along with some shuffling. There was no doubt in the hero's mind that she expected this call. After the two of them uncovered the villainous hippo's secret shrine, she was waiting for the moment were the them to a moment to... iron out their issues. Normally she would've teased him for it, but she was feeling nice that day. After a few seconds, Shenny's voice picked up on the other line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Punchy. I'm a little busy right now, so what do you need?\" she asked a pleasant tone that mirrored Tiffany's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero blinked as he could hear some clamoring in the background. At first he was worried that people were antagonizing her, but his fears were abated when he managed to catch some of what was said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Can I get another picture to hang above my bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shenny, do you have a twin sister?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit on me, please! Just one time!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher grinned broadedly. It wasn't long since the mere mention of Shenny's name brought shivers to all who had the misfortune of witnessing her past actions. Now she was amongst the very people that once feared her, getting swarmed by numerous admirers. He couldn't help but be proud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He pushed his feelings to the side as he remembered why he called in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenny, Helen wants to get... personal with me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was a brief silence on the other end. Aside from the chatter in the background, all he could hear was his girlfriend's breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero had prepared for a variety of responses, but that wasn't one of them. She had been very flexible with him regarding his not-so-secret lust for his foes, but he expected just a little more resistance from her, especially were Helen was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... is that alright with you? If not then--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy. Do <i>you</i> want it?\" She asked in an almost accusatory tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero winced and rubbed his arm bashfully. In his mind, he was just trying to make Helen feel better, but that was just an excuse. Despite his rocky past with the villainess, he couldn't deny his attraction to her. His silence gave Shenny her answer as she let out a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two have fun. Just be careful, alright? Don't do anything stupid\" she instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? You really don't have a problem with it?\" The hero asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh. Of course I do. What kind of dumb question is that?\" She asked with a snicker. \"Still... you're a horndog and that can't be helped. After all, I did kind of drill it into you. Besides, it's like I said before: they might take your body, but I'll always have the one thing that really matters\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero smiled and nodded. Many would lay claim to him, but only Shenny could boast his absolute adoration. Still, that wouldn't stop him from giving it all to satisfy Helen. He still remembered how she claimed that he \"didn't measure up\" and he was eager to make her eat her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me make something clear though\" Shenny began, her tone darkening. \"I'm trusting you two to keep things safe. If you do anything that would require us to call up Dr. Wong, you're not getting any for a week\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero blinked and let out a curt laugh. \"Alright, I get you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not joking\" she added sternly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero's smile waned as the blood drained from his face. For some this would come off as an idle threat. He had been conditioned to cum at least five times a day, so the thought of going through an entire week without his girlfriend's magic touch was unspeakable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay. We'll keep things under control. I promise\" he said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'll see you two later! Love you!\" Shenny giggled, her bubbly tone returning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you too...\" The hero said before ending the call. He was given little time to think things over before Helen wrapped her arms around his neck. As her plump stomach pushed against his back, his neck strained as her massive breasts rested atop his head. His nose curled at the familiar scent of her arousal, coupled with a heavy layer of perspiration. That scent alone was enough to bring back memories of their past bouts; all of the times she had trounced him, all the times she had toyed with and humiliated him. He looked down at his crotch and wasn't the least bit surprised to see that he was pitching a tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. Now that we got thd go ahead, how do you wanna do this?\" The hippo asked in an uncharacteristically gentle tone. \"Believe it or not, even <i>I</i> can be a giving lover. We can take things nice and slow if you want. Of course...\" She began as her voice grew more and more heated. \"We can always keep to the status quo. I know you like being bullied by strong women. I'd be more than happy to play the part...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero swallowed as he felt his cock throb slightly. He thought back to the treatment his clone underwent and it only served to make him even more hot under the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your call, lover boy. How do you want i\"</span></div></div>",

Don't you want to switch it up for a bit?\" The hero offered, hoping to avoid any major incidents this way. He was also genuinely curious to see what the hippo had in mind when she described herself as a giving lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part Helen just smirked, keeping the hero held against her big, round gut. She had only dreamed of this scenario until now. For the first time the superhero was truly willing to do this. She didn't have to force him. She didn't need to take anything, he would freely give it. For once, her greed was completely sidelined. It felt weird, but undeniably pleasant. She could feel herself getting aroused and they'd barely even started. After maintaining her snug hold on him a few more seconds she let the hero go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, Punchy. Lose the spandex and let's have some fun. Just know that gentle me is still a big girl with big tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher wanted to be cocky and mention how he deals with Shenny's intense loving on a frequent basis, but he thought better of it. \"That's okay, you know I can take it.\" He flirted as he quickly slipped out of his superhero suit. He tried to remember the last time he was able to do that. Usually he'd lost parts if not most of his suit just in a day's work interacting with these supervillains. It almost felt strange to still have it intact. Helen reached out an arm, ready to smother her partner in love. The hero hesitantly put his hand in hers and it snapped shut like a bear trap. Helen's sultry stare became a little unnerving as she prepared her first move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled hard, yanking the hero off his feet and sending him crashing into her chest. Helen's large cleavage effortlessly caught the hero, surrounding most of his body with soft boobflesh. The smooth walls jiggled as she let out a cute little laugh before pursing her lips and going in for a kiss. The hero was still dazed from his quick journey into this position and gasped when he felt her smothering lips pressed against his face. A large hand reached around and held the back of his head, mashing it into her sloppy smooch. No point in fighting back now, the hero thought. He surrendered himself to it, trying to return the favor as best he could. But Helen was in charge and he was a passenger on this ride. She even probed inside briefly with her tongue. But both of them knew this was just a prelude to what's to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally detached herself from his face with a noisy <i>pop</i> he nearly hung limp in her embrace. His gaze was vacant and for a moment Helen worried she'd taken this too far. But then he finally spoke, adding nothing more than a bemused \"whoah...\" followed by a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you're all ready now.\" The hippo replied. She had felt his manhood poke against her, hardening during their kiss and leaking a little already. Not even his clone was this eager for action. Helen grabbed her large breasts and pulled them apart a little. \"C'mon now, Punchy. You know where you're needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero hadn't even noticed Helen had laid herself down on her back. Her kiss was that intense. Also, those big smothering lips had left him blinded for a most of it. He knew what she wanted and he was every bit as eager to provide it too. He shuffled down along her big belly. It grumbled a little as he passed, but he paid it no mind. Something to eat could be arranged later. Right now there was a bigger hunger that needed sating. He slid down until he was stood between her thick thighs. They were parted wide to give him a clear look at what he'd be dealing with next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpread out before him was Helen's drooling pussy, glistening and smooth. It twitched and moved at his every touch, a soft moan echoing from the other side of that big belly. He felt a little claustrophobic, surrounded on both sides by thighs so thick he couldn't look over them. Was he really about to commit to this? Maybe he shouldn't, just to prove to Shenny that she's the only one that mattered. But he already promised Helen this, and going back on his word now would break her heart. No, there was no more time for doubts or questions. He stepped forward, his erection aimed squarely at the gaping hole in front of him. Much like before the difference in size made it feel like a fruitless effort, but he wasn't about to let that stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, stick it in. I want to feel you inside me.\" Helen cooed, eager for the hero to get a move on. She wanted to reach down and take charge, but she'd promised to be gentle. Hopefully the hero got the message an~. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thought was derailed as she felt his shaft enter her. Any words she had devolved into lewd moaning as she keenly felt the entirety of his manhood sink into her. Just like before it was nowhere near enough to fill her up, but the sheer excitement of finally fucking the Pint Puncher made up for it in spades. She didn't know why he of all people had such a profound effect on her and she didn't care. Carefully she closed her legs, smothering most of the hero and keeping him locked in place. He could barely contain himself, breathing hastily until finally he came, moaning loudly. Helen wasn't too far behind and hearing his ecstasy pushed her over the edge too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher felt the hippo's legs strain and squeeze him tightly, a powerful reminder of Helen's strength. But the real action was happening around his crotch as her orgasm glazed it in pungent release. The feminine smell was amplified tenfold, hazing him a little. The hippo's pussy squeezed and undulated around his wilting shaft, eager to milk every last drop out of this encounter. Finally the two relaxed, her thighs releasing their crushing hold on the hero. Both were worn out, breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how to leave 'em satisfied, don't you, Punchy?\" the hippo joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... 's what superheroes do.\" He returned with a goofy smirk. Helen strained herself and sat back up, able to see the exhausted hero sitting in front of her. They exchanged big satisfied smiles. It was nice to be able to do this without needing to resort to violence for a change. But the hippo's greed wasn't wholly extinguished. There was still a lot of time before Shenny and Tifanny returned and Helen was more than a little curious to see how far she could get the Pint Puncher to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After we catch our breath... you up for more?\" She asked, hoping she didn't sound too blunt. The hero just smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" The hippo responded with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" The Pint Puncher could tell there was something on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... maybe we could... spice things up a bit?\" Helen mumbled, still worried that she was pushing her luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, I guess... What did you have in mind?\" The hero replied, raising a curious eyebrow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> A wave of shyness washed over Helen as she peered down at the eager hero. He was ready and willing to fulfill her wishes, that much was obvious by his erect manhood. Helen had dreamed of this exact scenario and she was still having some trouble adjusting to it. Still, she didn't want to keep her lover waiting. She took a deep breath and placed her hands on his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you inside me. <b><i>Deep</i></b>, inside me...\" she purred as her eyes went down to her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher smirked at her request. All things considered, it was a tad underwhelming. After spending weeks tending to Shenny's insatiable love tunnel, the thought of immersing himself in Helen's pussy seemed almost quaint. That wasn't to say that he wasn't interested. Aside from the obvious thrill of it, he saw it as a chance to put everything he learned with Shenny to use. He would see to it that by the time he was done, Helen would barely be able to form a coherent sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, I like that smile. You're thinking that this is gonna be a cakewalk, aren't you?\" she asked before falling back again with the hero in her arms. She pushed him down until his was face to face with her quivering lower lips. His smile widened as he was hit with the familiar scent of her arousal and the pleasant warmth that accompanied it. It certainly looked imposing, but the Pint Puncher wasn't one to shy away from a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well? Go on...\" Helen said with barely contained giddiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She couldn't see the hero past her breasts and stomach, yet she could somehow feel him grinning at her. In the past, she would've felt slighted at his aloof attitude but somehow it made her all the more excited. His next act took her by surprise, as he suddenly plunged his arm deep inside her pussy, forcing a gasp out of her. Her reaction brought another proud smirk to the hero's face, though he was mainly trying to gauge just how much space there was inside her love tunnel. It certainly was spacious, but one could never be too careful. He could feel it tugging at his arm, growing more and more hungry for his body as he ran his arm along her inner walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come oooon, stop teasing already...!\" Helen moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero was amazed at the how much restraint she was showing. He half-expected her to lose her patience with him and just force him inside of her, but she seemed to be dead set in allowing him to move at his own pace. He didn't want to keep her waiting for <i>too</i> long though. After taking a deep breath, he began to push his way inside, using both hands to pry her pussy open before pushing himself in headfirst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen's senses were thrown into complete disarray as pleasure washed over her. She writhed on the ground, moaning in ecstasy every time he moved inside her. She wasn't a stranger to having someone inside her in such a way, but never like this. They would struggle and squirm in desperation as they tried to get away. The hero's enthusiasm made it all the more enjoyable though, as would twist and turn in just the right way to make her cry out in bliss. If it wasn't evident before, he was making it quite clear that his sole focus was on wringing out as much pleasure from her as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Every whimper and moan the hippo made brought a smile to the Pint Puncher's face he continued to worm his way deeper. He had blown his load more than a few times while immersed in her hot love tunnel, his dick getting thorough massage with each movement he made. He didn't linger on it, as his attention was on Helen and making sure she was left properly satisfied. It was a struggle to move, as her snatch was a lot more snug than he was accustomed to, but he was determined to find the one spot that would trigger the loudest response from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It didn't take much time for him stumble upon it as he suddenly heard a gasp from outside. He grinned and immediately went to work, ravishing her g-spot with licks and kisses. The normally proud and domineering villainess was reduced to a hot sweating mess, her eyes rolling in the back of her head and her tongue hanging out of her mouth as a chorus of moans escaped her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh... fuck... P-Punchy...! Love you... love you so much...!\" she wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In an instant, the hero's face was hit with a hit with a torrent of her cum as she was brought to an intense orgasm. On the outside, Helen laid out on the ground, her chest heaving as she tried to collect herself. Many thoughts were running through her mind as she watched the slime beginning to pool at her legs. In her excitement, she had confessed her love for the Pint Puncher, a secret that she was prepared to take to her grave. She felt oddly content in that knowledge though. After all of that, there was no way she could keep her affection under wraps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once she finally caught her breath, she looked down to check on her pint sized lover and saw that he was...</span></div></div>",

Only a pair of feet were wiggling just beyond the soaking wet pussy of the hippo. She was still breathing heavily, worn out after such a dramatic climax. How could that little man manage so much even when he was crammed up her love tunnel? Did he practice this? Maybe him and Shenny were teaching eachother more than he realized. Whatever the reason might be, she couldn't be anything other than pleased with his performance. It seemed that for once his cockiness was warranted. But he didn't need to know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad at all, Punchy. I guess your girlfriend helped <i>you</i> get your act together too. That was much better than your usual panicked flailing. Was it good for you too? Kiss once for yes, two for no.\" She suggested with a barely suppressed snicker. The hippo waited and felt a rush of pleasure as the hero kissed her sensitive folds. Only one kiss, reason for Helen's smile to double in size. If he liked it, there was a good chance they'd do this again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. You wanna stay in there? Marinate a little more in my juices?\" She added, lowering her voice to a seductive whisper. It had little effect as the hippo soon felt two distinct kisses from inside. At this stage it probably was pushing her luck to keep him packed inside of her snatch any longer. With a weary sigh she reached down between her legs and grabbed the two feet poking out of her nethers. Helen paused, briefly entertaining the thought of pushing the hero back in completely, sealing him inside herself a little longer. But it didn't feel right to abuse the hero's trust like that. Not after the things he'd readily done for her. The hippo wasn't used to feeling this kind of remorse, especially for the Pint Puncher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero wiggled a little, the slime-soaked cavern around him squeezing tightly. He was surprised at the hippo's depth. There was no doubt he'd have been able to push himself in, but for her love tunnel to be able to house him completely exceeded his wildest expectations. It was still nowhere near as spacious as Shenny, but the wolfess did have a slight size advantage in general over the hippo, so that was to be expected. There was something to be said for how tight and cozy Helen's pussy felt, but it couldn't match his girlfriend's inviting chamber. Only his feet weren't held in the warm, snug grasp. A cold breeze rushed past them until a meaty hippo hand wrapped around his feet and pulled him free. In a single, wet squelch the hero was forcefully removed, Helen letting out one last distressed gasp as a wave of pleasure shot through her. She didn't bother moving the Pint Puncher any further than strictly necessary, leaving him in a large pool of her arousal. The stench was powerful, but for some reason the superhero didn't seem to mind it very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tapped... You are... a lot of fun, little guy...\" Helen's voice was still haggard from the intense experience. The hero wasn't faring much better. Though the hippo's blubbery body might've muffled it all, he had been moaning like crazy inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Didn't expect that ride to get this wild.\" The hero admitted sheepishly, causing the supervillain to chuckle. \"I'm gonna need a break, how about you?\" He continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No arguments there.\" Helen muttered and the two simply laid on the table, enjoying eachother's presence. Neither of them moved a muscle or said another word until the hippo finally broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what. If you help mediate with those goons at the I.S.E.A, I'll consider what you offered before. You know... helping out behind the scenes. So long as they don't stick me in a cage and prod me with needles again I reckon working with them is something I can do if the perks include access to you.\" She couldn't see it, but between her legs the superhero laid on his back with the biggest smile on his face. Not just for what he'd just done inside of her, but how he had pulled it off again. Another supervillain ready to fight the good fight. Getting the I.S.E.A.  to play ball would take some negotiating, but if he can manage to talk them into giving Shenny a chance, how hard could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany sat back and watched Shenny beaming with joy. The wolfess was surrounded by fans on all sides. They both had to be careful as they did decide to stay fairly large for their shopping trip. Waiting in line was for regular sized folks and people were a lot more polite to those that stood 20 feet tall. It also gave those throngs of fans more to admire. The mouse girl expected Shenny's reputation to have turned around after catching so many supervillains. But she wasn't prepared for what came next. A subtle tap on her arm alerted Tiffany to a nervous looking man staring up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y... You're Tiffany, right?\" He stammered awkwardly, blushing as he finished his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one and only. Can I help you? If you're a bit shy about approaching Shenny for an autograph, don't worry. She'll happily give you what you want.\" The mouse spoke calmly, pointing over to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenny? I want an autograph from you!\" The man replied, sounding a little surprised. The mouse girl's jaw fell open. She'd barely shown her face around town. Unlike Shenny, she had spent most of her time as a good guy working in a lab. And now she has a fan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell anyone, but I've always had a... a... a crush on you. I could never get close without worrying I'd end up as collateral damage. But now I was wondering... Could I get your autograph? Sorry if that sounded weird.\" With each sentence the man gets redder. Tiffany almost pities this odd little guy. It was more than a little strange that his crush apparently extended to her time as a villain. All the things she'd done to people just for her amusement, and he could still see something loveable? No amount of science could make sense of that to her. The mouse girl looks around shiftily, as though she was about to plan something nefarious. But instead she just leans down a little, grabbing the man with both hands and lifting him up to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you something even better to remember me by.\" She said with a seductive voice. The man gasped and wheezed, unable to form another coherent word as she pursed her lips. Tiffany gave her fan a big, wet smooch. His face was covered in a thick layer of drool, making the towering mouse girl giggle. \"Oops, too much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never washing this face again...\" The fan managed to sputter out as she set him back down on the ground. He stumbled away, seemingly drunk with joy. \"Best. Day. Ever.\" He said to nobody in particular, putting a proud grin on Tiffany's face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Several minutes went by before Shenny was able to depart from her ever growing crowd of fans. Most of them were innocent enough, beseeching her for an autograph or asking her to take a photo with them. There were a select few that wanted a bit more though. They seemed dead set on getting her to channel her old habits, as they begged to be stepped and used as her seat cushion. It didn't happen too often and she turned them down every time, but the temptation was always there in the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her attention turned to Tiffany who seemed have an extra kick in her step as they walked down the busy shopping district. She could hardly blame her for being so ecstatic. The wolfess could never forget just how proud she felt upon meeting her first fan. She considered it to be the defining moment in her super hero career, the moment where it all became worth it. It felt good to see her friend enjoying such a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany lead her friend all through the mall, often stopping to browse a clothes store. Shenny didn't quite share her enthusiasm as she perused each shop, mainly in part to her lack of interest in clothes. Tiffany was much more accustomed to wearing clothing than her, especially due to the environment she worked in. More than a few times the mouse would show off a tank top or a blouse to her and Shenny's replay would be in the form of a half-hearted compliment or a shrug. The giddy rodent never seemed to catch on however, as she continued to skip from shop to shop with her purchases hanging from her large fingers. Just when it seemed as though the rest of Shenny's day would be spent watching her friend buying clothes, something completely unexpected happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? Miss Shenny?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The wolfess blinked, her ears immediately perking up at the familiar voice coming from beneath her. She looked down and beaming at the young man standing at her feet. It was none other than the fan she had met the day she had fought Felicia. He was bit more formally dressed than before, wearing a grey business suit with a camera hanging from his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there! I haven't seen you in a while!\" she said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you recognize me?\" the young man asked, his heart soaring and his face turning bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I remember you. It's kind of hard to forget your first fan\" she said with a giggle as she patted the top of his head. \"So what've you been up to? You haven't been getting tangled up with anymore super villains, have you?\" she asked teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no,\" the young man laughed as he rubbed the back of his arm bashfully. \"Though I've had more than a few close calls. The boss pays top dollar for high quality photos, so being in the line of fire is almost a necessity for me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, are you a photographer or something?\" Shenny asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More of a reporter. Not a lot of people are willing to put themselves at risk when it comes to reporting on all the villains in the city, so I have to pick up the slack for them\" he said as he pushed his chest out proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny chuckled at his bravado. It certainly wasn't misplaced, given how bold he had proven himself to be in the past. Despite all the risks, he had dared to venture out with Felicia on the prowl just to try and get an autograph from his favorite heroine, and from what the Pint Puncher told her, he didn't even think twice before back-sassing the dangerous vixen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's mighty impressive. Just be sure that you don't get too overconfident. I'd hate for something to happen to my number one fan~\" She cooed as she patted the top of his head. The young man laughed and adjusted his tie bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You flatter me, Miss Shenny, but I'm not covering any villains at the moment. I was actually looking for <i>you</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Shenny asked with a raised brow. \"I guess I can see why. When you go from being a villain to a hero, people are gonna wanna know why\" she said with a smirk. \"Ask me anything. I'm an open book\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You misunderstand. I'm not here for an interview. See, ever since we began covering glam city's villains in our publication, we've had an increase in young male viewership. The boss decided to capitalize on our spike in readership by making section dedicated specifically to anthropomorphic beings, like yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that any different then now?\" Shenny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... we want to cater to our new demographic, so our new project needs to be much more... *cough* racy, if you catch my meaning\" the man said as he tugged on his shirt collar uncomfortably, his growing more and more red as he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny's smirk turned into a wide grin. She remembered her boyfriend talking about her potentially being on posters hung up on the walls of every teenage boy in the city, a thought that she took an immediate fancy to. She stood up to her full impressive height and placed a hand on her hip. Even from so high above, she could easily spot the tent forming in the reporter's pants as he eyed her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I <i>don't</i> think I know what you mean. Would you be so kind as to spell it out for me?\" she asked as she cocked her hip to the side. She struggled to keep from laughing as he looked her up from head to toe, sweat forming on his brow as he was no doubt fantasizing about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I-I would like you t-to um... be our pinup girl...\" he stammered nervously. He winced as Shenny's hand came down and yanked him from off the ground by his collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love to~\" Shenny sang happily before giving him a quick kiss on the top of his head before placing him back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The reporter staggered a bit as her kiss left him feeling flustered. He adjusted his suit and cleared his throat as he tried to collect himself, though his air of professionalism was slightly undermined by the boner he sported. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're happy to have you on board with the project, Miss Shenny. With you signed on, our success is a guarantee\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm always happy to please my fans. And it's just Shenny. No Miss\" she said with a chuckle. That brought another thought to mind. \"Now that I think about it... you never did tell me your name. Seems wrong for me to not know the name of my number one fan!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive my rudeness. My name is--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cole!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny blinked and looked over to see Tiffany running up to the young reporter, her arms filled with shopping backs. She squealed in glee as she hugged him tightly, his face being mashed against her breasts as she ragdolled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen you in sooooo long! Why haven't you been visiting the institute? I've been dying to talk to you!\" she cried happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiff... you might wanna ease up a bit\" Shenny snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany blinked and looked down to see the young man pushing against her stomach to free himself. As pleasant as her breasts felt, it was hard to focus on that when the air was being forced out of his lungs. She loosened her grip and let him fall onto the ground. She smiled sheepishly as she watched him gasp for air before standing up and brushing himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's... good to see you too, Miss Tiffany\" the man said with a weakened smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenny, this is my friend Cole. He used to come around to interview the staff. Miss Wong didn't like him being around the lab, but he'd come around and talk to me every now and again\" she said as she wrapped and arm around the shy young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've met. He was just asking me to be a pinup girl\" Shenny said as she ran a hand down her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! That is so <i>awesome</i>\" the mouse exclaimed before she looked down at Cole with a playful pout. \"If it's anthro girls you wanted, you could'a always come to me\" she whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried pitching you, but the senior editor insisted on Shenny on account of her notoriety. If all goes well and we hit the sells we're looking for, you'll be the first person I come to for the next issue\" he said with a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good, but why not use the both of us?\" Shenny suggested. \"I understand why they'd want me, but I don't see why Tiffany can't be on board too. She's done her part in helping us fight crime in the city, what with her and Dr. Wong making gadgets for us\" Shenny said folding her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shen, it's fine. I was just teasing\" Tiffany said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I want you to do this with me. You and Wong don't get nearly enough credit for everything you do for us. It's only right that I share the spotlight with you. Besides, being in a magazine is great... but being in a magazine with my best friend is even better\" she said before looking down at Cole. \"What do you say? Think you can fit her in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cole sighed and scratched his chin as she thought it over.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The photographer could see the eagerness on both heroines' faces. He furrowed his brow and thought about how to keep everyone happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I can handle a shoot with both of you, but knowing my senior editor he'll probably stick to mostly using Shenny's pictures. But if it's a hit the next issue will probably feature a lot of group shots. Now then, let's head for the parking lot, so we've got some space to work with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany was excited just to be part of the shoot, but Shenny was still a little peeved to see her friend get sidelined like that. Did these guys not see the same wildly attractive mouse girl that she saw? Plenty of fans were ogling her as much as they were staring at the wolfess herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. But if there's no pictures of Tiffany at all I'm coming over to your head office to give that editor of yours a piece of my mind.\" Shenny grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duly noted.\" Cole stammered in response. Though he was her biggest fan, it didn't take much for the large wolf to send a chill down his spine. He guided the pair outside and directed Shenny for the first few shots. She was a natural at finding alluring poses for him to photograph, showing off her titanic curvaceous body. She grew and shrank to help add to the perspective. It didn't take long before the wolfess could even spot a little bulge in his pants. Seems like she was giving him exactly what he was looking for. And if everything went right, her beauty would soon adorn this whole city. She couldn't wait to get her friend a taste of that limelight too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver to the side the mouse girl had filled a few parking spaces with all her bags, mulling over what to wear for her pictures. At times she'd also watch Shenny make merry with the camera, giving her everything. Modeling seemed to come so easy to the wolfess. Tiffany was finally called over when Cole had filled up his camera's first memory card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about this Shen, I can't even decide what to wear.\" She said with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing pinups for horny teens. I think 'less is more' definitely applies here. Just imagine you're trying to seduce Punchy. Show yourself at your hottest, I know you can do it.\" The wolfess encouraged her, giving her a comforting hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany found her confidence and strode up to the spot. Cole was ready for her, but he didn't expect the mouse to start off by shedding nearly everything she was wearing. He took plenty of pictures as she undressed herself until only a thin bikini bottom was left to give things the slightest air of modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit! You're doing great!\" Shenny yelled from the sidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling brave, the mouse girl threw her everything into showing herself off like she'd just seen her friend do. She played to her great size, even picking up the photographer to provide some unique perspectives to her towering form. It helped that she knew Cole from before, as any other reporter/photographer might've wet himself with fear in her grasp. After a copious amount of shots of her tits and ass she set him back down, blushing a little. Tiffany wasn't used to exposing herself like this, but it certainly drew attention to her. On the edges of the parking lot several enamored fans were watching the whole thing intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great stuff so far. Now let's get a few with both of you together.\" Cole said, feeling excited about the possibilities. The two titans took to the group shots with gusto, finding all kinds of dramatic and arousing poses. They capped it off by letting the amassed fans in on one last shot of the two of them standing firm to protect them from evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome. I dare my editor not to use those.\" The photographer boasted whilst packing away his gear. Tiffany slipped back into her regular attire and got ready to take her bags and perhaps head back home with Shenny. There were only a few shops left unvisited, but she'd already found so many nice things. In the middle of it all she felt the wolfess' hand on her shoulder. Shenny whispered in her ear and a big smile curled up onto her face. The mouse girl let out a devious giggle before approaching Cole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for agreeing to take pictures of me too. I reckon that sort of kindness should be... rewarded.\" She said seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole grinned, seeing her reach down to grab him again. He quickly put down his gear and let Tiffany do her thing. He could already guess what was about to happen as her large pursed lips closed in. Suddenly a shadow rose up behind him as Shenny had snuck in to 'assist' her friend. The photographer found himself getting smooched from both sides, warm breath washing over him as the two set about rewarding his work in the one way they knew all men appreciated. Their king-sized kiss smothered his whole head for a few seconds. Tifanny could feel his excitement, a tiny bulge poking into the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mwah! There. I reckon that oughta do it. If you need us for another session, feel free to visit by the I.S.E.A. I'm sure something could be arranged.\" Tiffany mused as she set Cole back down. Already her mind was spinning with other possibilities. Maybe some action shots with the Pint Puncher too. Or maybe they could show the latest crop of villains turned to heroes. It would help to get the word out that not every superpowered animal is a villain these days. Then again, with all the irredeemable cases still locked up in their cells, it was probably better not to be too hasty with this. It took time for people to warm up to Shenny and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey parted ways with the mouse girl still mulling things over. But opposite to Tiffany's ponderous staring Shenny's smile couldn't be bigger. Her dream of being adored by many was another step closer as soon posters of her would spread through Glam City. And her friend was there along for the ride. This day couldn't get any better. </span></div></div>",

I wanted to show my tits off, but I don't want people thinking I'm some kind of floozy. I <i>am</i> a representative of the institute, after all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny smirked as her friend prattled on excitedly. Whether or not Cole made good on his word to push for Tiffany's involvement in the project, seeing her in such high spirits made it worth it all the same. Of course, that didn't make her previous threat any less sincere. Her current occupation prevented her from heading over to their offices and ripping the roof off to get her hands on the senior editor, but given her intimidating size, she wouldn't have to do much but stand outside his office window and glare at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shen? Are you even listening? Come on, this is super important! I wanna make sure Punchy likes all the outfits I got\" the mouse whined as she patted her on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you they looked good when you first tried them on. Doesn't my opinion amount to anything?\" Shenny asked with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you're only said that because you were bored and wanted to leave!\" Tiffany answered back with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny sighed and rubbed the back of her head with an embarrassed smile She had hoped that Tiffany would take notice to her disinterest, but she wasn't exactly the most subtle actor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True... but that doesn't mean I wasn't being honest\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, whatever. You were just trying to be friendly\" Tiffany said as she rolled her eyes . She blinked as Shenny's expression soured as though she had just been insulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiff, you really need to stop putting yourself down like that. Someone who looks like you has no business being so self-conscious\" she said shaking her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you blame me though?\" Tiffany asked with an awkward laugh. \"How can someone not feel like a Plain Jane standing next to a knockout like you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiff...\" Shenny began with a heavy sigh. \"You wanna know why I don't care about the clothes you picked out? As far as I'm concerned, you're the most attractive woman I've seen in this city. You putting on all those outfits means nothing to me, because I'd honest prefer seeing you without clothes at all\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany was left speechless at her praise, her face turning a bright shade of red. As often as she received compliments from her peers at the institution, they didn't carry as much weight as Shenny's.  She'd always been envious of her friend's beauty, going as far back as when the two of them first met. Just looking at the wolfess' perfect curvature and flawless physique was enough to make her feel inadequate. For such glowing statements to come from someone as beautiful as her, Tiffany couldn't help but feel flattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny smiled and patted her friend on the shoulder before continuing on her way. She wasn't lying when she said what she said, but part of her was trying to make up for all she had said during their time as villains. The two of them would squabble often, and that usually led to them trading insults back and forth. More than a few times, Shenny had made cracks about the mouse's weight, something she was very much ashamed of in hindsight. In truth, she was a bit jealous of Tiffany's massive tit and plush ass. She certainly wasn't lacking in that department herself, but she always admired how the mouse was able to topple buildings with the sheer force of her impressive rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The trip back home was punctuated by an awkward silence, save for the few times the two stopped to wave to a fan. Tiffany kept her face forward, though she would occasionally steal a glance at Shenny. She wanted to say something, to bring attention to wellspring of emotions bubbling up in her stomach, but she found it difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a minute...\" Shenny muttered as she came to a stop. She squinted her eyes as she examined their current location. Tiffany was about to question her when the wolfess' face suddenly lit up with a bright smile. \"I know where we are!\" she cried excitedly before grabbing onto Tiffany's hand and pulling her along as she trotted down the street in the direction of the city shoreline. Once they arrived, she turned to Tiffany and gestured to their new environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't this place ring any bells?\" she asked before walking over and sitting down in the sand and letting her feet soak in the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... can't say it does\" Tiffany responded as she examined the area. Aside from them, the shore was devoid of activity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where we first met! Remember? I had just gotten through weekly rampage and I came here to wash up\" she explained before turning and and pointing to the sidewalk leading up to the shore. \"You called out to me from over there. You said that you didn't want another giant muscling in on your turf\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The finer details of the incident remained a mystery to Tiffany, though the mention of Shenny bathing was more than enough to jog her memory. Like Shenny, she was just coming off a recent crime spree, her body aching as she just barely managed to come out on top against the Pint Puncher, his body left in a giant ass shaped crater downtown. Her near loss put her in a sour mood and was still itching for a fight. Shenny just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time... although given the outcome of that fight, the opposite might've been true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's coming back to you, isn't it? Our first fight\" Shenny said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I can still feel it in my jaw\" Tiffany giggled as she sat down beside her. \"You've got to admit, I didn't do half bad for someone who just got through fighting Punchy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. Funnily enough, if you'd told me that you were keeping Punchy busy, we would've been friend much sooner\" Shenny said, giving her playful jab on the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... that never even occurred to me until now. Hindsight's twenty twenty, I guess\" Tiffany said with a shrug,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny nodded and turned her attention to the water rippling against the shore. She wasn't accustomed to such a quiet and serene setting. It was the perfect atmosphere to pause and reflect, two things that she rarely made time for, if ever. She thought about the direction her lie had suddenly taken and it dawned on her just how much she had to be thankful for. She had a loving boyfriend, a wonderful job, and the respect and adulation of a decent portion of the city. If she were to go back in time and tell her past self that she would later have all these things and more, her past self would no doubt scoff at the notion. Her old self was concerned with tending to her petty hungers and would've been incapable of appreciating such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shenny\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The amazon was broken from her thoughts as she turned to face Tiffany. Judging by the wistful expression on her face, she too had taken time to reflect on things. She turned to Shenny and smiled, a light blush touching her face as she took a moment to organize her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of me? Like... overall?\" she asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her caught Shenny for a loop as she raised a brow at her. It didn't really require much consideration on her part, as she couldn't possibly have a higher opinion of her than she already did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you're cute, you're funny, and aside from Punchy, I can't think of someone I care about as much as I do you\" she said, patting the mouse on the shoulder. \"What, are you feeling self-conscious <i>again</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I just... um... when you say 'cute', like... what do you mean? Do you think I'm mean my personality or...?\" she asked before trailing off bashfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Shenny answer back with a chuckle. \"What's this all about, Tiff? If you're feeling a certain way, you know you can talk to me about it\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany sighed and nodded. She had hoped to slowly work up the nerve to speak her mind, but knowing Shenny, approaching the subject head on would prove much more effective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shen. Do you think it's possible for us to be more than just friends?\" she asked bluntly, her face growing red hot as she stared deeply into Shenny's eyes. Her stomach turned a bit when Shenny's only response came in the form of a blank stare. Had she crossed the line in trying to push their relation even further? Her fears were quickly dismissed as Shenny leaned in forward and wrapped an arm around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, we aren't already?\" she chuckled before pulling her friend in for a deep and passionate kiss. This would mark the first and only time that their lips met without the Pint Puncher in the middle, though that didn't make it any less effective. After a minute, Shenny pulled back to catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I think about it, we never did make it official, did we? I just assumed you had come to the same conclusion that I had\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well excuse me for not picking up on hints...\" Tiffany said with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiff, after everything we've done together, all the times we bathed together, all the times we slept in the same bed, all the times I've talked about how great your tits were, you really didn't pick up on anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany huffed and folded her arms. When she broke it down like that, it <i>was</i> rather ridiculous for her to have assumed that her feelings wouldn't be reciprocated. Shenny laughed at her friend's indignant expression before giving her a quick peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, Tiff. Is that better?\" she cooed in a playfully condescending manner. Tiffany answered back with a kiss of her own, her eyes lit with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very~\" She murmured softly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tiffany quickly scanned the beach around them to make sure there were no stray humans to get in the way of what she had planned. When it seemed all clear she threw and arm around Shenny and surprised the wolfess by pulling her over. The giant mouse girl laid herself down in the sand, draping her friend on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" Shenny exclaimed before catching on to Tiffany's ideas. She let herself flop onto her friend and crawled forward a bit to reward that stunt of hers with a big loving smooch. Both titans closed their eyes and laid in a passionate embrace, kissing eachother like never before. But before this heated moment could go any further a loud voice cut through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! This will be even easier than I thought. Shenny! My name is Tallio and I am here to kick your ass! I've taken on and beaten your dumb little boyfriend several times in the past and after I deal with you he'll never have the nerve to bother me again!\" A reindeer man shouted at the two titans. He stood just over twice as tall as the average human, which still didn't put him past their kneecaps if they were on their feet. His tawny fur bristled as he stood confidently before them. They both looked at eachother, bemused by the spectacle, before addressing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have we met?!\" Shenny asked, visibly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're all over the news! A supervillain gone soft and helping these disgusting people. How can you look at these things and feel like they need protection?\" Tallio gestured around him. Surrounding the deer were several copies of him, all frozen in place. He runs down and grabs another bystander to demonstrate his powers. He locks the man in a powerful bearhug before dissipating in a wisp of smoke, leaving behind an image of himself keeping the man pinned. Even the Pint Puncher's strength wasn't always enough to shatter these illusions. He let out a maniacal laugh, the two heroes already growing weary of his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now feel my wrath!\" The reindeer charged towards the two, but before he could get a swing in Shenny grabbed his head and pulled him off his feet. She got up a little, dumping the smaller villain on Tiffany's belly before letting herself slump down again. In an instant Tallio was slammed between two soft surfaces, the immense pressure pinning him in place. Even with his strength, all he could manage was useless wriggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simmer down! Once you've learned your lesson we'll let you out.\" Shenny said with a chuckle before turning her attention back towards Tiffany. \"Now... where were we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse girl giggles a little, feeling the villain tickle her belly. She reaches up and puts a hand behind Shenny's head, guiding it back into a lengthy makeout session. Every beachfront property in Glam City was treated to the sight of the two titans making out, but neither of them gave a damn. This was their moment, not to be interrupted by spectators and especially not upstart little supervillains who were in over their heads. As their vast bodies rubbed against one another they felt the reindeer getting squashed and rolled around between them. Soon his resistance petered out, but they weren't done yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTallio is forced to endure more torment as Shenny and Tiffany attempt to catch up with years of unrequited love one lengthy kiss at a time. Though the idea of turning this into an ever lewder spectacle arises, the last vestiges of common sense still present steer them away from it. Perhaps something to get into back at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly an hour of intimate playing on the beach the two finally decide they've had enough. The sun was quickly disappearing behind the horizon. Shenny sat up, laughing a little as Tallio's flattened form was revealed. He didn't move, too worn out from the relentless squashing he'd endured. The wolfess helped her friend back onto her feet and Tifanny gave the institute a quick call to pick him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're gonna wait here for the people of the I.S.E.A. to take you away and you'll be a good boy, understood? Otherwise I'll have to bring you there myself and I'll want to have some more 'fun' with you on the way there.\" Shenny growled menacingly, holding her victim in a tight grip. The reindeer man weakly nodded, humiliated by how easily the two titans dominated him. After her call the giant mouse girl went over to the trapped people near the pier. She easily overpowered Tallio's illusions, apologizing for not freeing the townsfolk sooner. Most of them didn't respond, but one guy shouted up: \"After a show like that, take all the time you need!\" Tiffany blushed brightly before joining up with her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go home, Shen. I reckon your boyfriend has had quite enough time with Helen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, he better. Though I wouldn't be surprised if they managed to do something dumb and get him stuck inside her somehow.\" Shenny said with a chuckle. The greedy hippo wasn't exactly known for her subtlety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna bet? Winner gets Punchy for the night.\" Tiffany responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all that...\" Shenny points over to the large indent they left in the beach. \"...I think we should treat Punchy to two giant bodies to sleep between.\" A reaction that draws a gleeful squeak from the titanic mouse<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they leave Tiffany hurriedly straightens up the beach to remove most traces of their amorous session. Only a few large footprints are left behind when the two finally choose to leave. They quickly reach the edge of the forest and share a few more kisses on the way to Shenny's home. When they arrive...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Though the two giants arrived home in high spirits, Shenny couldn't help but be a bit on edge. She trusted her boyfriend to keep things under control in her absence but Helen had proven herself to be a chaotic element. Her amicable attitude could've easily been a facade to lull them all into a false sense of security. It was an troubling thought to be sure, yet Shenny found the prospect of her betrayal less rage inducing and more somber as she felt a genuine connection building between the two of them from their time spent alone together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny and Tiffany stepped into the room expecting the worst, but were both pleasantly surprised as they found Helen sitting on the table with her legs crossed. The Pint Puncher was no where to be seen, oddly enough. Helen blinked as she turned to greet the two with a bright smile. Her fun with the Pint Puncher had improved her mood considerably and it showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there. You two were gone for a while. Brought back anything interesting?\" she asked curiously. Tiffany beamed as she began digging through her bags. She was excited to have someone take an interest in her purchases. Before she could begin gushing about all the dresses she bought, Shenny spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Punchy?\" she asked as she narrowed her eyes at the hippo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen rolled her eyes and sighed as she stood to her feet. Shenny's expression shifted from suspicion to surprise as she found her boyfriend squashed flat as a sheet against the hippo's naked ass, his body perfectly conforming to every curve and contour. Helen looked up at her with a sheepish smile as she went to work peeling him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you get your panties in a wad, this was <i>his</i> idea\" she explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny was stuck for something to say as she watched her boyfriend's body gradually reshape itself. She knew to take Helen's word with a grain of salt, so she would trust him to verify. Once he was whole again, he stumbled to his feet and shook his head to try and collect himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The idea was... to try and build... a tolerance to gas based enemies\" he panted. The smell of Helen's sweat was burned into his memory for all time, though his hardened cock made it clear that this wasn't an inconvenience for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He gets an advantage over baddies, I get to use him as a seat cushion. How could I turn down an offer like that?\" Helen asked with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny frowned, though the hippo had a point. If the he was foolhardy enough to try propose something like that, she couldn't fault her for taking him up on it. She knelt down and examined the hero, her nose curling at the numerous stenches wafting from him. Helen certainly kept him busy while they were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all well and good, but I don't wanna come home to my boyfriend smelling like ass. Come on, it's time to wash up\" she ordered as she picked the hero up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just mad because he doesn't smell like <i>your</i> ass\" Helen teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get moving too, miss. You're practically soaked in sweat\" she said as she pointed in the direction of the springs. Helen simply shrugged and followed from behind, though she still had a smile on her face as she looked at the haggard looking hero. The evening they shared was truly something special. She didn't expect many opportunities to recreate it in the future, but after all the fun they'd had, it made her decision to remain under their roof worthwhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?! You beat him, just like that?!\" The Pint Puncher cried incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I don't know what you're getting all worked up for. He was just loudmouthed punk\" Shenny replied with the shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher's face burned red hot with shame. Of all the foes he had battled over the years, few inspired more dread for him than Tallio. He didn't always come out on top when they squared off, but almost every time they fought, the hero wound up with his stomach bloated and his ass sore. There was some catharsis in how easily his girlfriend dispensed with him as if he were nothing more than a pest, but it was more than a little embarrassing considering how much trouble the villain had given him in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Punchy\" Helen said with a snicker. \"We've all caught you on a bad day at some point. No need to be embarrassed\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero nodded with a slight smile. Of all people to give him reassurance, he never thought it would come from Helen. All four of them were in the spring, the warm water working its magic on their bodies as they leisurely lazed about. Shenny had recounted all the details of her day out with Tiffany, from meeting her fans, to the photo shoot, and finally to their passionate makeout session on the beach. The Pint Puncher took the news of their romance exceptionally well, delighting the giant lovers as they sat beside each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get back to something more positive. How long do you think it'll be before the magazine comes out with all your photos?\" Helen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cole didn't say, though the 'Glam City Gazette' typically comes out once a week\" Tiffany said with before going into a fit of giggles. \"I cannot <i>wait</i>! Miss Wong is gonna freak when sees it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I somehow doubt that\" Helen snorted. \"You'd have better luck drawing blood from a stone then getting her to emote\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hate to say it, but Helen's right. Science and sweets are the only things I've ever seen her show any enthusiasm for\" the hero added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why everyone talks like Miss Wong is some crusty old grump. She's one of the nicest, sweetest people I've ever met. She just... has a different way of showing it is all\" the mouse said with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Last time I seen her, she was poking and prodding me like some kind of freak. I don't exactly have a high opinion of her as is\" Helen said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany pouted, though she offered no rebuttal. She couldn't blame Helen for feeling the way she did. After all, it wasn't too long ago that she herself was being experimented on without consent. She remembered how degrading it felt to have her agency stripped away in the name of science. It was during one of those experiments however, that Tiffany made her first breakthrough into rehabilitation. She was going through yet another one of her maniacal tirades when the good doctor cut her off and dispensed some harsh truths to her. She wasn't the least bit obliged to speak to Tiffany during those experiments, but something had compelled her to speak out and tell the mouse what she needed to hear. Because of that, she was currently reclining with the two people she loved most in the world, and that alone made her eternally grateful towards the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think's about time we turned in for the night. My beautiful skin is starting to get all pruned up\" Helen said before standing up out of the waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I've got a busy day at work tomorrow. Miss Wong can't be happy with all the time she was forced to spend with Rowland\" Tiffany said with a sigh as she stood up to join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny nodded, though her thoughts were elsewhere as she looked up at her lover's naked body. She was eager to pick up where they left off at the beach, though she was at odd as to how to go about it. The two of them had included the Pint Puncher in all of their games of romance and she was worried about him being a third wheel this time around. Then that left Helen. It would've been awkward to have her sitting in the room by herself while she and Tiffany had their fun. She thought it over on the way back to her domicile and by the time they arrived, she had made her decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright, let's make this a night to remember.\" Shenny thought aloud as she took Tiffany's hand and guided her to the bedroom. The giant mouse girl was more than enthusiastic to join in on whatever the wolfess had in mind. After their session on the beach she couldn't wait to get more intimate. The Pint Puncher and Helen exchanged curious glances. Last they saw the two titans were friendly with eachother, but this seemed something different entirely. Was this the reason his girlfriend was so ready and willing to let him and Helen have fun together? The superhero's daydreaming caught the attention of Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Punchy. You're about to get your world rocked.\" She beckoned. But when only the Pint Puncher responded the wolfess extended her hand to Helen. \"You didn't think I was going to leave you out of this, right?\" She said with a smirk. The hippo rolled her eyes at the cheesy remark before getting on her feet, curious to see what the hell kind of foursome Shenny had in mind. The wolfess was quick to lay herself out on the bed, spreading her legs to give the others a good look at her soaking wet pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me this isn't giving you ideas...\" Shenny mused seductively. The towering mouse girl loomed over the other two as he helped the hippo climb up onto the bed. Tiffany hadn't bothered to put on a single garment after their bath, feeling confident after her talk with the wolfess. But as she saw the scenario unfold before her she got an even more arousing idea. Before today she'd never have dared to ask this of Shenny, but now the mouse felt determined. It had been on her mind for some time now and finally she worked up the courage to lean in close and whisper her idea in the wolfess' ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny first looked at her friend with surprise, but soon that same eager smile crept back onto her face. She liked the way Tiffany was thinking and quickly informed the other two of this change of plans. \"So Punchy... shall I put you in your 'room'?\" The wolfess said, massaging her drooling pussy. The hero didn't need to be told twice. He yearned for the comforting warmth of his girlfriend and nodded fiercely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how about you get a little bit of... company in there...\" Shenny's smile widened as she glanced at the others. Helen gulped. As much as she was eager to play more lewd games with the Pint Puncher, the thought of being swallowed up by the wolfess' snatch was a step too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Shen, but I reckon I'm gonna sit out on that one. Maybe let you and Punchy catch up a bit after I've had him all day.\" Her remark seemed to confuse the horny titanic wolf, but not quite for the reason she'd expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... I guess that could've worked too... But I was actually referring to Tiff.\" She muttered, causing the hippo to snap her neck around and see that the towering mouse woman was gone. Instead she stood on the bed just beside the superhero, having brought her size down to be almost as small as him. She still stood a good foot taller, letting the back of his head be supported by her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher wasn't sure how to respond to this with anything other than an enthusiastic nod. Shenny gave him a lewd wink before reaching down and grabbing both her lovers in one hand, bringing them to their destination. Against all odds the wolfess' hungering sex looked even wetter up close as she plunged both of them in at the same time. She was confident even someone as girthy as Helen could be swallowed up in there, so two human-sized prey were no match for the ravenous love tunnel that eagerly pulled them in. In mere moments it had finished the task, Shenny moaning loudly the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany wouldn't have dared to ask this before, but now it had really happened. She got the most intimate look at her girlfriend she could've ever imagined. And to top it all of the Pint Puncher was in here with her. She held him close, feeling his body get pressed against hers with every squeeze of the slime-drenched walls around her. It felt strange to be intimate with him at the same size, but it did little to dull the romance. \"Shall we turn up the heat in here?\" She whispers in his ear. The superhero looks a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure Shenny will be okay with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be more offended if we <i>don't</i> get it on, Punchy. Now stop holding yourself back and let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough still hesitant at first, the hero slowly guides his manhood towards her pussy. He was unsurprisingly rock hard, but what man wouldn't be in his position? Moments from having sex with a wonderful mouse woman whilst completely enveloped by the pussy of his girlfriend. He finds his mark and Tiffany moans as he sticks it in. He felt so big now that she wasn't ten times his size. Part of her even thought about reducing her size just so he could fill her even more thoroughly. But she wanted to be in charge still, grabbing the hero firmly and trying to dictate his pace. But neither of them could do much to stop Shenny from running the show instead. The inner walls came down on them and released them with a steady pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst Shenny slowly adjusted to the pair having sex inside of her she drew her attention to Helen. Though the hippo seemed content the wolfess still felt bad about not involving her. There was no doubt in her mind that she could fit in a third, even one as hefty as Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you don't want in on this?\" The wolfess almost managed to sound sad at the prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. It's been a long day. Being around Punchy like that can be surprisingly exhausting. I don't know how you keep up with him all day.\" The hippo joked. Shenny offered a chuckle in return before a moan interrupted it. The two moving inside her felt exquisite. She was tempted to use Helen's status as their prisoner to overrule her objections, but that seemed like something only the lust-crazed Shenny of old would do. The wolfess didn't like being reminded of her past, shivering a little before being filled with pleasure once more thanks to Tiffany and the Pint Puncher going at it in her pussy.</span></div></div>",

She was used to dictating the pace during sex and always felt uncomfortable when relinquishing control to others. Still, her lack of enthusiasm saddened the wolfess a bit. She had hoped that Helen would come to trust her already, but that might've been expecting too much, especially given how little time they'd spent with each other. She didn't linger on it for long as pleasure surged through her, her two lovers becoming more and more wily down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Inside the giant's love tunnel, Tiffany and the Pint Puncher were in a frenzy as they made vigorously made love. Tiffany had the hero pinned down, her thick hips pounding into his and her arms wrapped tightly around the back of his neck. The hero was determined to keep up with her as bucked his hips, meeting her halfway with each movement she made. Between the intoxicating aroma surrounding him, the plush breasts smothering his face, and Tiffany's hungry pussy squeezing and pulling at his cock, he couldn't even begin to count the amount of times he came. The two went on for what seemed like hours, neither of them showing any sign of tiring out as they were lost in a passion induced trance. It was only when the two heard a familiar rumbling noise that they were brought back to the present. The walls around them squeezed around them one more time before a tidal wave of slime rushed forth and deposited the two onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny wiped the sweat from her brow as she peered down at her two miniscule lovers with a smile. Some time ago, she would've been enraged to see their ' bodies intertwined in such a compromising positon, but now she delighted in seeing the two people she loved most in the word together and coated in her juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... that was... something...\" Tiffany chuckled as she stood to her feet. She stumbled a bit, her legs feeling a bit wobbly after the intense experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm definitely gonna be sore tomorrow\" the hero added as he sat up. Exhaustion had finally catch up to him as he took a moment to catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny laughed, though attention shifted over to the hippo watching on with a smirk on her face and a hand on her chin. Shenny knew well what that look meant, having seen it numerous times whenever the two worked together in the past. The gears in were turning in the hippo's head and that usually meant that something interesting was about to happen. Given her track record of unique plans, Shenny was eager to see what she had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen, would you like to make some suggestions?\" she asked, not even attempting to hide the giddiness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends. Are you willing to let me take the reigns?\" the hippo inquired with a shrewed grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny raised a brow and looked down at her boyfriend as if to ask his input. To her surprise, he didn't even hesitate to respond with an enthusiastic nod. She expected him to be the voice of reason and disuade him from putting her trust in their supposed \"prisoner\", but it would seem like their alone time had created an unspoken level of trust between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Helen. What do you have in mind?\" Shenny asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All eyes turned to Helen as she walked up to the Pint Puncher and pulled him up to his feet. She eyed him for a second, her attention focused primarily on his crotch. She licked her lips hungrily and knelt down to whisper into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be a dear and fetch me those bracelets Shenny told me about\" She instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her request catch the hero off guard, though he did as he was told as he flew off to retrieve them. Once he was gone, she turned her attention to Tiffany. \"Now you. Grow until you've matched Shenny in size.\" Tiffany blinked and looked up to Shenny who simply shrugged. Curious to see where this was going, Tiffany quickly shot up to her maximum size and scuttled over to sit beside her colossal friend. Her eyes went wide as the hero came flying back, the size modifying bracers in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, listen\" Helen began as her expression became uncharacteristically serious. \"You guys have been pretty easygoing with letting me do as I please around here and don't think that it isn't appreciated. I'll be honest, I'm still flabbergasted as to how you can have so much trust in me. What I have planned next is gonna push things over line though. For this to work, I need you two to be in a very vulnerable position and\u2026 well\u2026 I don't want to do this if you don't feel comfortable with that. I mean, it's barely been a day since we were last at each others throats. I can understand if you don't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come ooon, get on with it!\" Tiffany whined with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Don't leave us hanging!\" Shenny said with a lustful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen was dumbstruck at their enthusiasm. Neither of them seemed the least bit cautious in placing their trust in her. The same went for the Pint Puncher as he placed the bracers onto his wrists without a moment of delay. Normally, the hippo would've scoffed at them being so trusting of her. She tried to maintain her usual cynicism, but she couldn't bring herself to feel anything other than pride. It made her heart swell to see her former foes so eager to engage in her games. Not wanting to keep them waiting, she pointed to the two giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you two. Grab onto Punchy and use your powers make him grow. The two of you together should make him doubly huge\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany and Shenny glanced at each other, neither of them fully catching on to what Helen had in mind. Still, the thought of a monolithic Pint Puncher was too tempting to pass up. Shenny grabbed onto the hero, Tiffany following suit as she clasped her hand over hers, completely obscuring their tiny lover. The two closed their eyes focused on shrinking down, a warmth radiating from the Pint Puncher's bracers as they used their abilities to make him shoot up in size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a few minutes, the warmth dissipated. Tiffany opened her eyes and let out a noise that sounded like something between a gasp and a hiccup. She and Shenny were standing in the middle of the Pint Puncher's palm, surrounded by fingers the size of oak wood trees. Her eyes slowly traveled the fleshy landscape and up to the hero's colossal smiling face. Shenny's home was built to accommodate her great size and her boyfriend was large enough reach up and touch the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I made sure to get off the bed before I got too big. Are you two alright?\" he asked as softly as he could manage, his voice still managing to resonate through the room despite his efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany could only respond with a nod as she was still stuck speechless. Shenny was also silent, though her attention was elsewhere as she peered over the edge of her boyfriend's hand, her eyes trained on his crotch. She practically salivated as she thought back to all the fun they had during their first test run of the bracers. She remembered vividly how much she worshiped his mind-bogglingly large cock and she was dying to get back down there again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! We're not done yet!\" Helen shouted up at the hero, her words catching his powerful ears as he looked down at her. \"That was only part one! Now I want you to...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Pint Puncher smiled, understanding the type of role reversal the hippo was looking to set up. But something else caught his eye. He couldn't help but chuckle as he looked down at the pair in his hand. Both of them seemed entranced, staring at his erection. He slowly brought them closer whilst answering Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but first I think these two want to play a little. You wanna shrink down and join em?\" The superhero asked suggestively. The hippo returned a wry smirk. \"Thanks, but I'll pass. Also, what did you do to them? They look hypnotized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't get to see me like this very often. I guess they like what they're seeing.\" He mused aloud before talking to the two tinies in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to play with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny and Tiffany snapped out of their enamored staring long enough to nod feverishly and the hero quickly obliged. He brought his hand near the tip of his boner and let it rest in his palm. There wasn't much space for the wolfess and the mouse any more, but they didn't mind. Both of them threw themselves against the warm, smooth surface of the Pint Puncher's cockhead. The hero moaned a little, trying to keep steady so they wouldn't be thrown off. But he knew that this could only get more intense. Pre began to leak from the engorged mass and his girlfriend was ready as ever to sample it. The superhero didn't know whether it was his musk or just her latent desires, but seeing her this eager for his dick was always a little unsettling. It reminded him of the mindless horny beast she used to be. Stranger yet was seeing Tiffany join in with very little hesitation. The mouse girl was usually more composed, but now she seemed to indulge her urges as readily as his girlfriend was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess lapped away at the hero's cock, her tongue occasionally pushing in the slit. The hero's manhood was wider than she was tall and only one thought dominated Shenny's mind. She'd been in once before and she wanted to go again. She needed a helping hand last time, but the hero was twice as big now and that hole looked almost eager to have her. With a sly grin she turned to Tiffany and said: \"Watch this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse girl's jaw fell open when she saw what Shenny was doing. The wolfess laid herself on her back in the hero's palm, letting her feet rest against the pulsing hole. It opened and in a flash she plunged both legs in up to the hip. A loud gasp echoed from above, but the hero didn't seem to try and stop his girlfriend from sliding herself into his cock. He'd been here before, feeling much more confident that he wouldn't get the wolfess stuck inside his privates. Tiffany kept watching as her friend was slowly sinking in deeper, unable to push herself but instead being sucked in. She'd seen Rowland do this in his cage, but she'd never expected the Pint Puncher to be able to emulate it this well. Shenny reached out an arm to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, take my hand. You've got to try this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... Are you sure?\" Tiffany asked, baffled by the whole scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, it's the best. Don't you want to try making out inside of him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany giggled. It just sounded so silly, but having just come down from fucking the Pint Puncher inside of Shenny's pussy, was this really that much weirder? The mouse shrugged and walked over to the slit. It had kept pulling in the wolfess, leaving only her head and arms still visible. Shenny gave a trusting smile before her head sank into the thick shaft completely. With only the wolfess' hands still visible the mouse girl grabbed hold. It didn't take long for the last of her friend was swallowed up and the slimy warmth now embraced her wrists. \"Well this is definitely not what I expected to see today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me...\" Helen chimed in. The hippo had been utterly gobsmacked by the situation. These three seemed up for practically anything when sex was involved. No wonder the superhero had turned into such a horny little pervert with them around. She kept watching as the Pint Puncher's manhood steadily claimed its second victim. Tiffany giggled as she felt the narrow tube embrace her, slowly enveloping her in warm cockflesh until she too had been swallowed. THe superhero moaned loudly, the sheer sexual bliss radiating from his shaft was unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny and Tiffany were in pitch blackness, but through some effort managed to lock lips inside the hero's manhood. It was the single most unusual yet highly romantic kiss they'd ever experienced. All around them the cockflesh pulsed and squeezed them, massaging large globs of pre into their fur. They could feel his heartbeat resonating through them. It was speeding up, leading to a climax unlike anything they'd seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the two of them squirming inside him there was only one conclusion possible. The only question left on his mind was where to point his orgasm. The hippo's eyes widened as she saw the enormous superhero turn and face her. More importantly he pointed his shaft right at her. \"Don't you dare put me in there you little...\" She huffed, but the Pint Puncher had no such plans. Inbetween moans he managed to stammer out a single word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-\" Helen argued back before she was interrupted by a bellowing moan. The hero's cock twitched before erupting with a powerful geyser of cum. The hippo caught the brunt of it, struggling to stay on her feet as she was hosed down with his sticky, white release. Suddenly she felt something larger impacting against her gut. And again a few seconds later. The immense torrent splashed into the room, repainting one of the walls and leaving a huge pool of cum on the floor. Finally the stream ebbed away and Helen was able to see something other than off-white. She was drenched from head to toe in the hero's orgasm. The two lumps that impacted her were the slime-soaked bodies of Shenny and Tiffany, both breathing heavily with smiles from ear to ear. They flopped down in front of the hippo, muttering a weak \"thank you\" for catching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo tried to maintain her composure in all this. It was probably just the hero trying to get her involved into his oversized shenanigans. He didn't seek to humiliate anyone. That said, she couldn't wait to get him back for this. With her calm intact Helen looks up and reminds the hero of her suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, about that growth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... yes... sorry, got a little sidetracked there.\" The hero replies groggily. He picks up the two exhausted lovers and places them on the nightstand to catch their breath. Next he grabs the hippo and lets her take hold of the bracers. She murrs strangely as she feels their effect for the first time, a strange warmth washing over her. Slowly the room changes as the hero hands off some of his size to Helen. The hippo finally feels a little at home in Shenny's house, matching the size of the furniture for once. The Pint Puncher shrank down to merely his girlfriend's regular size. Both mouse and wolfess still looked puny, but now there were two giants looming over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what it feels like...\" Helen thought aloud as she stared at her hands. The power she felt was uncanny. It was intoxicating to see the world from Shenny's perspective. Speaking of which, the hippo turned her attention to the two weary figures on the nightstand. Growing this big had taken some time and both Tiffany and the wolfess had mostly recovered from their intense experience. They looked up in awe at the enormous hippo. A pang of fear ran down their spines. Was this really such a good idea? It got worse when Helen reached down and carefully grabbed them in a big hand. She brought them to eye-level, smiling broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you two like exploring big things, do you? Well, would you like to make out while I stuff you in my...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Helen laughed as she could see the color draining from their faces. Shenny in particular seemed the most unnerved as she wasn't very much unaccustomed to being on the receiving end. They expected the mountainous hippo to just shove them in without care, but she was delicate in handling the two as she lowered them down the crotch level. Oddly enough, she seemed to be moving them away from her hungry lovetunnel and over to the Pint Puncher's still rigid cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two hold on tight now. We wouldn't want you getting lost inside me, would we?\" Helen crooned as she placed the two down on the warm and bumpy surface of the hero's dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero was quick to pick up on Helen's intentions and while he found it immensely arousing, he couldn't help but be concerned for the safety of the two. He looked down and to his amusement, Tiffany was raring to go with her arms and legs straddling his immense shaft. Shenny followed suit, though she was still visibly nervous as she positioned herself near the head of his cock, her eyes glued to the dripping wet cavern that awaited them. Her lover's intense musk helped to push her fear into a back of her mind and in it's place there was a lingering curiosity. How did it feel to be shoved inside a giant pussy? How did it feel for all the people that she would feed into her own? These were questions that she was dying to have answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... everybody ready...?\" Helen asked as she leaned back on her elbows, the giddiness in her voice betraying her attempts to try and act aloof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero took one last glance at her girlfriend, silently asking if she had any last minute thoughts. Shenny said nothing, but he could just barely feel her arms tightening around his cock in preparation. With that the hero pushed ahead, his hips inching ever closer to Helens. The horny hippo bit down on her bottom lip and shuddered once his head brushed along her sensitive lower lips. Now that their sizes were evened out, she marveled at how well endowed the hero truly was. A startled gasp escaped her as she was filled to the brim, her inner walls clenching down on the hero with much vigor. Her giant lover paused to try and give her a moment to adjust, but Helen wasn\u2019t having it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d Helen growled as she wrapped her arms around his neck and pulling him in close. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare hold back. Gimme everything you\u2019ve got, big boy~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher smirked and pulled his hips back slowly, watching in amusement as Helen tensed up in preparation. Not wanting to keep her waiting, he roughly pushed back in, forcing another shuddered gasp from her. He went to work pounding her into the bed, his hands reaching down to fondle her large breasts. Helen was overwhelmed by the intensity of his affection and sought to return it in kind, closing the gap between them and putting her all into a deep, passionate kiss. Her usual aggressiveness was on display as her plump lips pinned his down, her thick tongue exploring the inside of his mouth, but there was no pretense of asserting her control. She wanted to show the Pint Puncer just how deeply she pined for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs heated as things were for them, it paled in comparison to what Shenny and Tiffany were going through. When the hero\u2019s cock docked inside Helen\u2019s pussy, they found themselves pinned down at all sides while her inner walls struggled to accommodate him. Every thrust he made loosened their surroundings and while the two managed to keep their grip secure, there were more than a few instances were the force of his thrusting threatened to yank them free. It was an experience that was equal parts frightening and exhilarating. Tiffany was having the time of her life, her head swimming from the intense mixture of musks surrounding her. To one side, she could feel Helen\u2019s pussy, pushing and pulling against her much smaller body .in what felt like an over-enthusiastic full body massage. On the other side was the Pint Puncher\u2019s rock hard rod. The scent of Helen's slime drenched walls was a delight to her and when combined with the subtle scent of the hero\u2019s musk, it was truly intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny shared her enthusiasm, her initial fears fading fast as she allowed herself to be swept up with the intense rocking motion. It didn\u2019t do much in the way of bettering her understanding of her boyfriend\u2019s perspective during their usual affairs, but it felt good all the same. Once this was all said and done, she would make it a point to do this again. The constant jostling pushed to the tip of his cock and she could feel her back hitting against something solid every time he bottomed out. A steady stream of precum dripped onto her face and she could tell that he was just about ready to blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen cried out as she came to yet another explosive orgasm, the hero following suit with a load moan before falling limp onto her. A look of bliss was frozen on the hippo\u2019s face, her chest heaving as she tried to catch her breath. It took awhile for the afterglow to fade away, but she was quick to give the hero a quick peck on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026 if you did that\u2026 back when we were enemies\u2026 I promised I would\u2019ve turned over a new leaf sooner\u2026\u201d she panted with a sleepy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShoulda, woulda, coulda\u201d the hero joked. His attention shift down ward, his eyes going wide as he remembered the two he had pinned to his manhood. He quickly pulled out, ignoring the startled gasp from Helen. A pool of cum flowed freely from her snatch, but his focus was on the Shenny and Tiffany. </span></div></div>",

The large, lubricated surfaces ground against eachother with ever more force, rubbing the mouse and wolfess back and forth. What little space they had was filled with slippery release from Helen and a smell that could carry for miles. The pungent musk made it difficult for those inside the hippo's pussy to think straight. The only thing on either of their minds was to crawl to one another. With little further recourse they held onto eachother, riding along as the giants reached their climax. In spite of the pitch darkness of their surroundings they stared at eachother before engaging in a lengthy kiss. As their love reached a new level the immense wet cavern shook. Deep moans could be heard from outside, overpowering even the constant noisy wet slapping of their titanic intercourse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!\" Tiffany said with a cheery tone. She had embraced the madness of it completely. Not in her wildest fantasies had she imagined anything near this scenario. And here she was, on top of the woman she loved, inside of Helen of all people. And the only other company was the Pint Puncher's bus-sized dick dragging them back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything erupted with a flood of juices when the two giants both came. With the torrent of cum any semblance of grip vanished completely and the hero's manhood quickly lost its riders. Neither the Pint Puncher nor Helen noticed, too engulfed by the shared pleasure and afterglow of sex on an all new scale. The superhero was knackered, ready to fall asleep, while the hippo felt the excess of his release drip from her pussy. It took a few minutes for the warmth to subside before they noticed there were two people missing from the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher was first to catch on, turning his attention first to his slime-drenched shaft and then the pool of juices created beneath the hippo's snatch. Neither contained anything that looked like a mouse or wolfess in need of help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen, have you seen Tiffany and Shenny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo was about to give a snarky response when she felt a strange tingle from inside of her. She quickly put two and two together, a broad smirk crawling onto her face. \"I think I know where they are. And my gut feeling is telling me they're just fine.\" She said, her voice dripping with lewd undertones. The hero was confused at first, but when the hippo stared at her crotch for a moment before looking him in the eye again the penny dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they stuck?\" He asked hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not. I'm no Shenny, but I reckon I should be able to push them back out.\" Helen replied with a shrug. But before she could put her plan into action she felt some very peculiar movements come from inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! In there?! Right now?!\" She huffed, making the Pint Puncher laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, you didn't expect those two to just sit back, did you? No way are they gonna skip on an opportunity like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay. I should've seen that coming. It's not like they're gonna make any kind of mess, not compared to what you left behind at least. I should've evened our sizes out earlier, you're built like a fire hydrant.\" The hippo glanced at the aftermath of his other orgasm behind her, the wall still dripping with cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" The hero muttered, blushing bright red. It felt weird to get that sort of compliment from a supervillain without a hint of sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After they're done I'll let them out.\" The hippo stated dryly before yawning. The hero too felt ready for a comfortable night's rest. Much had happened today and tomorrow would be busy. Wrangling with the Institute to get Helen on board would be a challenge to rival any fight with a supervillain. Hopefully the staggering number of other villains brought in so far by Shenny and Tiffany would help his case. But right now a different thought had crept into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they'll want to stay in for the night.\" He said absent-mindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, you sound like you'd want to join them.\" The hippo joked back, before realizing that he was actually considering it. If he handed her all his size she'd be able to fit all three of them with ease. But was he really ready to trust her so intimately after so little time? It seemed like a fool's choice, but for some reason he was seriously deliberating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to hide his daydreams the hero offers his most innocuous smile. \"I'm just saying, maybe we can have some fun in getting them out. Or maybe I can just join them in there for the night. You wouldn't mind, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Uhm... I guess not?\" The hippo stammered, caught off-guard by the hero's odd request. \"What did you have in mind?\"</span></div></div>",

Even as she shot up in size and his size dwindled into nothing, the shift in power didn\u2019t make him the least bit uneasy. Soon enough, her already impressive stature almost doubled, the bed beneath her audibly groaning under her bulk. The hero was reduced to a speck in the palm of her hand and though Helen could hardly make out his facial features, she could feel him ogling the veritable mountain that was hear body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou never do turn off, do you?\u201d Helen asked, her booming voice echoing throughout Shenny\u2019s home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero smirked and shook his head. There was no point in trying to communicate with her audibly, as she lacked his girlfriend\u2019s acute hearing. His eyes lingered on her heaving breasts and he was tempted to fly over and bury himself deep inside her cleavage. Helen quashed that thought right away as she brought him down to her enormous love tunnel. He was nearly bowled over by the intense aroma that greeted him, his rigid member throbbing and leaking precum as Helen guided him closer to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen grinned with glee as she watched him stepped towards with in a zombie-like stupor. She could never get over how unreal it felt to have her longtime enemy and crush lusting after her. She bit down on her lip and moaned as she suddenly shoved him inside with her index finger. It was a paltry offering in comparison to their last bout of passion, but felt wonderful all the same. She sighed and laid back onto the bed, giving her crotch an affectionate pat before shutting her eyes and falling into a deep slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Down below, the hero was pushing past the slime slick walls on his way to find Shenny and Tiffany. Helen\u2019s enormous size was such that he had little trouble in traversing his environment. His greatest challenge was wading through the knee deep puddles of discharge. That and the moments were hard powerful inner walls would press against him, trying to push his relatively puny body even deeper. It helped that he was already well versed in these types of situations even before getting together with Shenny and Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Finding the two wasn\u2019t too difficult as his he quickly picked up on the familiar sound of their aroused moaning. He traced the noise back to its source and was amused to see that they were still going at it. Both his and Helen\u2019s cum coated their fur, though that only spurred their excitement as Shenny held the mouse in her arms, their lips locked in a deep and passionate kiss. They were so immersed in their lovemaking that it came as a surprise to the hero when they immediately came to a halt and turned their attention over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPunchy\u2026 get over here. <i>Now</i>\u201d Shenny commanded, her eyes glazed over and her face flushed with arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was clear that she wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer as she reached out and grabbed onto his arm and pulled him down. He didn\u2019t resist as she straddled his waist and aggressively grinded her pussy against his erect cock. She gave him no time to prepare as she dropped all her weight down onto him, plunging his manhood deep inside of her. The hero gasped and winced as she vigorously rode him, each descent creating a loud moist slapping noise as their hips smashed into the fleshy ground beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In all their excitement, the hero began to wonder where Tiffany had wandered off to. He wasn\u2019t kept wondering for long, as her plump ass came crashing down on his face, his mouth positioned beneath her quivering cunt. He needed no further explanation as he went to work lavishing it with licks, smiling as he felt her body tremble from the pleasure. Her ass smothered out all sound around him, though he could somehow sense the two anthros above him locked in yet another intense makeout session as they made use of their human lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Their orgy didn\u2019t last for long, as they were still very much spent from all their prior games. Tiffany was the first to reach her climax, treating the hero to mouthful of her cum as she let out a muffled moan into Shenny\u2019s lips. The wolfess followed suit as she hilted herself onto the hero\u2019s cock, her pussy clenching tightly as she went cross eyed. The Pint Puncher tried his best to hold out, but it was a lost cause as he shot his load into her hungry cunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Exhaustion finally set in for the three as they huddled together, the Pint Puncher being sandwiched between the two anthros with his head getting smothered between their impressive racks. The sheer absurdity of it all hit the hero as he was finally beginning to wind down. He had just participated in a threeway while shrunken down inside Helen\u2019s pussy. He could only laugh and shake his head. To think, all of these came about because he decided get together with Shenny. Life had dealt him a strange hand, but he certainly wasn\u2019t complaining.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a little effort the three were finally reintroduced to daylight, a smug looking hippo towering over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you think after all that I'm still superhero material?\" She joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, until recently being able to slot me into your pussy wasn't a requirement, but so far I've gone three for three. I'll chat with the Institute to see if it can be made a rule.\" The Pint Puncher laughed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better clean up first, you smell pretty much as you'd expect after marinating in her juices all night.\" Shenny added. Before they took to the spring for a thorough wash the heroes set about reorganizing their sizes. A few minutes passing the bracers back and forth and finally everyone was back at their comfortable statures. Helen pouted a little, already missing the ability to loom over the two titans. But after all the fun they had, she was optimistic in believing that was an adventure worth repeating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three stick around, I'm going to have a talk with the Institute about offering our 'prisoner' a deal.\" The hero stated matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rather you than me.\" Helen replied nervously. Hopefully he could live up to his promises from yesterday. Though she was still iffy about working with those people, the Pint Puncher made it sound worthwhile. If only because it meant they could continue their lewd escapades without having to worry about being put in a cage. She gave him a smooch on his cheek and waved goodbye as he flew to the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... now what?\" The hippo asked. The two titans looked at eachother for a moment, then back down the the hippo, a big smile on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher arrived at the I.S.E.A. without delay. The city felt quieter these days. No doubt because of the rate with which he and Shenny were bringing in supervillains. The ones still out there must be lying low. Confident about his winning streak, the superhero walked through the Institute halls until he stopped dead in his tracks. He saw the most unusual thing in one of the large rooms he passed by and when he checked it again he confirmed what he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSat at an oversized table was Borris, the Hungry Hog. The villain seemed to be completely at ease here in the Institute. When he saw the Pint Puncher, the boar raised a hand and gave him a friendly wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Punchy, how are ya?\" He asked cheerily, his baritone voice shaking as he laughed joyfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm uh... I'm good.\" The hero stammered. Borris kept laughing at his confused stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you're wondering if this is even real. Well, let me assure you I'm the genuine article. Safe to say that after you rang my bell in our last fight I slipped away before your buddies here could throw me in a cage. But as the days went by and you and Shenny started rounding people like me up I got me to thinking. If there's really a possibility for redemption with the likes of her, maybe they're willing to cut little 'ol me a deal as well. 'Cause all I really want is something to eat. So I did what anyone might do in that position...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boar paused to let the superhero take a guess, but when there was only more stunned silence he continued. \"I just gave 'em a call. They were surprisingly accepting of me and now we've got a deal. The Institute has the resources to give me the food I need to keep my belly from complaining. And in return I'm now on your side, helping to catch criminals. They even got me this.\" He said proudly, pointing at his wrist. The supervillain wore a familiar looking bracelet, large enough to suit his meaty arms, but this one had a small screen on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It lets me set how effective my stomach acid is. So when I'm out catching bad guys I just pop it to neutral and suddenly this big belly becomes as harmless as a warm bed. And when the work is done I switch it back to normal so I can eat my dinner. I've only been doing this a few days, but I've already deposited like a dozen baddies near various police stations. I'll tell ya, I got some real weird looks when spitting out a mugger in front of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero let out an amused chuckle, picturing the scene. \"Hah, the looks on those muggers must've been even worse. Bet they won't be trying that any time soon again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorris smirked gleefully. He couldn't deny that it still felt good to have prey squirming in his gut. This seemed like the closest he could get without anyone getting mad at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Punchy, what brings you here?\" He asked, raising a curious brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna be trying to talk them into letting Helen be part of team hero too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen's gonna join us? Awesome. It's probably not counting for much yet, but she's got my vote.\" The boar blushed a little. He wouldn't mind spending more time close to Helen. The superhero caught a look at the clock and jumped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get going, I don't want to be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock 'em down, champ.\" Borris cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero arrived at his planned meeting with the top brass of the Institute. Mr. Abott was there along with several other high-ranking executives. Representing the scientific side of things was Dr. Wong, who had been dragged out of her lab under strong protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher made an impassioned plea to consider letting Helen join the Institute as a superhero. He made clear the hippo wouldn't be much for the spotlight, but if it meant keeping the law off her back, she'd be willing to share some of her tech to find some of the most wanted criminals out there. Her unique talents would be a great asset and the compensation she required would be easy to handle. After nearly half an hour the hero had finished his speech. Hopefully the executives could see in the greedy hippo the same person that the hero saw. He'd even vouched for her behaviour, offering to resolve any issues that might arise as a result of her conduct.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Mr. Abott remained stonefaced throughout the hero\u2019s entire monologue, casually puffing away at his cigar as he reflected on his proposal. Of all the villains for him to vouch for, the last one Helen was the last one he would\u2019ve expected. He wasn\u2019t too fond of the hippo himself given the monetary damages wrought against the institute by her actions, but he couldn\u2019t deny the appeal of having someone with her skills and resources on their payroll. Still, he wouldn\u2019t grant the hero\u2019s request until they resolved an issue that had been on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYour offer certainly is... interesting, to say the least. Of all the people for you to pitch for something like this, I never would\u2019ve expected Helen. However, I feel it\u2019s important to stress that the intention of this institute is to study her kind, not house them. I appreciate all the work you and Shenny have put in capturing specimens for us, but I think you\u2019re losing track of our mission statement\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d the hero asked with a shrug. \u201cSo long as you get your test subjects, who cares if a few of them crash here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The director frowned and leaned forward in his seat, resting his head on his tented fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur public image is very important to us, Puncher. We want the citizens to know that our work is for their benefit, but we don\u2019t want to give the impression that we\u2019re some benevolent organization. We\u2019re a research facility first and foremost. Yet your recent work is giving the public the idea that we solely exist to be a correctional facility for superpowered animals\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher raised a brow as Abott dug through his desk and fished out what appeared to be a magazine. Shenny and Tiffany were on the cover, their scantily clad bodies laid out in a provocative manner. The tagline read, \u201cMeet Glam City\u2019s Sexy New Heroines!\u201d, along with the promise of an exclusive interview with Tiffany regarding her work at the I.S.E.A..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is set to be published next week. As much as we enjoy good press, I\u2019m worried that this\u2019ll encourage the wrong kind of behavior in citizens. If some horny teenager walks up to someone like Debra thinking that they can strike up a friendly conversation, they\u2019re gonna get hurt and the blame will be laid at our feet. Not to mention, it\u2019ll have people pushing for us to focus our efforts on reforming criminals rather than studying them\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher frowned and folded his arms. If he was suggesting that they pull back on having the magazine published, he had another thing coming. Shenny told him how happy it made Tiffany to participate in the photoshoot and he wouldn\u2019t allow the institute to rain on her parade. Luckily, that didn\u2019t seem to be where the conversation was headed as Abott tossed the magazine aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t look so uptight. I\u2019m not turning down your proposal. I just want you to keep your priorities straight. You keep Helen in check and we\u2019ll be just fine, but if anything goes wrong and public perception turns sour, we\u2019re not going to let you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero\u2019s frown curled into a smile as he nodded. Mr. Abott\u2019s distaste of anthros didn\u2019t go unnoticed by the hero, so he appreciated him being able to curb his bias and see the merits of his proposal. Helen would certainly be shocked to hear that the notoriously bitter director had given her the greenlight. He went to walk away to deliver the good news when Dr. Wong broke her silence for the first time since they\u2019d arrived to Abott\u2019s office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one\u2019s gonna ask how I feel about all this?\u201d she asked flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, doctor. You know that we greatly value your input\u201d Abott responded wearily. He had hoped to close the matter so he could get back to work, but as usual his top researcher had to make things difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019re trying to do something nice for your new bed buddy, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m just gonna keep doing favors for nothing. I have a whole backlog of experiments that I had lined up for Helen that she needs to take account for. She wants to work for us? She can start by bringing me a fresh sample\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of sample?\u201d the hero asked, though he had a hunch that what she was referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll know what I mean. We\u2019ve had this conversation more than once, trust me. Until then, I don\u2019t want her within three hundred feet of my lab\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher glanced over at Mr. Abott expecting him to speak out against his employee, but he simply coughed and looked the other way. Once the doctor made up her mind, no amount of reprimandations or threats of docked pay could sway her. With her point made, she walked out of the office and back to her lab. There was an awkward silence as the hero and the director sat across from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. Mind if I take this with me?\u201d the hero asked pointing down at the magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any use for it, so why not\u201d Mr. Abott said as he waved his hand dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher smiled and quickly stanched it up. He could only imagine the excitement on the girls faces when he brought it to them. Tiffany would be especially ecstatic to see that she made the front cover as well. Soon, their names would be synonymous with heroism, much like his own. He was about to leave when another thought came to mind. He looked back at the director with a playful smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCare to give your two cents on this publication?\u201d he asked, waving the magazine back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave before I have my lawyers shut down their offices\u201d Abott responded sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero snickered but decided not to call his bluff as he exited his office. Abott waited until he was sure the hero was gone before leaning back in his chair and kicking his feet up. He reached behind his chair and pulled out another magazine, opening it up to a three page spread of Shenny sprawled out suggestively in the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo think I wanted her cover up that body\u201d the old man said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys get a look at this!\u201d The Pint Puncher called as he entered Shenny\u2019s home. He found the three seated at the sofa, laughing their heads off as they watched more security tapes. The hero flew over and grimaced as he recognized the footage immediately. Helen had stolen an experimental chemical from the institute and had used it to shrink the hero down one tenth of his normal size. She spent the entire afternoon toying with his much smaller body, swishing him around in her mouth, crushing him in between her breasts, and most cruel of all, sticking him in the back of her panties and shoving him deep between her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told him that if he got that tongue busy that I\u2019d give him the antidote to change him back to normal,\u201d Helen said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? And did he go for it?\u201d Shenny asked giddily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I did. I was so desperate to escape, I would\u2019ve done anything she asked me\u201d the hero cut in with a huff. \u201cCome to find out that there was no antidote and the effects were only temporary\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? It\u2019s not my fault you were so gullible!\u201d Helen giggled as she patted him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever. Shenny, Tiffany, take a look at this while I talk to Helen\u201d he said as he placed the magazine on the couch and pulled the hippo to the side. He heard Tiffany let out a squeal of delight as she saw herself on the front cover, though his focus was on breaking the news to Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? How\u2019d it go? They said no, didn\u2019t they?\u201d Helen inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Abott had his reservations, but he was pretty agreeable. The only trouble is Dr. Wong\u201d the hero explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, <i>that</i> quack\u201d Helen spat bitterly. \u201cWhat does that nut job want with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero laid out everything told to him, including the speech Abott made him after his initial pitch. Helen\u2019s face soured at the notion of her providing a \u201csample\u201d. The hero asked her to elaborate on what Wong meant and she informed him that the doctor was looking for...</span></div></div>",

But when they tell you they're researching us they're not wrong. We get samples taken of just about every bodily fluid you can think of. Saliva, snot, blood, the works. I'm no exception there. They've taken many a sample from me, but there's one that has eluded them.\" Helen explains sternly, gesturing down to her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They wanted my arousal, they couldn't have it. Those scientists went to almost hilarious levels to get me excited, but a cage is not a very stimulating environment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero had to subdue a giggle at the hippo's description, nodding attentively instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing they did worked, so they eventually took drastic measures. They had caught one of your clones and they knew how much I loved to play with you. Their plan might've even worked, but I caught on to his true nature in an instant. When it became clear to me that this fake Pint Puncher would do anything to get me to fuck him I turned their little plan against them.\" Helen started to smile deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I simply told him that if he got me out of this prison I'd fuck his little brains out. Never seen you move so quickly after that. It was the day I escaped the Institute and the day I left that bitch without her precious sample. And now she's trying to use <i>you</i> as leverage to get her way. So yeah, I'm a little peeved about that because the only way I want to help her study my powers is to belch in her face until it pops off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher gulped, surprised by the sudden dark turn Helen's story had taken. He flew up to eye level and put his hand on her shoulder. Without even needing to say something, he could feel her relaxing. He could tell she was happy just to have someone sympathetic to tell this whole story to. Finally he spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to force you into doing things you don't want to do. I'll try to keep you away from the Institute as best I can and I'm certain Shenny wouldn't mind having you around here a little while longer. Dr. Wong is stubborn, but I'll see if I~\" He was interrupted by Helen's finger on his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Punchy. Wong can still jump of a bridge for all I care, but for you I'll do it. Just give me the kit and I'll take care of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero realized that despite asking for a sample, Dr. Wong had neglected to give him anything to take and store said sample. Was she that convinced the hippo would rather shy away from the whole deal? Was that her goal? The superhero quickly darted over to Tiffany, who thankfully had some spare equipment on her, including a field kit. When asked why he needed it, the hero mentioned Dr. Wong's demands, but omitted  what sample she specifically asked for. The mouse girl just shrugged before returning to the magazine, fawning over the suggestive images with Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen grimaced a little, taking the sturdy glass beaker from the kit and putting it between her legs. \"Think you can lend a hand, Punchy? Just rub it a little, that should be enough.\" She said with a smirk. The hero nodded and got close. Normally this would be some kind of trap, a set up to get him squashed between her thighs or smothered under her butt. But this wasn't that kind of Helen anymore. She had changed. Now that she didn't need to force the hero to love her the hippo had become a fair bit kinder towards him. She couldn't deny that there was still a part of her that wanted to feel his little body squirm as she dominated him. But it was no longer the only way for her to express affection towards him. An affection that rose high when she felt his hands on her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he massaged the sensitive lower lips, feeling them quiver and heat up. His gentle touch soon got lubricated as she began to leak the fluids the Institute valued so much. It's a pity they weren't around last night. They could've gotten the same thing by the gallon when Helen was the size of a skyscraper. Finally he reached her sensitive nub and she moaned softly. Or at least, the hippo thought it was softly, but her noise was enough to tear Shenny and Tiffany away from the magazine. The mouse girl smirked, realizing what sample the I.S.E.A. wanted. Not a big deal, she'd provided plenty of those herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the kit filled up and covered in warm juices the hero set it aside, returning to the very smug looking hippo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaah, a golden touch as ever, Punchy. Forced or otherwise, you just can't give any less than 100%, can you?\" She mused. He nodded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, I'm not letting Wong off this easy. It's only fair that you learn about her dirty laundry as well after she made you do this. You see, when you're stuck in a cage with little else to do, you start paying attention to your surroundings. And guards talk... a lot. I actually got along surprisingly well with most of them and the gossip they had to share was delicious. In spite of that stoic facade, that precious doctor of yours can be as horny as you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher's eyebrows shot up. He was hanging onto the hippo's every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say she likes them big. The amount of 'personal visits' she made to Rowland would make even the dullest detective suspicious. I'm telling you, she loved riding that oversized dick of his. Whether it be letting him pound her directly or letting him grow enough to make that 'riding' part very literal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero could barely believe it. This had to be another one of those wild stories the hippo had conjured to fool him. He just couldn't imagine Dr. Wong to be in any kind of romance with something other than her work. Then again, Rowland was part of her work. Maybe the two were related. Before he can give it further thought the hippo continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you know they got Borris on board? Yeah, that glutton is on our side now.\" She sneered. The hero nodded in agreement, remembering his conversation earlier with the Hungry Hog. It still seemed surreal to have him switch sides so easily. \"Well, for some reason the Institute is apparently buying bulk volumes of food to keep him happy. And all of it on the recommendation of Dr. Wong. I doesn't take a genius to see that she's keen on having a go with that big pork sausage of his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been forced close to Borris' dick during their fights, the superhero struggled to see how anyone could take an interest in that unwashed mass, but given all the lewd escapades he gets up to every night he's hardly in a position to judge. Helen just laughed smugly, feeling very satisfied with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now I hope you can see your little Institute isn't the shining beacon of good it claims to be. It's fitting a horny bastard like you is their hero, since they're not too far behind.\" She said, still chuckling. But before the hero could laugh it all off her expression turned serious. She reached down and laid a hand on his shoulder, mirroring what he did earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jokes and gossip aside though, do not trust those guys, Punchy.\" She urged him, looking him in the eye. \"They're not just studying us for laughs. I haven't found out what, but I know they're up to something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Helen, where else am I supposed to take you? Regular jail ain't exactly built for villains who can blast through walls with a fart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. That part's fine. But I'm telling you not to buy this whole 'we're just researchers' crap. When you've rid this City of villains, don't be surprised when they prepare a cage to 'study' you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're just exaggerating.\" He scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish. I've overheard more than a few scientists and guards referring to you as the 'key'. I'm guessing all those special bracelets and rings they give you only work on people or animals affected by the event that gave us all these powers. Once they've pulled those secrets from you, they'll be able to give themselves any of our powers. Do you really think they'll not use those for their own gain? I know it's just guesswork and all but Punchy... please be careful.\" The hippo's tone was shockingly sincere. The hero had never heard her express concern for anything except maybe her hoard of stolen goods. It gave him food for thought, but he couldn't ponder for too long. His thoughts were interrupted when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> In the distance, the hero could hear the familiar ringing of Glam City\u2019s alarm. The hero pinched the bridge of his nose in irritation. Peace could only last for so long, but he was invested in addressing Helen\u2019s concerns. Seconds after the alarm started ringing, Tiffany\u2019s ears perked up and she looked down at her boobs. The others couldn\u2019t hear the very faint buzzing her communicator, but she could feel it vibrating in her cleavage. She pulled it out and spoke on it for a minute before turning her attention over to Pint Puncher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Punchy! Miss Wong just called. She wanted to warn you that Hank is attacking the city, so you\u2019d best prepare for his mind controlling musk. Do you still have the gas mask she made for you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero\u2019s eyes narrowed at her question, his face burning bright red with embarrassment. The very last time he used the gas mask, it was against Hank. For the most part it worked, but a stray blow from one of his brainwashed zombies managed to send it spinning around his head. Hank was quick to take advantage. He\u2019d managed to squeak out a victory, but not before enduring some hardcore humiliation. His throat ached just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou tell her I\u2019m not going anywhere near Hank until she sends me the hazmat suit she promised me\u201d the hero stated sternly as he folded his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s already on its way via drone\u201d Tiffany said with a giggle. \u201cShe only asked because she wanted you to attach it to the drone so she can do some finetuning\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her response came as a surprise to the hero. It wasn\u2019t at all like Wong to take such initiative. Usually he had to approach her for aid and even then she had to be coerced or bribed into it. This particular case must\u2019ve been a higher priority than all others, though he wasn\u2019t certain why. He heard Helen snickering from behind and turned to see her with a lecherous smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHank huh? I wonder why she\u2019d want <i>him</i> around\u2026\u201d she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It didn\u2019t take a genius to grasp what she was insinuating. He was still on the fence as to whether or not he bought into what she had said about the doctor, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to completely dismiss the idea. If it was true, it made perfect sense for Hank to be a high priority for her. He wasn\u2019t proud to admit it, but he\u2019d seen what the villainous badger was packing in that thong. He shook his head as his mind began to bring him unpleasant memories of being on his knees at Hank\u2019s crotch. That was the last thing he needed to be on his mind before facing off against him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Shenny said as placing the magazine on the table and cracking her knuckles. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She didn\u2019t get far before being pulled back by Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa Whoa, where do you think you\u2019re going? We\u2019ve got not place in this fight!\u201d she stated firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSays who?\u201d Shenny demanded before snatching away from her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget, Hank\u2019s powers are pheromone based. You and I have no business being anywhere near him with such sensitive noses. He probably wouldn\u2019t even have to get that close to use for it to affect us. Then he\u2019d have two giants on his side\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see your point, but can\u2019t Doctor Wong just whip us up some suits too?\u201d Shenny asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but then that still raises the problem of us trying to fight Hank while he has his little posse protecting him. You know he\u2019s going to use hypnotised civilians as meatshields. We can be careful all we\u2019d like, but there\u2019s no guarantee that we wouldn\u2019t end up hurting someone by accident\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny frowned, though she couldn\u2019t fault her logic. She was still fiercely protective of her boyfriend and didn\u2019t like the idea of sending him off to deal with Hank alone. Sure, he might\u2019ve bested him on numerous occasions, but luck didn\u2019t always favor the hero in his fights. She looked down at her small lover who offered her a sympathetic smile. It was clear that he had arrived at the same conclusion as Tiffany. With a heavy sigh, the wolfess...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But as the last of her sentence left her lips an idea sprang to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a moment, can't Helen go with you? She's used to bad smells due to her powers, so his musk would have less effect. And I bet she's got some more protection stashed in her old lair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not wrong, I should be able to handle that bastard with relative ease.\" Helen nodded with an increasingly big smile. Hank was reliant on his hypnotic stench, since he stood no taller than the average man. The hippo could already picture all the ways in which she could manhandle him and crush him into submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about his minions?\" Tiffany asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about them? I'll just bump them aside with my big belly as I go for Hank. What are some mind-controlled humans gonna do to me?\" The hippo scoffed. The giant mouse meant well, but she was getting a little overbearing for Helen's tastes. This was exactly the kind of drama that kept her from wanting to be a hero. Was it really that important that every last human was left completely unharmed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled, Helen will help me against Hank. Have Wong redirect the drone to her old lair, we'll go there to grab her mask.\" The Pint Puncher stated clearly, eager to get going. He couldn't let the villainous badger have another moment of free reign in the city. As quickly as the hippo could go the two of them ran off to her hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, this should do the trick.\" She said, rummaging around a little amidst the mess. The Institute had returned some of the tech she made after they were finished analyzing it. Now that Helen was going to be on their side, it only seemed practical to let the hippo have her gadgets. She retrieved a pair of strange looking plugs and jammed them in her nostrils. They went in so deep they were effectively invisible. Only an extremely heavy impact could knock those free. The Pint Puncher felt a little jealous, knowing that his solution was far less elegant. Almost on cue the drone came within earshot, landing just outside and delivering a small package. It was a modified spandex suit with a full mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, wouldn't that have been useful all the times I subjected you to my farts?\" Helen chuckled a little as she inspected the gear. The hero blushed, but he had an explanation. \"Your stench isn't as dangerous. Sure, it's horrifyingly smelly, but it won't mind control me. Super endurance lets me shrug off the former, but is a lot more susceptible to the latter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo rolled her eyes, feeling only slightly insulted by the hero suggesting he could defy her gas. She had plenty of past battles to pick from in which she proved otherwise. But her attention was drawn so something different as she saw the hero enter her lair with the spare suit. Eagerly she followed him, knowing what was about to happen. The Pint Puncher realized that he was gonna have to change in front of her. With a girly giggle the hippo encouraged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I promise I'll look away.\" She cooed, blatantly lying. But the hero caught her by surprise by simply shrugging in agreement. Then it was his turn to smirk as he simply slipped into the suit without taking off his white spandex at all. Helen was surprised, then disappointed, but there were bigger things to worry about. She could always coerce the hero into some lewdness later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gas mask fit better this time, a clear improvement. The filter was also a little more compact, which hopefully meant it wouldn't me knocked around so easily, though a solid blow to the mask could probably still end in disaster. The two went as fast as they could to the source of the attack. They stopped when they could hear marching in the street. Carefully the hero peeked around a building to see what was going on. What he saw horrified him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank had amassed a small army already and was using it to convert everyone in sight. He walked down the street, his servants moving in lock-step around him. Everyone the villain could see would get dogpiled by ten people and dragged towards the musky badger. There he would pick a smell at random to add the civilian to his ranks. Burps, armpit stench, even rubbing someone against his smelly dick. The Pint Puncher shuddered at the thought. Not just that smelly pole, but the insidious notion put in the back of his head that Dr. Wong was keen on having a go at said pole. He hadn't made up his mind on how much of Helen's story was true, but the mental images it conjured weren't pleasant. Before he can go in, a large hand on his shoulder stops him. He looks over to the hippo, who's got a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea...\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foul badger halted his army as he saw Helen walk into the street before him. He had no beef with the hippo, they mostly kept out of eachother's way. But when he saw the spandex-clad figure draped over her arm he knew she was up to something. With his curiosity growing he called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Helen, who's that you got there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one and only Pint Puncher.\" She said, holding the limp body of the hero up. She struggled to keep a straight face through this ruse, already amused by the potential result. The superhero played his part great, hanging defeated in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really now... and why did you bring him here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you could give him a whiff of the good stuff and order him to be my slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank laughed loudly at the suggestion, commanding the people in front of him to get out of his way as he approached the hippo. He was still a little apprehensive though. \"What's with the mask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, he thought he could resist my ass blasts with it. Unfortunately for him my ass is dangerous in more than one way and it didn't do much to stop him getting crushed unconscious. I was thinking you could fill those filters up with your special smells so they'll last even longer.\" Helen replied, impressed by her ability to make something like that up on the spot. The badger's curious brow finally lowered as he seemed convinced by her story. He nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, give him to me and I'll take care of it for you.\" He answered with a cruel smirk. Whatever horrid plans he had in mind for the hero, making him a slave to Helen was definitely a good one. He stood no more than fifteen feet away from the hippo, waiting for her to hand over the hero.</span></div></div>",

Neither of them were at any real risk given their equipment, but the hero couldn't help feel uneasy being so close to Hank. In terms of physical strength he had the villain pegged, but all it took was a second for everything to go south. Once they were five feet away from Hank, Helen grinned and tossed the hero aside with seemingly no care to his safety. As many beatings as he took on a daily basis, a drop to the ground wouldn't amount to much, she reasoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the deal? If you wanna mess around with him while he's got his wits about him, then-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before he could finish his thought, Helen cut loose with a powerful, skull rattling belch that sent him flying back several dozen feet. Despite her lack of concern regarding the civilians in the area, she wanted to start her career as a hero of without any unneeded casualties. Getting in close guaranteed that none of his drones would get caught in the blast. The didn't even react to her surprise attack as they stood idly by waiting for a command from their master. Helen wouldn't afford him the opportunity as she stomped towards the disoriented badger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the people outta here. I can handle this punk\" she instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero was slightly annoyed at her for taking charge of their mission but was quick to obey as he begun ushering the people away from the scene. She might've been reluctant to play the hero, but her cunning would ensure that no one got hurt. Relocating Hank's minions proved an easy enough task, as they did nothing to resist him. He made sure to deliver them out of earshot of their master just to be on the safe side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hank groaned and slowly stood to his feet, his head still reeling from Helen's surprise attack. Needless to say, he was feeling more than a little ticked at her for pulling such a stunt, but more than anything else he was trying to discern why she would even do this. They weren't particularly friendly with each other, but couldn't recall having done anything to warrant such hostility. The sound of her thudding footsteps brought him back to the present as he looked up to find Helen stalking towards him. Gritting his teeth, he jumped to his feet and readied himself for battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you save us both some trouble and give up? Worse thing that'll happen is that you'll be locked in a cell and some horny nerd'll come and jump your bone every now and again\" Helen said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her comment left Hank flustered and confused as he stared blankly at her. From the corner of his eye he could see the Pint Puncher escorting his army away from their battle, using his super strength to grab them the dozens before flying off. Going by the snide grin on Helen's face, he could tell that he had a hand in her ploy. It was all too much for him to wrap his head around. He had caught wind that some of his fellow villains had chosen to turn over a new leaf and he had been preparing for the eventuality of having to face off against his former allies, but he never would've imagined that Helen would be among that select few. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did they promise you, Helen? Money? Power? What was so valuable that it'd make you side with <i><b>him?!</b></i>\" he asked pointing over to the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great sex and a roof over my head\" she answered bluntly. She certainly wasn't being dishonest in her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Real fuckin' cute. You won't be joking when I have you worshiping the ground I walk on\" Hank growled angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen rolled her eyes and cracked her knuckles, her confidence making her foe visibly uneasy. She had no real reason to fear Hank. He could easily overpower the strongest human, but that meant little to her. The only thing he could rely on was his ability to congregate loyal servants and the Pint Puncher had ensured that there was no one around for him to convert. Still, Hank was more than a mindless hedonist. He utilize his wits when the situation called for it and he still had a few tricks he could call upon...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>His angered growl was replaced by a short command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assist me! Take these 'heroes' down!\" He cried out at top volume. The hippo just smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can't hear you.\" She takes a heavy step closer, ready to destroy the honey badger. But his smile didn't fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't need to.\" He said, his voice thick with malicious glee. Suddenly it clicked for Helen. They might not be anywhere near her, but the Pint Puncher was probably back there, standing among them and not suspecting a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll pay for that!\" She said gruffly, stomping towards Hank. The honey badger tried to dodge out of her way, but a large hand grabbed him by the shoulder and lifted him off the ground. He was pulled towards the hippo, her thick knee finding its mark in his gut. Helen let him stumble onto all fours, reeling from the tremendous blow. Before he could regain his bearings though, the supervillain found himself going up again. The hippo had grabbed his shoulder and his leg, hoisting him over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call them off.\" She hissed angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never.\" Hank replied bluntly. He didn't get a chance to taunt the hippo before he was thrown down in front of her, landing hard against the pavement. With what little mercy she might've had for him depleted Helen turns around, letting her humongous ass loom threateningly over the honey badger's downed form. Without any further threats of fanfare she sat down, smothering his whole body beneath tons of hippo ass fat. Like most villains, he was made of stern material and even with his relatively small size he was able to endure the impact, though the aftermath left him unable to do anything more than wiggling uselessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen was not done yet though. This bastard was going to pay for what he did to her lover. She grit her teeth and pushed out a powerful fart. Already she could hear footsteps closing in. His minions would soon arrive to harry her. With no time to lose the hippo let forth a squeaky volley of fumes that could strip paint. The useless struggles seized almost immediately, but she gave Hank a few extra blasts of her vile farts just to rub it in. Hopefully Dr. Wong had a nose clip ready for her visits to Hank, because this smell was gonna stick with him for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo's anger faded as she saw an inspiring sight. The Pint Puncher had managed to shake off the honey badger's minions and was flying through the air. He looked a little worse for wear, some small tears in his protective suit. But most importantly, his mask looked undamaged. As much as she daydreamed about dominating him back to his senses she was pleased to see Hank's ambush had failed. But as she let out the last potent blast she heard the rumbling of many footsteps closing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once the crowd escorted away by the superhero ran down the street towards her whilst every door opened up with even more minions pouring from them. The army in the streets was but a fraction of Hank's forces. She stood up, getting ready to endure the feeble attacks from these enthralled humans. Her thick skin would render it all useless, a slight tickle at worst. It also gave her a chance to admire the results of her overwhelming assault on the honey badger. The asphalt below her was cracked, a large star pattern converging right beneath her asshole showed the sheer concussive force she could unleash. Hank was laid out in the middle of it, his face right at the epicenter of those earthshaking blasts. His eyes had rolled up into their sockets and his breathing was shallow. Whether it was the stench or the weight that rendered him unconscious she didn't know, but Helen couldn't care less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serves you right, asshole.\" She huffed, staring down the hundreds of minions amassing around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd charged at the hippo without fear. Hank's grip on them was strong, even with him unconscious. As she expected the little fists slapped dryly against her skin, unable to do much more than create the slightest of jiggles in her flabby thighs, belly and rear. But as the minions' fervor reached a new high they began to crawl over eachother in a desperate attempt to pin Helen down. Like a swarm of insects they attempted to envelop her within their squirming mass. It actually sent a pang of fear down her spine. She could snap each of these useless little men and women in half or crush them to death by the dozens under her butt, but that wasn't an option anymore. Not if she wanted to keep close to the Pint Puncher. She needed to act fast before they could gain the upper hand.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Stress began to mount for Helen as the swarm of drones grew in number. Their attempt at offence was laughable, but she was growing increasingly irritated as she grabbed Hank and slug his limp body over her shoulder. She had no way of freeing herself from the hectic crowd, not without putting their lives at risk. She tried to shuffle past them, using her plump stomach to push them aside. It quickly became clear that her passive resistance was wouldn't work in this situation, as they would simply jump back up to their feet and make another attempt to rush her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen sighed as she readied herself. She was hoping to not have to resort to this as she was certain that the hero would admonish her for it afterward. An ominous rumbling began to arise from her gut, though her attackers were more concerned with fulfilling Hank's commands than getting out of firing range. The Pint Puncher watched from a distance as the crowd was sent flying back with several of them falling to the ground unconscious. A visible cloud of gas hovered around the area and it wasn't long before the entire crowd was out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen wiped the sweat from her brow and looked around at her handiwork proudly. Seeing the hero float over to her, she folded her arms and readied herself for the lecture that was to come. To her surprise, the hero approached her and gave her a pat on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great work! I can't remember the last time things went so smoothly!\" he said in a chipper tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Seriously? You mean it?\" Helen stuttered. Despite her initial cynicism, her face lit up at her lover's approval. \"You're not upset with me gassing them unconscious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What other choice did you have? It's not like you seriously injured them or anything. They needed to be incapacitated and you managed to do it with zero casualties. That's something to be proud of\" he said as he gave her another pat on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I can't remember the last time things went so smoothly. You have a real future in the superhero business, you know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... o-of course things well smoothly! Any plan orchestrated by yours truly is guaranteed to be a winner!\" Helen boasted. Her attempt to sound haughty fell flat as she fidgeted with barely contained glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Hows about we drop this bum off and go have some fun~?\" Helen asked with a lecherous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Job's not done just yet, I'm afraid\" Pint Puncher said gesturing pile of bodies. \"We have to notify the Institute about all the people Hank enslaved so they can get to work on a cure\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What 'cure'? I don't remember ever seeing you having to take anything after fighting Hank!\" Helen said in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but you have to keep in mind that I'm not like most people. A bit of blunt force trauma can bring me out the trace, but that's mainly because I'm superhuman. These people need something a bit more potent. Otherwise, they're just going to wake up as emotionless zombies, waiting around for Hank to tell them what to do\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n When he saw that his explanation wasn't sitting well with Helen, he smiled and rubbed her arm affectionately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once we're done with all this, I'll spoil you any way you like. That\u2019s a promise\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen folded her thick arms and looked the other way, but it was hard for her to hide her growing smile. The hero snickered and reached into his pocket for his communicator.. No doubt the doctor was already working on a method to cure the citizens under Hank\u2019s thrall. As his communicator came to life, he was with a voice much different than he was accustomed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? HELLO? Doc, how do you work this stupid thing?!\u201d A masculine voice shouted over the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet your finger off the answer button, you meathead!\u201d The doctor\u2019s voice called back from the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you didn\u2019t teach me howda use operate your crap!\u201d the male voice growled. It took the hero a moment to realize who it was Rowland he was listening to. What he was doing answering his call was a mystery, though part of him wondered if he had caught the two at an\u2026 \u201cinappropriate\u201d time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPuncher? You have Hank under wraps, right?\u201d Rowland asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah, sure\u201d The hero responded slowly, feeling very much confused as to what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat. Get over here so we can get him situated. Doc\u2019ll have the cure ready by the time you arrive\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before the hero could inquire as to what he was doing with the doctor, he shut the communicator off. He looked over to Helen who didn\u2019t seem all that surprised. The two rounded up the unconscious civilians and using his super strength, he wrapped a light post around them to keep them from straying. With that done, they made their way over to the Institute with their catch slung over Helen\u2019s shoulder. A group of workers met them at the entrance, dressed in hazmat suits not unlike the one the Pint Puncher wore. Their attention was on Helen the entire time, even as they were escorting Hank into the containment area. The hippo rolled her eyes at their caution, though she could hardly fault them for it. Few could boast the amount of collateral damage she had caused them in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Heading into the institute, the two were greeted by none other than Rowland himself. Much effort had been put into cleaning him up, his usual lack of modesty absent as he was dressed in a pair of lab coat, a blinking silver collar,  and a pair of jeans that was was a tad too small for him. The tightness of his trousers were such that it was hard to not take immediate notice to massive bulge in his pants leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEyes up here, pipsqueak\u201d Rowland said with a cocky grin. The hero blushed and quickly darted his eyes upward. The cougar laughed at his before turning around and gesturing for them to follow. \u201cCome on. Wong\u2019s got a reward for you nabbing Hank. She\u2019s had her eye on him for ages, so she\u2019s feeling especially grateful\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I bet she is\u2026\u201d Helen muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Punt Puncher flashed her a stern look as he nudged her. If she was going to be working with him, the last thing she needed to be doing was picking fights. The hippo simply shrugged as they continued to follow Rowland all the way to Doctor Wong\u2019s office. To their surprise, Hank had already been placed under her care, his body stripped naked and placed in what appeared to be a containment chamber, his privates exposed as his thong had been stripped away from him. The hero quickly averted his eyes from his crotch, though not before catching a quick glance at the unconscious villain\u2019s huge member. The doctor was seated at her work desk typing away as she pigged out on a large bag of cookies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I made it clear that I didn\u2019t want her in my lab\u201d she said sternly, somehow detecting their presence without breaking her gaze from the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLong time no see, Mia\u201d Helen chuckled smugly. \u201cI see you found another guinea pig to poke and prod. That always was your kink\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019re a stranger to this, what with you never having worked a day in your life, but this is what we call a \u2018job.\u2019 Most of us believe in earning what we have instead of taking away from people who did.\u201d Wong said in her usual deadpan manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReal high and mighty, considering you initially volunteered for this job. Waylon assumed that you were just really dedicated to science, but anyone with common sense can see that you\u2019re just a horny little minx\u201d Helen teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour projection would be endearing if it weren\u2019t so pathetic. A sex hungry glutton like you has no business criticizing my work\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that right?\u201d Helen asked with a wide grin, clearly enjoying their verbal fencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero shook his head as the two went at it. He looked over to Rowland who was standing at the doorway, watching the two with much amusement. Immediately, the hero began to ponder as to how the doctor managed to get him under her employ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Rowland.  How long have you been working here?\u201d he asked curiously, his voice kept low so the doctor wouldn\u2019t hear them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI started yesterday. What do you care?\u201d Rowland asked with an annoyed grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you felt any <i>different</i> lately?\u201d the hero pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting at. If you\u2019re surprised to see me working here, I didn\u2019t have much of a choice. Whenever Tiffany\u2019s away playing with you and your little posse, she uses me to pick up the slack. So eventually she decided to give me an official position as her secondary assistant\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero nodded slowly. It was a reasonable enough explanation, though he was left unsatisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough\u2026\u201d Rowland began, his face becoming serious for a moment. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve been a lot less horny lately. Considering the fact that I haven\u2019t gotten my dick wet in ages, it\u2019s pretty weird. I\u2019ve also been having odd dreams on and off again\u201d he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of dreams?\u201d the hero inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe kind where I\u2019m giving the doctor a real good dicking\u201d the cougar said with a grin. \u201cI guess being here\u2019s really screwed my brain up, or something. The doctor in dreams isn\u2019t anything like the real thing. She\u2019s a real cumslut. Face down, ass up, begging for me to fuck her like bitch she is\u2026 her words, not mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right\u2026\u201d the hero stammered, his face reddening slightly. \u201cAnd\u2026 how often do you have these dreams?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I first came here, it wasn\u2019t too often. Now I have them every night\u201d Rowland said with a shrug. \"Gotta say, Dream Wong has a pretty nice body. Plump in all the right places...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero nodded and placed a hand on his chin in thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Recently she even lets me grow my dick until it's bigger than her and somehow it still fits. It's like that Felicia chick, all kinds of stretch. And it feels great.\" Rowland added excitedly. The hero could even see the bulge in the cougar's pants twitch. Not wanting to arouse him further and get him into trouble the Pint Puncher switched subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's it like working for the good guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... Doing this beats staring at the walls in my cell. But I'm still very much here against my will. If they ever release me I'm not sure. Maybe I'd try find a way to use my powers to at least not hurt people. If the news I'm hearing lately is any kind of true it's not like there's a whole lot of future in villainy anymore.\" He muttered incoherently. The Pint Puncher cracked a narrow smile. It was good to hear that his efforts were bringing some results. Between a steadily growing number of supervillains locked away or reformed and the hesitation of other villains to act it looked like Glam City might actually find a semblance of peace in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puncher?\" Rowland asked, seeing the hero daydreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Yes?\" The superhero sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you see Shenny again... Could you tell her... Could you say I'm sorry for me? I know she's probably gonna keep hating my guts and frankly, I deserve that. But I want her to know I regret some of the things I said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of them?\" The Pint Puncher asked with a goofy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. All the parts about her being smoking hot are still true, you should know that better than anybody.\" Rowland huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No arguments there. Alright, I'll tell her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks man, I know we didn't get of on the best foot, what with me beating you up... and fucking you silly... and that time I smothered you in my armpit for three days... Oh, and remember when I got so big I fed you to my cock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I get it.\" The hero hissed with annoyance. Rowland gave him a sly smile, noticing that the hero's eyes had wandered down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you ever want to... 'play', I'm sure we can find a quiet corner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero sighed at the cougar's suggestive remark, unsure whether the cougar was just joking or not, and turned around. Rowland let out a short chuckle before getting back to work hauling things for Dr. Wong. The superhero was left puzzled and concerned. The way Rowland described what was happening to him lent some credence to Helen's claims. It sounded like Wong was drugging him and using him to fulfill her fantasies. These supervillains were horrible and dangerous, but treating them like that, was the Institute any better? Or maybe it was just Dr. Wong abusing her position in the Institute for her own gain. Strangest of all was Rowland describing what sounded like her having superpowers like him. Something didn't add up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor was still caught up in an argument with Helen, both of them going at eachother like their lives were on the line. The Pint Puncher set aside his concerns and stepped in fast, trying to defuse the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to break up this little reunion, but we should probably get going again, don't you think, Helen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess. Beats hanging around this pervert and her fuck-toys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do us all a favor and leave my lab. It's clear your cooperation was a mistake and I'll assure the brass that you are to be kept under close scrutiny. They may have forced this down my throat, but you step out of line for just a moment and I'll have you thrown in the coldest, loneliest cell we've got.\" Dr. Wong grumbled, fuming with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange, given the looks you were shooting over at Hank's package I thought you liked having things shoved down your throat.\" Helen retorted as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out! Both of you!\" Dr. Wong's frustration reached her peak. The superhero quickly ushered Helen out the door, choosing not to ask about his reward at this point. The pair walk down the hall and towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really necessary to antagonize her like that? I don't need you to like her, but some professional courtesy is expected.\" The hero says with an annoyed tone to his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it's a long story, but me and Mia there, we've got a lot of history. And it ain't particularly pleasant. So excuse me if I'm not feeling a whole lot of need to be professional with her. So how about you just hand in the baddies from now on and I make sure not to run in to her anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher let out an exasperated sigh. There was more at play here than he knew and some day Helen might take the time to tell him. But the middle of the Institute is not the right place for that. The hippo seemed to agree, putting a hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, with Hank dealt with, how about you and I go have some fun? I do believe you promised to 'spoil me in any way you like'.\" The hippo gave him a suggestive smirk. The hero's eyes widened as he knew Helen was going to take full advantage of that offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, a deal's a deal. Let's go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, let's go to my place instead. A little more intimate there with a few less giants snooping around.\" Helen suggested. The hero shrugged. It was all the same to him. Shenny and Tifanny wouldn't mind the two of them coming back a little bit later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two arrived at Helen's lair in good time. The hippo was eager to have the hero serve her and she knew just how she wanted to play out this little fantasy. She opened the secret entrance and pulled the hero along as she skipped towards an area the Pint Puncher didn't even recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lose the spandex, lover boy.\" She cooed, the hero obliging. He half expected the lustful hippo to rip the suit right off his body, but he didn't mind not having to swap into new clothes after every encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe motioned for him to follow her into the next room and inside the hero's jaw hit the floor. It was a lavishly adorned bedroom, but the decor was quite remarkable. Among the piles of red pillows and the enormous reinforced bed there were some unsubtle details. Pictures of him were framed on the walls and some of the pillows had his face or body printed on them too. The little proof he found before of her crush on him paled before this near literal mountain of evidence. He stumbled forward until he was within arm's reach. Eager to get started, the hippo picked him up and hugged him fiercely, squeezing half his body between her boobs before letting herself drop on her back on the sturdy bedframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've waited a long time for this, Punchy.\" She said, grabbing his head and planting several thick, slobbery kisses in his face. But she had a lot more in mind for him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> The hero did all he could to match Helen's enthusiasm as he pressed his lips against hers, his hands groping at any piece of flesh within his reach. Whether or not she took notice was hard to say as she continued to pepper his face with kisses, pausing only to yank her top off, exposing her plump, sweat slicked breasts. The hero grinned and without skipping a beat, snaked a hand over to her softball sized nipple, giving it a quick squeeze. This time there was no doubt that she had noticed as she shuddered and moaned into his lips. This prompted her to pull his head back and push him downward, his face brushing along the smooth surface of her skin until he was eye level with her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know what to do~\" she cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero needed no further explanation as he began licking at her sensitive teat. Above him he heard Helen huff indignantly and was pressed even harder into her boob. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"You can do better than that, Punchy. Use those teeth!\" she ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero was quick to obey and stretched his mouth as wide as he could to try and fit in as much of it as he could. He knew from first hand experience just how tough Helen was, so he didn't have to hold back as he bit down hard. Helen gasped, her eyes fluttering as she tightened her grip on him. Many a night she would dream of this exact scene playing out. She had never entertained the idea of making those dreams a reality, as she was unwilling to compromise her life of crime and hedonism. For all the wealth and power she'd accumulated, none of it could bring her the happiness she was currently experiencing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her attention turned back to her lover as she ran her hands along his back while he continued to nibble on her teat. She was so overjoyed to have him there that she was having trouble thinking of what to do next. A loud buzzing noise pulled her away from her thoughts. The noise startled her lover, but she recognized it as the buzzer to one of the many entrances to her home. The only people who would've been in the know regarding the location of her lair would be her former villainous colleagues, at least the ones she kept in her inner circle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hold on...\" she muttered angrily as she gently pushed the hero off of her and stood to her feet. Whoever it was, she'd give them quit the verbal lashing for cutting into their time together. She snapped her fingers, summoning a monitor from the ceiling. On the screen,  she was surprised to see her old acquaintance Quaker standing at the door. She appeared to be rather nervous as she was constantly scratching her arm and taking in deep breaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Quaker? What the hell does <i>she</i> want?\" Helen asked folding her arms. \"The Institute never announced that I stopped being a villain... maybe she wants to cause some trouble together\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Actually,\" the hero chimed in with a bright smile. \"She turned over a new leaf awhile ago. In exchange for letting her go, she promised to never turn to villainy again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And you just trusted her to keep her word?\" Helen asked with a bemused smirk. \"You really are a boy scout, you know that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well... I kind of turned on the charm on her a bit. I think a decent amount of bad guys out there just need someone to listen and show that they care\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's all well and good, but be careful who you extend that offer to. You probably think that you can sway anyone after getting me on the straight and narrow path, but there are people out there that aren't keen on talking things through. As much as I hate that hell you constantly sent me too... even I have to admit that some of my old 'friends' deserve to be there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher's face soured slightly. If there was one thing he could count on Helen for, it was to speak her mind no matter how uncomfortable the subject matter. She certainly wasn't wrong in what she was saying. He knew first hand the depths of cruelty that some of his enemies often indulged in. That said, he wanted to believe that a good portion of his current foes could be shown the error of their ways with enough time and patience. Wanting to change the topic, he pointed at the anxious pachyderm on the camera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So what about her?\" he asked curiously. He assumed that Helen would simply send her off, though the widening grin on her face told a different story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Open side door 12\" she said to the monitor. On feed, they watched Quaker step back in surprise as the door in front of her slide upon. She was still hesitant to enter, stealing herself for what she assumed was going to be a hostile confrontation. Helen started towards the entrance to her private chambers, stopping only to wave the hero over. She stepped into the main hall of her home where her guest was waiting for them. She winced at the sight of Helen, though she couldn't see the Pint Puncher standing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This better be good, Quaker. I was just about to have fun with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Listen, Helen\" Quaker cut in. \"I know you're not gonna like what I have to say, but as your friend I think you need to hear this. The I.S.E.A. has been cracking down on criminal activity harder than ever. That may not sound like much, but they've been recruiting our kind to help get the job done. It's only a matter of time before they come for you, and no amount of gadgets or money is gonna save you when it happens\" she said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see...\" Helen said softly. It was a struggle to keep from laughing, though she managed as she looked at Quaker with a stony gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know you have a history with them, so I won't ask you to turn yourself in... but what you <i>can</i> do is renounce your criminal ways. Go off and live in peace, or better yet, join me on the side of justice. You've always been a good friend to me... and... I'd hate to have to bring you in one day\" Quaker murmured as he looked down at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This is a lot to take in, Quaker. Where did this sudden change of heart even come from?\" Helen asked folding her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I had a talk with someone little while back... someone who I thought was my enemy. Someone who... I've grown quite fond of, despite our past...\" the elephant confessed, her face turning red as she placed a hand over her heart. \"He helped me see the error of my ways. He made me feel things I've never felt before. I couldn't bare to stand against him after that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh?\" Helen said leaning in, her smirk curling into a wide grin. \"And who would this person be? Is it anyone I know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You... wouldn't believe me if I told you\" Quaker said as she fidgeted uncomfortably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen simply nodded and stepped to the side, revealing the Pint Puncher. Quaker's heart nearly stopped at the sight of him, a startled yelp escaping her lips. It was surreal to see someone as commanding and dignified as her looking so squeamish and uneasy, though the hero found it uniquely charming. Helen laughed at her flustered expression and pointed down at the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If it makes you feel any better, I think your speech was better\" she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This is all so weird...\" Quaker said as she sat on Helen's bed. The revelation of Helen's turn to heroism was odd enough, but finding out that she secretly was crushing on the Pint Puncher was even odder. At first she assumed that he was under the influence of some kind of mind controlling potion, but specificity of Helen's story was enough to convince her that she was being truthful. She had arrived with the expectation of having a long, drawn out argument with the notoriously stubborn hippo and if words weren't enough, she would've swallowed the bitter pill of having to capture her good friend. The last thing she expected was to find her and the Pint Puncher stark naked and in the midst of a romantic outing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I've given up on trying to make sense of it all, to be honest\" Helen snickered as she patted the confused elephant on the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"In any case, I'm glad you took the initiative to try and bring other people to our side\" The hero added as he sat down beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I was mainly acting out of my own best interests. I've enjoyed a peaceful life of being waited on hand and food by my harem of concubines and I don't want anything compromising that peace\" Quaker said in her normal haughty tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If you say so\" he responded with a smile. She might've switched sides, but her ego ever present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well then,\" Helen cut in as she wrapped an arm around the Pint Puncher. He blinked and looked up at her, a chill running through his body as he saw the mischievous glint in her eye. \"You came all this way for nothing, so I'd hate for you to not have anything to show for it. How's about you and I have some fun with Punchy like in the good ol' days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her offer took Quaker by surprise as she stared at her dumbfounded. She looked down at the hero, expecting him to snap at the hippo for treating him as if his input didn't matter. He didn\u2019t really have much say, given his promise entertain Helen\u2019s every request. That said, he wasn\u2019t <i>too</i> upset at the idea of being sandwiched between two plus sized beauties, as was indicated by his stiffening member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI-I would hate to impose\u2026\u201d Quaker muttered. Her affection towards the hero had only intensified since they\u2019d last seen each other, though she still felt like a third wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh, but I insist\u201d Helen said with a smirk before pushing the hero into her without warning. Quaker winced and bit down on her lip to keep from moaning. His mere touch brought her such joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cCome on, Quaker. Let\u2019s play a little. You know you want to\u2026\u201d Helen sang as she began to rub the hero\u2019s body along her thick frame. That was all the elephant could take as she snatched him from her grip and brought him to her face to give kiss that rivaled Helen\u2019s in terms of passion. After a minute, she pulled back and leered at him with hungry eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've wanted this for some time now...\" she said softly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The elephant grabbed hold of the hero and hoisted him up to her face, lips puckered and ready. The Pint Puncher gave a knowing smile and prepared himself for an overwhelming kiss. He didn't need to wait long as Quaker smushed him against herself. Thick elephantine lips smothered his face and an eager tongue began seeking entrance. The superhero playfully tried to resist her advances whilst Helen snickered at the futility of his actions. If he couldn't keep her out, he stood no chance against the larger pachyderm. She goaded him into surrendering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, Punchy, you know you want to. Let her in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was Helen's words or Quaker's unrelenting pressure would remain a mystery, but with a muffled squelch the elephant finally gained entry. She threw everything she had into this kiss, not knowing when the next opportunity might arise. She'd tried emulating it by dressing up one of her followers, but they had passed out long before she was done. With the real thing she didn't have to hold back one bit and she would take full advantage of it. The intense suction on her lips was so bad it slowly pulled the hero's head into her maw. Eventually she just committed to it and slurped it in, continuing her tongue's assault on his throat along with coating his head in slobber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the crafty elephant didn't just settle for a kiss. She would play with him at the same time. Her agile trunk probed around his waist until it found his stiffening manhood. It wrapped the throbbing meat inside a loose coil and began to give it gentle squeezes. The hero's body shuddered as he moaned with pleasure. Helen was in awe of  the spectacle. She envied the elephant, wondering what it must feel like to have a trunk to get up to such mischief with. Quaker upped the speed with which she worked his cock until it finally spurted its load onto her chest. Feeling lewd, she gave Helen a nudge and a wink, leaning in to make her breasts easy to access.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen gave a sly smirk and dragged her thick tongue across the small offering provided by the hero. The salty taste paired with the earthiness of Quaker's skin was strangely appealing. Finally the superhero was released from the damp cavern of the elephant's maw, sliding down along her belly and onto the bed. There was barely enough space for him between the two and the hippo was quick to think of a way to abuse that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go play with our bellies...\" She mused, leaning towards the elephant a little. Quaker caught on fast and leaned towards the hippo. The superhero looked to both sides to see their huge, round guts closing in. He tried to fly to safety, but in mere moments he was pinned between two vast oceans of blubber, their jiggly mass enveloping his body completely. It felt strangely relaxing, the usual monstrous pressure absent this time. The two had only leaned close enough to smother him, not throwing their full weight into it. At least, not yet. For now, Helen was more interested in something else the elephant had mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that he's occupied, I've gotta ask... You mentioned a harem of slaves? How'd you talk him into letting you get away with that?\" The hippo had a sly smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they're not slaves. They're free to come and go as they please.\" Quaker responded, causing the hippo to roll her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, free to go, but the only entrance is blocked by a pillar of rock that only you can move, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. They're volunteers.\" The elephant gave a giggle with her response, amused by the incredulous look on Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean to tell me you've got people following you... willingly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's some paperwork involved. Mostly me promising they won't be maimed or killed during their service. But last I met the Pint Puncher he told me about this group of people that loves big women. I got in touch with a few and they spread the word. Before you knew it there were a dozen ready to pamper my body and cater to my every whim. All of their own accord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really now? I wonder how they'd react if they learned about my turn to the good side...\" Helen thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you can make sure they don't get hurt or have to commit crimes I bet you there'd be some folks in this crazy city ready to worship you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crimes? Me? Haven't you heard? I'm a hero now.\" Helen huffed with insincere indignation, causing both pachyderms to burst into laughter. Afterwards she returned to a more serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do these 'volunteers' do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just about everything. Housekeeping, cooking but most importantly, tending to me with the best personal care a girl can get. And if they're being real good boys and girls they even get to be extra close. Smothered safely between my boobs or under my butt and belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? They want to be sat on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of them, yeah. Made a special seat for that so I could fulfill their crazy wishes safely, but they're ready to serve me on their knees for a turn under my ass.\" Quaker boasted proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does the Institute know about this deal?\" Helen mused cynically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know it? Two of my volunteers work at the Institute. As long as safety is maintained, they're more than happy to see me lounge around the house all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all very interesting. Maybe I should look into this myself.\" The hippo rubbed her hands together with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let them know you're on team good guy now and give them your address. I bet there'll be a line of worshippers ready for you to boss around in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right. Speaking of bossing around, I wonder how Punchy is doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair shifted away from eachother, hoisting their blubbery bellies back into their laps. The superhero was stuck to the elephant's gut, breathing in the new supply of fresh air and blushing as his boner was revealed to them alongside the little mess he made. During their chat the two pachyderms had ground their big bodies against eachother a little, squeezing the hero and pushing him to a powerful orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again? Shenny really made you into a dirty little hornball, didn't she?\" The elephant playfully chided him. Mostly to deflect from her own burning loins. She looked up to Helen and saw all the talk about volunteers and worship had put the hippo on edge as much as her. They both needed release and the Pint Puncher was going to provide it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Helen considered giving the hero a few minutes to catch his breath, though Quaker wasn\u2019t in the mood to wait. She slowly peeled him off of her stomach with her trunk and dropped him down at her crotch. He didn\u2019t need to be a genius to figure out what she had in store for him, as the smell of her arousal was so thick that he could practically taste it. He was no stranger to the sight of Quaker\u2019s spacious pussy, though he couldn\u2019t remember a time where she\u2019d been so excited. Her lower lips looked painfully swollen and a puddle of slime was forming at his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIf you would be so kind\u2026\u201d she said softly as she rubbed his back with her trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero nodded, his attention focused squarely on her hungry snatch. Quaker began to worry that her forwardness was putting the hero off, but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. He took pride in being able to wring out every drop of pleasure from his much larger lovers and leaving them completely and utterly satisfied. He was determined to do the same for Quaker, as he slowly inched forward and placed his hands on her quivering lips. His mere touch sent shivers through the pachyderm\u2019s body, though the best was yet to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen watched in a mixture of envy and amusement as he plunged his right arm inside of her. Quaker gasped, the suddenness of his act catching her completely off guard. He gave her a moment to catch her breath before pushing another arm inside. Her lips had little give as he parted them and shoved his foot in. Quaker shivered and moaned with every movement he made, though she couldn\u2019t help but feel that things were moving rather slow. She looked down at her lover and was about to speak when a wave of euphoria jolted through her and caused her to cry out. Down below, the hero was laying back with the lower half of his body immersed in her pussy, his hips pumping and his legs kicking with great vigor as he squeezed and licked at her clit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Given the size discrepancy between them, he knew that his member alone wouldn\u2019t be enough to satisfy her. Being with Shenny had endowed him with the skills needed to get the job done, as evidenced by the ever growing torrent of slime gushing from the elephant\u2019s snatch. Quaker was stunned at how skillfully he worked her into a frenzy. All the times she had used him as a sex toy paled in comparison.  The hero smiled proudly, though he smile waned slightly as he felt the pressure on his body increasing by the second. Quaker\u2019s heavy gut pressed into him as she leaned forward and pressed down onto him, her fingers clenched tightly onto Helen\u2019s sheets as she pounded him into the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026! Fuck me harder, you little stud\u2026!\u201d Quaker cried out, her eyes watering and her tongue hanging from her mouth. As much as he appreciated her enthusiasm, the hero was having a hard time fulfilling her request as he was trying his best not to suffocate beneath her. His input didn\u2019t really matter by that point. She was happy just having him inside her; him, the man she had spent the last few days quietly fawning over. She always had him on her mind, even as she was being worshiped by her many dutiful servants. Her attraction to him went well beyond cardinal lust. She was infatuated with the hero, and it showed as she continued to ride him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her orgasm was signaled by a loud trumpet from her trunk before flopping back onto the bed with a satisfied smile. Her lover was soaked in a mixture of sweat and slime, his chest heaving as he tried to catch his breath and his own orgasm having gone completely unnoticed. He would be given a minute to rest before being snatched up by Helen and pushed face first into her pussy. She was still worked up from before and watching the two of them have their fun had incensed her even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMy turn!\u201d she said giddily. She was feeling a little jealous that he would reserve such a move for someone else, especially given how this was supposed to be <i>their</i> alone time. She practically squealed in excitement as the hero slowly went to work replicating what he had down with Quaker. First his right foot, then his left. She didn\u2019t bother waiting for him to get secure before dropping down and humping his much smaller body vigorously. After dealing with Quaker, the hero found her comparatively smaller size easier to adjust to, though that wasn\u2019t saying much. He tried his very best to keep up the tempo, but hippo left him completely overwhelmed. It didn\u2019t take long for her to be brought to a mind rattling orgasm, their earlier bit of fun leaving her feeling extra sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMmm\u2026 you never fail to disappoint, Punchy\u2026~\u201d she cooed as she sat back and stretched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero nodded and smiled weakly as he gave her a thumbs up. \u201cYou know\u2026 I am\u2026 to please\u2026\u201d he panted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDon\u2019t get to comfy, my handsome little stud\u201d Quaker said softly, her eyes still filled with lust as she grabbed his leg with her trunk. \u201cI\u2019m ready for round two~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDon\u2019t take too long. I\u2019m still feeling antsy myself\u201d Helen said as she stroked her crotched with a lewd grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher sighed inwardly as he was dragged back over to Quaker. It was hard to feel apprehensive when his cock was still very much hard. With a resigned grin he plunged his legs back into Quaker as he mentally prepared himself for what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>Two Hours Later</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n The pungent smell of sweat and sex lingered in the air as Helen and Quaker laid sprawled out on the bed. Their bodies were drenched in perspiration, their chests heaving and their eyes glazed. Back and forth they passed their pint sized lover, each orgasm growing more intense than the last. It had almost become a competition to see who could outlast the other, though unsurprisingly, Helen managed to win out. Quaker was the first to collect herself as she sat up and stretched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSimply magnificent. I can only hope that this isn\u2019t a one off thing, Puncher\u2026\u201d she said with a laugh. Her laughter subsided once she looked down and saw the state the hero was in. After enduring two whole hours of lovemaking between the two giants, he was left....</span></div></div>",

You did great down there. Here, let me give you a little pick-me-up.\" She mused, grabbing the hero and wiping the worst of the goop off his body. The sticky slime covered him from head to toe, gooey strands leaking down into a large puddle on Helen's bed. It smelled strongly of their feminine musk. As the elephant's hand brushed past his groin, she was amazed to still feel it twitch. Even after two hours of being submerged in pure pleasure the hero could go for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the hero's dick could go for more, the rest of him wasn't looking quite so eager. He wearily looked around to see what Quaker was doing to him, watching her imposing breasts get closer. Those massive mammaries had crushed him into submission before, but now he wasn't moving towards that man-eating cleavage. Instead one of her stiffened nipples entered his view. He grabbed hold of the sensitive nub, rubbing it a little and sending a shiver through Quaker's body. The large mass of breast jiggled, but the hero held on to his prize. His determination was rewarded as she brought him right up against the soft surface. She took over on the rubbing, massaging herself with the weakly squirming little man. She could feel his manhood perking up by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on...\" She mused as she finally brought the hero to his destination. His face was pressed up against the large nipple, a small trickle of wetness alerting the superhero to her intent. He moved his head and opened his mouth, taking the nub inside and suckling on it. The elephant's massive tits made his efforts fairly difficult, the twitching nipple barely fitting in his mouth. But he was determined, in no small part because the taste of her milk was heavenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only my most devout followers get to have a taste. And whenever they do it perks them right up, making them even more eager to serve. Maybe it'll do something nice for you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher was barely paying attention to her words, happily drinking what she served him whilst massaging the enormous mammaries. It made him think of all the times he'd been sandwiched between Shenny's tits. And Tiffany's... And Helen's... He struggled to think of a single large supervillainess that hadn't at some point put him there, be it for torture or temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuaker just sat back, murring happily as she felt the little hero suckle on her teats like there was no tomorrow. She watched Helen slowly rise up from her afterglow and regain her bearings. When the hippo saw her little lover latched onto the elephant's nipple she immediately leaned in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Punchy... What's better than one pair of massive tits?\" She asked, standing up to ensure her rack was on the same level as the seated elephant. She didn't wait for an answer before leaning in and smothering him completely. Quaker didn't know if this was jealousy or playfulness, but she quickly sat up, ready to take the hippo's mass. In an instant the Pint Puncher had completely vanished between their soft boobs, his world turned upside down as he was squeezed and rolled around. The pachyderms enjoyed playing with their new toy very much, massaging the little hero as best they could with their tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a rare act of mercy the heavy duo finally parted, letting the hero catch his breath. He should've know even his recovery would be turned into an overwhelming ordeal. To both the Pint Puncher and Helen's surprise, the elephant got up. She gave a happy little sigh and turned to face the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it's time for me to leave. Thanks for letting me have some fun with him, Helen. I'll think of some way to repay you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen smirked, quick to reply. \"Send some of those weird followers of yours my way and we're good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!\" The elephant guffawed. \"Alright, but remember: No hurting them and no doing crimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo rolled her eyes, holding the Pint Puncher to her chest. The scenario felt surprisingly familiar. The hero's tired, heavy breathing, the scent of arousal thick in the air. Any other day this would've been the moment for her to finish him off in some satisfyingly brutal way. But after bringing her all this pleasure, he'd earned a moment's rest. Not a long moment though, because Quaker was barely out the door before Helen gave the hero a sly look.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \"Well, I think it's time we head on back. Knowing Shenny, she's probably jealous that I'm taking up so much of your time\" Helen said with a smirk, not even trying to mask her satisfaction. She gently lowered the hero down onto the bed and stood up to stretch. She cringed as lifted her arms over her head and caught wind of the odor coming from her armpits. They had worked up quite a bit of sweat over the last few hours and her scent was beginning to turn sour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come on lover boy. Let's hit the showers\" She said before picking him up and slinging his limp body over her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're... not going to use me as a wash rag again, are you?\" the hero asked as he finally began to catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm just going to assume that was a rhetorical question\" Helen snickered as she glanced back at him. He smiled back in response, having already presumed her intentions. Helen might've turned over a new leaf, but her lewd nature didn't seem to have an off switch. He was carried out of her bedchambers and into what appeared to be a washroom. The room was large enough to comfortably hold Helen's stature with plenty of room to spare and at the end there was an enormous marble bathtub her name neatly embroidered in gold and aligned with various expensive soaps. As she stepped inside,  his looked up to see a large square shaped shower head hanging above them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry. I won't take too long\" Helen reassured. At the snap of her fingers, the shower sprang to life and let loose a torrent of hot water onto them. She let out a content sigh before grabbing the hero by the back of his head and began scrubbing the slime and sweat off of her body. pausing  briefly to lather him up in soap. The hero was far too tired and apathetic to try to resist, though he put in a token effort just for her amusement. The hippo was predictably thorough in her washing, paying special attention to her ass and breasts before moving on the other parts of her body. As expected, the Pint Puncher's dick was hard and the constant rubbing had brought about yet another intense orgasm. It didn't go unnoticed by Helen, though she feigned ignorance as she hummed pleasantly to herself all the while. She was quite familiar with the Pint Puncher and his subconscious affinity for being dominated, so she was certain that he was enjoying his undignified treatment. By the time she was finished washing up, she had managed to make him cum three more times and while his body was squeaky clean he didn't look any less winded due to the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"After everything we put you through, I'm amazed you even have anything left to give\" she giggled as she fondled his crotch. \"Then again, you <i>are</i> superhuman. I guess that translates to having a super libido\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're one to talk\" the hero said with a laugh as she staggered back to his feet. \"I can't imagine normal humans being able to keep up with you or any other anthro. Your sex drive is <i>insane</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What can I say? I'm very demanding\" Helen chortled as they walked out of the bathroom and back into her room. It took her a moment to find her panties and tank top, having tossed them to the side without a care once their fun commenced. After looking around the room, she found her panties hanging off of the lamp next to her bed and her tank top near the foot of her bed. As she got dressed, the hero was going to work slipping back on his spandex costume, occasionally taking a break to look over at Helen while her back was turned to him. She was still slightly damp from their shower, the water glistening off of her enormous rear end as she pulled her panties up. Just looking at it brought back memories of all the times she had gotten the better of him in a fight, all the times she had flattened him beneath its impressive bulk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now that I think about it...\" Helen said as she stopped halfway into pulling up her underwear. \"You must be spent. How's about I give you a life back home?\" she suggested with her usual coy smile. The hero raised a brow, unsure of what to make of her offer. She had something planned, though he couldn't fathom what. She smiled at his confusion before pressing her hands against her thick backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come on, Punchy. Don't you wanna take a ride in the backseat? Just like old times~\" she cooed as she wiggled his hips enticingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero was dumbstruck at the temerity this woman. Did she really just offer him a chance to ride in the back of her panties as though it were a kindness? He wanted to tell her off for having such nerve, yet he found himself unable to as his eyes were glued to her plump ass swaying to and fro, each motion making it jiggle hypnotically. Tearing his gaze away, he folded his arms with the most stern scowl he could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks but no thanks. I can fly home just fine, thank you\" he said with an indignant huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh don't be that way. You know you loved it whenever I stuffed you back here. Don't even try to pretend your not tempted\" she said with a smug smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Even I have standards, Helen. You'd do well to remember that\" the hero snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You can act all offended if you want, but don't forget you've got a lie detector hanging between your legs\" the hippo said with a giggle. The hero fidgeted as he felt his stiff length twitch and pulse with anticipation. He sighed and slumped his shoulders in defeat. He wanted to maintain some dignity, but there was no fighting against his baser instincts. Still, he would at the very least try to maintain some level of control over himself as he looked up at her with a firm gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're not going to gas me, are you?\" he asked in suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What, are you gonna pretend that you don't enjoy that either?\" Helen asked with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Helen, I'm serious\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, alright. I'll do my best to reign it in. No promises though\" she rolling her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero chose not to press any further as he knew that that was the most he was going to get out of her. He let Helen do her thing as she hosted him up and pulled the waistband of her panties out. With little ceremony beyond a wink, she dropped him inside and snapped them close. The hero was pinned against her massive right cheek, sandwiched between her pleasant smelling flesh and the musky underwear holding him in place. Helen laughed as she looked at her backside in the nearest mirror and saw the outline of her lover's body. With him secure, she walked out the room and into the main hall of her lair. She was half tempted to take the long walk home through the city, showing off the hero for all to see but she thought better of it. As much as she enjoyed toying with him, she cared too deeply to harm his reputation in such a manner. She instead decided to take on of the many secret tunnels out of her home and into the city limits were no prying eyes could see her lover in such a submissive state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n From the inside, the hero could hardly tell what was happening. His hands rubbed the smooth, leathery surface of Helen's ass, his arousal coming to the forefront yet again as his spandex covered boner jabbed against her skin. Every step she took caused subtle ripples that he found oddly comforting. A few minutes into her trek home, sweat had already begun to accumulate, resulting in him yet again being coated in her scent. Not that he particularly minded though, as he had come to find the aroma strangely intoxicating. It did create some problems though, as the slick surface made it easy for him to get displaced as he slid back and forth with each step she took, inching further and further to her buttcrack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Many minutes went by as the hippo continued her trek down the long corridor. Her initial eagerness had dulled, mainly due to the strenuous activity she had given herself. It seemed like a fun idea when she first thought of it, but the novelty was wearing itself thin. She was about to reach back and retrieve him when something unexpected happened.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Every step had the hero slip a millimeter closer to the only semblance of a gap present in these tight panties, Helen's vast asscrack. The hippo let out a small gasp as she felt him suddenly shift, his body pressing on her rear in a new an enticing way. She could feel him wiggling in response. He was so eager to play with her butt more, how could she not indulge him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher could sense the displacement slowly guiding him towards that immense canyon that had dominated him before. He didn't want to be wedged in that deep, fearing the hippo wouldn't be able to resist letting out those horrid farts once he was trapped in there. He tried to signal this to her, but to no avail. He felt a large hand push against the tight fabric, pressing down and wedging his body between the massive fleshy globes of her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sweat lubricated the whole process nicely, giving a subtle <i>shlk</i> as she pushed him in deep. His whole body was surrounded by smooth, sweaty assflesh. Helen smirked, feeling the now quite conspicuous boner prodding against her bare cheek. Maybe one day, with enough time and supervillains, they'd find the bottom of his well of libido. For now she'd just treat him to what he so eagerly wanted. She kept walking, exaggerating the sway of her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his whole world shift around as the enormous jiggly masses around him rubbed along his body. With a victorious swing in her step the hippo's cheeks ground him up between them. But this time it was different. He was no stranger to being in this position, Helen was ever proud to show him the destructive power of her ass. But where she'd clench down with boneshattering force before, now it was no more than a firm massage. He simply enjoyed the ride, rubbing his arms against the sweaty flesh whenever possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, someone's having a good time back there.\" She mused mischievously. Suddenly the hippo clenched her cheeks together, crushing and smothering the Pint Puncher for a few seconds. A distinct little wetness could be felt leaking out from his manhood in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... You can't hide it from me, Punchy, you're loving this.\" She added, feeling the tiny throbs of his dick against her jiggling buttcheek, adding to the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero didn't speak up, both from being exhausted by the overbearing hippo and being a little ashamed that she was mostly right. Suddenly his attention was drawn to a different threat. The powerful clench had pulled him deeper still and now her nasty asshole was in sight. He could feel it twitching and he feared the worst. His hands were too pinned down by assflesh to cover his nose. But mercifully the only thing that came from this buildup was a squeak so insignificant he doubted the hippo had even felt it. Nowhere near the foghorns she usually sent his way. It was still enough to contaminate the small pocket of air available to him with that all too familiar gassy stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lengthy tunnels soon gave way for forest as the hippo sauntered towards Shenny's place. It wasn't too much further. Already the distinct hint of wolf arousal hung in the air. The poor girl must really be missing her boyfriend. Next on her journey were the signs. Shenny's home had been marked out with a large host of signs by the Institute. It seemed excessive to the hippo before to make such a big deal about people not going near her, but having now lived there for a day she understood. The wolfess needed to be able to move around her home without fear of stepping on some unfortunate hiker. And that far up in the sky she would have no chance of seeing someone hidden in a brush or under a tree. The hippo scoffed to herself, imagining there being no humans dumb enough to even get near the wolfess that used to have a reputation for fatally using people as living dildos. But over the last months she'd been amazed by the amount of support Shenny was getting for bringing other supervillains to justice. Just as the hippo was daydreaming about this all she spotted something unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange little man was skulking through the woods, somehow unaware of the hippo's presence. Even Helen's heavy footsteps as she walked up to him couldn't break his concentration. Only when she cleared her throat did the man get startled, turning around and going pale as a sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you see the signs?\" She asked, annoyed with this odd figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y... Yes.\" He stammered, beads of sweat dripping down his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you chose to ignore it? I know you humans can be dumb, but this is gonna end with you getting stepped on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P... Please don't hurt me.\" The man whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen paused for a moment, realizing he thought she was threatening to stomp him flat. \"Not like that. Shenny walks around here without looking down at her feet. One misstep and you're gone, you dumbass. What could you possibly want that makes it worth risking that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Au... Autograph.\" He looked away, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... you're a fan?! And you decided that the best way to show your admiration is to sneak into her house and maybe get stomped flat, just for an autograph?! Human, I don't know if you're really committed or really stupid, but I'm leaning towards the latter. Be happy I found you before Shenny's foot did. Now you're gonna turn around, leave her alone and whenever she's handing out autographs in town, you're gonna be on the front row, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" The fan said, hanging his head in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure you got the message. So how about a little punishment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher had been content to remain stowed in the back and listen to the hippo deal with this. His words to the clueless fan would've been every bit as harsh. But when the word 'punishment' dropped, he feared the hippo would do something drastic. He tried to slip out from between her hefty cheeks, but they bore down on him hard, clenching to keep him in place. Helen wasn't going to let him ruin the moment for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna let you leave empty-handed. I'm gonna give you something to remember, fanboy. Now pucker up.\" She leaned in, pursing her lips. The man recoiled, but Helen's hand was there to stop his escape and take hold of his head. She planted a big, sloppy kiss in his face, her tongue gleefully heaping on more slimy drool. With a noisy pop her lips left his face, the man sputtering in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't let me catch you snooping in here again, or you're going in the back to kiss my ass. Understood?!\" She said in a commanding tone. The fan sputtered and nodded, sprinting awkwardly back to the perimeter of Shenny's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Punchy, I've got your back.\" She said, amused by her choice of words to the hero currently enveloped by her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later they finally reached the others. Helen quickly fished the superhero from her pants, making the towering wolfess roll her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to have you back, Punchy. What took you so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, some business here and there. One thing after another, really. Ran into Quaker too, she's doing well.\" He answered with a shrug.</span></div></div>",

His poker face could've convinced most, but she knew him well enough to know when he was hiding something. She especially found it hard to believe that would have so little say regarding Quaker. She intended to press him further, though Helen was already ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Remember everything Quaker said, Punchy?\" the hippo asked in a mockingly innocent tone. The hero shot her a glare before clearing his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She took our advice to heart and found herself group of worshipers to wait on her hand and foot. A few of them even work for the institute\" the hero said with a shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh. That's good to hear\" Shenny responded with a disinterested half-smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen shook her head as she looked down at the hero with annoyance. If there was one thing she couldn't stand about him, it was how seriously he took himself. She was confident that were he to fully embrace his debauched lifestyle, he would be much less tense. She wasn't going to let him drop the subject so easily as thought of a way to sway the conversation into the direction she wanted it to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aren't you underselling things a bit? It's not like we just bumped into her at the store\" she said with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s true. We were at Helen\u2019s home when she came knocking on the door. Turns out we had a more positive effect on her than expected, because she came over to try and talk Helen into quitting supervillainy. A little late mind you, but-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWait, what were you doing at Helen\u2019s place?\u201d Tiffany cut in as her ears perked up curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero\u2019s smile faded in an instant as he felt a lump form in his throat. Shenny smirked as his facade cracked before her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWe just made a pit stop after dropping Hank off at the Institute and lost track of time\u201d the hero insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh, did we ever~\u201d Helen cooed as she placed a hand on top of his head and leaned in with a lewd smirk. \u201cPunchy promised me a bit of fun after the job was done and we were about to get to it when Quaker came a knockin and me being the ever gracious host that I am, I invited her to stay and join us. Apparently she\u2019s had the hots for him for a while now. Spent a good minute gushing about how he \u2018helped her see the error of her ways\u2019 and how he \u2018made her feel thing she\u2019d never felt before\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIs that right?\u201d Shenny asked with a raised brow. She recalled how Quaker had offered her boyfriend the chance to be her servant, though she assumed her attraction was superficial at best. Still, the elephant\u2019s love towards the Pint Puncher didn\u2019t at all strike her as surprising. Since they\u2019d been together, he had developed a talent for winning foes over with his charms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMmhm. You\u2019re a lucky one, Shen. This little guy is an absolute monster in the sack. Two straight hours of nonstop sex and he was still rearing to go\u201d the hippo laughed as her hand snaked slipped down and groped the hero\u2019s crotch. Her smile widened as she felt his boner pushing against the spandex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen Quaker\u2019s face when he started working his magic. He did this thing where he sticks his legs inside you while playing with your clit at the same time. By the time he was finished, he had Quaker screaming and out of breath~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019d expect nothing less from Punchy\u201d Tiffany snickered as she looked down at the hero\u2019s bright red face. It was hard to believe that someone so modest could tout such sexual prowess. Even as he was being praised, he couldn\u2019t help but fidget uncomfortably while trying to pry Helen\u2019s hand away from his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlthough,\u201d Helen began as she gave his manhood a firm squeeze to make him cease his squirming. \u201cAs great as he is in bed, he has a bit of trouble reigning himself in. We got him to blow his load by squishing him between our stomachs. Didn\u2019t even notice it until we pulled apart\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her story sent the two giants into a giggling fit, making the hero feel even more embarrassed. One would think that by then he would become accustomed to their teasing, but he could never quite get used to it. It was made even worse by Helen keeping a firm grip on his junk, so any attempt to rebuke her claims would\u2019ve been rendered moot by his ever growing erection. She wasn\u2019t entirely joking when she referred to his dick as a \u201clie detector\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s not too surprising. I remember when we first started working together as a crime fighting duo and I stuck him between my tits so I could sprint over to the city without trouble. I pull him out, he\u2019s dripping with sweat, and there\u2019s a giant trail of cum trailing down his leg\u201d Shenny said with a grin as she recalled the memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen snorted, barely able to contain her mirth. Glancing down at the Pint Puncher she almost felt bad for hazing him so much. He was still under the impression that he was a clean cut superhero and was having a hard time coming to terms with his more vulgar habits. Then again, that only made it all the more entertaining whenever he was pressed on it. A wicked grin spread along her face as she remembered Quaker\u2019s last act before she departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou\u2019re looking pretty well rested for someone who spent the last few hours having his brains fucked out. Quaker\u2019s pick-me-up really did the trick, huh?\u201d she asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen snickered as her teasing had the expected effect, the hero\u2019s cock twitching in her grip as he thought back to the event in question. His body grew warm as he recalled the tantalizing taste of her milk and the odd sense of euphoria that had washed through him as she had him pressed up against her breast. Shenny seemed to pick up on the implication immediately as she raised a brow at them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDid she feed him some of her milk?\u201d she asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYeah!\u201d Helen responded in surprise. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019ve done it a few times myself. I don\u2019t do it too often and I usually reserve it for when I go a bit overboard\u201d she said with a smirk. Her boyfriend had certainly built up his stamina since they\u2019d gotten together but there were some nights where she was feeling particularly ravenous and left him sore and gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s not too different from Quaker. She said that only her most devoted followers get a taste and it usually gets them back on their feet in an instant\u201d Helen explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGreat minds think alike, I suppose\u2026\u201d the hero chuckled awkwardly. Part of him enjoyed the banter they were engaged in, though his mind was in another place at the moment. He was thinking about Dr. Wong and how defensive she got when Helen taunted her. Between Rowland acting as her assistant and the \u2018dreams\u2019 he had been having regarding her, the hero wasn\u2019t sure what he was supposed to believe. In all the time he\u2019d known the doctor, she had come across as completely amoral and utterly asexual, her only passions being science and sugary foods. Then again, how much did he really know about her? Aside from his occasional visits to her lab, he never spent more than an hour in her company. What if the rumors were true and she was a sex crazed manic like Helen claimed? If he were to take Rowland\u2019s word at face value, that would also mean that she had a masochistic streak not unlike himself. He shuddered at the thought of the enlarged cougar sitting in his cell with her hanging off of his gigantic member as though she were a living condom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Punchy? Did you hear me?\" Tiffany called, tilting her head as she peered down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh? What was that?\" the hero stammered as was brought back to the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I asked you a question and you just zoned out on us\" she said with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"O-oh, I'm sorry. What were you asking me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany rolled her eyes before repeating her inquiry.</span></div></div>",

After we got the protective gear on we dealt with him handily. Punchy led the bulk of his minions away whilst I showed him who's boss. Without his helpers he's not much to worry about. You probably could've dealt with him in a single stomp if he didn't have such easy access to your minds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmpf.\" Tiffany huffed indignantny. She felt a little silly for overestimating Hank's prowess, but the hippo's story would've been much different if he'd had a giant like the mouse or Shenny under his command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I squashed him good and unlike Punchy, he couldn't handle my ass.\" The hippo continued proudly, the hero blushing a little. Helen's smile grew even larger as she felt his manhood react in her hand. He wasn't about to let her tell the whole story though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then she got swamped by his minions. Turns out, flailing humans can't put up much of a fight against thick hippo skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know it.\" Helen added smugly. \"Anyway, I erm... 'pacified' them and we corralled them all together so the eggheads at the Institute can remove Hank's control. When we got to that pervert you work with she already had him strapped in. So I'm sure he's gonna have a lot of fun in the Institute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany realized the hippo was referring to Dr. Wong and let out a defensive \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pachyderm squeezed the Pint Puncher's manhood a little as she got agitated. How the giant mouse could deal with being around Wong long enough to actually start liking her was a mystery. She noticed the hero's squirming and quickly released her grip. His spandex failed to hide the conspicuous bulge she'd created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that all sounds riveting.\" Shenny mused aloud. \"But if you don't mind, I've not had a lot of private time with my boyfriend lately.\" She wrapped a large hand around the superhero and brought him up to her muzzle. A large, careful kiss was plastered on his chest before she took him to her bedroom. The Pint Puncher was quietly thankful for the reinvigorating effects of Quaker's milk. Something told him he was gonna need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen responded smugly to the situation. \"Heh, if he converts any more big villains like us he'll run out of time to stop crime. Then again, being fucked silly all day long is probably as close to heaven on Earth for him as he can get.\" Despite being upset at the hippo, Tiffany couldn't help but chuckle at the mental image of the Pint Puncher getting handed off between reformed villains. \"Probably a dream for Wong as well.\" The hippo added glibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your problem with her?\" The titanic mouse shot back, sounding offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh, guess I'm gonna have to share that story sooner or later. Short version, we know eachother for some time already, things didn't go well, I got hurt. When Shenny and Punchy are back here I'll add all the horrid details, but I'm not gonna tell the whole thing twice.\" The hippo sighed. Tiffany's frown softened a little. For all the times Helen's been telling tall tales, this one seemed devoid of the usual self-satisfied tone. It might well be a rare moment for the hippo in which she's telling the truth. \"Look, I'll give you this hint. Have you ever wondered how the Institute seemed so prepared for the effects of the Calamity? Those supervillain-resistant underground cells aren't exactly something you quickly put together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany mulled over the hippo's words. Did she really imply that the event that caused all of them to gain their immense power was man-made? By the Institute? Her mind was racing with questions, not the least of which how Helen knew all of this. Before the Calamity Tiffany was just an ordinary mouse, a life that seemed so far removed from her current reality it bordered on crazy. Then again, she couldn't have been that ordinary, since the other mice were unaffected. Was it just random chance or did the Institute have a hand in that too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save your questions. I'll answer them all later when we're all here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heated conversation was missed completely by the couple in Shenny's bedroom. She'd let the hero escape her grasp just so he could take off his clothes. After that he was held snugly whilst she planted overwhelming kisses on him. First on his face, then gradually going lower until his little hero slipped between her lips. He was already semi-erect before, but the slightest hint of a suckle on her part made it surge to full mast. She noisily spoiled his manhood with her tongue, easily drawing the first of many orgasms out of him. It was hard to believe he'd been fucked up and down by Helen and Quaker for several hours before this. The hero seemed as ready as ever to please her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis squirms were delightful as she wedged him between her breasts, rolling the endless tide of soft flesh back and forth over him. It reminded her of the story she told a moment ago and the hero wouldn't be permitted escape until he'd re-enacted every detail of it. A few minutes of this overwhelming sensual massage were all it took for the Pint Puncher to fullfill her request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finally permitted a moment away from her large hands and smothering chest the hero flew up to her head. He perched himself down next to one of the wolfess' enormous ears and rubbed it. He hadn't done this in a long time and the lewd moan it caused was music to his ears. He could feel his girlfriend shudder with delight as he continued his sensual ear rub. When her enjoyment seemed to taper out he shuffled over to the other ear to repeat the process. He saw her hands looming up over him, but every time she thought better of it, leaving him to do his thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny didn't need to say a word, but the superhero had a few ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, I know you want to. Shall I pretend to resist like the old days?\" He muttered softly in those big ears. She grabbed the hero and nodded at him, putting a cheeky smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess lowered the hero to her crotch, her pussy dripping with pent up lust already. She'd show her boyfriend no mercy, bringing him in face-first. His face was rubbed against her sensitive pleasure button, a loud moan escaping overhead. No more stalling. He was brough down to the engorged passage and his world went dark as he was shoved inside. The slimy walls bore down on the superhero, eagerly trying to pull him in deeper. He resisted their actions, but not enough to stop her from slowly watching him disappear into her womanhood. Feeling him squirm like that brought her close to the edge already, but she was a wolfess on a mission. She'd gobble that tasty hero up before soaking him in her orgasm. Her hungry snatch worked diligently to complete its task before the pleasure overwhelmed her. Wet squelches and slurps fill their ears until finally she'd swallowed her boyfriend whole with her pussy. The Pint Puncher rewarded her efforts with a gentle kiss planted on the slippery inner walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Punchy... Yes!\" She muttered to herself. It was enough to send the titanic wolfess over the edge, a flood of release crashing into the hero and flushing him from her warm love tunnel. Shenny laid back on her bed, satisfied and happy. No other villain, reformed or otherwise, could claim to have sex this great. The Pint Puncher knew her every desire and gladly acted on them. A thought reaffirmed when she felt him massage her lower lips. She eagerly gave him a helping hand, sliding him back inside to let him rub against her innermost pleasure centers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  As the Pint Puncher worked his magic inside of her, Shenny's thoughts briefly turned to Helen and the detailed recounting of their time together. She had made peace with him sleeping with other women, but a small part of her feared the possibility of him being seduced into leaving her. She knew that he didn't have it in him to hurt her, but at times she wondered whether or not their relationship could sustain itself if were she to suddenly curb her need for sex. She had practically trained him to share her monstrous libido, so could she really fault him for leaving for another sex-obsessed villainess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her train of thought was derailed as she hit another toe curling orgasm, her boyfriend once again being deposited to the outside by a flood of slime. She looked down at snickered as she looked down to find him laying on his back with his hands behind his head. She thought back to the days in which they were mortal enemies and he would be left and panting wide eyed mess after surviving a trip inside of her pussy. The fear that would be ingrained onto his face was nowhere to be seen and he didn't look the least bit tired despite everything he had endured up to that point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting sturdier, little man. I might have to step my game up, or you'll start to get bored\" She said with a slight chuckle, her concerns being not so suddenly hinted at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about that. I probably wouldn't been passed out from exhaustion if it wasn't for Quaker's milk. I don't blame her followers for sticking around if that's one of the perks\" he joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" the wolfess chuckled halfheartedly. His quip had unintentionally placed the image of him being counted among the elephant's worshipers, seated on her lap with his head nuzzled into her thick stomach as she claimed him as her own. Her discontent didn't go unnoticed by the hero as he raised a brow at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A penny for your thoughts?\" he asked nudging her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... thinking too much is all\" she said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenny, come on. I know when something's eating at you. You can talk to me about anything\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny nodded, though she still hesitated. How would he react to her concerns? She didn't want to offend him by bringing his loyalty into question, but it was something that needed to be addressed. Taking in a deep breath, she looked into his eyes with all the seriousness she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy... what... do you love most about me?\" she asked softly. She winced internally, as she didn't have the heart to flat out ask him what was really on her mind. She hoped that this question would organically lead into the real heart of the matter. The hero placed a hand on his chin in thought before shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be honest, I don't know if I could name just one thing. You're beautiful, compassionate, and as embarrassing as it can be for me, I really do like your sense of humor\" he said before a smirk appeared on his face. \"Plus, no one knows how to please me in bed better than you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you...\" she paused for a moment, steeling herself for the reaction she would receive. \"Would you still be with me if we couldn't have sex anymore...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She expected the hero to either have an outburst or to stare at her in a stunned silence, but she was greeted with an amused chuckle instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of question is that? Of course I'd still be with you!\" he said before placing a hand on her leg. \"We might have a one track mind in regards to how we spend our time together, but our relationship is more than just mindless sex. You're one of a kind, Shenny. I wouldn't trade you for anyone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny wasted little time in bringing the hero to her lips, peppering his tiny body with kisses as the butterflies fluttered in her stomach.She had matured significantly since they became a couple but every now and again she showed signs of her old emotional self. There were no words to describe the love she felt for him at that moment, so she could only show it through her actions. She pulled him away after a minute, smiling brightly as she looked at his saliva soaked form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for round 2?\" she asked with renewed vigor. She didn't bother to wait for him to reply as she brought him back down between her legs, though she decided to change things up as she sat up on her knees, pinning his body down with her lower lips. A shiver ran down her smile as she felt him squirming against the sensitive folds, his tongue running along every inch of flesh he could reach. With her hands gripped onto the sheets, she bounced atop him, riding his body into the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Punchy... I love you... I love you soooo much...!\" She cried as she came to what had to have been the most intense orgasm she'd experienced up till then. Her boyfriend did all he could to keep from drowning in her juices, a pleased grin on his face he heard her cry out his name. He expected her to collapse onto the bed and bask in the afterglow for a bit, but to his surprise she kept going without pause, her eyes crossed and her tongue hanging out as she continued to ride him. His seemingly innocuous statement regarding their relationship had lit a fire in her and it would take some time for it to dim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hours went by, though it felt like much longer for the hero. The smell of sweat hung heavily in the, though from where the hero was, he could scarcely notice the difference. After what had to have been the twentieth orgasm, Shadow had finally showed signs of winding down, her chest heaving at her eyes glazed over as she slowly fell back onto the bed. With her head gradually clearing up, her boyfriend's well-being began to resurface in her mind. She looked down to see that he was... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wolfess felt a pang of concern overcome her. Did she finally take it too far? Had she overestimated her boyfriend's resilience? Where had he gone? He wasn't glued to her crotch, nor stuck to the sheets. The answers came moments later when she felt something stir in a very familiar place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there you are.\" She murmured, breathing a sigh of relief. The copious amount of sexual release must've provided enough lubrication for him to slide in during the last few rounds unnoticed. Given the number of orgasms she had this evening it was a surprise she hadn't drenched the entire bed yet. Night had already fallen and Shenny was more than ready to fall asleep. The superhero wiggled inside her, but she made no efforts to retrieve him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. You're... *yawn* safe and sound.\" She stretched her limbs one last time before laying down in her bed. Almost as soon as her head touched the pillow the wolfess was gone. She could dream happily of her boyfriend, having reaffirmed to herself that their love is stronger than any temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher didn't hear what his girlfriend muttered to him, but he could tell from the way her whole body was relaxing that she was sleeping. Though even asleep there was one part of her still very active. Any efforts he made to slide out of her pussy were quickly halted by a squeeze from her inner walls before he was pulled back in deep. Her ravenous snatch held on to its prey with zeal. For a moment he was tempted to start pleasuring her and try to ride out the resulting orgasm. But all things considered there were worse places to sleep. He was literally surrounded by the warm, if slimy, embrace of the titanic wolfess. He wiggled a little to get comfortable in the intimate folds before drifting off himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Shenny woke up first. She let out a big yawn before shuffling onto her feet. Last night would stay with her for a long time and as the memories came back she gave her groin a soft little pat. \"Good morning, Punchy.\" There was no response at first, but soon the hero started squirming as his bedroom shifted and moved. With a little effort the wolfess finally released him from her snatch, her instincts fighting her every step of the way. It always felt so good to have him in there, struggling to escape. The power of being able to keep him down with just her sex was intoxicating. But he had earned his freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaylight stung the hero's eyes. After so much time in the sweltering darkness of his girlfriend he needed a moment to adjust being able to move on his own without the walls coming down on him. Shenny eagerly helped him be rid of the worst of her juices coating his body. She cradled him in her hands and brought him up to her muzzle. The Pint Puncher knew what came next and braced for impact. Her large tongue pressed into him, long licks scrubbing the worst of her juices away, replacing them with a thick coat of wolf drool. After this intimate bath he was slotted between her breasts and rubbed vigorously. The overwhelming softness encasing him made his dick rock hard, spurting out a minuscule load as she finished cleaning him up. Either she didn't notice or didn't care as she fished him out without another word, taking him to the living room. In there they found the titanic mouse girl sleeping on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany stirred a little when the bedroom door closed, but remained asleep. The wolfess and the superhero exchanged smiles and Shenny began to tip-toe closer. The Pint Puncher whispered in his girlfriend's ear. \"Hold up, I want to try something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew closer to the sleeping mouse, landing on top of her head as gently as he could. He began rubbing her large, round ears much like he'd done to Shenny before. The wolfess gave him a big smirk, but Tiffany didn't quite react as expected. The mouse girl's large hand shot up towards her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>WHAP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smacked the pesky little thing irritating her, the impact waking her up. \"Huh, wha?\" She muttered, unsure of what the hell was going on. She saw Shenny standing close to her, ready to burst into laughter. Then she realized the itch near her ear was still there. She scratched it only to find the Pint Puncher grabbing hold of one of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy... was that... Oh no.\" She blushed brightly with embarrassment, but the hero was quick to soothe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. That was my fault. I should know better and let sleeping giant mouse girls lie.\" He said with a chuckle, raising a smile on Tiffany and making his girlfriend burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny's laughter got even louder when her friend got up. The wolfess had wondered where Helen was off to, but now the hippo was revealed. She'd been smothered under Tiffany's large tits all night. With a foul grin she looked up to the others, staring daggers at the mouse most of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In case you didn't know, you roll in your sleep.\" She stated, her voice filled with frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I do... Didn't feel a whole lot of trying to free yourself down there.\" Tiffany replied with a giggle, making the hippo blush. Helen huffed indignantly and rolled her eyes. The titanic mouse picked the hippo up from the couch and set her down on the coffee table. Tiffany and Shenny both took a seat, the Pint Puncher flying up to the Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Helen, I've given your words some thought and maybe you're on to something. But I do wonder how you know all of this. If you feeling okay talking about it, would you tell us about your history with Wong and the Institute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I suppose. I'd probably tell you sooner or later anyway, so let's not delay it any further. I know so much about this stuff because I'm not like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher raised a curious eyebrow. \"What do you mean? Is this because you're a hippo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no. I mean, I wasn't created like you. The Calamity gave all of you your powers. But when that happened I was already like this. I... was the prototype. The reason they knew this would work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prototype? For what?\" Shenny asked, her voice heavy with doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you all. For the Calamity. The Institute created a machine that activated some dormant genetic hocus pocus inside animals to unlock otherworldly powers. I don't know the details of it, I was just their guinea pig. For years they've been perfecting it, but all previous test subjects either didn't make it or were unaffected. I was the first one to be dubbed a success. Empowered, intelligent and willing to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? Help?\" The Pint Puncher said with a joking smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wong bought my cooperation with food. I thought they were gonna use the device to help people and animals live in harmony. But then I learned about their motives. That damn bitch never said a word about it... She tricked me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wong...\" Tiffany muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. She was in on it from the start. She knew that the effects were unpredictable and testing individual animals was far too slow. So she suggested just letting it overload, blasting every critter in a hundred mile radius. Then they'd capture whoever changed. They knew the Calamity would awaken the animals' evil urges. That's why they had all those cages ready when you joined them, Punchy. You don't build a supervillain containment center overnight. And in all those years of planning they kept me in the dark, spinning lies about peaceful coexistence. I could never learn what they had in store for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen...\" The Pint Puncher reached out the the hippo, who was sounding more emotional with every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They did horrible things to me to try and steal my abilities. None of them knew how to do it, so they tried just about everything. I had to escape. The Institute cares only about power. Mine, yours, theirs, any villain they can catch. Once they've managed to extract their superpowers, I dare not think what they'll do with them next. Some of the villains you put away belong in a cage, but nobody deserves what the Institute has planned for them. You must put a stop to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" The hero seemed surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you. Power, this kind of power. It always corrupts. No human can escape that. Even you aren't completely immune to it. Unless abusing that super endurance to have more sex than any man alive doesn't count.\" Her tone got a little less sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uhm...\" The Pint Puncher stammered, blushing bright red. He'd defend himself, but he also just spent a whole night inside Shenny's pussy, so maybe the hippo had a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, as far as abuse of power goes, I think I speak for everyone here that this one can be overlooked.\" The hippo added to a chorus of giggles from the two titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the Calamity was just an experiment by the Institute to create supervillains so they could capture them and take their powers? That's quite a tale you're telling.\" Shenny mused aloud, doubting the hippo's truthfulness.</span></div></div>",

Knowing them, they're probably trying to think up some way to de-power you and wipe your memory clean as we speak\" the hippo said folding her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The room went quiet as the group tried to rationalize what they'd just been told. The Pint Puncher was at a crossroads regarding his career as a hero. If what she was true, than he had been nothing but a pawn in the Institute's sinister ploy for power. That still raised the question as to why he had been the only human affected by the Calamity. Had that been part of their plan, or was his transformation nothing more than a coincidence? Helen smirked at the visible conflict on his fact before turning her attention over to Tiffany. She didn't share the hero's concerned expression as she stared down at the ground somberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess. You've got some objections, right? If you wanna call me a liar, I've got more stories to tell about how I was treated\" she said bitterly, a tinge of hurt in her voice at the memories that still lingered with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I believe you\" Tiffany said with a soft smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen blinked and raised a brow at her response. She expected the mouse to snap back at her for daring to insinuate that her providers didn't have good intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back when we were bad guys, I never knew you to be dishonest. Even when it came to dealing with Punchy\" she said before looking down at the hippo sympathetic eyes. \"I only have one real point of contention. I don't think Miss Wong meant to trick you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Helen sighed, rolling her eyes. \"<i>Of course </i>you would defend that slut. Look, I don't know why you're picking this hill to die on, but you've gotta face reality. Dr. Wong a lying, scheming, backstabbing whore. The sooner you realize that, the better off you'll be\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get the wrong idea. I'm don't doubt she hurt you. I just don't think that was her intention. At least...\" she petered off as she slowly broke eye contact with the hippo. \"... at least that's the impression I got when she talked to me about the incident...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? She told you about what happened? When?\" Helen asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, she didn't really go into any specifics. She kind of alluded to it before changing the subject...\" Tiffany explained as she fiddled with her tail nervously. \"She doesn't like to talk about anything other than her work and she usually brushes off all of my attempts at small talk. I wanted to show her that I was grateful for putting me on the right path, but no matter how much I tried she would shut me out\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She looked over at the Pint Puncher who stood listening to her story intently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember the day you and Shen found out that I worked at the institute? After you two left, I was thinking about how much I wanted you to be mind... but at the same time, I also wanted to rebuild my friendship with Shenny. With no one else to talk to, I vented to Miss Wong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Some Time Ago...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"... I just don't know what to do.... I want to tell him how I feel, but what if it throws a cog in their relationship? What if... what if he DOES love me back, but then he leaves Shenny to be with me? I... I couldn't do that to her... I've hurt her so much already, she'd probably hate me for the rest of my life. I don't wanna be with the man I love if my best friend has to suffer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dr. Wong said nothing as she typed away at her computer, breaking only to take a sip of coffee from her mug. Her assistant had been prattling on since the two crime fighting couple left her lab and she showed no signs of slowing down. Whether or not she was even listening was hard to determine given her perpetually disinterested facial expression. Tiffany continued to vent her frustrations before the good doctor sighed and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s a thought. Why don\u2019t you just tell how you feel?\u201d she asked in an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What?!\u201d Nononono, that\u2019s\u2026 I can\u2019t do that! Shenny would rip me to pieces! She already hates me for trying to seduce him, so why would I wanna push her buttons even more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can either do that, or go out of your way to never see him again\u201d The doctor stated bluntly. She rolled her eyes at the wounded look on Tiffany\u2019s face before continuing. \u201cIf you keep this to yourself while still trying to be her friend, you know what\u2019s going to happen? At some point, you\u2019re going to be alone with her boyfriend, and something is going to happen. It doesn't matter how much self-control you think you have, you're going to slip up and do something you'll regret. You'll try to hide it from her, but soon enough it'll come to Shenny's attention that something weird is going on between the two of you. And when she finds out, she'll be <b>more</b> than just mad at you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany bit down on her bottom lip and looked away. The scenario the doctor described painted a vivid picture in her mind and while she liked to think that she would never stoop to such a low, she couldn't quite convince herself that it wasn't a possibility. She huffed and folded her arms stubbornly. Wong's initial proposal didn't seem any less stressful, but perhaps there was some merit to it. Her ears perked at the swivel of a chair and she looked up to see that the doctor had turned back to her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care what you do, but take it from someone who knows: there's no worse act you can commit against a friend than to betray their trust. Even if Shenny gets upset with you for lusting after her boyfriend, she'll know that deep down, she can rely on you to be honest with her; she'll have placed her trust with you, and that... is what makes a friendship genuine. Don't make her regret placing that trust in you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany tilted her head curiously. For the first time since she'd arrived, she could hear a hint of emotion in the doctor's voice. She wasn't given much time to ruminate on it, as the doctor whirled around and shoved a small stack of documents into her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take these to Dave's office. If he makes another pun about my calculations, let me know. I've been meaning to find someone to test my new shock collar on\" she said in her usual flat tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Miss Wong!\" the mouse responded with a chipper smile. She turned and walked out of her lab but before she walked any further, she looked down at the papers in front of her. She couldn't help but notice a single damp spot on the front page. She sniffed at if and raised a brow as she recognized the scent: saltwater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n At some point when her back was turned, the doctor had shed a single tear. For what, Tiffany could only wonder.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Present Day</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen didn't appear the least bit moved by the mouses story. Was she really expected to believe that the woman who made much of her live a leaving hell actually felt remorse for what she had done? There may have been a point in their history where she would've called the scientist a friend, but meant nothing now. Even if Wong felt shame for what she had done, it didn't erase the pain Helen had been put through. She intended to voice her disapproval when the familiar buzzing of the town's alarm cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why now of all times?\" the Pint Puncher muttered. He had been curious to learn more about Helen's dealings with the institute and he was growing weary with all of these interruptions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany blinked as she felt her communicator go off in her cleavage and after pulling it out, she flipped the feed on to find Rowland staring back at her. From the looks of it, he'd taken quite a beating, his eye swollen shut and a bruise on his cheek. The look in his eyes was unlike anything they were used to from the confident cougar, as they were filled with worry and nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiff? Is this the right frequency? Oh, thank god. Listen, we don't have much time! Hank and Derek, somehow they broke out of containment and they ran off with Wong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The atmosphere in the room immediately became tense. Given Helen was taken aback by this sudden change in developments. Tiffany looked like she was on the verge of panic, but managed to keep her wits about her as she slowly nodded. Shenny was the first to speak up, grabbing the device from the mouse's trembling hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this have anything to do with the alarm that just went off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rowland nodded and panned the camera over to the nearest monitor. The sight that greeted the group was something they'd never be able to move from their minds. On the monitor, the villainous badger and the sinister lion stood atop what appeared to be a makeshift platform made from a wall that had been clearly ripped from the institute. Clutched against Derek's muscular leg was Doctor Wong, stripped completely bare save for a silver collar wrapped around her neck. Her body was soaked in a slimy white substance and it didn't take a genius to gets what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss... Wong...?\" Tiffany whimpered.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Damn! They were did a number on her\" Helen snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher cringed as stared at the feed in stunned silence. He thought back to his talk with Rowland, how he described the doctor in his \"dreams\". This woman completely matched his description, as she rubbed her naked, cum-coated body against Derek's leg, her face flushed with arousal as she tried in vain to grope at the massive bulge in the lion's tight black shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... um... is there... anything we should know... before heading out?\" the hero stuttered awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rowland hesitated and nodded. \"Yeah...\"</span></div></div>",

Hank's power is as strong as ever and Derek can emulate it with his own smell. You'll need protection and I've got something to help you with that. Meet me at the lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero had a serious expression on his face. This mission was critical. He needed to save the day. The others too shared his determination, except for Helen. He got up and prepared to rush towards the lab when a large hand grabbed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time to waste, get in here.\" Tiffany said heroically, stuffing the Pint Puncher between her breasts. As the two titans started to run off to the city they noticed Helen wasn't following. When met with their frustrated looks the hippo shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I'm not busting my ass for Wong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny saw this coming a mile away, but before a heated argument could start she gave the hippo a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you don't want to beat Hank into submission a second time? After what he pulled I'm fairly sure we can all agree you won't have to hold back. C'mon, you know you want to...\" She said seductively, the hippo's gears turning in her head. Finally Helen crossed her arms and sighed deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but I'm doing this for me, not for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, I think Tiffany got her covered.\" Shenny gave the hippo another smile before grabbing her. Helen was a bit too large to be squeezed between the wolfess' tits, so she just kept her in her hand. The two titans sprinted through the forest, reaching the city outskirts in no time. With some restraint they walked down the main road. It was amazing how quickly the road had emptied. The people of Glam City were starting to get used to this it seemed. A few distant cheers could even be heard as the titans made their way downtown. They arrived at the Institute and made their way to Dr. Wong's lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place had been completely smashed, like a hurricane had come through. In the corner they found Rowland, sitting defeated with an Institute medic tending to his wounds. It was nothing severe but he looked like he'd taken a beating. The first one to speak up was Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you let this happen?! Why didn't you stop them?!\" Her voice was fraught with distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of this damn thing!\" He snarled back, pointing at the silvered collar around his neck. \"I'd like to see you try to fight those bastards without your powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, focus. The feed showed that they were standing on a piece of their cells. I doubt those assholes will have carried it far. The Pint Puncher interrupted. \"You said you had something to help us, Rowland.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Me.\" He gave the hero a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In order to help study Hank the doc immunized herself and me to his stench. It'll wear off eventually, but for the next few hours I won't be affected by it. Release me and I'll squash both those goons into submission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher paused. He'd not forgotten his earlier conversations with the cougar. Rowland wasn't a willing assistant like Tiffany. He admitted himself to be doing this mostly against his will. If the hero released him he might well just decide to run off. Another supervillain on the loose was the last thing he needed during this crisis. More concerning yet was that he couldn't have been the only one to recognize the cum-drenched Dr. Wong on screen as the one in Rowland's dreams. Was the cougar only pretending to be helpful so he could make those dreams a reality? There was no more time for doubts. Against Hank and Derek every second counted. He narrowed his eyes into a fierce squint and stared the cougar down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I know I can trust you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't.\" He replied with a foul smirk. The superhero sighed deeply before turning to Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it.\" He said, sounding a bit defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy?\" She seemed as mistrustful of the lecherous cougar as he was, but she could see the resignation in his eyes. She walked over to the injured villain and began to fiddle with his restraining collar. In just a few moments it gave a distinct click and she stepped back, holding the device. Rowland took a deep breath, feeling his powers activating once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you listen closely. You'll help us take down Hank and Derek and in return I'll put in a good word with the brass. Maybe get you some extra privileges or even let you out if you promise to behave. But know this. If you betray my trust I will have Shenny enact that little kick to the crotch so many times you won't even be able to get hard in your dreams anymore. Are we clear?\" The Pint Puncher spoke calmly and threateningly. Shenny backed him up by giving the cougar a malicious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah. Now give me a moment.\" He grumbled as he pushed past the hero. The villain started rummaging through the trashed workplace. He threw aside stacks of paperwork and broken experiments until he finally got his paws on two syringes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are what Wong and I used to inoculate ourselves against Hank. There's only two left though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine!\" Helen piped up, snatching a syringe and jabbing it in her arm before the others could react. Even as a hero her greed still shone through from time to time. She looked at the others' surprised stares and shrugged. \"What? I can't beat up Hank without it, now can I? And I didn't come all this way for nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny rolled her eyes, wanting to remind the hippo she didn't take a step but was carried here. The Pint Puncher meanwhile grabbed the second syringe and mulled over his options. With the stink of both Hank and Derek it was way too dangerous to go in there without it. But right now he knew there was someone else that needed this more. He turned to Tiffany and handed it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't kill them, okay?\" He looked into her eyes. That concerned look was one that Tiffany understood well. She'd seen it many times in the doctor's eyes. Wong was distrustful of her in their early days, worried she might snap back to old habits and cause mayhem. But over time she came to see the mouse girl's potential. Now she would show off this potential by rescuing her. She took the syringe and gave herself the shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll hang back until you've got them subdued. Maybe I can find some masks or something around here that'll protect me so I can join you later. Shenny, keep an eye on Rowland. If tries any funny business, you know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I do...\" She said, rubbing her hands together. Rowland just grumbled to himself. He was more than happy already to be given a chance at a rematch. And this time he'd have full access to his powers while Hank couldn't do a damn thing to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heroes all went outside and Shenny, Rowland and Tiffany got up to their regular heights. The cougar pointed to the location of the escaped supervillains and Tiffany grabbed Helen to provide her a lift to the action. The hippo was getting a little tired of being manhandled like this, but it beat walking there. The superhero and Shenny stayed back, not wanting to expose themselves to the dangers of Hank's mind-altering stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank and Derek laugh boisterously. They've taken off their speedos and are crouched down just enough for the cum-soaked Dr. Wong to grab hold of their manhood and suckle and rub them like her life depended on it. Whenever they feel another climax approaching they make sure not a drop goes to waste. Every load is spurted onto the doctor, the coat of gooey slime getting thicker with each new application. The villains enjoyed this humiliation greatly. After all the experiments Derek had been put through already it felt nothing short of cathartic to have the doctor at their mercy. But their smiles wouldn't last long as they heard the distant thunder of large footsteps. Towering over the buildings in the suburb were Tiffany and Rowland and they didn't look pleased.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> A hint of nervousness flashed over the villains faces as they looked upon their giant challengers. Their attention was focused primarily on the scowling Rowland. No doubt he was looking to dole out some punishment after their heinous attack. Tiffany looked no less intimidating, her eyes burning with a white hot hatred for them. As the giants drew closer however, Derek and Hank's initial fear waned and was replaced with a smug confidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the cavalry's finally arrived\" Hank snickered as he folded his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better late than never, I suppose\" his cohort added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany gritted her teeth and narrowed her eyes at the pair. It took a considerable amount of restraint for her to keep from bolting over and stomping the living daylights out of them. More than anything else, ensuring the doctor\u2019s safety was her number one priority and charging onward would\u2019ve put her in harm's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm only going to say this once. Release Miss Wong from your mind control and let her go. <b><i>Now</i></b>\u201d she growled, her knuckles turning white from clenching her fists so tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind control?\" Derek responded with a hardy belly laugh. \"You've got it all wrong! We didn't do anything to your precious doctor\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He flashed a toothy grin as he looked down at the enraptured scientist, his large paw-like hand rubbing the top of her head as though she were nothing more than a pet. Tiffany was flustered as she watched her mentor swoon at his touch. Her disbelief greatly amused the villains as they pressed their crotches on either side of Wong's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd been planning my escape for some time, but claiming this slut as my property was a happy little accident...\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not long after I was caught, I decided to take advantage of the Institute's asinine 'redemption program'. I knew that if I played my cards right and they'd lower their guard enough for me make my escape. Eventually I landed enough brownie points to get a job there as a self-defense trainer, and that gave me the freedom to roam around the premises without an escort\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He turned to Derek, his grin widening as the badger was toying with Wong,  repeatedly slapping his thick cock across her face and snickering as she desperately tried to catch it in her mouth with each swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night, I decided to make a break for it while everyone was asleep, but before I left I wanted to get some payback on this Wong for all the experiments she'd done on me. I heard from the grapevine that she'd be doing a private exam on Hank in his holding cell late at midnight and she wasn't to be disturbed. Imagine my surprise when I ripped open the door to the cell and found her bent over with Hank mounting her from behind\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany's face contorted in revulsion, both at the heinous mental image and the nature of his assertion. Much of her time in the Institute had been spent alongside the doctor and she knew nothing of the rumors floating around regarding her wild streak. Rowland on the other hand reacted with astonishment as he looked down at the cum stained doctor. Had there been more to his dreams than he'd initially thought? Wong was such a killjoy, he found it hard to wrap his head around what he'd just heard. Hank smiled at their confusion and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Woke me up late at night and released me from my binds. When I asked what the hell she wanted, she fell to her knees and begged me to let her suck my cock. At first I thought she was setting me up from something, but then she pulled my thong down and went to work. Let me tell you somethin', for someone so little this lady sucks dick like a champ\" he said before kneeling down and meeting the doctor's lust filled gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course that wasn't all we did... there isn't a hole on this bitch that I haven't claimed now. And the funny thing is? I don't even have to use my powers to get her to obey. She took one look at my cock and could't resist me. Isn't that right, you little whore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes... so <i>big</i>... so <b><i>thick</i></b>...! c-c-can Mia taste it again, m-master...?\" the doctor whined as she grabbed onto her crotch, her loins burning need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Wong...\" Tiffany whispered softly. She had been so quick to assume that her current mental state was the result of Hank and Derek's mind altering stenches but that clearly wasn't the case. The badger's musk had the ability to turn people into servants, but they never maintained their wits once they were enslaved. What could have driven someone so proud and respected as her to act in such an undignified manner?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think I've heard enough\" Rowland growled as he began stomping forward. \"All I know is, you two jackasses have a serious asskicking coming to you. Think you can just jump me two on one and get away with it? Nah, I don't think so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't blame us. We gave you a chance to join us and you refused\" Hank cackled. \"Even worse, you tried to stop us! She's done nothing but treat you like a guinea pig yet you <i>still</i> tried to stop us! Why are you so set on helping her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's none of your goddamned business\" Rowland snapped back as he continued onward. \"She might be a pain in my ass, but I'm not about to let you pricks do as you please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hank and Derek grinned at each other, their eyes shining with malicious intent. In one swift motion, Derek reached behind his back and pulled out a set of bracers. The cougar came to an immediate halt at the sight of them, his eyes going wide in horror. In his hands, the malevolent lion held a perfected version of the Pint Puncher's size changing bracers. Rowland had played a good part in helping Wong perfect the technology, their experiments giving her greater incite into the phenomenon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Derek slipped the bracers on and growled excitedly as he began to shoot up in height, his accomplice quickly running out of the way with his lustful plaything slung over his shoulder. Unlike the prototype bracers, the shift from normal sized to giant was seamless, the speed of his transformation clearly catching his foes off guard. Once at his maximum height, he let out a satisfied sigh as he stretch. He reveled in the stunned expressions of the two heroes, smiling as his new stature allowed him the luxury of staring down at them for the first time as he stood two heads taller than Rowland. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I see why you two were so quick to switch sides. That slut really does make the best toys. Speaking of which...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He glanced down at his feet where Hank stood looking just as bewildered by his transformation. They'd plan this in advance, but he wasn't prepared for how huge his partner would become. Derek chuckled at his reaction before reaching down and plucking Wong from his shoulder. He brought her up to his face, a wicked smile spreading along his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking about eating you and snuffing out your worthless life, but that would be such a waste! I normally don't do this, but I think your position is more suited as my personal inventor\" he said with a dark chuckle. \"You can build me all kinds of neat trinkets to make me even more powerful\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n A flicker of reason showed on Wong's face as her captor was talking about her acting as his technician. No good could come from letting this monster have his way with her inventions and even in her manic and sex-crazed state of mind, she knew this to be true. Her lucidity wouldn't last as a familiar scent struck her nose. She looked down and gasped in delight. Derek pulled open the front of his shorts, giving her a clear view of his gargantuan length. She flailed in his grip, wanting nothing more than to drop down and immerse herself in his stench and sweat. With a wicked grin, the lion let his shorts snap back into place before putting her back down beside Hank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no... please... I need it...!\" she pleaded as she reached out to the towering villain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'll get it... but only when you obey me\" Derek snickered. He turned his attention back forward, raising a brow at the giants that stood before him. Their stances were primed for combat, but he could see the uncertainty in their eyes. He could hardly fault them for it. Without a definite size advantage, they had to rely purely on their combat skills to defeat him, a task easier said than done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why so nervous? All I did was make things fair. Now that we're more or less the same height, we can have a fair bout\" he said as he got into a crouched wrestling position. He gave them little time to prepare as he quickly closed the gap between them, his increased height doing little to hinder his speed. Down below, Wong whined and squirmed in place. She'd gone several minutes without having one of her holes filled and her hunger was starting to peak. Even Hank was taken aback at how needy she was as he tried to push her away as she clung to his leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn, can you give it a rest already?!\" he growled as he yanked his leg free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to agree with Hank. It was funny at first, but now it's just sad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hank's could feel his blood run cold at the familiar voice. He turned slowly turned around and swallowed as he saw Helen marching up to him, a confident smirk on her face as she cracked her knuckles. The doctor's whining petered out as she looked over at the hippo. Her presence alone seemed to calm her lust as her hungry eyes became wistful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Helen...\" she murmured gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get the wrong idea. I'm just here to kick Hank's ass. Although, after I'm done with him, you've got a some of explaining to do\" Helen stated coldly. Tiffany's story was still on her mind, so she was curious to hear what Wong had to say regarding the role she played in the calamity.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The badger knew he'd only have one chance at winning. He charged towards the hippo, leapt up and planted both his sweaty palms on her nostrils. His vile stench entered Helen's mind and she seemed stunned for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesss... breathe it in. Join the winning team.\" He hissed with glee. It would be hilarious to see Helen thirsting after his cock too, but before he could gloat any further she grabbed him by the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already on the winning team.\" She stated with a malicious grin. \"Now it's my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badger thrashed around in her grip, but unlike Derek he was still as weak as during their last match. How she was able to just shrug off his control was a mystery, but the hippo didn't give him the time to work it out. Helen wasn't going to make the same mistake twice. She went easy on him last time and apparently this villain needs a more powerful message to make sure he'd stay put in his cell. She brought him up to her face, her belly rumbling louder and louder. Even in her sex-crazed state Dr. Wong knew that sound and what was about to follow. She scampered behind the hippo, getting clear of the incoming blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen let out an ungodly belch, her maw opening wide to unleash a torrent of piping hot gas with enough concussive force to break through walls. Hank's head was flung back, his whole body no more than a limp ragdoll in the hurricane force. Had Helen let go of him, he would have been launched into the nearest building with enough speed to punch clean through a house. Instead he was forced to endure the hippo at full strength from point blank range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank was teetering on the brink of unconsciousness when the fat hippo finally seized her assault. She hummed a pleased little tune, shaking his body a little to see if he was still there. When he muttered something incoherent she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then. Are you going to try and escape again or do you need another lesson?\" She threatened. Each new sentence didn't just instill fear into the badger. It also seemed to snap Dr. Wong further out of her addled state. The scientist was no longer trying to reach for his dick whilst the hippo was going to town on him. Helen quietly hoped he'd be defiant, but after a belch like hers few would have the guts to stand up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S.... Screw... you...\" He mumbled weakly, making the hippo smile from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping you'd say that...\" She whispered in his ear, her voice dripping with spite and glee. She unceremoniously released him, the badger falling to the floor. He didn't have the strength to land on his feet. Regret set in the moment he saw Helen's ass rising up in front of him. She wasn't about to give him even a moment's reprieve. To add to the cruelty she grabbed her large, flabby asscheeks and pulled them apart, giving the terrified badger a quick look at his next tormentor. In a flash she brought it all down on him like an avalanche of fat. Hank was on his knees, a prime position for being wedged deep between the jiggly masses. They squeezed him from all sides, pinning him down as the only sound that could be heard in these horrifying depths was the rumble in Helen's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Wong cleverly got away from the hippo, lucid enough to recall what happened when Helen served up an ass blast to pacify that crowd of Hank's followers the other day. Judging by the hippo's strained grunting that would be nothing compared to what she was about to subject Hank to. The scientist would be proven right as the earth itself shuddered when the hippo farted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen's sonorous trumpeting carried with it enough force to crack the road she was seated on even further. She let out a large sigh of relief, feeling all that built up gas escaping. Even better was the feeling of the badger's body being pounded by her potent eruptions. He couldn't move a muscle, not even able to shield his nose as her brutal assault seared his nostrils. She thought she'd been thorough before when she beat Hank down, but to have him escape not even two days later was too grave an insult to her abilities. He would learn to stay where he belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the fart ended the hippo was so wrapped up in her own thoughts she didn't even notice his body had gone limp. She stood up, feeling him go up with her. He was wedged firmly enough to be carried around in her ass, but she fished him out instead. She wanted the badger subdued, not dead, so she felt the need to check if he was at least still breathing. Fortunately he was, though she wondered how many would care if she'd accidentally gone too far. Wong might, though for all the wrong reasons. Helen was well aware of the doctor's perverted streak, but even she was shocked to see her act like she had. The hippo threw her victim over her shoulder and walked over to the scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Amy, it ain't safe here with that big brute around. Once we've beaten him back into line you can get back to slobbering all over his cock.\" Helen said with a smirk. To her surprise Wong seemed to be a little disgusted by the suggestion. Maybe she was already on the mend from... whatever it was she was afflicted by. Helen didn't feel like waiting for the little human and threw her over the other shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go, I don't think I'll be much help against that guy.\" She mused to herself, looking over to Derek. The giant lion had been so occupied with staring Tiffany and Rowland down he hadn't even noticed the loud belching and farting happening down below. Helen slipped down an alleyway barely wide enough for her fat frame and began making her way back to the Institute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek gave his opponents a toothy grin. Was this how they always felt? Such power. He could squeeze the Pint Puncher between two fingers, swallow him like a piece of candy or drench him in so much sweat the superhero might just drown in it. Once he was done dispatching these two oversized fools he'd make quick work of subjugating this whole city. Once he proved his dominance he wouldn't need any mind-controlling stench. These puny humans would serve him without question or be reduced to food or toys for him to indulge in. That wretched Pint Puncher chief among all his toys. His daydreams were cut short by a streak of white from the corner of his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero hadn't sat idle. He couldn't. Not after seeing Derek grow huge. A direct fight was still too dangerous, but he could use his powers to mitigate the damage that was no doubt about to happen. With super speed he raced from home to home, gathering up people in bunches and flying them towards Shenny. In mere minutes the entire neighborhood had been cleared out. The wolfess tried to sound as comforting as someone as enormous as her could be to these little humans. \"Don't worry, I will protect you.\" She spoke softly. The people cheered, though she could see some were still rightfully terrified. Three giants were about to brawl in their neighborhood. They could only hope nobody got crushed in the chaos.</span></div></div>",

She readied herself to pounce the moment he made a move to oppose the the Pint Puncher's efforts, but he instead he laughed and turned his attention back towards his two adversaries. When his body grew, so to did his arrogance. As far as he was concerned, the hero was simply delaying the inevitable. Once he was finished with Rowland and Tiffany, he would beat him down and force the runt to watch as he toyed with the civilians he had worked so hard to save. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then. Shall we commence?\" he growled eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They had little time to prepare before the lion charged them, his increased size doing little to inhibit his movement. He was able to smoothly slip to the side of Rowland, wrapping his arms around his waist and hoisting him up high into the air before slamming him down onto the ground and destroying several evacuated homes. The cougar hissed in pain as he landed head first onto an empty house. He had taken a few beatings in the past, some pretty severe, but never was he once ragdolled in such a way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany wouldn't allow such a dominant display intimidate her as she leaped onto Derek's broad back, her legs wrapped around his waist as she tried to put him in a choke hold. Derek laughed off her futile attempt at offense as he yanked her free with little effort and tossed her aside. He raised his foot and brought it down with frightening speed onto the mouse's chest, though she managed to roll out of the way at the last minute. A shiver went down Tiffany's spine as she listened to the deafening crash of Derek's foot on the city streets. Had she not acted when she did, there was little doubt that such a move would've broken a few ribs. She staggered to her feet and braced herself as Derek came charging at her again. He was intercepted by Rowland, who had recovered enough to run over and clutch onto the lion's leg to try and trip him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your approach is spirited, but your technique is flawed\u201d Derek snickered as he wrapped his arms around the cougar\u2019s waist. Rowland\u2019s eyes widened as he was once again hosted up with ease. Derek\u2019s tight grip pushed the air of his lungs as he flailed his limbs in an effort to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou never participated in my classes so allow me to educate you. This is called a gut wrench. And this\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rowland felt his world get turned upside down as he was thrown to the ground with great force, his ribs and back aching from the impact. The lion looked down at him with a satisfied smirk as he dusted his hands off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... is called a gutwrench suplex. Maybe if you\u2019d attended some of my demonstrations, you would be better equipped to fight people your own size\u201d he taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He blinked as he noticed something in the corner of his eye and swerved his head to avoid a punch from Tiffany. Unlike Rowland, she was very much accustomed to facing off against foes of equal stature, her years of fighting Shenny paying off as she swung at the lion with great ferocity. She proved a greater challenge to Derek, though it made little difference. The size difference between them was simply too much, and her harder blows only managed to sting him a bit. He grabbed her hands as she went for another jab, his powerful arms pulling her in for a tight embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for us to be fighting, you know. The human\u2019s might\u2019ve swayed you, but I promise that siding with me will be a lot more rewarding in the long run\u201d he said with a toothy grin, his eyes narrowing as he pressed his crotch into hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust imagine it. This city would be our kingdom and these worthless humans would be our playthings. I\u2019ll even let you keep the Pint Puncher, seeing as you\u2019re so fond of him-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The lion\u2019s speech was cut off by a sharp headbutt to the mouth, disorienting him and making him stagger back. Shenny winced slightly as she watched the fight from the sidelines. She knew better than anyone just how painful Tiffany\u2019s headbutts were. The mouse pulled free from his loosened grip and grabbed onto his right leg. She looked back at Rowland as he was just beginning to collect himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rowland! Get his other leg!\" she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rowland blinked and nodded before scrambling over to assist, his arms wrapping around Derek\u2019s leg once again. Derek was still dazed from the headbutt when he suddenly felt himself getting lifted off the ground. With their combined efforts, Rowland and Tiffany had lifted him up into the air. Fear touched the lions\u2019 face for the first time since the battle had started. Clearly, he wasn\u2019t used to being taken off of his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what\u2019re you two doing? Stop! You\u2019re gonna\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two fell back and drove him face first into the street, his body going limp in an instant. The act of picking him up left the two winded as they pushed his thick legs off of them. Rowland in particular was feeling a bit lightheaded, his ribs still throbbing from being suplexed. His ears twitched as they picked up on something peculiar. He looked over at Shenny and the Pint Puncher. The rescued citizens were crowded around the couple and after having watched their battle, they burst out into a loud cheer. He wasn\u2019t too surprised to see them happy after Derek had been dealt with, but what stunned him were the number of people chanting his name. After everything he\u2019d done to make their lives hell, now they were cheering for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeels good doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Tiffany asked as she placed a hand on her shoulder. \u201cBeing a hero. Having people chant your name. Isn\u2019t it nice?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rowland stared at her, discomfort showing on his face. He wasn\u2019t sure how he was supposed to feel at the moment. He didn\u2019t fight for their sake, he merely wanted to get revenge for them having jumped him. Then again, was that really the case? Back at the lab, he had thrown the first punch in an attempt to rescue Wong from their clutches. If he really only cared for his own best interests, he could\u2019ve let them have their way. He felt compelled to lend aid and as a result he had enlisted the help of Shenny and the Pint Puncher, something he never would\u2019ve dreamed of doing in a million years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get it twisted. I\u2019m not switching sides or nothin\u2019\u201d the cougar huffed. \u201cI just\u2026 wanted to talk to Wong about all those dreams I\u2019ve been having\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you say\u2026\u201d Tiffany giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen smirked as she heard the crowd\u2019s chants. They were living in a strange time, where seemingly irredeemable criminals were turned into crimefighters. She looked down at the doctor to get her two cents, though she seemed to be in her own world as she stared blankly at the ground. For a moment, Helen felt sorry for her, especially given how much she had debased herself in view of thousands of spectators. The Pint Puncher flew over to them, ignoring the pungent slime coating the doctor as he placed a comforting hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on. We\u2019ll get you back to the lab and have you scrubbed down\u201d he said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d the doctor answered curtly. \u201cPlease. I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be there right now. Can\u2026 you take me home with you? I need to clear my head\u2026\u201d the doctor murmured, exhaustion weighing heavy in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher raised a brow at her request. From what he\u2019d been told, the Institute was the closest thing to a home she had and she never stepped outside of it for any reason. He certainly sympathized with her, having been humiliated in a similar fashion in the past. Still, it was out of his hands as to whether or not she would be able to crash with them. He looked up to his giant lover and by the looks of it, she didn\u2019t seem too keen on having the doctor in their home. After all, she was a prominent member of the Institute, the same group that Helen had accused of being power hungry schemers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you guys do anything, we need to get these bums back to the Institute!\" Rowland called as he walked over to remove the bracers from Derek's arms.</span></div></div>",

I don't go down that easily, you mooks. Now you'll get to-\" The angry lion's taunt fell short as his perspective changed. He saw Rowland with a cocky smirk on his face. The cougar revealed the contents of his hand, one of the bracers. Derek looked down to his wrist, seeing it shockingly bare. Realization sank in. With half the equipment he only got half the boost. He still stood taller than a house and could probably crush the Pint Puncher into oblivion. But his comfortable advantage over Tiffany and Rowland was gone. He reached up to about their bellies now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek had to make a choice. He could try to run away and maybe shake his opponents or he could fight them even with his disadvantage. The proud lion gave a weary sigh. There really was no other way, was there? He lunged towards Rowland, grabbing his leg and hoping to do to the cougar what they'd done to him. But just like when Rowland tried to do this to him, the lion found his strength no longer sufficient to move his enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA swift jab of Rowland's knee pushed Derek back. Next the cougar reached down and wrapped his arms around the lion's waist. He hoisted Derek off his feet and gave him a mighty squeeze. With a voice full of sarcasm he taunted his opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's this for a gut wrench?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek didn't answer, he only let out a horrified yelp as he saw the floor approaching fast. He slammed down face first into the street, the hard surface cracking under the impact. Overhead he could hear the cougar mocking his words. \"And this is a gutwrench suplex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to scramble back onto his feet but his efforts were nullified when Tiffany decided to have a go at him. She mercifully didn't try to stomp on his spine. Instead the mouse simply sauntered over to the floored lion and sat down on his back. The weight was overwhelming, but manageable. She had him pinned down, but with some time and work he could slip out from under her. Derek found himself short on both as he watched the cougar circling him. He squirmed more and more as he saw Rowland reaching for his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany noticed what the cougar was up to and smiled. This was about to get even better. She helped pin down the lion's arm and with a strong yank the bracer was removed. The mouse giggled as she could feel the effects immediately. Derek shrank down beneath her and she happily added onto his misery by grinding her large posterior down on his increasingly puny form. She wasn't worried about injuring him, knowing how big and soft her ass is. She may just be thinking of excuses to remain seated on her victim, but Rowland finally coerced her to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, let's put this twerp away before he gets hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, okay.\" She moped, getting back onto her feet. But the lion was nowhere to be seen on the road. Had he slipped away when shrinking? Rowland quickly realized what happened and let out a short guffaw. Tiffany turned to face him. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a little passenger.\" He said, snickering loudly along the way. The mouse girl looked over her shoulder to see one flattened lion plastered against her asscheek. She pulls him free and hands him to the cougar. He brings the lion up to eye level and keeps on mocking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you're right. I've not got much experience fighting people my own size. But dominating pesky little twerps who think themselves big?\" He squeezed the lion tightly in his fist. \"I've got that down pat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous cougar turned towards the Institute, but before he set off there was one last thing he wanted to do. He brought the lion down to his groin and pressed Derek against his musky crotch. The cougar's manhood was still hidden in its sheath, but Rowland didn't intend to bring it out anyway. Instead he rubbed the lion against the musky pouch. Derek could do nothing to stop his attacker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now everyone in there will know who did this do you.\" Rowland spoke brashly. But the cougar was caught off guard when he heard cheering again. Damn, he'd completely forgotten about all the people watching. But wait, did they just cheer him on for rubbing a villain against his junk? What was wrong with these people? Was Shenny influencing them in some way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher, Shenny and Tiffany were starting to help people back to their homes and making an inventory of all the damage caused. When he saw the cougar walk away the superhero quickly flew over to him. He hovered close to his ear and whispered in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I've not had time to give Shenny your apology yet. Maybe you should do it yourself now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towering cougar shot the hero an annoyed glare, then looked over to Shenny. With a distinct unease he approached her and cleared his throat. The wolfess looked up expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... Shen... I...\" He stammered, choking on his words. The superhero rolled his eyes and charged into the cougar's back, giving him a slight nudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to say I'm sorry for what happened before. Ever since I got these powers I've barely felt able to control them. The constant unrelenting urge to find a mate, to have someone that I could be intimate with. These puny humans can't ever hope to match it and you were the only one around that looked able to keep up. It made me weird and creepy and you didn't deserve any of that. I don't know how or why yet, but since I've been in the Institute that overwhelming horniness has ebbed away. It lets me see things differently. And it fills me with shame to look back at some of the things I've done, especially to you. I understand if you still hate me. After everything I've done that bridge is probably thoroughly burned. But I do want you to know that I am sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd at her feet gave a chorus of \"awwww\" but Shenny didn't reply immediately. The cougar just laid a lot on her and she didn't have the words ready. His story felt eerily familiar. She too had been driven to horrid acts by lust and only when the Pint Puncher managed to temper it did she have space or time in her mind to see what she had done. After all his nasty comments she still hesitated to like him, but with this apology maybe she could at least stop disliking him. He took her silence as a refusal to accept and hung his head in disappointment. But before Rowland could turn away she put a hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" She said softly, giving him a friendly smile. His sad expression curled up into a smile as well and he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I should probably get back to work. Little Derek here needs to be put back in his cell.\" He waved the lion around like a toy. Shenny blushed a little, thinking back to when she brought him in. She'd crammed the unfortunate lion up her pussy to play a small prank on the I.S.E.A. It didn't turn out well, but she was still new to the whole hero business. Before Rowland left though, he had one more question on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, have you seen Wong around? I got some things I need to discuss with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... She'll be going to my place until her lab is rebuilt.\" Shenny said, sighing deeply. The superhero was in earshot and could see the conflicted expression on her face. The wolfess felt a pang of regret the moment she said those words. If Helen was speaking the truth about the Institute then inviting Wong into her home just felt wrong. But after everything that happened today, it seemed only fair that the scientist be allowed to provide some perspective herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... uh... hmmm...\" The cougar awkwardly trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, you can come visit to talk with her. Though at this rate I'm gonna put in a demand with the Institute to get a bigger damn house.\" The wolfess grumbled. The Pint Puncher was quick to soothe her, whispering a sweet 'thank you' into her ear and planting a kiss on her cheek. Shenny's annoyance faded. How could she stay mad at that cute little face of his?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heroes finish up locking away Hank and Derek, returning people to their homes and ensuring the collateral damage was dealt with. After such a long day they all finally reconvened at Shenny's place.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> The first thing the group did upon their arrival was to wash the cum and sweat off of the doctor's body. Helen too it upon herself to clean her off, though not without some protest from Tiffany. The hippo gave her word that she would be gentle in handling the much smaller doctor and she kept her promise as she delicately ran her hands along Wong's smaller body. Once the filth was washed off of her, Rowland brought the doctor a set of clothes he'd been holding onto and they all met up in Shenny's giant living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need anything, Miss Wong? Something to drink? Something to eat?\" Tiffany offered as she tried to lend comfort to her superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Wong shook her head and remained silent. She hadn't said a word during their trip home, her expression blank and unreadable. Granted, she always had a stoic look to her, but never before any of the group seen her so defeated and weary. Her attention turned to Helen, her face softening in an instant. Whatever hard feelings she held towards the hippo, they were nowhere to be seen as she nodded her head in respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for saving me. I mean it\" she said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen scoffed and folded her arms. The doctor's gratitude meant nothing to her. Not after everything she had done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doc, I know you're still feeling out of wack, but... what happened back there? With you and... you know, those guys?\" Rowland asked, making sure to be as vague as possible as to not upset her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I knew you were a cock hungry slut, but that was a bit much even for you\" Helen added with a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her taunting hit home for the doctor as she winced and sighed. She wanted so badly for this not to come out, but there was no helping it. Everyone had seen her at her worse and they'd never let her forget it. Like it or not, she had to tell them the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not wrong...\" the doctor confessed somberly. \"I've done everything I could to keep my issues from coming out, but here we are. The truth is... I'm... not that much different from you, Pint Puncher\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero blinked and raised a brow at her claim. Helen had already told him as much, but he didn't expect the doctor to just come out and admit it. Wong noticed his surprise and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't just mean in regards to our... tastes. I mean in regards to what we are. I am a superhuman, just like you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That statement drew immediate skepticism from the group. If she had similar abilities to the Pint Puncher, why on earth would she waste her days away inside a lab? Sensing their disbelief, the doctor sighed and did something none of them had expected. She reached for the hero, her hand stretching out across Shenny's enormous table until her palm was inches away from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granted, my powers are channeled much differently than yours, but you get the idea\" she said with a slight smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is... weird\" Rowland stammered as he rubbed his eyes in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive. I don't see how it relates to you acting like an eager cum dump for those two though\" Helen said to keep things on topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does, actually\" the doctor answered back as her arm shrank back to its normal length. \"Some time ago, before the Calamity occurred, I was a junior researcher fresh out of college. The I.S.E.A. was much different than the one you know now. Before, they were called the Institute for the Study of Energy Emissions, or I.S.E.E.. Back then, people in Glam City saw them as a bunch of quacks. They believed that there was a latent energy inside of all humans that could be channeled and harnessed when under the right circumstances. Stupid as it sounded, they were the only credible research station in town. Or rather, they were the only <i>profitable</i> one. Mr. Abott invested a crap ton of money in that place, so even the most mundane position paid well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was brought on board as a part time researcher after I had published a paper on Perpetual Energy. Not to toot my own horn, but I was damn good at my job, so much so that they had offered me a full time position on numerous occasions, though my personal life kept me from committing fully to it. Being bright eyed and naive,  I wanted to show that I was a team player and that I\u2019d do anything to get the results we were looking for even if I couldn\u2019t work full time. I went so far as to volunteer myself for an extremely dangerous experimental treatment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome time before I started working there, a meteorite crashed outside the city limits. The mayor didn\u2019t even get a chance to look things over before Mr. Abott spent hundreds of millions on it. It radiated a unique energy signature unlike anything seen on this earth. Anyone who got close to it felt energized\u2026 and horny as hell. They bombarded me with that energy in one large burst, though at first I didn\u2019t feel any different. And then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The doctor trailed off as her face turned bright red. Shame and embarrassment once again hung heavy over her as she turned to look at Shenny with sad, sympathetic eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt hit me when I was home with my boyfriend. I was in the middle of talking about a presentation I planned on doing in the morning when I suddenly got real horny. I needed a good fuck, and I wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. He and I went at it all night without a second of rest. It wasn\u2019t until the morning broke that I felt satisfied, though he was half-conscious after having ejaculated so many times. He loved it at first, and so did I. I\u2019d go to work, feel it bubbling up, then I\u2019d come home and fuck his brains out. The problem was, he didn\u2019t have superhuman stamina like I apparently did\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She paused and glanced at the hero who cringed in response. In truth, even he had a hard time keeping up with all the women in his life. He couldn\u2019t imagine how hard her boyfriend had it trying to reign in her sex drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter about a week, he left me. Left a note on our door telling me he couldn\u2019t handle it anymore. Can\u2019t say I blamed him, but it left me without a means to treat my condition. I tried to get my mind off of it by working full time, but I could only hold it in for so long before I felt like snapping. It was only until the Calamity that I was able to find\u2026 <i>ample</i> candidates\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait, does that mean that my dreams aren\u2019t really dreams? You and I\u2019ve done it together?!\u201d Rowland asked in a mixture of excitement and confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d the doctor sighed as she pinched the bridge of her nose. \u201cYou and I have had sex. Many times. The reason you can\u2019t fully recall any of it was because I\u2019d do a mind wipe after each time. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d retain any memories, but there you go\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy the hell would you wipe my memory then?\u201d Rowland asked with a huff. \u201cI\u2019d have gotten along with you from the start if we were friends with benefits\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause, handsome as you are, you\u2019re still an arrogant loudmouth. You wouldn\u2019t have been able to resist bragging about how you had me pinned down and screaming your name\u2026 although there\u2019s no point in trying to hide it anymore. Everyone\u2019s already seen me degrade myself\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHandsome, huh? Well, you certainly have good taste. If you ask nicely from this point on, I might let you play with it whenever you need to\u201d Rowland chuckled before rubbing a hand along the fat bulge in his crotch. He grinned as the doctor\u2019s eyes went wide, her stoic facade nowhere to be seen as she didn\u2019t even try to hide her arousal. Rowland\u2019s pride waned as her hand shot up and grew to giant size before latching onto his throat. The doctor squeezed with frightening strength as she stretched her neck up to meet him at eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t... toy with me, Rowland. This hunger of mine has forced me to do things that I normally wouldn\u2019t dream of doing. Ask Gutsy how bad it can get. Ask Taurus. Gutsy thought it was hilarious to deny me after making me beg for him to fuck me with that giant dick of his, and Taurus outright refused no matter how much I pleaded. You know what I did then? I beat them down and took it the hard way. This isn\u2019t a game to me like it is for the rest of you. I do this because I legitimately <b>NEED</b> it. Do you think I <i>like</i> begging scumbags like Hank to fuck me? Do you think that I like being a literal slave to my lust? My condition isn\u2019t something I want you joking about. <b>Ever</b>. Do you understand me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowland nodded slowly, sighing in relief as her hand slipped from his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean\u2026 the offer\u2019s still open though\u2026\u201d he muttered, rubbing his arm. He held no ill will for her actions and in fact found it flattering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo let me get this straight\u201d Helen interjected with her usual smugness. \u201cYou mean to tell me that the reason we have animals walking around on two legs and destroying the city, is because you needed to get plowed by giant anthro dick on a regular basis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d the doctor snapped, flashing the hippo a cold glare that managed to unsettle her. \u201cThe reason there are more of your kind walking about was because they were going to funnel all of the energy in that machine into you, which would\u2019ve had a ninety-six percent chance of killing you. I almost lost my job trying to get them to change their minds and in the end, the only compromise they would accept was letting the machine overload. You were my only friend and I wasn\u2019t about to put your life at risk just for a promotion\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen\u2019s cynical smirk dropped in an instant. Much of what she knew regarding the incident was in hindsight and she was certain that she had a full understanding of how things played. She looked at the doctor\u2019s face, expecting to see a tell that would lead the hippo to believe that she was lying. The doctor remained unfettered, though given how well crafted her \u201casexual stoic genius\u201d persona was, it was hard for Helen to determine whether or not this was another act she was putting on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hefty hippo was surprised to hear Wong talk about any kind of emotional connection at all. Throughout their work on the project, Helen had to admit the scientist had been more amicable to her than most, but she'd seen how fiercely driven Wong could be. Something tells her that this isn't the entire picture. Saving her sounds all noble and probably something she'd do, but she's got a hard time believing Dr. Wong would instead let them irradiate the whole city. It sounds more like she was to be the final test before they were gonna expose everyone to it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up... You chose to cause all these villains and the destruction they wrought... because of me?\" She raised a suspicious eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWong sighed reluctantly. \"I'm not enough of an optimist to believe they wouldn't have turned it on the city eventually. But I was at least able to prove that it didn't have any value to kill you too. For lack of a better word, I did sort of respect you back then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The great Doctor Wong, respecting another? Alert the press.\" The hippo scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shove it. I mean, you were always confident in yourself, even when you became a villain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats becoming a massive hypocrite about it. You've berated everyone here for indulging in their vices when you're no better yourself. Take away the labcoat and you would be in one of the Institute's cells too.\" Helen added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still don't get it? I'm not indulging in anything, I <i>need</i> to do it.\" The frustration was clear in Dr. Wong's voice, but the hippo was unrelenting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did they!\" She pointed up at Shenny and Rowland. \"She couldn't sate her desires without stuffing men up her snatch and he's been looking for someone to stick his dick in ever since he got his powers. Both of them had their 'needs', but neither of them pretended to be anything other than villains when sating them. And if you're about to tell me you've got a bigger thirst for cock than the wolfess with a literal man-eating pussy I'm going to give that the strongest of doubts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least she got to quench it!!\" The scientist shouted back, taking Helen by surprise. \"I would've killed to be in her position, finding a way to subdue the urges. But instead I find myself working in the lab, having to pretend not to be interested in any kind of sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uhm...\" Rowland interjected, taking a moment to pick his words before he got strangled again. \"As much as I hate to interrupt a good chick fight, have you considered that what happened today might be a good thing then? You were clearly going mad having to hide it from everyone. Now that you can explore your passions more openly, maybe it'll take the frustrated need off. I don't like admitting it, but all those nights... It kind of worked for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist stared at the towering cougar with staggered disbelief. What was he talking about? Rowland could see the confusion in her face. Wasn't she supposed to be smart about these things? He quickly elaborates on his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've not felt anywhere near as frustrated or angry with myself since you started to visit me at night. I know nighttime Wong didn't much care for any part of me other than my junk, but she really did help. And just ask Shenny what the Pint Puncher did for her. What I'm saying is maybe it's time to drop the act and get the help you need? Whether that's a loving relationship or a dick the size of a bus. Because I can provide at least one of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I can't do that. Abott would never permit me to work at the Institute again if he knew I was fucking the test subjects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And lose his top scientist? I doubt it.\" The Pint Puncher interjected. \"He squawked a little too when I announced my relationship with Shenny, but he knows there wasn't a choice involved. Hell, I'm pretty sure that's how the whole redemption program started, and now look at us.\" The superhero said proudly, gesturing all around him. \"Tiffany, Shenny, Rowland and Helen were once the scourge of Glam City, and now people are cheering their names when they fight for justice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other heroes smiled, Rowland blushing a little. He never thought he'd hear the day that the Pint Puncher of all people would be praising him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say that works, then what? I can't just go into the cages and demand them to present themselves.\" Wong said, the frustration back stronger than ever. She twitched angrily when Rowland laughed in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha. Okay, first of all, yes you can. If you'd have told me that from day one I wouldn't have caused half as much trouble in there. And two, are you gonna tell me all of this still isn't enough for you?\" He boasted, gesturing at his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" The scientist scratched behind her ear. She didn't know how to break this gently, but her answer was basically a yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you're adorable, but if you think what I gave you back in that cell was all there was, you're sorely mistaken. You let me grow a little, yes, but that was only a quarter of what's available out here where I can be my full size. Trust me, this thing is big enough to swallow a person whole, just ask Punchy.\" He gave the superhero a sly look. The Pint Puncher just sighed deeply and rolled his eyes. Sadly he knew the cougar was speaking the truth. Dr. Wong's interest was certainly peaked, but she tried to keep an air of modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guest room's over there, if you make a mess, clean up after yourselves.\" Shenny said with an unsubtle roll of the eyes. Rowland smiled and nodded, holding out an open hand for the scientist. She nervously placed herself in his grip, surprised by how gentle the otherwise brash cougar was. He carries her along, thanking the wolfess for her hospitality. \"You're the best, Shen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever.\" She says with a little grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silence fell over the heroes. It had been quite a day today. The Pint Puncher was the first to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... now what?\"</span></div></div>",

Truth be told, he never found Wong all that attractive. Whenever he'd make a pass at her, it was usually done as a means to antagonize. Still, this would mark the first time they had gotten together without having his mind wiped. The memories of their past romps were cloudy and scattered, but they were just vivid enough to give him an idea of what to expect. He sat down the bed and smiled as he brought his hand down to his crotch. The the subtle musk emitting through the fabric of his pants was enough give the doctor goosebumps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you wanna do this? You want the whole thing in one go or...?\" Rowland asked as he unzipped his fly, letting out even more of his powerful musk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what? No!\" the doctor said with a pout. \"You can't just go all out right off the bat! You've got to let me work my way up to something like that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the boss\" the cougar relented with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. First I'd like you to sit me on the bed and shrink down to your normal height. I'll handle things from there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rowland was quick to comply as he gently placed the doctor onto the center of the bed and began reducing his size. He met the doctor in the middle of the giant bed, his minimum height still dwarfing the petite woman by three feet. She wasted little time in stripping from her outfit, the haste in her movement catching Rowland by surprise. He never would imagined a situation where Doctor Wong would be so eager to have sex with him, but it was flattering all the same. Once her clothes were taken care off, the cougar was allowed to drink in the finer details of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n His fleeting memories did little to prepare him for what stood before him. He wasn't sure how the doctor managed to hide such a voluptuous figure with nothing more than a lab coat. Large perky breasts, thick hips, and a plush derriere that could match Tiffany's. He must've been staring for some time, as Wong blushed and tried to cover her more lewd areas with her arms. Despite her ravenous sexual appetites, she was still uncomfortable being viewed in a sexual manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you really should get rid of that lab coat. A body as fine as this shouldn't be covered up like that\" the cougar said with a smirk. Such a statement would've normally been perceived by the doctor as him cracking wise, but the sincerity in his voice caused her to blush even brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last thing I need is people hitting on me while I'm trying to get work done. I was lucky to be granted shape changing abilities when my body was altered, so I can better hide my... more <i>distracting</i> features\" she explained with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, all that work to try and keep your secret under wraps. Don't think for a second that I'm gonna let you carry on with that. If you ever find yourself in need of some stress relief, I'm the man to come to\" the cougar boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The doctor narrowed her eyes and for a moment Rowland was worried that he'd gone too far again. The last thing he wanted was to get on her bad side, not after hearing what she did to Gutsy and Taurus. Breathing a heavy sigh, the doctor surprised him with a slight smile before she stepped forward and went to work undoing his pants. She was nearly bowled over both by the powerful scent of his crotch and by the massive erection that sprung forth and slapped her chin as she pulled his pants down. Rowland began to stammer an apology, though she didn't appear the least bit upset as her hands ran along his manhood. She marveled at the girth of his meat, her fingers unable to fully wrap around it as she caressed every inch of flesh from the tip to the sheath. Her actions were rewarded with a large dollop of precum spurting out and landing on her cheek, the scent of it making the her shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rowland wasn\u2019t at all prepared for what came next, as she leaned in and gave his shaft one long lick. He gasped in delight, his length splattering another another wad of precum onto her face. This only spurred her further as she began lathering his cock with licks and kisses, her eyelids growing heavy and body growing warm as she worshiped his manhood. Her attention soon turned to the cougar\u2019s sack, her mouth watering as scooted in closing and pressed her face between his plump, swollen balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-damn\u2026\u201d the cougar muttered as the doctor began to treat his balls with the same reverence as his cock. If he had any thoughts about going back down the path of villainy they quashed then and there. There was no way he could go back to using random civilians to get off after receiving such attention. As much as he was enjoying himself, his pleasure paled in comparison to Wong\u2019s. Now that she no longer had to worry about maintaining her image, she was free to fully indulge in her lusts. The potent smell of his musk, the hot virile seed raining onto her face, the distinct taste of his sweat on her tongue, it was a wonder that she was even able to think with how aroused she was. She pulled away for a moment, her expression becoming serious as she looked up at Rowland\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me\u2026 make something very clear\u2026\u201d she said before backing up. Rowland groaned and rolled his eyes at her sudden shift in moods, though he kept his comments to himself as the doctor shot him an icy glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were right before\u2026 about me putting too much energy into suppressing my urges. It <i>would</i> be best for me to be open about my condition and not be ashamed of it. That said, when you and I are in the office don\u2019t expect any special treatment. Never forget that I am your superior and if you do anything to compromise my position, I\u2019ll do everything I can to make your life a living hell\u201d she said coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rowland sighed and nodded as he folded his arms. Did she really need to bring everything to a halt just to lecture him? It wasn\u2019t like he assumed that their work days would consist of her slobbering over his dick. He didn\u2019t get a chance to tell her as much as  he looked down to find her down on all fours, her cold expression gone and replaced with one of debauched mischief. She grinned and waved her thick rear back and forth in a tantalizing display, her desires made clear by the clear liquid running down her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut when you and I <i>aren\u2019t</i> on the clock... we can really enjoy each other\u2019s company~\u201d she cooed. \u201cOr\u2026 maybe you\u2019re feeling a bit more vindictive? Perhaps I got just a bit too uppity at work and talked to you in a tone that left you feeling agitated? I bet you would often daydream about putting me in my place, right? Kind of like how you would the Pint Puncher\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rowland was left speechless. Was she really suggesting that he act out his twisted fantasies on her? It seemed she shared the Pint Puncher\u2019s masochistic kink, though unlike the hero who was still in the process of coming to grips with it, she didn\u2019t hesitate to embrace it. She grinned and bit down on her bottom lip, her eyes fluttering lustfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, big boy\u2026 show that know-it-all who\u2019s <i>really</i> in charge\u2026 she needs a nice hard dicking from a <i>real</i> man to remind her that she\u2019s nothing but a worthless little cum dump~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit, you are such a <b><i>freak</i></b>! I love it!\u201d Rowland chuckled excitedly, his dick throbbing as he approached the lust stricken scientist. His mind was racing with all the possibilities before him and he wasn\u2019t sure where to start.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"C'mon, big guy, with all the time you spent staring at my ass I thought you would've pushed yourself deep inside it from the moment I gave you the lead. Don't you think about holding back now after all that talk about me loosening up. I promise you I can stretch however much I need to satisfy you without hurting, so don't you dare get cold f- oh?\" Her taunts were interrupted when the cougar growled lustfully. He grabbed the scrawny woman by her sides and lifted her up. In mere moments Dr. Wong was face to face with Rowland, whose toothy grin managed to send a joyful tinge of anticipation down her spine. Like a ravenous beast sizing up its prey the cougar's eyes examined every inch of her naked form. He was drooling so much the doctor began to wonder whether he was thinking about fucking or eating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was answered a moment later as he lowered her a little and brought her closer. A sudden pressure against her ass startled Wong for a moment, but soon she felt the familiar touch of his tip prodding between her asscheeks. This wasn't the first time he'd entered the back door, but it would probably be the best. With every little buck of his hips Rowland brought his manhood closer to hitting the bullseye. \"This is for makin me forget all the fun we had.\" He growled with an insincere voice, hopping onto the suggestion that he should act out some vindictive streak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I ha-aaaaah\" The scientist tried to play along and protest, but her words melted into lewd moans as the thick shaft burrowed itself inside her. A well-hung specimen like Rowland would easily fill the doctor's cute little butt. But the cougar was looking to achieve so much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fasten your seatbelts, doc, because I'm about to fill you with so much cock you won't be able to resist bragging about it.\" He said with a smug grin. Wong was a little doubtful, but then she saw the bed get a little smaller. She was going up, and not because the cougar had started thrusting. Instead he was steadily growing, his swelling manhood already squeezing against the confines of her backdoor. The girthy invader started to stretch her body out to accommodate it, filling the woman with a perverse pleasure. She cried and moaned as the cougar filled her in ways she didn't think possible. As she moaned in pleasure the cougar whispered in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna keep going until you can give me a blowjob. And no, it ain't coming out first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... YES... do it.\" She mewled, the former villain responding with a growth spurt that mangled the rest of Wong's words into incomprehensible gibberish. By now she could feel that thick cock pushing ever deeper into her body. Soon it would clear all the way to her stomach. Hopefully that wouldn't cause any problems. She was feeling so damn horny right now that she wouldn't tolerate anything getting in her way. Steadily she felt the large mass push up further, her body stretching a little out of shape to deal with the sheer size of his thing. She'd never felt him this big before. In his cell a quarter of his maximum was as huge as the cramped space would permit. Now he's already surpassed that and he's not looking to slow down anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowland felt his girth enter her esophagus and pressed on. He was close now and he didn't want to overshoot the mark. He was nearing 30 feet in height, but it was the size of his manhood that had his full attention. It pushed up through Wong's throat until finally it filled her mouth. That was the point at which the cougar stopped. Having skewered the doctor he could finally sate his faux vindictive streak and enjoy the peace and quiet. Before long his contemplation is shattered when he feels her trying to lick his tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... extra salty... You've been busy today.\" She moaned as she struggled to lick the thick cockhead parked in her mouth. She caressed it as best she could in her position, drawing a hearty chuckle from the cougar. She gave his cock many more licks and weird kisses, stimulating  the cougar immensely. But he didn't want to cum just yet. This was only the start of their adventure. After a few more minutes of teasing he pulls her free, the massive shaft unlocking from her pert little butt with a loud, wet, <i>pop</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was good, but you've got the full monster to work with here, doc. How about we have some fun with all I've got to offer...\" He mused with a sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that 'monster' could swallow people whole...\" She replied with a suggestive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, you really want to... Oh who am I kidding, of course you'd want to.\" Rowland smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew about it long before. The security tapes featuring the fight between you and the Pint Puncher where you performed it the first time are some of the most well-worn in my collection. I swore that one day I'd make that journey, but I've always backed off at the last moment. I had to rely on you to get me out and until today I could never see that happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowland didn't know if he should be insulted by her distrust or cheerful that she's willing to really let him do it now. He was more interested in granting her wish. In record time he pushed himself to full height, towering over the little woman on the bed. With uncharacteristic grace he takes hold of the puny woman and begins to carry her slowly towards the throbbing mass. The smell of it was intense, but with each passing second she became more accustomed to it. It began to pulse faster, the large slit twitching a little in anticipation. He lowered her towards it, chuckling as she pulled her legs away from the smooth tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay doc, I've got your back.\" He said as he lowered her again. This time she overcame the initial hesitation and she put a foot inside the slit. The other followed soon and the narrow passage began to pull on them. It was an eerie sensation to say the least, feeling the thick musky column sucking her inside. She tried to stay calm, but when you find yourself halfway inside an enormous, smelly dick sinking deeper with each passing second, fear is not a choice. Her nervous shivering only helped to arouse Rowland further, whose cock began to suck on its prey with even greater vigor. Slimy pre made sure Dr. Wong's trip would be well-lubricated, covering her legs in generous amounts already and gushing from the tip as it pulled in more and more of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cougar tried to milk the moment for as long as he could, but his manhood was ravenous for the scientist's little body. There was no resisting it, not that she put up much of a fight. By the time only her head was still sticking out of the hefty tip she just gave him one last look and a big smile. Finally she disappeared completely, the towering cougar letting out a growling moan. \"Hot damn this feels good. I forgot how nice it was to have someone sink down into my balls. Wriggle for me, doc.\" He panted loudly as he felt her travel down his shaft. Whether it was because of his commands or because she felt like doing it herself, the little bulge in his manhood responded, squirming and sending him onto the verge of orgasm already. But couldn't have Wong exit before she'd paid a visit to his balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mix of fear and arousal overwhelmed the doctor's senses. The dark, narrow passage smelled heavily of cum and musk, her nose aching a little from the sheer intensity of it. Somehow she expected things to be wider. His enormous cock felt almost small and homely from the inside. The wet squelching as it sucked her into its depths was eerily beautiful and finally she could feel things opening up a little. The tunnel led to a small chamber. She braced herself for a quick dive and soon found herself splashing down into a large bathtub's worth of cum. The gooey substance was warm, sloshing about a little as the titanic cougar moved. It tingled a little on her skin, but nowhere near as intense as around her pussy. It felt practically aglow with energy, sending the scientist crashing into an earthshattering climax. She cried out so loudly she was convinced the huge cougar must've heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowland could feel his prey splashing around in his left ball. It gave him a rush of intense pleasure, his manhood more rigid than ever. Hopefully Dr. Wong was enjoying her time in there. As much as he'd want to keep her in there all night, there were so many more games to play. Also, he wasn't sure it was safe for him to keep her inside for a long time. The last few people that went that way didn't come out again, but with her superpowers who knows what would happen. Ultimately it was going to be his own pent up need for release that would seal the deal. She was coming out, whether either of them wanted it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cougar was cross-eyed with arousal, his manhood pulsing with a desire to erupt. He couldn't hold himself back any longer. He aimed his cock into a corner of the room and with a loud howl unloaded his balls. His erection sprayed out a thick, white lance of cum, splattering against the wall and forming a large pool on the ground. more hefty ropes of pungent white goo followed. Rowland grunted and moaned when a new stimulus hit him. The small bulge that was the scientist had been pushed up into his shaft and was now blocking the flow. Pressure built until finally she was forced out, launched like a bullet from a gun into the large patch of cum pooling on the floor. Her body made a large splash, suspended in the sticky cum and staying motionless for a second before stirring back to life. No rollercoaster could ever hope to compare to that trip. As she began to swim up the cougar grabbed her and brought her up to his face. She was drenched from head to toe and smiling from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it as good as you hoped for?\" He asked with a cocky smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better.\" She replied, breathing heavily.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get you cleaned up. Shenny\u2019s gonna gut me when she sees the mess we made\u201d Rowland said with a hint of pride in his voice as he looked down at the pearly white pool he\u2019d created. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The doctor nodded and stretched, an amused smirk on her face as she looked down at her slime coated body. She remembered the day the Pint Puncher arrived into her lab soaked in the cougar\u2019s seed. At the time, she had greeted the sight with a disgusted sneer though she was merely playing up her character. In truth, she envied the hero and was practically salivating at prospect of receiving the same treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The cougar\u2019s massive tongue startled her out of her thoughts, a shiver running through her as he trailed along her naked body. Normally she would scold him for cleaning her off in such an undignified manner, but the pleasure it brought quashed her objections. Soon enough, her body was completely free of his cum, though in it\u2019s place was a light layer of saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but all this excitement\u2019s got me tuckered out\u2026\u201d the cougar said with a yawn as he walked over to the guest bed and fell back, the doctor falling from his hand and landing onto his chest as he descended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna catch some z\u2019s before I get to cleaning. You can go hang out with the others if you\u2019d like\u201d he offered as laid his head back into his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I think a bit of rest is warranted for me as well. It\u2019s not often that I take time to sit back and unwind\u201d the doctor said with a yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rowland raised a brow as he watched the pint sized doctor from his chest all the way down to his crotch. Once she reached her destination, she laid back into his massive furry sack with a content sigh. Despite having climaxed not five minutes prior, she could practically hear the seed sloshing around from within. The cougar smiled mischievously as reached his arm to the side of the bed and retrieved the speedo he had tossed to the side along with his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The doctor\u2019s world turned dark in an instant as she suddenly found herself pinned up against the cougar\u2019s sack, the musty fabric of his underwear touching her naked back. Rowland laughed as he saw the tiny human shaped bulge struggling against his balls. He held no ill will towards her for wiping his memory of their past nights of passion, but there was an undeniable catharsis in being able to treat her in such a way. She would no doubt make him pay once they were back working at the lab, but he\u2019d indulge himself for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Wong huffed and quickly gave up trying to escape. Annoying as it was, she couldn\u2019t mask her content as she breathed in the scent of his powerful musk. It was a rich, intoxicating aroma that she had long ago grown addicted to. She sighed and closed her eyes, pressing her face into sweaty fur in front of her as she fell into a peaceful slumber. Her environment had a noticeable effect on her dreams as they were unabashedly crass. Rowland was right about one thing: it certainly felt good not having to keep this side of herself under lock and key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany shuddered as her large ears picked up on the wet splatting noise coming from the guest room. Whatever they were getting up to in there, Rowland certainly wasn\u2019t holding back. The lewd noises also caught the ear of Shenny who huffed and rolled her eyes. She could only imagine the mess they were making in there. Given how cock-hungry the doctor was, she was probably begging him to feed her into that monster between his legs. Her nose curled at the mental image, though her disgust was rather forced given the warmth she felt building up down below. Her hatred of Rowland and his pigheadedness was the only thing that kept her from acknowledging his physical attractiveness. Now that the two of them were on speaking terms, she was more welcoming to those type of thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She wasn\u2019t alone in her growing arousal. Tiffany was making no effort to hide it as she bit down on her lip and squeezed her legs together. Helen wasn\u2019t quite as interested in the doctor\u2019s affairs, though she had already been in the mood for some fun after her one sided battle with Hank. She casually slipped an arm around the Pint Puncher\u2019s shoulder and pulled him into her. He could practically feel the heat raising in the room along with the potent smell of arousal. All eyes were on him in a heartbeat making him sigh inwardly. There the times were he\u2019d bemoan how routine their leisure time had become. On the other hand, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to be too upset about it. Spending all of his free time having mind-blowing sex didn\u2019t seem like much of a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, kicking the crap out of Hank really put me in the mood. I think I need to kick back and unwind a bit...\u201dshe said with a smirk as she gave the hero a light squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd seeing as how me and Tiff so graciously stepped up to the plate for you, you\u2019ll no doubt repay us for our troubles, right Punchy?\u201d She added as she pinched his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course he will! Punchy\u2019s a real sweetheart~\u201d Tiffany giggled as she batted her eyelashes at the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero\u2019s gaze shifted up to his girlfriend expecting to hear her to voice her annoyance at the two for propositioning him without her permission. He wasn\u2019t too surprised to see her looking down at him with the same predatory leer as the others. His stamina and endurance and grown to a point that he could satisfy the notoriously needy wolfess with ease, but he hadn\u2019t quite gotten used to dealing with multiple giant partners at once. He smiled and shrugged his shoulders, affirming his approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm certainly open to suggestions\" he quipped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n All three women flashed him a delighted grin in response. No doubt they were constantly thinking up games to play once the day had ended and they could properly let loose. The only difficulty they faced was choosing which game to play first. The hero didn't have to wait for long, as one of them quickly made their mind up as to what she wanted to do.</span></div></div>",

Helen wasn't sure what Tiffany was planning, but her curiosity was peaked. Once they were secured in her grip the two were lifted up to eye level with the two titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy, you're gonna be up here, trying not to be swallowed up by our cleavage for as long as you can.

Helen was lowered down to the seat of the couch, feeling a little left out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you better hold on tight, because if you slip through, there'll be a hungry hungry hippo awaiting you, eager to make you vanish between her tits.\" Tiffany said, winking at Helen. The hippo gave a curt smile. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was getting the titans' hand-me-downs. But when she heard the hero struggle already, she realized they weren't making this easy on him in the slightest. She may have her hands on the Pint Puncher sooner than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero was down on all fours. The wobbly surface he was on wouldn't allow him to stand up. Overhead he could see Shenny and Tiffany smiling from ear to ear. They swayed back and forth, giggling as they watched the little man flounder about. He didn't last long before one of his legs became wedged between them. They didn't relent. To the contrary, it was a sign for them to shift around even more, the small pinch soon turning into a greedy hold on both his legs. To the Pint Puncher it felt like sinking into quicksand. The softest, most pleasurable quicksand ever. He gave the girls a big grin as the jiggling masses enveloped all of him. They cheered as he sank beneath the surface, feeling the hero squirm and struggle. If they leaned together they could keep him pinned down forever, but that wouldn't be fair to the hippo waiting below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen grew an evil leer as she spotted a set of legs emerging from the two pairs of giant breasts overhead. The puny hero had been lost to their cleavage so easily. The hippo paced back and forth, trying to position herself as best she could to make sure she'd 'catch' him right where she wanted him. The Pint Puncher held on tenaciously, but the two titans were starting to work up a sweat from all this fun, making his hold even more tenuous by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incoming.\" Tiffany called out, feeling the little man slip free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher had only a moment to look down and see Helen's rapidly approaching chest. He let himself go limp and closed his eyes. In an instant he was completely surrounded in the wobbly embrace of Helen's tits. She had placed herself well and caught him just right. The hippo gave a small moan as the two titans leaned away from eachother to see what their friend was getting up to. They snickered at the sight of Helen giving her boobs a firm jiggle. The superhero was nowhere to be seen. Tiffany smirked, her hungry hippo analogy proving more truthful than she thought. The hippo's cleavage shook, the hero's head popping out to greet the titans. He wasn't given much time to laugh it up before Helen's hand covered his view and pushed him back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay down, you. Big Helen ain't done with you yet.\" She said sternly, giving the two titans a broad grin. The hippo broke out into a small victory dance, shaking her assets wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, you show em who's boss.\" Tiffany cheered, whilst Shenny had to suppress a laugh whenever the hero's body started to get flung free, only for Helen to quickly stuff him back into her depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Helen finished her little routine and fished one very satisfied Pint Puncher from her cleavage. All three of them spotted his boner in an instant. Helen could feel it poke the soft surface of her tits before, but now it was out in the open and somehow just a bit more shameful as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun.\" Shenny mused. \"And I think I know what to do next. There's only one Punchy for the three of us, so we'll have to choose who gets to sleep with him for the night. And I think this little guy can do with a little more fun too.\" She rubbed the satisfied hero with a single large finger. Making him squirm as she roughly massaged his dick. The others could tell the wolfess had a plan, waiting for her to finish her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I propose we take turns sitting on him and whoever he sticks to gets to keep him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound fair, I'm a little outclassed there by you two giants.\" Helen protested, but Shenny was having none of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not pretend that you aren't plenty capable of wedging him between those big asscheeks of yours, Hel. You stand every bit as much chance of winning here as us. Now, to make it a little harder for all of us and to make sure Punchy has plenty of fun, we all only get five seconds to do our thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher sighed. How could he resist such temptation. He puts on his best resigned face and lays down on his back, waiting with a smile for the first butt to descend on him. The other three decide through a quick round of rock paper scissors who gets to go first. The superhero gulps as the titanic mouse hovers her mountainous backside over him, letting it crash down like a meteor. Tiffany moans softly as she feels him pinned beneath her vast posterior. With only five seconds on the clock she acts fast, but doesn't succeed. Shenny is up next and takes her characteristic unsubtle approach to this, slamming her rear down with all the force and vigor she had. He could feel himself flatten a little, but he didn't stick. Next was Helen's smooth-skinned buttcheeks. She tried fiercely wiggling, but in only five seconds she couldn't establish enough of a hold on the hero to wedge him between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more rounds a winner is finally found.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Irritation began to show on their faces as they each took their turns one after the other. They wiggled, bounced, and ground the hero into table with all the effort they could muster until eventually, Helen stood to her feet and turned to find him missing. The Pint Puncher's body had been effectively plastered onto her ass, completely flattened by the unrelenting pressure. The hippo smiled proudly at the two giants as she sauntered around the table, each movement causing her butt to jiggle and with it, the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair! Your skin makes it easier for him to stick than our fur!\"   Tiffany said with a pout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiff, come on now. Don't be a sore loser\" Shenny answered back as she gave her friend a playful nudge. \"If it makes you feel better, you and I can cuddle together~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... that's a pretty good consolation prize\" the mouse giggled as a blush formed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen paid the two little mind as she reached back and carefully peeled the hero off of her posterior. She was no stranger to this scenario: her standing proud with the Pint Puncher squashed until he was paper thin. This was the point were she would add insult to injury by using taking advantage of his flattened form and while she derived great pleasure from it in the past, it paled in comparison to the present. As she looked the hero over, she wasn't the least bit surprised to find that his erection remained intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta hand it to you, Punchy. You really know how to make someone work up a sweat\" she teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero let out a pained groan, though his throbbing hard-on showed that his enthusiasm had yet to waver. He knew what was coming next, having experienced it many times before. She grabbed his paper thin body and used to it clean the sweat off of her. He could remember being thoroughly embarrassed and disgusted by this treatment in the past yet after making peace with the playful pachyderm, he saw it in a completely different light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Up and down her arms, across her back and stomach, Helen showed a surprising amount of restraint in avoiding her more private areas as she made use of him. She was in tune with his desires as they mirrored her own. He wouldn't vocalize it even if he could, but he desperately wanted her to turn things up a notch. She was teasing him, occasionally bringing his body inches from her breasts or butt before pulling back and wiping off the more mundane spots on her body. Torturous as it was, he knew that she was building up to a grand payoff. Showmanship was her calling card, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Thankfully, the hippo didn't keep him waiting. With a smirk, she pulled his body taut and went to work flossing between her breasts. The hero's eyes practically rolled in the back of his head as his cock slid along the warm, sweat slick walls of her cleavage. Just as he was about to cum, she stopped and pulled him out. He groaned internally, his balls aching for release. Helen smiled and winked before bringing him down to her crotch. Once again his world went dark as she began flossing between her massive thighs. Every sawing motion brought him closer and closer to his climax, his face and cock being dragging along her hot drooling slit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, enough playing around. Time for bed, Punchy!\" Helen sang cheerfully. She yanked him back though her thighs and up between her giant butt cheeks.With him secure, she slipped her panties back on. She looked up at the two giants were had watched her games with great interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you even come up with this stuff?\" Tiffany asked with a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spend enough time sitting in a cell, your mind tends to wonder\" Helen said with a yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. Me and Tiff are gonna turn in the for night. You're more than welcome to join us if you'd like\" Shenny said as she turning to walk into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's all the same to you, I think I'll pass. It's bad enough having one giant roll on top of you, I don't think I've be able to handle two\" she said with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I was sorry!\" the mouse huffed. Shenny hushed her as she ushered her out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen sighed and laid down on the table. She thought about sleeping on the couch. but she didn't want to risk getting sat on in the morning. That thought brought her back to the hero. With a mischievous grin, she clenched her cheeks as tight as she could. She got the desired effect as she felt something hot and wet seeping between her cheeks. In her mind, she could see the Pint Puncher panting shaking as her cheeks milked his overstimulated balls dry. The taste of her sweat, the sweltering heat, the constant pressure; he was having the time his life. Though she had made peace with not being his one and only, no one could best her scratching that masochistic itch of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, lover~\" she cooed as she gave her rear an affectionate pat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dawn broke to an almost alien silence. For once there were no alarms to rouse the heroes and no villains willing to disturb the morning. It was a welcome change from the Pint Puncher's usual daily life. It's probably a good thing too. He's still completely stuck between Helen's asscheeks and though he can probably muscle his way out gradually, he doesn't want to wake the hippo. He didn't have to worry long as suddenly the walls around him stirred. Helen let out a loud yawn, scratching her ass and letting out a big fart. She looked up in surprise when she heard coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, Punchy! I'd forgotten all about you. You just feel like such a natural fit back there. Here, let me just...\" She reached back between her large asscheeks and pulled the flattened man free. Unsurprisingly his morning wood was still rock hard, but the hippo was still a bit too drowsy to make witty remarks about it this early in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large bedroom door opened to Shenny and Tiffany walking in holding hands. The hero didn't need to be psychic to know they had a very enjoyable night. The wolfess giggled a little upon seeing the slowly reinflating hero and his manhood. \"Still hard? Did Helen not do it for you?\" She teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen did plenty, but this hornball just won't quit, will he?\" Tiffany mused, making the three anthros laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guest room door opened and Rowland stepped in to the living room, looking prideful. Unlike the others, he was wearing some clothes, even if it was only his speedo. But as he wanted to boast about having Wong hidden in there he remembered what had happened last night. With a slight blush he asks Shenny for a mop and a bucket. The wolfess sighs deeply, pointing him to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, let me just take care of this, then I'm good to go.\" He said, not a hint of sarcasm in his voice. It caught the titanic wolf off guard. She'd never expected an ounce of responsibility from Rowland of all people. The Pint Puncher soon chimed in with a question of his own. \"Where's Dr. Wong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, she's down here and loving every moment of it.\" He said proudly, rubbing the bulge in his speedo. The hero could just about spot the small hints of movement hidden under the fabric. Knowing what Wong was capable off there was no way she was trapped there. She wanted to be there. The hero shrugged. Better her than him. The cougar caught the superhero staring at his groin and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You want in too?\" He asked teasingly. \"I dunno, I think you'll have to clear it with the doctor first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher blushed, turning his attention to the other two titans. Rowland took that moment to go back into the guest room and clean up his mess as promised. \"Okay, I think it's time we settle the last of what happened yesterday. I'll take Wong to the Institute and have a firm 'chat' with Abott about her continued employment. I reckon he might've suspected already, but I don't think he's willing to give up his number one scientist over this. If he's letting his superhero fuck around with half the villains in his path, Wong's activities should barely be a blip on the radar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riveting stuff...\" Helen said, rolling her eyes. \"Look, you go deal with her. I guess now that she's gonna be a bit less insufferable I can make an effort to be a little more professional with her. But you listen good to me, Punchy. The Institute is up to something. I'll keep working with them for now, do whatever it is they want so they won't bother me. But I'm keeping my eyes and ears peeled and if I find proof, I'll let you know.\" She spoke ominously. Her gloomy tone was a strange juxtapose to the sloppy kiss she gave the hero right after. \"One for the road.\" She grinned, before hopping off the table and setting off towards her lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about us?\" Tiffany asked with an amused smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. Maybe you could patrol around the city a bit? Oh, how about you take Rowland with you. Once he gets to see all your adoring fans he might just be convinced that being a hero is gonna be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, do we have to bring him along?\" The mouse girl whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want him near the Institute to say something inappropriate when I'm trying to keep Wong employed. I promise I'll make it up to both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I promise I'll make you regret those words.\" Shenny said teasingly. She wasn't overly fond of the cougar still, but the way he's been conducting himself lately was a marked improvement. Almost at the same time he emerged from the guest room, bucket and mop in hand. He disposed of the dirty water in the sink and cleared everything away nicely. The wolfess wouldn't show it, but she was impressed by his diligence. When he was all done he joined the others in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's the plan, Puny Puncher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first I'm gonna need Wong to get out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cougar chuckled, pulling open his speedo a little. \"You heard the guy, doc. Up and at 'em. Nap time's over.\" He carefully fished her out of his musky groin, setting her down on the table. She stank off his manhood something fierce, the smell burning the superhero's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you need to get a bath first.\" He said with an amused smirk. \"And you are going with Shenny and Tiffany.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Are they okay with that?\" The cougar asked carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begrudgingly.\" Shenny sighed. \"Just promise me you'll behave yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\" He said jokingly. The three giants set off whilst the superhero took Dr. Wong to the spring to clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Rowland could hardly contain his mirth as he recounted his time spent with Wong in vivid detail; from her slavishly worshiping his manhood to her enthusiastically asking to be fed to it. Shenny was amused by his bragging, though Tiffany looked slightly uncomfortable. She hadn't yet come to terms with the revelation that the stoic and asexual professor that she came to respect was just an act put on to hide her affliction. She didn't think any less of her for it, but she couldn't help but wonder if this discovery would affect how they interact with each other at work. Perhaps she could help provide relief when none of the male test subjects are available. It's not like the offer hadn't been extended in the past...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany? Earth to Tiff!\" Shenny said as she put a hand on her friend's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Tiffany muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're about to enter the city and you're just starring into space. You might want to keep your eyes on the ground\" the wolfess said with a smirk. All things considered, it was impressive how little damage was caused whenever they went strolling through the streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. Sorry!\" Tiffany said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The thudding of their footsteps were received with apathy from the citizens of Glam City. The sound which once sent them all into an immediate panic had become something that they'd eagerly look forward to hearing as it signaled the arrival of their heroes. Most stood at the sidewalk to give them space to move around unabated, though there were a small minority of people bold enough to try and an approach them for an autograph or a photo. Such was the case when the three of them came across as large gathering of folks in the middle of the street downtown. It didn't take a genius to discern why they were there, with the handmade signs and posters praising Tiffany and Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. Looks like we were expected\" Shenny chuckled. Some time had gone by since she had made the jump to heroism and while her view of the I.S.E.A. was much more jaded, her love for her fans increased with each passing day. As she knelt down to greet them, she saw that many were had a magazine in their possession, the very same magazine that she and Tiffany had posed for. <i>Looks like they released it early</i>, she thought to herself. Coming off the heels of the last villain attack, it only made sense for them to want to capitalize on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The crowd gathered around the giants with much excitement. They cried out, their requests ranging from having the standard affair of having their magazines signed and their photos taken to the more obscene as some asked to receive the same rough treatment that the Pint Puncher received. It raised the question, how many of these people <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can step on me any day, Tiffany!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can you shove me up your butt, Miss Shenny? Just for a second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much would I have to pay to get your bikini bottom?! I'll give you my life savings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tiffany was the first to pipe up, her eyes shining with glee as she drank in the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now. Your passion is appreciated, but you guys a little to small to handle <i>our</i> type of fun. Don't worry though, we won't leave you unsatisfied~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was a bit of murmuring throughout the crowd as they wondered what the mouse had in mind. With a playful wink, she reached down and plucked a handful fans. She pulled her top open, exposing the seemingly endless valley of her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun!\" she tittered as she released the eager fans and watched them land onto the plush surface of her breasts, some of them slipping between them. To say they they were overjoyed would be an understatement as they made the most of the privilege granted to then. They squeezed and pressed their bodies against the warm yielding flesh, some so overcome with arousal that they humped and ground their hips against her. If their brazen debauchery offended Tiffany, it certainly didn't show as she alternated between giggling and moaning at every motion they made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show off\"... Shenny quipped with a smirk as she looked down at the fans that had been left unattended. She wanted to one up her friend, but she couldn't quite compete with her when it came to breasts. Instead, she decided to take a different route. With a mischievous grin, she sat back on the road and placed her feet at the remaining crowd. They were were given little warning before the walls closed in on sandwiching them all between her soft paw pads. It had been awhile since she'd involved her feet in her games but she hadn't lost her step as she gave them a pleasant massage with them. She expected some of them to be apprehensive, but to her surprise they all jumped at the opportunity to pay their heroine worship as her feet were treated with the same affection as Tiffany's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Watching the two interact with their fans, Rowland could hardly believe it. Not long ago, these folk would've fled in terror at the idea of being subjected to their whims, yet here they were begging to be treated as playthings! Was this what he had to look forward to in a future? Surely not, as none of these these people seemed at all interested in his presence. Not that he could blame them, given the two gorgeous women before them. Still, he couldn't help but be envious of the two. How long did he had to wait before he had a gaggle of horny fans to play with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, like... excuse me? Mister Rowland?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The cougar blinked and turned around. He was surprised to find group of about four or five women. They looked up at him with shared awe, marveling over the finer details of his muscular body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We like, saw you beat up Derek yesterday and stuff and... we just wanted to say-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a <i>major</i> hotty!\" one of them interrupted, barely able to contain her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a girlfriend? If not, we should totally hang out together!\" another chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, guys! A-anyway, we just wanna say thanks. You were awesome in that fight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rowland looked at the ladies, unsure of what to say. For the first time in his life, he felt what it was like to be appreciated. Granted, he didn't save the day for their sake, as he was far more concerned with getting revenge on the lion and his cohort Hank. Still, there was a unique pleasure he felt in the earnest praise of others. He smiled warmly at his fans and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... it was no problem...\" he said rubbing the back of his head in a display of bashfulness that was very much unlike him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooo, are you gonna give us a treat too?\" one of them asked with a lewd grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Shenny and Tiffany gave <i>their</i> fans a show. It's only fair that we get one~\" another cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, the cougar's normal cocky smirk returned. His mind raced at the possibilities, though he had to be mindful of how fragile their tiny bodies were. None of them would survive a trip down his manhood, though the way they were ogling his bulge, it was clear where their interests were. After thinking it over, he decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, I can tell what you're all thirsting for, and I can't blame ya. But I think people are gonna get mad if I whip it out here, what with there being children watching and all. And you're all a bit too puny to handle being stuffed in with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some dejected 'aww's rising up from his fans, but he was quick to reassure them, with all the grace Rowland possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you ladies aren't honestly gonna tell me that's the only part of me you want to drool over, right? 'Cause you better believe you've all been invited to the gun show.\" He said with a cocky growl, leaning down and flexing his arm before them. Their disappointment turned to awe as they reached out and touched the wall of muscle. It trembled with inhuman strength. He smiled, seeing them so enamored with his giant body. If only they knew he was just getting started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get yer cameras out, ladies. I'll give you something to fawn over.\" He said, standing up and towering over them. He put on a cocky smile and posed for them, flexing in all kinds of ways to show off his muscles. They cheered whenever he showed off more of himself, though he got the sneaking suspicion some of his fans were just taking pictures of his bulge. Whatever excited them more, right? He could only feel flattered. The real problem he felt was that they were all down there and he was so much taller. With some trepidation he stopped posing and lowered his hand down next to his fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for the close up, get on.\" He spoke softly. The ladies barely needed encouragement, a few more having joined from the crowd near Tiffany and Shenny. When about half a dozen were in his palm he lifted them up, closing his hand a little to make sure there'd be no accidents. They were lifted past his furred six-pack and right up to his broad chest. The enormous muscular wall closed in as he held his fans against it. He could feel them rubbing his skin with their tiny hands. It was heavenly, but he knew to resist the urge to press them into the surface. It was annoying to have to be so careful. Maybe he could talk Wong into making something that would let his fans be a bit more resilient so he could 'play' with them without needing to watch his every movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying yourselves?\" He said with a snicker as he lifted the handful of fans up to his face. His breath gave them some pause for thought. It wasn't pleasant, but they weren't about to let it show. He flashed them a toothy grin before bringing them over to admire his biceps. As he raised his other arm to flex the fans were held near his armpit. The sweaty smell was hard to bear, but they didn't seem to care in the slightest, taking pictures of the bulging muscle in front of them. Finally the cougar set them back down. He knew what they dreamt of most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably shouldn't be doing this, but for my fans I'll make an exception.\" He mumbled softly, not wanting the other two titans to hear it. They both seemed busy playing with their own fans. He carefully sat down and put his hand down between his parted legs. The powerful musk radiating from his crotch nearly bowled his fans over, some of them coughing from the sheer intensity. Rowland smirked, slowing himself to let them acclimatize to his overwhelming manly scent. He let the fans climb off his hand and approach the mighty beast hidden away behind the tight speedo. The taut fabric left little to the imagination. Even flaccid the cougar's manhood easily dwarfed the enamored fans. The first to walk up to it and put her hands on it discovered the speedo to be damp with his musky sweat already. It only heightened her adoration as she boldly stepped closer and rubbed her body against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowland let out a satisfied rumble as he felt his fans caressing his package. They were stimulating him a little, though it was nowhere near as arousing as playing with Wong. He tried to think of boring and ugly things to stop himself from going full mast, but his fans were making it difficult. All the more so when they began to fantasize aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would ride this big beast into the sunset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would hump it until my legs gave out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would let this big snake swallow me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, shower me in your seed, Rowland.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cougar loved the attention and was amazed by how pervy these humans could be. If it weren't in public and they were perhaps a little more durable he'd gladly grant their wishes, but for now they'd have to do with hugging his bulge. It throbbed softly with excitement and he didn't want to leave his fans without something to remember him by. An idea came to mind. He put his hand into his speedo and pressed against the tip of his cock with a finger. Predictably a glob of pre came out, coating the digit. He stifled a moan as it happened and pulled his hand out, reaching down and dangling his finger among his fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, looks like I made a mess. Would you please help clean it?\" He said with a cocky smile, watching his fans stare at the slime-soaked digit. It didn't take long for the first of them to jump onto it, rubbing herself against it and soaking her clothes with his pre. The pungent smell didn't seem to deter them in the slightest as they all took turns using their bodies and clothes to wipe away his mess. In just a few minutes they'd cleaned him up. With the broadest grin on his face the cougar spoke to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, girls. I don't think I should be doing this, but if you really want a peek at what's behind the speedo, give me your phone numbers. I'll snap a few shots for you back home and send em to you all.\" He watched them all gasp in unison before they began shouting numbers at him. After getting them to take turns he had a list of no less than a dozen admirers in his phone, some of the women there giving them the numbers of their friends too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny had finished massaging her fans with her feet, stopping before she'd get carried away and hurt someone. She looked over to Rowland, seeing him smile from ear to ear entertaining his fans. He seemed a whole new man ever since he'd found a way to relieve his urges. It was hard to even associate him with the horrid brute he was before. She didn't find herself falling in love with him just yet, but she had to admit she was starting to respect him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany fished the last of her fans from her cleavage, making extra sure there'd be no stragglers hitching a ride. It was such a dramatic shift it still amazed her sometimes. A month or so ago she'd be terrorizing these people, crushing and eating them with reckless abandon. And now they were cheering for her, holding up signs and asking her to do all kinds of lewd things to them. She's even certain she heard someone in that crowd literally ask her to crush him flat under her big butt. She couldn't help but smile at the strangeness of it all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> The strangeness would only ramp up from there. The jovial atmosphere came to a halt the sounds of thudding footsteps echoed through the streets. The three giants jumped to attention in an instant as they were poised to protect their fans from the approaching threat. Their fans weren't the least bit concerned by the noise as they chattered excitedly amongst themselves. Getting to worship their hero's bodies was a treat in and of itself, but now they were going to see them in action! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny tried to determine the approaching anthro with her sensitive ears. Loud enough to shake the ground yet light enough to avoid cracking the concrete. That would indicate that it wasn\u2019t another giant approaching, most likely standing just above Helen in height. From around the corner, a large pig woman poked her head out and looked over to the wolfess with narrowed eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou! I knew I\u2019d find you eventually, ya dang hussy!\u201d she snapped as she stomped over to her with her hands placed on her wide hips. The crowd marveled at her generous assets, though her attention was focused squarely on Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, do I know you?\u201d the wolfess asked with a bemused smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe name\u2019s Annie, and you\u2019re the homewrecker that went and stole my man!\u201d the pig said as she pointed an accusing finger at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t play innocent with me, missy! It\u2019s all I ever hear nowadays! Folks be talkin\u2019 about the Pint Puncher and his new squeeze Shenny! I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d take him away from me when everyone knows that I had my eye on him!\u201d she huffed, folding her arms as she continued to glare daggers at the giant before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t even an official member of his fanclub! I\u2019ve busted my behind for <i>months</i> working my way up to vice president and I haven\u2019t seen you at <i>any</i> of our weekly charter meetings!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook miss, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re on about but if you want to start something with me, let\u2019s not do it when there\u2019s people around, okay?\u201d Shenny said with a sigh. She had always been protective of her boyfriend and she didn\u2019t appreciate someone trying to intercede with their relationship in any way. Annie\u2019s attention shifted to the crowd of humans, her frustration fading away in an instant as she flashed them a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hey there, little fellas!\u201d she said kneeling down to the ones closest to her. Despite her status as a villain, the crowd greeted her with praise and compliments for her voluptuous figure, much to her delight. While she basked in their admiration, Tiffany pulled Shenny to the side to speak with her privately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShenny, you might wanna let this one go\u2026 Annie\u2019s not someone to take lightly\u201d she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding right? <i>That</i> fatass?\u201d Shenny asked with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, Shen. Annie is one of the few criminals that the institute has given up on trying to capture. She may be smaller than us, but she\u2019s got an <i>insane</i> amount of strength. Every time she's been caught, she escapes in a matter of hours\u201d she explained as she glanced over her shoulder to make sure she wasn\u2019t listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky for us, she\u2019s never been all that interested in causing trouble. The only time she commits crimes, she tends to leave the job half finished and with little to no casualties. She\u2019s more concerned with getting Punchy\u2019s attention more than anything else\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenny raised a brow and looked over at the chubby woman who had taken to posing for the horny crowd. It seemed with each passing day, more and more of her kind were falling for the hero. Thinking about it, she couldn\u2019t help but be amused at the odd contrast. While her and Tiffany were acquiring a slew of human admirers, the Pint Puncher had unintentionally created an ever growing harem of anthros. She would\u2019ve been jealous had he not assured her his loyalty after his time spent with Helen and Quaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa'll are mighty kind, but my heart belongs to the Pint Puncher\u201d the pig said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, don\u2019t be that way!\u201d Rowland interjected with a grin, having just finished jotting down the phone numbers of his admirers. He didn\u2019t really care about her infatuation with the hero, but he saw an opportunity to bring yet another villain to the side of good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t every day that these people get to be close to a hottie like you. Why don\u2019t you give them something to brag to their friends about?\u201d he prodded. His sweet talk sent her into a fit of giggles as she played with her pigtails. How someone so giddish and easily flattered managed to accrue a reputation of villainy was beyond him, but he was quick to make use of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that right, guys? Don\u2019t be shy. Let Annie know what you really feel!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men in the crowd erupted with catcalls and perverse requests towards the bashful pig, causing her to blush brightly. They praised her powerful thighs, marveled at her massive rear and pleaded for her to remove her trademark bathing suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw shucks, ya\u2019ll sure know howda make a girl feel special!\u201d she tittered. \u201cAlright then! I \u2018spose I can make some time for you fine folk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rowland was pleased with himself as he watched her grab onto the human nearest to her and mashed his face into her breasts. He was about to throw out a suggestion when Tiffany reached over and grabbed him by the nape of his neck and pulled him over to her. She wasn\u2019t the least bit amused by his stunt, her eyes narrowed as she scowled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing? The last thing we need is to be <i>inviting</i> bad guys to mess with civilians!\u201d she hissed. Rowland rolled his eyes and pulled himself free<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey hey, relax. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s some hardcore crimelord or anything. She\u2019s about as menacing as a jaywalker. Besides, even if she were to act out of line, she\u2019ll have the three of us to deal with, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point, Rowland. It\u2019s good that citizens are starting to become more receptive to our kind, but that also makes them more susceptible to being manipulated by anthros who haven\u2019t reformed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u2026 I hadn\u2019t thought of that\u2026\u201d Rowland muttered, scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They looked back over to the crowd and watched as the eager sow indulged each request presented to her. One of her admirers had been stuffed inside of her bathing suit, his relatively small body outlined against it as his head was buried between her giant breasts with another fan being pinned against her backside. As they reveled in their positions, her other admirers were tirelessly massaging every inch of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her friends thought nothing of her fun and games,  butTiffany was still very much concerned. Annie wasn\u2019t an active threat, but she was well known for not knowing how to control her incredible strength. Apprehending her seemed the wisest course of action, yet she felt it unjust. She wasn\u2019t hurting anyone at the moment and in fact, was welcomed by their fans with open arms. She thought it over for a moment and eventually decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The titanic mouse couldn't bring herself to interrupt what was going on. Annie had taken to her fans with incredible speed, smothering them with her ample bosom or letting them take pictures and admire her body. Not wanting to feel entirely superfluous, Tiffany did issue one small warning towards the pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be careful with them, they're not as strong as us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it, partner.\" She oinked happily, barely looking up from the man she was about to give a large kiss. He squirmed a bit as she overwhelmed his senses, her passionate smooch nearly sucking his head into her mouth. It sent the rest of the crowd wild, more of them demanding the same treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'all are insatiable, I should set up a kissin' booth. I'll be richer than Helen in a week.\" She joked, putting her one lucky fan down. She fished the other out of her bathing suit, filling it up with several new occupants and ordering all who want a kiss to line up. A few backed out seeing the drool-soaked state of the last recipient, but the rest of her fans were undeterred, forming a queue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes ticked by with each of the anthros entertaining their own little crowd of fans. Shenny carefully let them see every immense corner of her body whilst Tiffany gave a brave fan an even more overwhelming kiss, smothering his head between her lips. Rowland posed for more pictures before coercing a few of his fans to flash their tits at him. The lecherous cougar giggled, loving how lewd the humans were willing to get with him. He wondered if he could set up another meeting someplace more remote so he could lose the speedo and show them everything. Annie worked her way through every man and woman lining up for a smooch, frequently slotting a few new lucky volunteers in her bathing suit too. By the end of it she had actually worked up a bit of a sweat, wiping the moisture from her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you guys. I thought only Punchy would've been able to make me work that hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, have you considered doing what we did?\" Tiffany remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you talkin about?\" The pig raised a curious eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when I was causing mayhem the Pint Puncher only showed up to lock me away and then he was off to whatever threat was next. Now we spend evenings at Shenny's place playing with him. She's his girlfriend, but that doesn't mean he's not got time for us, you know. And trust me, he's got a thing for heroic gals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And guys.\" Rowland added with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it, you, he's not into that.\" Tiffany chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a couple days to change that for you.\" The cougar replied jokingly, returning his attention to his adoring fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig was about to fly into a brash tirade about the Pint Puncher and Shenny when suddenly a devious idea shot into her mind. The giant mouse girl was right about one thing. Punchy never stayed around unless she physically held him down. But what if she played along with this? She would finally be able to show him that she's a far better choice for the superhero than any of these oversized hussies. She would make love to him in ways that'd have that silly little man forget all about Shenny and live happily ever after with the woman of his dreams. Before she could daydream about the wedding too a voice rang from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late to the party, can I have a kiss, miss Annie? I've never kissed anyone before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sow's heart melted. This guy looked a little nerdy and no older than 16. She gladly obliged, picking him up in both hands and providing him with a first kiss that he'd never forget. She almost pitied the human girls that would have to compete with this experience. She lowered him back down before changing her mind and giving him a big hug too, mashing him into her boobs. The man let out a small gasp and as his head was wedged between the soft globes a small crack was heard. Annie's blood ran cold and she immediately pulled back. She barely did anything, how could that have happened? Thankfully it was just the guy's glasses that had snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry.\" She said, blushing brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N... no problem.\" He stammered, still love-drunk from her kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you get a lot more fans as a hero, trust me.\" Shenny piped in. Annie vaguely nodded, still thinking about the nerdy guy that wanted her of all people to be his first kiss. Humans were weird, the Pint Puncher more than any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine. I'll stop trying to get his attention by breaking things. But you gotta do something for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what is it?\" Tiffany smiled. She didn't think getting Annie to join them would be as easy as this, but something told her she already knew the pig's demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want some time with Punchy. Not to steal him away or anything, just to have some fun with the guy without needing to hold him down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine.\" Shenny moped. It felt like the Pint Puncher's time was spent more with others than with her lately, but she knew this was the right thing to do. He probably won't like the impromptu 'date' they just set up with him and the pig, but he would understand what's at stake. She wasn't about to let the pig off easy though. The wolfess stood up, towering over Annie, and leaned down, flashing her a large toothy grin. \"But if this is some kind of scheme to take my boyfriend from me I'll take you down. I don't care how scared everyone is of your strength, there's nothing stronger than my love for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig was ready to throw down right there and then, angered at the words of that insolent wolf. But hearing the fans around her gasp as she balled her fists snapped her out of it. She'd teach that jealous mutt who the Pint Puncher really belonged to, but not here and now. \"Oh, sorry y'all, didn't mean to scare ya. Let's get back to the fun stuff.\" She said, laughing awkwardly and hoping to suss the tense mood. Thankfully the fans went straight back to praising her and hollering lewd suggestions at all the heroes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> While the giant trio were busy entertaining their adoring fans, the Pint Puncher had been speaking with the director of the facility regarding Dr. Wong\u2019s condition. The normally gruff Abott proved surprisingly receptive to the news, though that was partly due to him having suspected such was the case. It never made sense to him that despite all they knew about this unique energy and its effect on the human libido that she would remain unchanged after having exposed herself to it. So long as it didn\u2019t interfere with her research, he wasn\u2019t at all concerned with what she did with her test subjects. The only demand he made was for her to refrain from wiping their memories afterwards, as he didn\u2019t want to run the risk of her causing them any neurological damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once they were done discussing things, the hero walked alongside Wong to her lab. He had hoped to see her shed her cynical character and engage with her coworkers, but she continued to wear her usual dreary expression as she passed them by. Once they were back in her lab, she shut the door behind them and took in a deep breath. As she turned to face him, the expression that greeted him caught him completely off guard. Her stony gaze had greatly softened and her permanent frown replaced with a cute smile. Before he could comment on it, she stepped forward and wrapped her arms around him in a tight embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you...\u201d she murmured before pulling away,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what? \u201c the hero asked with a slight chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, the rest of my life would be spent trying to hide my condition. I was too stubborn to properly address it and too proud to make peace with it\u2026 but now things are different. I\u2019m done pretending to be something I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher smiled and nodded. While they weren\u2019t always cordial with each other, he still considered the doctor a friend and felt good in helping her. With his business done there, gave her a friendly pat on the arm before stepping out of the room. As he stepped out, he bumped into what felt like a large cloth covered wall. A familiar musky stench nearly made him wretch and he looked up to find that he had walked into Boris\u2019 crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops! Sorry little guy! Didn\u2019t see ya down there!\u201d the boar said with a hardy laugh as he brushed past him. The hero raised a brow as he looked back to see him walking into Wong\u2019s lab, the good doctor greeting him with a wide smile. With her secret now out in the open, she didn\u2019t even bother trying to hide her intentions, her hungry eyes leering at his crotch as she ushered him inside and closed the door behind them. The hero shuddered as he imagined the kind of debauchery she had in store for him, though he couldn\u2019t help but laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 she\u2019s certainly going to be making a lot of friends around here\u2026\u201d he said as he exited the facility. In the distance, he could see his giant companions just barely peeking over the buildings. The alarm hadn\u2019t gone off, so they couldn\u2019t have been fighting a villain. Knowing them, they probably were getting mobbed by adoring fans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome to think of it, it\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve mingled with normal people\u201d the hero thought out loud. He certainly enjoyed the fame and respect his job brought him, but he seldom took time out of his day to interact with his fans. Perhaps he felt a bit envious at the attention that his friends had acquired as he suddenly felt compelled to go over and join in on the fun. He smiled and flew over to them expecting an animated response upon his arrival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Unfortunately for him, the reaction he would receive would far exceed his expectations. The moment he came into view for the group, an excited, girlish squeal rang pierced the air. His heart filled with dread as he knew what that sound indicated. Before he could even brace himself, he was snatched from the air and pulled into the powerful arms of his most passionate fan, Annie. The plus sized sow had been the first to spot him and had leapt into the air with speed unbefitting someone of her size. She came crashing back down to the earth, but didn\u2019t appear the least bit fazed as she smothered the hero in her overly affectionate embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooh, Pint Puncher, it\u2019s been ages since I last held you in my arms! I was startin\u2019 think you forgot about me!\u201d she giggled as she nuzzled the top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnie\u2026 what did I\u2026 say about... personal space\u2026?\u201d The Pint Puncher wheezed as the air was forced out of his lungs from her powerful grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 right\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Surprisingly, the pig was quick to relent as she let him go and took a step back. His rejection didn\u2019t diminish her enthusiasm as she rocked back and forth with barely contained excitement. The hero sighed and brushed himself off, his attention turning to the three giants who, save for Shenny, watched him with much amusement. Why, he wondered, hadn\u2019t they apprehended her yet? Granted, she wasn\u2019t much of a threat given her lack of genuine interest in crime, but she was a criminal all the same. Although, part of him just wanted her to be locked away and out of his hair for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess what, suga? I got to talkin\u2019 with the fellas and they convinced me to give up bein\u2019 a bad guy! Isn\u2019t that great?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher raised a brow, the dour expression on his face still lingering. He didn\u2019t see this news would present much of a change. A large portion of her offenses came as a result of her airheaded callousness, so her choosing to abstain from villainy didn\u2019t mean a whole lot. Annie took no notice to his unimpressed face as she continued with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, the only reason I ever got into the game was to get your attention, but ya never stick \u2018round long enough for us to really\u2026 bond\u201d she said as she leaned in batting her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 wonderful. Not be rude, but we\u2019ve got to finish patrolling the city\u201d the Pint Puncher said as he turned to leave. He was quickly yanked back into the pig\u2019s tight embrace, though her grip was a bit more laxed than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, suga. We ain\u2019t seen each other in weeks and already you\u2019re leavin\u2019?\u201d she said with a pout. \u201cHow come everybody else gets to spend time with ya but me? I been your biggest fan for ages and you never give me the light o\u2019 day!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher was about to rebuke her yet again when the crowd of onlookers decided to add their two cents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYeah! Why don\u2019t you spend some time with her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, are you too good to spend time with your biggest fan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, don\u2019t be so heartless!\u201d </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero sighed inwardly as he looked over at the crowd. He had arrived hoping to enjoy the same praise that the others had gotten and instead he was being browbeaten into indulging the amorous pig. Still, she did have a point. When he was willing to befriend Rowland, someone who once engaged in acts that the hero would normally deem unforgivable, he had little excuse for not showing leniency towards Annie. The most he could say that he found her annoying and he was far too good natured to tell her flat out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, fine. I suppose\u2026 we can hang out for a while\u201d he said begrudgingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie let out another excited squeal and gave him a sloppy kiss on the cheek. The hero glanced up at his girlfriend who shrugged in return. She wasn\u2019t fond of the idea, but this was the most effective way to keep the pig in line. Another sloppy kiss brought his attention to Annie as she looked at him with a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoooo\u2026 I was thinkin\u2019, after we\u2019re done entertainin\u2019 these fine folk, you and I can get to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wait, what? You're serious about this?\" The hero stammered, caught off guard by the hefty sow. He'd just assumed her declaring herself a hero was another way to try and get his attention for however long it took to wrap him in an inescapably strong hug or something. But she'd been good with that before, releasing him without a fight. Maybe that was the other three looming over her to keep her in check, but he still wasn't sure what to think of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helloooo, Earth to Punchy. You in there?\" Annie giggled at the hero's dazed expression. Not one to waste a moment, she planted another slobbery kiss on his face. That finally seemed to do the trick, pulling the Pint Puncher back into here and now as he sputtered in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, what a guy, ain't that right, people?\" She hollered, drawing a large cheer from the crowd. The hero freed himself from her arms and wiped the worst of the pig drool away. He composed his thoughts on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, alright. But first I gotta say hello to all my fans.\" He raised his arms as the crowd gave him a raucous applause. He landed among them and shook hands with everyone. The ladies in the crowd were eager to get a kiss too, but the superhero reminded them that they'd have to ask the titanic wolfess first. Knowing the Shenny only reluctantly permitted the oversized sow to smooch him they opted not to press their luck, choosing instead to fondle his spandex-covered body. It was nice to receive this kind of love. The hero had definitely missed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on all the superheroes entertained their own little crowds. The Pint Puncher and Rowland even got into an impromptu contest to see who was more attractive. They both posed and flexed, showing off their impressive muscles. The white spandex left not a feature unseen on the hero but the sheer size of the cougar won him some serious points too. It was close, but in the end Rowland won, catching him by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I thought about beating you a lot back when I was a villain. But I don't think I ever thought this would be how it happened. Hah, better luck next time, Punchy.\" He laughed, striking a powerful victory pose. The hero could practically see the cougar's ego growing. As though it wasn't big enough already. Some of the more attentive onlookers in the crowd also noticed his speedo getting a little tighter than usual. The enormous cougar was definitely happy to win. Rowland was too drunk on victory to notice and nobody else seemed to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fun wound down Annie sidled up close to the superheroes. The Pint Puncher was the first to speak up. \"Alright, let's make up for lost time. We've still got a patrol to finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know. Why don't we split up? That way we'll have this covered twice as fast.\" Tiffany suggested. The towering mouse had a point. There were five of them now, having them all stick together seemed like overkill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we'll cover the outskirts of town, you two head to the city center. Those places are harder to navigate when you're huge.\" Shenny suggested dryly, playing along with her friend's little game. It was quite obvious the mouse was trying to help Annie and the Pint Puncher find a moment for themselves and the pig smiled from ear to ear listening to the idea. They all nodded and parted ways. The giants were barely out of earshot before Annie began talking to the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do ya think, partner? Annie and Punchy, crime fighters. Didn't think I'd be sayin that today.\" She mused aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes two of us.\" The hero chuckled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it to me straight, Punchy. Do ya think I got what it takes?\" She asked, cheerful as always. But it made the superhero stop in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annie, I don't know. Like, do you have any idea how to fight crime? And I don't mean literally, like against supervillains. Lots of criminals are just humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, what's the difference, right? A crime's a crime.\" She shrugged, her smile never leaving her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no.\" The hero laughed wearily. It felt like this would be a long patrol. But if the pig was really that eager to prove herself, he'd best give her the basics before she hurts someone. \"Okay, you probably already know regular humans are fragile and weak. Just because they did a little crime doesn't mean you're allowed to go all out on them. It doesn't even mean you're allowed to fight them. You've just gotta subdue them and take them to a police station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subdue them? Like sit on 'em?\" She looked a little puzzled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd kill them. I mean hold them down and make sure they don't run away. But without hurting them. I suppose in your case you could just grab them. If I can't get out of those hands easily, a regular Joe doesn't stand a chance. Just take away any weapons they might have and take them to the police. They will handle the rest for you. Though I imagine they'll probably look at you weirdly the first few times.\" He smirked, trying to put himself in a policeman's perspective. The pudgy sow dropping off masked bandits seemed almost comical to him, but it's pretty much what he was aiming for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I think I got it, sugah.\" Annie nodded. \"Thanks for teaching me.\" She pulled the hero in for another slobbery kiss, the Pint Puncher just smiling and accepting it. Almost on cue a scream for help echoed from a nearby alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, showtime.\" The sow smiled and barreled towards the alleyway. Charging across the road nearby caused an accident, but the hefty pig was only interested in showing the hero she could be a good guy too.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher had lagged behind a bit, having to stop and apologize to the citizens that she had inconvenience in her recklessness. He quickly caught up with her, rounding the corner to find her in the alley with a large masked man hemmed up against the wall. A young woman sat beside Annie with her hands grasped tightly onto her pocketbook. She didn\u2019t appear all that grateful, though the hero could hardly blame her. He could only imagine how startling it was, her being held up this thug and having a giant pig woman coming to her aid<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThought you could go around robbin\u2019 innocent folk, didja? Well think again, mister? Annie\u2019s here to keep the peace from now on!\u201d the sow said proudly. Her gaze turned to the hero, eager to hear him voice his approval of her performance. Her behavior irritated him, though he did his best not to let it show as he gave her a half-hearted smile. He didn\u2019t care for her behavior, as it reflected the type of self-serving attitude that he didn\u2019t care for. It was always good to have more allies, but he didn\u2019t want her only doing it for his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet your disgusting hand off of me, you fat whore!\u201d the thug growled as she squirmed in her grip. He was lucky because had it been Tiffany or Shenny, they would\u2019ve delivered a swift and painful punishment for his rudeness. Annie responded with an amused giggle and patted him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just hang on a while, sugah. I\u2019ll let ya go when we\u2019re at the police station\u201d she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The thug hissed angrily, his eyes turned to the hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s come to this, huh? Mr. Goody Two Shoes is recruiting freaks to do his dirty work, is that right? Some fucking hero you are. You\u2019re just like the rest of these monsters!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all, they aren\u2019t <i>monsters</i>\u201d the hero began as he narrowed his eyes. He wasn\u2019t about to let someone speak ill of his friends, not after all the work they\u2019d put in to clean up their images. \u201cSecond, I\u2019m not recruiting anyone. It just so happens that more and more wrongdoers are realizing that there\u2019s more to life than crime and they\u2019re trying to pay their debts to society. You would do well to learn from their example\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t give me any of that shit!\u201d the thief scoffed. \u201cWhat I do and what they do aren\u2019t even in the same league! I snatch purses and steal car radios! These\u2026 things, whatever they are, are a bunch of raping, murdering, psychos! But for some reason, you give them all a past and invite them to dress up and fight crime! How many people did your lady-friend snuff out last year before you two got together?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d thank you to keep Shenny out of this\u201d the hero stated coldly, his anger beginning to show as he glared at the thug. \u201cI\u2019m fully aware of her past, and she\u2019s done everything she could to try and make amends with the people she\u2019s hurt-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t exactly bring back all the people she stuffed into her cooch, does it? But it\u2019s okay, because you\u2019re a limpdick boy scout who\u2019s a slave to your cock!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Annie snapped as she gave the brute a quick shake to remind him of where he was. \u201cI can handle folk talkin\u2019 bad about lil\u2019 ol me, but won\u2019t stand by and let you slander Punchy! He\u2019s the bravest, strongest, most awesome hero this city ever had!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only reason you\u2019re out on the streets right now is because he\u2019s got some weird fetish for your kind! Makes sense, now that I think about it\u2026 he came around not longer after you all did. I guess you freaks are all cut from the same cloth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Annie growled, her pinkish skin turning red as she tossed him roughly to the ground. She couldn\u2019t stomach anyone insulting the man she loved and him calling the Pint Puncher out of his name was a bridge too far for her. The hero was jolted out of his anger and his eyes went wide as he watched her turn around and slam her massive rear down onto the helpless thug, her arms folded and her nose held high in the air as she ground his body into the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnie! What\u2019re you doing?!\u201d he cried as he ran over and tried to pull her back to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was askin\u2019 for it!\u201d Annie said with a pout. \u201cBesides, he\u2019s a bad guy so who cares?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnie, we talked about this! You have to be gentle with humans or you might seriously hurt them! Get off of him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet off him <i><b>now</b></i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Annie swallowed nervously and complied as she slowly stood back to her feet. By some miracle, the thief was still alive, albeit unconscious. He had been positioned in just the right way to slip into the crack of Annie\u2019s ass, sparing him the full brunt of her descent. The hero assumed that had passed out from sheer panic as he watched her meteoric rear come crashing down. The hero sighed in relief and looked over to find Annie twiddling her thumbs nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s bring him in now\u201d he said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Annie nodded, but remained silent. After taking a moment to console the confused purse nabbing victim, they brought the culprit to the nearest police station and made their way out with little fanfare. Annie said nothing the entire trip as she kept her eyes on the ground. Seeing the normally jubilant sow looking so dour made the hero feel a twinge of guilt. He was right to reprimand her callousness, but he knew that she was new to this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As they were walking along the sidewalk, he reached out and placed a hand on her arm. She blinked and looked over, her heart skipping a beat at the warm smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnie\u2026 I appreciate you sticking up for me, but I\u2019m gonna need you to try and reel it in next time, okay?\u201d he said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 sorry, sugah. I guess I ain\u2019t cut out for this type of work\u2026\u201d she said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a bit too soon for you to say that. We all make mistakes when trying something new. What\u2019s important is that we learn from those mistakes and keep pushing forward\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d the sow sighed, not all that moved by his words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero placed a hand on his chin, trying to think of a way to make her feel better. Perhaps taking her somewhere nice would bring her spirits up. Then again, maybe he just needed to give her another chance to shine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A jewelry store down the road was in the middle of being robbed it seems. Several men in masks ran out the door and packed into a car. It sped up right in the direction of the two heroes. The Pint Puncher seemed almost annoyed so much petty crime was happening all around him. He barely got a chance to console Annie before this shit happened. But when he looked over to the sow all he saw was excitement in her eyes. She didn't bother asking for permission, immediately running out into the road and blocking the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt screeched to a halt, missing the pig by a hair. The robbers needed their escape vehicle in one piece, but Annie had other plans. Before the car could reverse away she grabbed the front of it, lifting the front wheels off the ground. Just before she acted on her plan she shot a confused look over to the Pint Puncher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta be careful with them.

She crushed the entire front of the car, compacting the wheels into the engine block and rendering both useless scrap metal. The back wheels had squealed to get away from the pig's grasp, but now the car sat in the road. The show of force hadn't warped the body of the car much, just enough to render the doors inoperable. But Annie was quick to assist, stepping closer and grabbing a corner of the roof. Like opening a tin can she ripped the roof off the car, metal groaning as it buckled under her immense strength. The Pint Puncher hovered in, smiling at the work Annie had done to halt these criminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the men caught a look at the hero and quickly began to chastise him. \"Oi, what gives man? Why are you unleashing her on us? We didn't hurt anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie frowned and reached in, fetching the gun she saw lying on the floor between the men. \"You sure looked ready to, sugah.\" She sneered, crushing the gun in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't seriously trust these freaks, right? Being arrested is one thing, but having to suffer through whatever she's got in store for me? That ain't right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only thing I got in store for ya is a brisk walk to the police station. But if you wanna keep mouthin off, I'm sure I can arrange something extra for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robber shot the Pint Puncher an exasperated look, but the superhero just smiled. \"Oh, I see what's goin on here. You let her play hero for a bit to butter her all up so you can fuck later. Shoulda known.\" He grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher could feel his blood pressure rising, but he wasn't about to let some random criminal ruin his day again. Instead Annie answered the man with a sarcastic \"sure.\" She picked the men out of the wrecked vehicle one by one, draping them over her shoulder. \"Hold on tight, boys. Next stop, police. Try not ta jump off, or I gotta carry you under ma arm, and I haven't washed me pits in a while.\" She chuckled as she felt the bandits hold on to her shoulder tightly. The superhero quickly dropped the ruined car off in a nearby parking spot before following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick visit to the police station later the pair were all smiles. Annie flexes her muscles. \"Hah, I hope the next set of baddies go just as smoothly. Maybe you're right, Punchy. Maybe I do jus need some practice.\" The hero nods, but the sow isn't done yet showing her gratitude. She grabs him and wraps him into a tight hug. \"Thanks for believin in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spine... S...Spine...\" He sputters, the sow relaxing her embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sugah.\" She said, blushing brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay... Let's just finish this patrol.\" The hero said between coughing and catching his breath. Annie smiled, walking down the street with the hero in her arms. Whenever he tried to squirm free she'd tighten her grip a little. Without another word she made it clear she'd take care of him for now. The Pint Puncher reluctantly settled down, letting the sow do the walking for him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  The sight of Annie carrying the hero through the streets garnered much attention from onlookers as they watched the two with mild amusement. In some way it illustrated the shift in the public's general consensus regarding anthropomorphic beings. Months ago, they would've panicked, assuming that their hero was in some kind of peril. While some looked uncertain, most saw it as nothing more than two people spending time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Having all those eyes on them made Annie's smile widen. It made her feel like the two of them were some kind of celebrity couple. She knew that wasn\u2019t the case, not while he and Shenny were an item. That thought soured her mood a bit, though not for the expected reasons. It was thanks to Shenny that she was able to get this far with the Pint Puncher, so she held very little against her personally. Still, something was niggling at her that she couldn\u2019t quite put into words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Annie\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sow blinked and looked down at the hero to find him turning blue in the face. As she was trying to make sense of her feelings, she had gradually tightened her already fearsome grip on him. She quickly loosened her hold, allowing him to slide off of her and landing on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh geez, sorry \u2018bout that! Are you alright, sugah?\u201d she asked concernedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d the hero said with a slight cough. \u201cSomething on your mind? You kind of zoned out for a minute there\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about lil\u2019 ol me. I was just thinkin\u2019 about all the baddies we\u2019re gonna catch together!\u201d she said with a wide grin. It pained her to not be honest with him, but she didn\u2019t want to sour the mood after all the time they\u2019d spent together. Around this time, the Pint Puncher would\u2019ve made himself scarce, desperate to escape her loving embrace. This marked the longest amount of time that they\u2019d spent together and while she greatly enjoyed his presence, she was looking to make things more intimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, sugah\u2026 can we go grab a bite to eat? All this crime fighting is makin\u2019 me hungry!\u201d she said as she rubbed her plump stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine by me. It\u2019s been a while since I last ate out\u201d the hero said with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two protectors made their way to the nearest fast food restaurant, where they were greeted warmly by the staff. The news of Annie\u2019s turn to heroism hadn\u2019t reached far, but seeing her accompanied by the Pint Puncer in and of itself a positive endorsement. They weren\u2019t happy for long, as much of their time was then spent serving the gluttonous woman. Tray after tray was brought before her, each one filled to the brim with all manner of greasy food. Her ravenous hunger and abhorrent table manners left them both awed and disgusted while the Pint Puncher watched in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n By the time Annie was finished, the area around her was a graveyard of hamburger wrappers and disposable soda cups. She patted her large gut and let loose a window rattling belch that could rival Helen\u2019s in its volume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, do excuse me!\u201d the sow giggled with a hand over her mouth. \u201cThat hit the spot! What say we get a move on, Punchy? There\u2019s a nice lil\u2019 spot by the lake where we can sit and unwind!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Annie stood up from the flattened remains of the chair she had attempted to sit on and began to leave before she was pulled back by the hero. He frowned and gestured to the mess she had created. She blushed in embarrassment and quickly went to work cleaning up the trash, all while profusely apologizing to the staff. Once everything was in order, the Pint Puncher cut them a check and exited with Annie tailing from behind. With the institute covering all of his expenses, he didn\u2019t have to worry about the enormous bill she had accumulated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever forget, there\u2019s more to being a hero than busting a few heads. You\u2019re a public servant, meaning you\u2019re obliged to be on your best behavior-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSugah, I might be a bit of a slob, but I know howda act like a proper lady\u201d Annie huffed indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt to get a reminder every so often. Now, you were saying something about a place for us to unwind?\u201d he asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Annie nodded excitedly as she picked the hero back up into her arms, her grip a bit more lax than last time. If nothing else, the hero was grateful for her trying to reel in her strength when handling him. The only downside was the rather tart stench coming from her. Somehow she managed to work up a sweat in spite of the limited amount of activity she had engaged in. He did his best to ignore it as he was carried out of the downtown area and into a more rural setting. This was a part of Glam City that he didn\u2019t often frequent as a superhero. His foes tended to be glory seeking attention hounds, so there was little for them to gain in terrorizing such a quiet and sparsely populated area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was surprised by how open the people were to Annie as they walked by, stopping to greet her with a bright smile before moving on with their day. The genial and nonchalant tone they took made it clear that they were quite familiar with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty popular around here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d the hero asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, they\u2019re just bein\u2019 friendly, sugah. They\u2019re my neighbors after all\u201d she explained as she continued down the trail. Eventually, she arrived at her destination and her grip on the hero finally loosened so he could free himself. Standing before him was a house that on top of looking shoddy, seemed to have been built to look like a barn. The surrounding area was devoid of grass or plants, though there was a large puddle of mud on in the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to my humble abode! Feel free to make yourself at home!\u201d she said as she eagerly pushed him inside. She could practically feel her heart pounding in her ears. Everything had been going smoothly, so she didn\u2019t want to rush into intimacy, but she was tempted to tear off her singlet then and there and pounce on him. She took in a deep breath and walked over to the giant handmade armchair in the center of her living room. Ther<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you don\u2019t mind the mess, hun. I don\u2019t get a whole lotta people comin\u2019 round here\u201d Annie said as she nervously fiddled with her outfit, pulling it down to draw more attention to her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve seen much messier places\u201d the hero responded with a smirk. Given her species, Annie\u2019s living conditions were exactly as he imagined. On that note, he also wasn\u2019t surprised to see all the numerous photos and news clippings of himself scattered about the place. The newspapers in particular were marked by large kiss stains wherever his face was displayed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I talk to you about something, sugah?\u201d Annie asked as she moved aside to give him room to sit. The hero raised a brow and nodded as he took a seat beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. Fire away\u201d he said as he gave her a pat on the thigh. He had a feeling what the topic was going to be and had spent much of their time preparing himself for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just curious as to how you and Shenny became an item. Last bit of news I heard, she had taken you like a government mule and before I could even get to lookin\u2019 for ya, I hear that you two got together! What\u2019s the deal with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t explain it to you even I wanted to. Us getting together just sort of happened\u201d the hero said with a shrug. \u201cLove is weird like that\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that don\u2019t make a lick of sense! She beats ya down and kidnaps you and you fall head over heels for her, but when I spill my heart out to ya, you didn\u2019t give me a second look!\u201d she huffed, her emotions flaring up as she crossed her thick arms. Her irritation turned to sadness in a heartbeat as she looked down at her body. \u201cIs it\u2026 is it because she\u2019s prettier than me\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t even start\u201d the hero said sternly, catching the sow by surprise. \u201cBeing a bit on the heavy side doesn\u2019t make you any less attractive to me, Annie. Even if that were the case, that\u2019s on me and not you. You\u2019re a knockout no matter what my tastes are\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Annie shivered and bit down on her lip. She wanted to grab him and shower every inch of his body with kisses, but she managed to restrain herself as she carried on with their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, I don\u2019t get why you were never interested in me\u2026\u201d she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnie, you\u2019re cute, you\u2019re nice, and you\u2019re good with people. The only issue I\u2019ve ever had with you is your\u2026 well, we\u2019ll call it \u2018pushiness\u2019. You robbed a bank just to get my attention and you barely let me get a word out before squeezing the air out of me and calling me your boyfriend. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I appreciated the attention, but you just came on too strong is all\u201d the hero said as he rubbed her arm to try and comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph\u2026 I guess that makes sense\u2026\u201d she responded with a pout. She held firm the belief that her love for the Pint Puncher would be reciprocated if she kept pursuing him. She felt stupid for not seeing the bleeding obvious and hearing him compliment her looks and personality made her feel even worse. If only she had known, she would\u2019ve adjusted her behavior accordingly and it would be HER standing beside him as his partner in heroism instead of Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh well\u2026 too little too late, I suppose\u2026\u201d she said with a shrug. She tried to sound aloof, but the quivering of her bottom lip was a dead giveaway to her true feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher sighed inwardly and shook his head. She had been a nuisance to him in the past, but he knew that her heart was in the right place. He couldn\u2019t bare to see her upset, so he was quick to make amends. </span></div></div>",

I can fling by for some fun every now and again, but that's not gonna cut it in the long run.\" The hero said optimistically. He was aware he'd consigned himself to occasionally going down on the sow, with all the overbearing consequences involved. At least it replaced her pout with bemused curiosity for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whadda ya mean, sugah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really gonna tell me there's nobody else you got eyes for?\" He nudged her a little, giving her a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the pool ain't that big for a gal like me. Can't date any humans cause there ain't no chance o them surviving a night in the bedroom with me. And that's if I don't snap them in half by accident on the first big hug. Which is a damn shame since you all are so cute. It's kinda one of the reason I like you so much, sugah. At least you don't break so easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mhm...\" The Pint Puncher looked up to her, his concern increasing. At least she was self-aware enough to know forcing a relationship with regular people was a bad idea, though he dreaded to think whether she was guessing or learned all this the hard way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there's the other animals like mahself left. And many of them are villains. I know you won't be my man for now, but I can't see you anymore if I start hangin out with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, more and more of them are switching sides to be heroes. I know Borris and Rowland are already there, and it's happening so often I can barely keep up with it anymore. Hell, I can ask the Institute for a list so you can see what your options are.\" He replied with a proud smile. It stood as a testament to his efforts that villains were turning a new leaf so often he struggled to keep track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you got Borris on your side? I ain't gonna lie, sugah, I can respect a healthy gut like his. Full disclosure, one of the first things I'd be doing if we got together is make you a little bigger too. But I didn't imagine anything with him since I didn't wanna end up being the lunch lady that's gotta deal with his incessant hunger.\" She gave the hero a sly smirk. He tried to laugh off the comments about her trying to fatten him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you two should get talking. The Institute has his hunger covered for the most part and last I saw him he seemed to be doing well.\" He nudged her again, making the sow blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright sugah, I'll humour you and see if there's a guy out there for me. But I didn't miss what you said earlier. You 'flinging by for some fun'... You're here now.\" She smiled from ear to ear, leaning in close to the hero to look him in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher gulped. He thought he was writing checks he'd have to cash in later. But Annie wasn't about to take no for an answer. Not with a promise like that. He tried to distance himself a little, but her large gut was already pinning his leg. He was at her mercy and she made it very clear what she desired. Two strong hands wrapped around his torso, pulling him free. She needed a little more space than her armchair and laid him out on the couch. Like a flabby avalanche the sow rolled onto her belly, her pursed lips on a collision course with his face. There was nowhere for him to go. Her hefty breasts smothered his torso, making him gasp in suppressed delight. Annie didn't need another word out of him and dove in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips smacked and slobbered all over the superhero's face, leaving no part unattended and slathering it all in excessive amounts of drool. It was an intense rollercoaster ride for the hero who could barely tell if she was merely kissing him or suckling on his whole head. It felt like both at the same time. His whole body was pinned down by jiggling fat, the pig grunting and moaning as she tried to smooch him into submission. Speaking up was made impossible by her diving her tongue into his mouth at every opportunity. She wouldn't stop until she'd taken what she wanted. The kiss she'd always dreamed of. Who knows, maybe this is how Shenny convinced him too and he'll turn around to her afterwards. But that only had a chance of working if she gave it her all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero eventually stopped squirming and struggling beneath the sow and Annie finally paused long enough to inspect the results. She smiled, sitting up and hoisting the hero into her lap. The large wet spot on her couch had an outline of his head in it, the result of a vigorous wet kiss. The hero was barely responsive, but regaining his bearings after such an overwhelming experience. He's fairly sure he fainted for a moment there, but he honestly cannot recall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm... I'm definitely up for more 'fun' like that in the future, sugah. Sorry if I got a little carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... *cough* okay. I know you've been saving that one up for a while.\" He sputtered back, wiping the worst of her drool from his mouth. His seat shook as the sow giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I guess. But it was worth it.\" She added, wrapping her arms around him and giving him a hug. For the first time the hero didn't need to ask her to ease up, her embrace feeling kind of pleasant instead of the usual bonecrushing intensity. </span></div></div>",

I reckon ya'll better be headin' out now... you got a whole city to look after and whatnot\" Annie said quietly as she released the hero from her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher raised a brow at her sudden shift in attitude, though it wasn't hard for him to see that she wanted more. Her skin was flushed with arousal and she was biting on her bottom lip as her hands rested on her lap. He respected her attempt at restraint, but it wasn't necessary. They could have the romantic relationship that she'd wanted, but that didn't mean they couldn't still have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annie do you want to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you insist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before he could even finish his offer, the sow had slipped off her bathing suit in one swift motion before pulling him into another hug and doing the same to his costume. The hero wasn't sure if she even knew what he was about to suggest, but it didn't matter. He was going to make sure that she got a bit more out of their time together than just a kiss. He let her take the reigns as she flopped down on top of him, her heaving breasts pressing on either side of his head as she tried to align his manhood against her hungry slit. As she sat back up, he founding himself being pinning beneath her generous gut with his vision slightly obscured by the underside of her breasts. He didn't need to see her face to know that she was beaming at him, her face turned a deep shade of red as she felt the hero's manhood enter her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Despite their extreme differences in size, the hero was surprised at how tight she was. Every part of her was immensely strong it  seemed, as her inner walls clamped onto him with the type of intensity that he'd expect from Shenny. It was his turn to cry out as Annie bounced up and down his length, the sheer force of her pussy nearly taking him up with her every time she ascended. His time spent with Helen had done well in conditioning him for this kind of lovemaking, but even she couldn't match Annie's passion as her couch groaned with each plunge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n In a matter of minutes, Annie managed to bring him to an teeth clenching orgasm with her following suit shortly afterward. The smell of her discharge filled his lungs as he felt his lower half getting soaked in it. She was pent up for some time, it seemed. Not doubt saving her next orgasm for the day he choose to reciprocate her advances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sugah... that was... mmm... you're something else...\" she panted as she wiped the sweat from her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... I am to please...\" the hero said with a grin. He looked around her home for a moment wondering if it had a shower installed, though his attention was quickly forced back onto Annie as he felt her pussy squeezing on his still flaccid cock. He swallowed nervously as he felt her body getting warm again. How was she ready to go again so quickly?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, stud... show me how much ya got~\" Annie cooed as she began bouncing on him again. The hero groaned, but couldn't bring himself to complain as his member went to full mass almost immediately. He should've known that she wouldn't have been satisfied after three minutes. He took in a deep breath and braced himself as he had a feeling that he'd be there for an awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>One Hour Later</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Every part of the hero's body was screaming at him for his decision to stay. Annie's sex drive was the stuff of nightmares, and just when it seemed as if it'd never end, she finally slipped into a deep and peaceful slumber with her lover held tightly in her arms. She took full advantage of their time together as she used every part of her thick body to bring himself an intense orgasm time and time again. The results showed as a thick splattering of cum could be found on her breasts, in cleavage, on her rear, and even on the bottoms of her feet. If anything else, she wasn't a selfish lover, as she found great joy in being able to bring him such pleasure. Her enthusiasm was appreciated by the hero, but it did little to sooth the aches and pains he was suffering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero managed to slip out of her grasp with the aid of their combined sweat and hobbled over to collect his outfit. He was hesitant to put it on right away given how the smell of sex clung to him at the moment. He thought about looking around for a bathroom, but he didn't want to run the risk of her waking up in the mood again. With a heavy sigh he decided to fly home in the buff. Turning around, he gave the sleeping sow one more smile before heading out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The superhero was thoroughly done for the day. After all the headaches of making sure Wong would be able to continue her work at the Institute and his 'date' with Annie the Pint Puncher was ready to call it a night. He couldn't wait to nestle himself in his girlfriend's pillowy breasts. She wouldn't mind him being naked. Though stinking of the sow's release might bring more objections. Maybe a quick dip in the lake before going to her is wise. Or he could just let her slide him into her own pleasure cavern. As smelly he was having Annie's juices splattered on him, it'd be nothing compared to being practically submerged in them by Shenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis daydreaming about the wolfess was interrupted by a sharp whistle. Someone was up late at night and saw him soaring through the air. He had flown low to avoid too many people catching a glimpse of his little hero, skirting over rooftops and keeping a low profile. But apparently there were still some keen-eyed folks out there this late at dusk. He looked over to see if he could find the source of the whistle, but the hero didn't see anyone. When he looked in front of him again his eyes widened. Just ahead was a large elephantine trunk sticking up in the air, ready to catch him. He was mere moments away, far too late to adjust course or do anything other than realizing the whistle had just been a well-timed distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful appendage curled around the Pint Puncher's body, snatching him from the sky and dragging him into the alley. Its grip was less constricting than the hero feared and soon the reason became clear. He was swung around and brought face to face with an excited looking Quaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy! Fancy running into you here. I was just thinking about you.\" She was elated to meet him, but the hero felt his spirits sink. This was going to be a long night, wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Quaker.\" She responds flatly. The elephant either doesn't register or simply doesn't care about his indifference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got great news. I stopped a crime the other day. Some thief was running from the police into an alley, so I quickly made a wall appear. When they had him I dropped the wall again and they were really thankful. Apparently the guy had been giving them the slip several times now. They were so happy. None of them even seemed to care anymore that I used to be a villain. But that's enough about me. What have you been up to?\" She started to ramble a bit, clearly still on her heroic high. Before the hero could answer his smell made it up her nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Ooooooh, did Annie get her hands on you? Wow, she didn't hold back at all, did she? Can't blame her, just look at you. Even worn out you're still so cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I just... Can we maybe continue this conversation later? I'm really tired and I'd like to get back home.\" The hero tried not to sound snippy, but the elephant seemed a bit put off by his words. It didn't take long for her smile to return though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know. Why don't you come with me? My followers can dote on you, maybe wash the smell of pig from you and there's plenty of comfy places to sleep.\" The elephant woman gave her breasts an unsubtle nudge when mentioning sleeping spots. \"Or if having me sleep on top of you is more your style, I'm sure I can be talked into that too. And in the morning we can massage those sore muscles of you.\" She added, giggling a little at the hero's flustered reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, but if you really just want to get back to your girlfriend, I suppose you could bribe me with a kiss. Reckon you still have the stamina for that, Punchy?\" The elephant added on with a naughty giggle. It'd be hard to boast about being a hero if she'd kidnap the Pint Puncher straight after. But she wasn't about to let him go without something in return. And judging by the little twitching she's feeling in the coils of her trunk, he wasn't too averse to it either.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Quaker smiled as she watched the hero mull over his decisions. Annie certainly put him through the wringer and she could hardly hold it against him for turning down her invitation. She could only imagine the stress he went through each day with all of his former foes vying for his attention. That said, he couldn't have bumped into her at a better time. Since her turn to heroism, she had discovered that she had an aptitude for healing that, were it not for him, would've never been put to good use. It was her hope that in demonstrating her skills to him, he'd be inclined to visit her abode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You needn't worry, Punchy. I'm not nearly as needy as Annie. All I want is the pleasure of your company\" she said as she pat the top of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I find that rather hard to believe after the last time we were together\" the hero said as he thought back to their time spent at Helen's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't act like you weren't into it too!\" Quaker said with a hearty laugh before patting him on the back. \"Seriously though, just trust me on this one. I can help you unwind after the day you've had\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a thinking it over for a moment, the hero sighed and nodded. As much as he wanted to go home the loving embrace of his girlfriend, he was curious to witness the going ons of Quaker's abode. He overheard her conversing with Helen about all the followers that she had accumulated and hadn't had a the chance to really probe her for further details. Besides, if she was going to call herself a hero, he needed to make sure that she was treating them justly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" The pachyderm chimed happily before stuffing his slime soaked body in between her breasts. \"Hold on tight. I'd hate to have my handsome guest slip out and suffocate\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Were it not for the boob flesh surrounding him, the hero would've laid into her for cracking such a joke when they about to get enter the earth. Instead he voiced his disapproval by pinching her boob, though with her tough hide, the elephant only giggled in response. Using her command of the earth, she was able to sit comfortably while the dirt and stone enveloped her and pushed her deep beneath the surface of Glam City. Were anyone to walk by the area, they would see no signs of her presence, due in part to closing up her tunnels behind her. She was fully committed to her new role and the last thing she wanted to do was leave a giant hole for some innocent civilian to stumble into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher waited as he heard rumbling all around him. Thinking about it, he never really noticed just how Quaker was in using her powers until that moment. In a matter of minutes, he could pick up the sound of running water and conversation. Soon enough he was freed from her cleavage and the sight that greeted him took his breath away. Quaker's home was immaculate in it's architecture, with limestone tiles, hand carved columns, several pools of bubbling mud, and dozens of statues of herself. It looked as if he had stepped into a high end spa, rather than the lair of a former super villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever wondered why I recovered so fast after we fought each other? Now you know\" Quaker teased as she sat the hero down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher ignored her quip as he continued to look around her home curiously. True to her word, there were an abundance of humans toiling away with smiles on their faces. What struck him as odd was the outfits they were. They were all dressed in tribal garbs, consisting of loincloths and wrappings. As if sensing his confusion, Quaker smiled sheepishly and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's part of the experience, Punchy. They want to worship me as royalty and they're acting out their roles as my servants. These outfits are meant to reflect their status while within my home\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, humility is an important part of being a hero too\" the hero said as he folded his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Queen! You've returned!\" one of the female servants called out as she ran over to greet them. \" And I see you've brought another worshiper. Welcome to The Temple!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The... Temple?\" the hero repeated with a bemused smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's their little nickname for my home. I think it's rather cute, don't you?\" Quaker asked with a giggle before turning her attention to the servant in front of her. \"Take care to make sure his every need is satisfied, won't you. He is our guest of honor\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my Queen\" the servant said with a smile before taking his arm and pulling him along before he could ask any further questions. Her hands kneaded into his arm slightly, making him wince as she examined his still aching muscles. \"You certainly have a lot of tension in your body. Nothing that a quick mud bath can't solve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The term \"mud bath\" made the hero grimace as it made him think of Annie. Not wanting to come off as ungracious, he kept his discomfort to himself as he allowed allowed the servant to lead him through Quaker's opulent home. Whenever they passed by one of her other followers, they would stop and greet him with reverence that went beyond what he'd expect. He was used to being met with praise and excitement by his fans, but these people seemed to admire him in a similar vein to Quaker as they blushed and stammered over themselves at his mere presence. It was only after being fawned over the tenth time did he turn to his guide and question her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really that surprised?\" she asked with a curt laugh. \"We've all been admirers of the Queen long before she was kind enough to invite us into her home. With no way to safely indulge our fantasies, we took to trading around tapes and photos of your past fights with her. Whenever she got the better of you, whether it be crushing her beneath her foot or pinning you beneath her magnificent butt or... or...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero turned to look at her and raised a brow at the heated expression on her sweating face. It took her a moment to come to as she shook her head in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ahem... whenever she got the better of you, we would imagine ourselves in your place. In that light, you were doubly our hero, both for protecting us from danger and acting out our fantasies\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher bit back the urge to lay into her as he nodded. Her explanation made sense, but it irritated him to think that while he was being manhandled by Quaker and fighting just to survive, they were sitting in their homes pleasuring themselves to his misfortune. At the very least, she acknowledged and was grateful for his efforts in saving Glam City from Quaker's rampages. He stewed on that fact until they reached their destination. At the end of Quaker's home was an elaborate stone throne tailored specifically for the towering pachyderm. Life sized statues of Quaker stood on either side, both posing in a seductive manner. In the center of the throne room was what had to have been the largest pool of mud he'd seen since his arrival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't recall another time where someone other than the Queen was allowed to enter her private bath. You are quite lucky\" she said with a smile as she gestured for him to step inside. The hero questioned how sloshing around in mud was supposed to make him feel any better, but he decided to give it a try regardless. He slowly entered the bubbling pool and once fully submerged, let out a satisfied groan as he leaned back against the edge of the pool. He was no stranger to being submerged in mud given his time spent battling Quaker, but there was something unique about this pool that he couldn't quite put his finger on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you've noticed the healing properties of the pool? The Queen's mastery over the earth allows her to draw out the minerals from stone and locate reservoirs underground. What you're sitting in is a mixture of the purest spring water and the richest dirt one could ever find\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero nodded, though he barely registered what was being said to him in his state of content. Even the spring back home paled in comparison. He wondered if it was at all possible to have Quaker create a mud bath there as well. He wasn't sure if Shenny would get behind it though. Having to clean the dried dirt from her fur would defeat the purpose of using it to unwind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be back shortly with a towel for you. Feel free to call if you need anything\" the servant said a bow before scampering off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do\" the Pint Puncher answered back with a slight yawn. He could almost feel himself falling asleep from the comforting warmth of the bath. Just as he was about to close his eyes and nod off, he heard someone enter the throne room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hero was surprised to feel the mud around him almost drawing the pain from his limbs. It was exceptionally comfortable, though after a few minutes he felt something new. A strange current in the mud, like another pump or mechanism had been activated to turn the collosal mud bath into something like a wave pool. He dismissed it at first, far more interested in getting the relaxation he wanted after having Annie go to town on him. But the movement around him was getting stronger. He wanted to ask the kind servant what was going on, but they'd all left the room. He looked around and noticed that he was completely alone. Did Quaker have something in mind for him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't need to wait for an answer as the doors opened up to reveal the towering pachyderm herself. She mumbled something to the attendant at the door and locked eyes on the soaking superhero. With a big grin she walked up to the edge of the pool before carefully stepping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaah, that's the stuff. It never gets old. Sorry about that, Punchy. Had to take care of some business, make a call, that sort of thing.\" She babbled. The Pint Puncher could tell straight away that she was making a big deal out of nothing to sound interesting, though it did make him wonder what kind of 'business' the elephant woman would be conducting. But as he pondered her words, the current in the pool pushed him from his relaxing perch. He looked over to Quaker, who smirked a little. Well, that's one mystery solved at least. He should've known. What he didn't expect was the next step she'd take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I bet after being humped sore by that sow a little massage wouldn't go amiss, right? Just enjoy the ride, Punchy.\" She mused seductively. The superhero wasn't fully sure what she meant until he felt the mud around him stir. It pushed in on him, grabbing his whole body and squeezing it. But the pressure was light, evenly spread except for a few points. There it gently applied some more force, much akin to a massage. Slowly he noticed himself rising up, a large ball of gloopy mud encasing his body and roiling and rolling around it. Quaker raised her hands up from the mud, revealing her strict control over the situation. As she waved her fingers the hero could swear he felt the mud move and react in the same way. Like she was massaging a tiny version of him in her hand, the mud scaling it up to the hero's whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past this would've been cause for panic. Quaker's rocky hold on him rarely spelled good news. Squeezing and crushing before leaving him vulnerable to brutal finishers, frequently finding himself squashed beneath her feet or ass. But now that same technique was used to give him a relaxing massage. She smiled from ear to ear, seeing the hero's happy face as she calmly worked his body. He murred and moaned quietly, his limbs finally relaxing in her earthen grasp. She giggled, slowly guiding the floating ball of mud and hero closer. He was hovering directly above her now, the elephant giving him a knowing smile. Suddenly she leaned up a little, plunging her trunk into the mud. The hero jerked a little as he felt the rugged hide of her trunk wrapping around his manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I've forgotten about your little man, Punchy.\" She said, sounding a little nasal. But her trunk had more important matters to tend to. It gave his shaft a small squeeze, exciting it and quickly bringing it to full mast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make this mud even richer.\" She cooed, pumping his cock with her trunk. The hero only mustered a chuckle, the stimulation from all around him far too intense to attempt any resistance. His orgasm was lost in the mud ball almost immediately. Briefly he wondered if he was the first to do so. Or did Quaker's private mud bath also carry traces of her own release? As the last drops were milked from him the mud suddenly lost its integrity, splashing down on Quaker's chest and depositing the muddy hero atop her large breasts. She giggled, feeling him squirm. The mud had slickened both their bodies, making the hero slowly slip inbetween her large, pillowy breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, little hero.\" She cooed, patting him on the head. \"I'm sure she'll be here soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you talking about?\" The Pint Puncher replied, struggling to keep his head from vanishing between her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll see. I called in someone special.\" The elephant woman said, giggling at his frustrated expression.</span></div></div>",

Immediately ideas flashed up on the best way to end it. It had to be bold, spectacular. Something people would talk about for years to come. Just stuffing him in her pussy and letting it crush the life out of him seemed almost pedestrian now. Too easy, not enough flair. She could save that salvo of personal pleasure for when she was done. No, this needed something never seen before. Suddenly her eyes shot wide open. Inspiration had found her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, this is going to be great.\" She hoped that even with this evacuation going on someone would be out there recording her from a safe distance. If her experience with news crews was anything to go by, they'd be watching her huge beautiful body with the best cameras they could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny spat the hero's body into her hand. He might've been alive, his super endurance had not stopped the wolfess from chewing him up. He was bent and contorted out of shape, slowly reforming. The villain did not give him the chance to recover as she pinched one of his arms between two thick fingers. It took some fiddling with his puny body in her large hands but eventually the wolfess succeeded in laying him out in her palm. She dragged him along the coarse surface and closed her hand around his legs. The rest of his body was left to dangle from her fist. The hero was not left in suspense for long, both figuratively and literally. She grabbed the upper body with her other hand and began pulling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer incredible strength turned the superhero into a comedy act, stretching him like a rubber band. His suit wasn't built for stress anywhere near this and tore to ribbons all around his increasingly thin body. It took her considerable effort to overpower his endurance, but with a grunt and a growl she pulled him further and further. Her diabolical plan was well on its way. She knew that the strain on his body would eventually prove too much, but the humiliation this position offered her was even greater. She flashed a toothy grin before opening her large maw wide. The hero's head was stuck inside one of her clenched fists, but he could feel the warm breath on his exposed and thinly stretched midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt even more when she wedged him between two teeth. Slowly she dragged him back and forth, rubbing him as deep as she could manage between her teeth. Though the hero couldn't see a thing he knew precisely what she was doing. She was flossing her teeth using his stretched body. He felt everything. The gunk being pried free between her teeth. The rough surface of her tongue getting a taste in once every while. The tight pinch between her pointy molars. Eventually it all began to blur together. Super endurance had its limits and the Pint Puncher was quickly reaching his. When he finally popped unconscious Shenny didn't even realize. Only when she inspected him closer did she see he'd gone from helpless to hopeless. The fun was over, the hero was unconscious. She was nowhere near patient enough to wait for him so she saw only one possible outcome: disposal. She let go of the rubbery body, letting it slap into her hand and lie in a heap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fun while it lasted.\" She said, her tone almost somber. Thinking back through their encounters gave her a wry smile. She'd done many things to him, even before the Blood Moon. But all good things must come to an end. There was no more fun to be had with this one. Maybe the next superhero to try and stop her will put up more of a fight. She spreads her legs and unceremoniously pushes the little body inside. The unconscious hero is sucked inside by her empowered vagina and Shenny sets about finding where everybody went. No doubt they were hiding somewhere. She couldn't wait to show them what became of their hero. Hopefully the footage of his final moments, the hero being used as dental floss, would be as good as she imagined.</span></div></div>",

Acting in anger was her modus operandi, but she had been having so much fun during this \"battle\" rage seemed unnecessary. Instead, she thought rationally and logically about what she wanted to do with the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she knew the Pint Puncher had superior super durability, it was also very clear he was tiring and weak at this point in the fight. She knew how she wanted to finish him, and knew that she wanted him to have at least a little fight left in him when she did it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cruel smile, she tightened her grip and licked her lips. \"You've tried resisting my charms for a long time now Puny, but that ends tonight. On the last night of your life,\" she said hauntingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed the Pint Puncher hard into the open area of concrete near her feet. She wiggled her toes in his face, adding insult to injury, but as much as she wanted to torment the hero, she had other plans for him. Shenny stood above him and moved her feet far apart, revealing her hungry, cavernous pussy high above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't crawl in on your own, but I know what you really want Puny, and I'm going to give it to you. Whether you like it or not,\" the wolfess said with an evil laugh. With that, she activated the powers she received from the Blood Moon once again. This time, the Pint Puncher was too weak to resist the incredibly powerful vacuum that was sourced deep within Shenny's snatch. His eyes opened wide as he saw her hungry crotch growing closer at an astoundingly fast speed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero hit the wolf's pussy and was sucked in immediately. He was significantly smaller and more malleable than a car, so she didn't need to help at all. All the Pint Puncher could offer in resistance was a scream. He begged and pleaded from deep inside Shenny's vagina, but he didn't have a clue if she could hear him. He did know that if she could hear him, she wouldn't offer him any mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fought back for all he was worth and tried to crawl his way back to the entrance. There was still a sliver of light that slipped through into her snatch. That was exactly what Shenny wanted. She fell back and moaned loudly in pleasure as she felt the great hero rub up against places within her body that had never felt physical contact. Most humans were crushed to paste immediately and the cars she had sucked in just didn't offer the same unpredictability. She wished she could make this moment last forever, but she knew that, at some point, his durability would fail him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny seemed set on testing his limits as best she could. She had great control over the muscles within her vagina, and used them to bear down on the hero from every direction. She manipulated his body deeper within her own, easily erasing any progress he had made. All the while, she added enormous pressure from all sides as she rolled and writhed in pleasure through the city. Shenny didn't care about how many buildings she toppled in her exuberance, she was just focused on enjoying the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny's juices had filled her love canal and threatened to drown the Pint Puncher if he wasn't crushed first. His struggles for freedom had shifted to struggles for survival. He knew he couldn't last long here. He was resigned to the idea that he was unlikely to escape the wolf's pussy alive, but he was not one to go down without a fight. He knew his struggles were playing right into what the villain wanted, but he didn't care. The hero summoned every ounce of strength he had and swung at the walls of Shenny's fleshy tunnel with all his might. Each strike sent the wolf howling in pleasure as his world continued to shift along with her rolling body. Finally, his weakened body gave out, and the hero collapsed unconscious. Done in by a wolf's insatiable arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny sighed and panted as she felt the hero's squirming come to an end. She had done it! She had defeated the great Pint Puncher! Now, there was no one and nothing to prevent her from getting exactly what she wanted. In his defeat, he had given him the best ride of her life. Still, Shenny wanted more, and she wanted to make absolutely certain that the hero was done and not simply unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf looked around and saw several abandoned cars nearby. Her eyes fell on one in particular that was, for some reason, not abandoned. This particular SUV carried a group of important looking government officials. Unable to make the bunker, they tried to hide their car in the series of abandoned vehicles on the street. They were thankful they had managed to survive the collapse of the highway, but their joy in survival quickly turned to terror as they realized Shenny's eyes were locked on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go! Go go go!\" one of the men in the car yelled at the driver. He didn't need to be told twice, let alone four times, as the driver quickly turned the key in the ignition and pressed the gas, trying to speed away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenny smiled again at the terror in the eyes of the men in the vehicle. She simply parted her legs and let the vacuum do its work. She focused on the SUV. Despite the power in the vehicle's engine, it could do nothing to resist her powerful pull. Soon, the men found themselves staring through their windshield pressed directly up against the wolf's crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmm,\" Shenny cooed happily as she maneuvered the SUV between her lower lips. Simply knowing the vehicle was occupied made this so much better than sucking up another abandoned car. She imagined the screams of the men inside the car inside her as she started manipulating the large auto deeper within her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men gasped as they saw the Pint Puncher's ravaged body. They were helpless to do anything as their SUV slammed into his unconscious form. Once she had everyone arranged properly, Shenny started applying a crushing pressure. The well structured SUV could do nothing to resist the crushing power of the wolf. The men inside screamed briefly, but were silenced as the car was quickly smashed and smeared into the body of the former hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheeny enjoyed her metallic toy for several more minutes before pushing it back outside. It crashed to the earth, nothing more than a metallic sphere. She picked it up and examined it. The wolfess threw her head back in a hearty laugh when she saw points of the Pint Puncher's white cape sticking out from the wreckage of the black SUV. To make certain that her work was done, she opened her mouth and dropped the remains of the hero and the SUV inside, swallowing it as if it were a small pill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had won, and she had never been happier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheeny's eyes scanned the city. She knew there were more people here somewhere. There was no way they could have evacuated quickly enough. She spotted the bunker that held the civilians. The wolfess reached it in just a few broad steps. She eyed the structure hungrily and licked her lips in anticipation of all the fun she could have with what was hidden behind those metal doors...</span></div></div>",

She stomped down with all the weight and fury she could deliver. Her stone form adding untold amounts of tonnage and causing the big foot to sink into the pavement. The superhero didn't even feel his body compress. It went from normal to perfectly flattened in an instant. His body exploded with pain as it was subjected to more crushing mass than ever before. The earthen Quaker certainly weighed as much as a mountain. Around him he felt the vibrations in the earth. Buildings had collapsed from the quaking force. Just as things looked their worst, the elephant kicked it up a notch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous weight pinning Pint Puncher down slowly ground from side to side. From the elephant's perspective she pushed her foot even deeper into the earth. At no point did she bother to use her powers. Just by sheer weight she twisted and ground her opponent deeper into the rock and stone. He didn't think his body could get any flatter, but she gladly proved him wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finishing blow came soon thereafter when Quaker hopped forward, balancing herself on just one foot. Her full mountainous weight rested atop the hero. His super endurance was pushed to its limits underneath the elephant. It felt like he was about to pop. She wasn't the most stable of villains on just one leg and her wobbling around began to shift the crushing weight on the Pint Puncher around. Before long it reached his head. Finally, only after having an stone elephant press down on his head, his super endurance failed him. He fell unconscious beneath Quaker. She didn't even notice her victim had passed out. He wasn't able to move to begin with, so going limp didn't change anything. It'd take another half and hour before his wracked body would see light again. By then it was buried almost five feet into the earth. A stony trunk coiled around his flattened form and the supervillain quickly passed her judgment. He was so flat he'd be of no use for pleasure. The only recourse was nourishment. She simply flung him into her mouth. A swift gulp sent him down a crushing stone passage into a hollow stone chamber. The walls closed in and long before he would wake his body was made a part of Quaker's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blood Moon passed and the elephant regained her fleshy normal self again. She felt the soft expanse of her butt and her large swaying boobs. They were definitely bigger now, a nice addition made by the superhero. She thanked him before setting off on a crime spree that would inspire horror stories for centuries. Nobody was safe from her sadistic games. The legacy of the Pint Puncher ended as a small contribution to a body that would smother dozens of people every day for Quaker's amusement.</span></div></div>",

Rowland added a few brutal haymakers himself but only managed to strike air. The hero tried to find a way to land his famous punches, but he was completely occupied just avoiding the muscular cougar's wrath. After an intense bit of flailing he came to a halt. The hero was a little worn from all the evasive flying as well. Both stared at eachother with a distant sliver of respect. But the cougar soon adopted a foul smirk as he stood himself straight again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Punchy, you're a slippery little brat. You're really making me work up a sweat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moisture in his fur began to coalesce along his mighty pecs and onto his shoulders. Right next to the existing tendrils two more columns of animated sweat began to protrude. With these new additions to his arsenal the cougar was prepared to lay down a fresh beating, even more ferocious than before. The hero looked on in fear and disgust. The stink of Rowland's sweat was becoming increasingly pervasive. If he let the cougar fight him much longer the sheer number of sweaty tendrils would overwhelm him. The hero grits his teeth and hopes the element of surprise is enough. Without warning he flies directly towards the cougar's face, fist outstretched for a knockout punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the hero's fist collides with the cougar's large nose it does little more than gently boop the moist surface. Rowland's smile grew as he held the hero within several sweaty tendrils at once. All looped around a different part of him and quickly trying to find their way into the tight latex of his suit. The cougar's catlike reflexes were not dulled by his exhaustion and he'd stopped the Pint Puncher before he could suckerpunch him. Immediately a thin tentacle made of dirt and sweat lashed across the hero's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for trying to get sneaky with me! Now for some fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thick column of sweat makes its way towards the hero's head. It's watery surface thoroughly muddied with dirt and grime. The stench was immense, both from his restraints and the cougar's hot breath washing over him. The villain held the hero close as he maneuvered the sweaty tentacle towards the Pint Puncher's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look thirsty...\" Rowland didn't need to say another word. The hero began to panic, but with a large chunk of his body suspended in the animated sweat of the cougar there was little hope of escape. The murky column drew ever closer until it wrapped around the hero's head, encasing it within a globe of foul sweat. He kept his eyes closed, fearful of the stinging liquid outside. Rowland used this moment to reach in and grab the hero by the head. With an uncompromising grip he wrenched the stubborn jaws open, allowing his sweat entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good little hero. Drink up now, it's good for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher could do nothing as he felt the disgusting taste of cougar sweat run along his tongue and down his throat. He was forced to swallow it all lest he'd choke on Rowland's sweat and grime. The supervillain roared with maniacal laughter, celebrating his victory. But did Rowland cheer too soon?</span></div></div>",

The boar seemed determined to push his super endurance to its limits. Every time the villain thinks he cannot do more, he finds another ounce of feral strength to squeeze into the pinned hero. The slimy sweat was a afterthought in all this. Compared to the murderous crushing the hero endured a little stench couldn't add much. But when it began to smear onto the superhero's face and into his nose it revealed the final nail in his coffin. What little putrid air Pint Puncher could get was now cut off. He hacked and coughed in the boar's pulverizing grasp. Shortly thereafter Borris felt the body of his nemesis go limp. Still not satisfied, he kept on crushing with everything he had. Just in case the hero was just playing tricks. Maybe also a little because it felt really good to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held the body of his vanquished opponent in front of him. Part of Borris still couldn't quite believe he might have done it. But the boar's feral mind soon turned to the one thing he wanted to do most of all. He opened his maw wide, copious amounts of drool leaking from all sides. If ever there was a meal he'd anticipated, this was it. The boar threw the hero into his waiting maw and bit down hard. Again the hero's super endurance saved him from serious harm. The growling boar started angrily chewing to no avail. The dull molars crushed and squeezed, but the hero's unconscious body never did more than mould around them like a piece of living bubblegum. As was expected the Hungry Hog quickly grew bored of chewing this heroic piece of gum and slipped him down the back of his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boar's gullet greedily accepted the Pint Puncher's legs, drawing them in effortlessly. No part of the hero gave the boar's hungering body any difficulty sliding down the saliva-coated tunnel. Even the trip down the esophagus seemed to want to crush him, the tight tube pushing the hero to his inevitable end. A big splash accompanied the hero's arrival into the boar's bubbling stomach. The noxious stench inside, amplified by the Blood Moon, kept the hero from ever waking up. The Pint Puncher had been defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>--- EPILOGUE ---</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe townsfolk were huddled together in the bunker. By their thousands they were spread around the enormous underground chamber. Two heavy metal doors were their last line of defense. Beyond that they had only the Pint Puncher to defend them. Some quietly prayed that he would protect them, others simply sat and waited for this horrible event to pass. All looked up when a heavy thud was heard. The heavy door shook a little and a distinct snorting could be heard. Another slam left the door bent out of shape. Panic crept among the people in the bunker as they feared what would come next. A third and final bang threw both doors off their hinges. In the doorway stood Borris, crouched on all fours like a beast. He hungrily looked at all the people now trapped in this one big buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo everyone's surprise the boar then turned around and left. But his parting gift was a thundering fart. It knocked the people closest to the door out and left many others holding their nose in disgust. None dared to look when a loud metallic scraping echoed from outside. The Hungry Hog, in a flash of intelligence, was dragging two military trucks towards the bunker. He backed himself in, his smelly butt forcing the cowering people to hide in the far corners of the cavernous room. With great strength Borris tried to pull the trucks through the doorway, but it was much too small. The metal crumpled and groaned but wouldn't fold completely. The boar snorted and left the trucks there, turning to face the horrified masses. The crushed metal vehicles were wedged stuck and only Borris would be strong enough to push them out again. He had locked them all inside of the bunker. People began to panic. It was time to feast.</span></div></div>",

While she usually moved with a rapid grace, nearly silently, she was having trouble being discrete at her larger size.

She only wished he had flown himself just a bit deeper or that she could find a way to push him all the way in. The feeling she had, with him struggling deep within her cheeks but not yet at the apex of her anus, was amazing as it was. No wonder Quaker was always <i>so</i> happy, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then a concern crossed her mind. While she was able to keep the hero trapped securely for now, it was only a matter of time until his super strength allowed him to break free. But she quickly dismissed the concern as she fumbled upon an idea that would give her the ability to hold onto the Pint Puncher and hopefully force him deeper all in one move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned invisible again, wanting the hero to see exactly what was happening to him. Being able to see more than zebra ass wasn't exactly a huge relief for the Pint Puncher, as he was still being pressed and smothered on all sides by Olivia's massive backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfortable down there hero?\" she mocked, squeezing and slapping her flesh, which sent the Pint Puncher's world shaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly hope so. But sadly, I'm not. It takes a lot of energy to carry around all this sexiness,\" she purred with a laugh. \"I'm feeling a bit tired, but don't worry, I'll make sure you stick around,\" she said continuing to mock the hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, the massive zebra flexed her glutes, ensuring that the Pint Puncher had no opportunity for escape, and kicked her legs out in front of her. Her feet collapsed a building at the end of the street, but Olivia didn't care. She was focused on the sensation within her ass as she fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the Pint Puncher, this was a brand new sensation. Being able to see through Olivia's invisible ass, he saw the street rush up towards him as Olivia dropped down. He tried to brace for impact, but was forced deeper between the zebra's cheeks before reaching the street. His mind was arguing with his body as his vision displayed a view just a few feet above the street but his body felt crushing, smothering pain from the villain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the hero wasn't beneath her ass when she fell, Olivia's landing still had an impact on him. Not only was he forced deeper within her ass, he felt his world collapse further on him. As his mind was coming to terms with reality, Olivia turned visible once again, shutting the hero's world in complete darkness. He realized that even if he was able to pry himself free, the zebra was planted on the concrete, leaving him nowhere to go! He was trapped! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia moans as the panicked hero's squirms within her ass intensify. Her plan worked. While he still wasn't as deep as she would have liked, each of his frantic squirms sent him into further contact with her hungry anus. It was only a matter of time until she could fully close her back door on him. </span></div></div>",

All the same, he felt himself moving. Suddenly, he felt his foot kick free. He was dangling upside down, but if he could maneuver himself just a bit more in that direction....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he realized the enormity of his error. He was moving himself closer to the epicenter of her crack. As he squirmed and wiggled, Olivia was encouraging his movement by shifting and flexing her cheeks, guiding him closer to her anus. She squealed in delight as she felt his leg kick into her rear hole. The Pint Puncher tried to recoil and pull away as he was shocked by the sensation, but Olivia was prepared. Her anus clamped down on the hero's leg and she went to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it Punchy, give yourself to me!\" she moaned through clenched teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to flex and shift her cheeks and at the same time, tightened and loosened her anus as she pulled his body deeper. The strength and body control Olivia displayed was amazing. The Pint Puncher was in a stupor as no matter how hard he fought, it was as if he was fighting in quicksand. The harder he fought, the further in he sunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with a massive clench, Olivia managed to swallow up the hero's head. She had him trapped, completely within her ass! She squealed and bounced with delight as the hero was tossed in every direction within her, sending the zebra feelings of pleasure she had never imagined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved the sensation of his squirming body, but wondered if there was any other way she could torment him. Then she had it. She wanted to break his mind just as she was dominating his body. She managed to avoid her usual verbal taunts and just moaned happily at the feeling of his kicks and squirms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she activated her invisibility. The Pint Puncher's mind went into a frenzy. He was trapped in darkness, but suddenly everything was lit up. He saw the city all around him. Somehow, he was suspended upside down in mid air. He tried to fight to right himself, but found he couldn't move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero knew exactly where he was, but on seeing the cityscape before him, his senses were telling him something different. Just as he was reminding himself of his situation, Olivia returned to her usual visible form and the lights went out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggle to herself as she returned to an invisible state. She felt the Pint Puncher's squirms change in frequency and direction when she \"turned the lights on\" and amplify when she \"turned them off\". It was as if she could power his struggles by remote control!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had one final layer to add to his torment, to complete her dominance over him. She searched the city until she could find a camera she'd be able to operate at her size. She set it up so that she was sure it would broadcast to the citizens of the city, wherever they were hiding. The zebra stuck a sexy pose, jutting her ass out, and turned the camera on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia smiled and slowly moved closer to the camera, making sure that she kept her ass as the focus of the frame. When she was close enough to be satisfied, she turned slightly, displaying her massive ass so that it was all the camera could see. Then she turned invisible, putting the trapped Pint Puncher on display for his city. She laughed loudly at the thought of the scene within their bunker as they saw his panicked expression when the \"lights\" came back on. The zebra slowly walked away, turned visible again, and blew the camera a kiss. Symbolizing what was waiting for the people when they finally left the safety of their bunker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero's mind was broken. He no longer trusted his senses. His eyes kept trying to tell him he was safe while the pain that coursed through his body told him something very, very different. He had long since gone numb to the horrid smell within Olivia's ass. He squirmed and struggled, but it was a directionless panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia toppled a few buildings and laid down to enjoy the final moments of the Pint Puncher. She moaned in pleasure as he fought to stay awake and alive within her ass. Finally, he slipped into unconsciousness. One he would not wake up from. Eventually, Olivia fell asleep as well. When she woke up, the blood moon would be over. She knew she would no longer have Quaker's size. But she slept happily, dreaming of the bunker filled with panicked citizens she'd be able to play with without the Pint Puncher around to get in her way. </span></div></div>",

Her breasts jiggled as she laughed, sending his surroundings into a dizzying display of moving stripes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to reverse course and fly away, to gain some level of separation from the ultra powered villain. But before he could, Olivia acted. She slammed her breasts together, squashing the hero between their soft mass. Her laughter continued as she felt the hero's body collapse between her breasts. She maintained the pressure and forcefully rubbed her large tits together, giving him no time for a reprieve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe packed and maintained so much force in her onslaught, that the Pint Puncher had no opportunity to breathe, much less fight his way out. Finally, Olivia parted her breasts slightly, revealing her foe stuck squashed to the inside of her right boob. Seeing the mighty Pint Puncher's battered body practically hugging her chest made her laugh, sending the hero's world spinning. This time though, he was attached to the jiggling flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia smiled confidently as she looked at the hero and considered what to do next. Should she finish him? Or continue her fun?</span></div></div>",

This Blood Moon phenomenon was beyond a blessing to her and others like her, but she didn't know how long the effects would last. As much as she wanted to continue toying with the hero, she needed to capitalize on her enhanced ability now. She could always find another toy later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zebra looked down at the battered hero, plastered flat against her right tit. She jiggled it up and down and laughed as he was helpless to do anything but move with it. She thought about how she wanted to end his pitiful battle, how she should finally put him out of his misery. The villain shrugged to herself. She was going to end him here and now, but there was no reason she shouldn't enjoy herself in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peeled the Pint Puncher off of her breast and looked around. After carelessly traipsing through town holding the hero in her hand, the zebra finally found what she was looking for, the strongest, sturdiest building in the city. Little did she know that this was also the bunker the citizens of the city had fortified for themselves to get through the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia dropped the Pint Puncher down on the roof of the building and hovered over him with a smile. He had regained his strength a bit, but not enough to escape or mount a counter attack. Before he could come up with a strategy, Olivia lowered her black and white stripped breasts directly over his body. She rubbed her tits back and forth across the roof of the building, smashing and smothering the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, inside the bunker, the civilians of the city heard a loud WHOMPH on the roof of their bunker. They feared they were under attack, but had faith that the Pint Puncher would come to their rescue. They didn't know that the bunker they had constructed had become a key piece of the Pint Puncher's final moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia activated her invisibility and laughed loudly as she was able to see the hero pinned and flattened beneath her mass of flesh. She remained invisible so she could enjoy the sight of his final defeat. She maneuvered her breasts so that she was pinning him with her now erect nipple. The zebra moaned loudly as she felt her foe's body come into contact with one of the more sensitive parts of her body. She roughly ground down on him mercilessly, his cries muffled by her invisible flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Olivia lifted her breasts off of the building and gripped her chest with her hands. She squeezed and groped her breasts, massaging them vigorously. The knowledge that she was ending her greatest rival adding to her pleasure. Finally, she felt a snap and she knew she had broken the hero, once and for all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one to take chances on a flawless victory, Olivia peeled the hero's broken, defeated body off of her nipple and lifted him to her oversized mouth. With a smile, she tossed his lifeless form into her mouth and swallowed him whole. The zebra savored the sensation of the Pint Puncher's body slowly traveling down her throat and landing in her stomach. Her smile grew broader as she rubbed her taught belly. She enjoyed every moment of this battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now her attention shifted to the building she used in the hero's defeat. Nothing should have been able to withstand the pressure she placed on that structure. Unless....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought for a moment and examined it a bit more carefully. She could see that it was erected specifically to withstand the highest amounts of pressure and punishment. She remembered that during her walk through town, she didn't see a single civilian. This must have been their little security blanket!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villain smiled and, remaining invisible, rapped on the door to the structure as lightly as she possibly could at her massive size. Then she waited. She heard a muffled stirring from within the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe citizens inside the bunker didn't know what to think. They all breathed a sigh of relief when they heard the knock at the door. That must have been the Pint Puncher giving them the All Clear! With a cheer, they rushed to open the door to greet their hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door flung open, the citizens of the city were shocked to see....nothing. Nothing but the empty city street. Suddenly, the structure was capsized above them! Olivia, still invisible, took advantage of the open door and used that one weak point as leverage to remove the roof off of the entire building!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she revealed herself. The civilians screamed in terror at the sudden sight of a thick, muscular zebra taller than a house! Olivia smiled as the people ran in all directions. She'd chase down those who escaped later, but there was still quite the crowd surrounding her feet. With a smile, Olivia bent her legs and leapt straight into the air. She stretched her feet out in front of her and allowed herself to come crashing down ass first on the crowd. The screams grew louder as people froze in shock at the sight of her massive black and white rump descending at a rapid speed. The villain smiled as she felt the non-super humans pop beneath her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile grew broader as she shifted her weight over the flattened crowd beneath her. \"Play time is over humans,\" she said hauntingly, \"Well, it is for you at least. It's just starting for me.\"</span></div></div>",

Knowing this couldn't be good, the Pint Puncher flew towards the sound of the noise. Little did he know he was about to encounter ossibly one of the most dangerous foes yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe source was downtown, near a shopping district. Though, the only way the Pint Puncher knew that was through his past visits to that area. Right now, the buildings seemed to be warped into strange shapes, the streets disheveled and upturned, and all of the text on the signs replaced with a tapir standing in different positions. The entire area was surrounded by a purplish hue. Somehow, the Pint Puncher knew who the villain here was. He touched down onto the street, and looked around for any sign of the villain. Though, she'd make herself known soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero felt the ground beneath him rise up and reshape. His legs spread more and more as the ground seemed to open up. It got surrounded in a purple light, forming into a tapir shape, his legs planted on either of her lips. Then, the light dissipated, and the Pint Puncher was looking down at Julia's large mouth. He felt it open up more, and leapt away before she could snap her jaws upon him. He touched down away from the newly formed tapir face, which turned towards him, grinning widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your worst nightmare,\" Julia said, bearing a sadistic grin. \"With that blood moon in position, dream energy began to flow from my mind out into the real world! Now I can mold the world however I want!\" Another head formed on a building behind the first Julia head. \"Make myself as beautiful as I want!\" Another tapir head formed, eating up a vendor of hotdogs as it reshaped. \"And consume anything I want!\" The faces each disappeared, and the main tapir herself, appearing in her dream-like appearance before the Pint Puncher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only problem I have, however, is that I can't directly affect beings holding dream energy themselves,\" Julia remarked. \"I can reform the world, but not the people themselves... at first. If I beat on a foe enough, I can suck the will right out of them and render them my drooling slave! At least, that's my hypothesis for the moment. Ready to be my guinea pig~?\"</span></div></div>",

Something pulled him to the side, then up. He tried to maintain his stance but found himself needing to fly just to be near the ground. Gravity seemed to have vanished and many items in the street started to float. Cars, random pieces of trash and just about anything not bolted down was now floating a little above the ground. A deep rumbling echoed through the city. This part took Julia a bit more effort but one by one the buildings around them began to break free, their foundations crumbling as they hovered in the air. The hero needed to be on guard. Anything was possible now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tapir didn't leave him waiting for long. With a casual gesture several cars and a house rushed towards the hero. He ducked to the side, barely avoiding the impact. The house slammed into another, reducing both to a heap of floating bricks. Julia concentrated on this cloud of masonry and made the bricks swirl in a violent storm. Suddenly a single brick shot like a cannonball towards the hero. He dodged out the way, the brick shattering to dust against the road. Quickly more bricks followed, like a volley of machinegun fire chasing the hero. He flew unpredictably, staying just ahead of the flurry of stone ripping through cars and walls behind him. In a moment of cleverness he flew towards Julia, trying to coax her into hitting herself. She raised a brow but kept up the barrage, unfazed. When the stream of bricks was about to strafe her the solid stone turned to red marshmallows, harmlessly bouncing off her grinning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher hid behind a house, the terrifying barrage of brickwork finally ending. Julia suddenly tapped him on the shoulder, leaning from the window in the house. He shrieked from the sudden surprise, making her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you think you could hide? I see <i>everything</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo illustrate her point, more Julia's showed up in every window of every house around him. Which one of them was the real one? Was any of them the real one? Was any of this real at all? The Pint Puncher was knocked out of his stupor by a random metal bucket slamming into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't break your brain just yet, I'm only warming up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tapir lifted herself into the air, hovering menacingly whilst her purple dream energy glowed brightly in ribbons around her. The houses lifted up with her, filling the sky and leaving the hero little place to regain his bearings. Julia was ready to step up her game. How does she bring the pain?</span></div></div>",

The hero noticed her stretching her limbs at cars, but he also noticed that, instead of hands, the arms bore Felicia heads. Additional Felicia heads. They tore the doors off of cars before retreating back. The heads then molded into her hands. The Pint Puncher realized he couldn't let her keep this up, so he flew down to try and strike her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Felicia heard the hero approaching.

He didn't want to risk letting any of those punks get their hands anywhere near those helpless mortals. He was downtown, when he suddenly felt a strange tug on his suit. He looked at the pulling, and was surprised to see no one pulling him. He kept pulling and pulling, and he managed to fly with enough force to tear that bit of suit off of him that was being held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, why'd you have to fight so hard?\" the Pint Puncher heard. The tone was familiar, so he had an idea as to who was challenging him. Sure enough, Susan sauntered onto the scene, hands on her hips. \"I just wanted to show you my affection, but you had to go and struggle. C'mon, it's not every night we get to hang out under the blood moon.\" She cupped her breasts and squeezed them, showing off their size. \"Doesn't the idea of getting acquainted with this body under the ruby red light of the celestial body interest you?\" As she spoke, she ran her hands from her breasts down past her hips and cupped her buttocks. \"The best part: you won't have to do a thing~ I can just pick you up with my new telekinetic powers and work you however I like~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher realized that this fight would be harder than he thought.</span></div></div>",

Before him was a bunch of off street lights craned around to shine down on a red carpet, which seemed to be decorated with pink feathers. The Pint Puncher then realized who might be behind this. The hero flew towards the site, and landed at the end of the carpet. At that, the lights lit up one by one, starting at the Pint Puncher's end and lighting up too the other end. The lights finally lit up upon a familiar flamingo, except she appeared to be wearing a pink robe. Fiona did indeed set this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, hellooooooo there,\" she said with a flourish. \"How nice of you to meet with me tonight. I was hoping all this setup wouldn't go to waste.\" The Pint Puncher narrowed his eyes at the pink villainess. She was just as tall, if not a little taller, than he remembered. He had no idea what was with the robe though. She sauntered down the carpet, towards the hero. \"It's gettin' pretty dicey out here. You sure you don't wanna hide with the rest of those humans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And miss the chance to beat down punks like you? I can't wait to show you all who's boss,\" the Pint Puncher shot back, only to be greeted by a chuckle from the wicked winged beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Puny Puncher, do recall your dalliances,\" Fiona began. \"How many times have you been at our mercy? At my mercy alone?\" The Pint Puncher simply raised his fists and got ready to strike her. She was a couple of yards away from the hero, and brandished a great big smirk. \"Perhaps you've got it reversed. Maybe it's YOU who needs to be taught who's the boss.\" With that, she clenched, and thrust her wings outwards, letting the robe flap open and revealing her voluptuous form. However, the robe began to shift about unnaturally. It then began to fall apart into flamingos that looked like smaller Fionas, boasting similar voluptuous forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flamingos all flew off of Fiona's body and into the air, and began to convene onto the hero's location. As they drew near, the Pint Puncher realized that they were surrounding him. Worst yet, they were poised to strike him rear first.</span></div></div>",

While they were smaller than the original flamingo, they still towered over his small body. They ranged in size between 6 and 8 feet tall and all owned sculpted bodies of identical proportions to the original Fiona. How the original villain, even at her massive size, managed to carry all of them as if they were a robe twisted the hero's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't have time to dwell on the physics of that feat. The flamingo army was prepared to strike, ass first. One flamingo launched at him in a move similar to a Peach Bomber. The hero's enhanced reaction time allowed him to dodge out of the way. Unfortunately, his peripheral vision was not on par with his reflexes. As he dipped to the side to let the first flamingo fly by, he crashed right into the rump of another one! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis newest flamingo laughed as she felt the hero's head make contact with her soft ass. Before he could push himself away, yet another flamingo crashed into him from the side, sandwiching his head between their soft flesh. They laughed to themselves as they pushed their booties against each other, squashing his head in between. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeeey Punchy!\" the flamingos called and taunted in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a surge of strength, the hero managed to press one hand against each of their plump backsides and shove them away. But before he could refocus and mount a counter attack, a horde of flamingos pounced on him, bring him in butt flesh. One landed squarely on his face, another on his chest, two more on each of his arms and legs. Finally, one last large flamingo landed ass first squarely on his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fight us Punchy, we just want to play!\" the horde of flamingos sang in a chorus. \"You're right where you belong, beneath us!\" they laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona drew closer and towered over the pile of flamingos sitting atop the hero. He would burn with rage if he could see her face, if his eyes were not covered by a pile of flamingo flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relent and enjoy yourself Punchy, like I said, let us teach you your place!\" she laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher seethed in rage, but he felt an excitement well up within him as the horde of flamingos laughed and giggled and shifted their weight over his body. It didn't really hurt, but they certainly had him pinned securely. But the hero's resolve was far from broken. He resisted the pull of excitement he felt and the desire to submit to the seductive flamingos and waited for the right moment. Finally, he caught all of the flamingos just in the right spot at the right moment, with their weight shifted off of his body at once. He surged upward and pushed the horde off of him. His erection slipped deeper into the largest flamingo's backside and his face briefly visited depths of another's crack, but they too were shoved off of him as he shook himself awake and knocked the cobwebs from his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cracked his knuckles and prepared to go after the original Fiona, but this fight was far from over.</span></div></div>",

He could barely remember when villains weren't attacking, so now that there was a break, he decided to lounge about. However, his reprieve would be short lived as he heard a lot of commotion nearby. Deciding that he should check it out, he flew over. As he approached, he began to notice a bunch of cars smashed up. The citizens seemed to run off, thankfully, but the villainesses were still around. The Pint Puncher saw five mares, two looking exceptionally large, and each wearing latex outfits that were identical, except for the colors. From left to right, he saw red, blue, pink, green, and orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew over and slammed down in front of the mares, who looked awfully pleased with themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Who are you guys?\" the Pint Puncher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear that girls? The famous hero doesn't know who we are,\" the mare wearing pink said. \"Why don't you gals introduce yourselves?\" They each nodded, and began to walk forward. \"First up, Brawny!\" she announced. Before the Pint Puncher could react, he was suddenly grappled. The mare with the red spandex had wrapped the hero in a crushing bearhug, and he felt himself compress into her firm body. \"This girl earned extra muscles when she could walk upright. She loves long walks on the beach and crushing any shrimp she comes across!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher tried to push against her, but she was just as strong as, if not stronger than, him. After a bit of squeezing, she lifted the hero overhead before throwing him into the concrete. He was immediately dazed on impact, and Brawny posed before the cheering mares before walking off. The hero was barely getting his bearings back before the mare in blue walked over to him. \"Next up, we have Gummy!\" She gripped his shoulders, and a blue energy glowed around her hands, and it began to spread to the hero. \"This gal earned the power to knead anyone she gets her hand on into a fine, taffy-like being. She loves jogging and tasting gummy humans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the pink-wearing mare was telling the truth. He began to feel funny, a lot squishier. Soon, she stopped glowing, and began to roll up the hero, who was molding into a ball. He got tinier and tinier, until he was the size of a piece of candy. She then worked at the hero suit wrapped around the hero. She peeled it off like it were a candy wrapper, and licked her lips. The hero tried to scream as she placed him in her mouth. She clamped her teeth down on him and began chewing. The hero winced as he felt her molars grind into him and her tongue taste him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of chewing, she spat the hero out. He flew through the air, and felt himself splat against some mare booty. A very smelly mare booty wrapped up in green latex. \"Annnnnnnd now, we got Stinky!\" The Pint Puncher winced at her name. She certainly lived up to it. She pinched the wad of Pint Puncher on her cheek, and peeled him off. She scrubbed him deep into her pits, whiched just made him try to quirm even more. He tried to move, but his gummy state left him immobile. \"Our gal here was given some nasty BO following her power acquisition, and she's been putting her stench to good use. She loves boat cruises and gassing some poor fool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Stinky flashed a wicked grin. She held the flattened form of the Pint Puncher in front of her butt, lifted her tail, and farted on him. He tried to cry out in absolute horror. He smelled a lot of horrid smells, and Stinky's gas was pretty high up there. After that, she rolled the hero up, and flicked him away from her. Gummy then snapped her fingers, and the hero was back to normal, though he was naked. He began to hear some loud stomping. He looked behind him, where the stomping was coming from, and saw the giant, orange clad mare approaching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now presenting, large and in charge, though not really, Squishy!\" The Pint Puncher tried to get up, but he got an unfortunate view of her truck sized rump before she threw out her feet and slammed down onto him. The concrete caved in under her from the sheer force, and the hero felt like he was just struck by a mountain. \"When she got her powers, they came with a miraculous growth spurt. She loves candy and squashing little bugs!\" Squishy shook her ass side to side on top of the Pint Puncher, grinding him into the concrete. With a quick shake, she got off of him, and smacked her rear at him tauntingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grit his teeth and got ready to fly up to face her, but the pink clad mare already wrapped her arms around him. \"And lost, but certainly not least, Lovey~!\" she said as her arms began to glow pink. The Pint Puncher tried to pull himself out of her grip, but he began to feel himself lose the will to fight. It was a familiar feeling, like if he were facing Hank or Muro. Uh oh. \"You may have guessed it already, but I was given the chance to be completely and totally irresistible. I love a nice dinner date, and any human giving up their will to serve me~\" The Pint Puncher tried to squirm out of her grip, but he felt himself losing the will to fight more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we introduced ourselves, is it time to fight? You hardly seem in the mood for it. Riiiiight~?\" At that, the Pint Puncher felt a funny feeling stir between his legs. He suddenly remembered he was naked, and his groin would be completely exposed to her. Not good. She rubbed the hero up and down on her, rubbing his erection against her smooth coat. He let out an involuntary moan, feeling so ashamed for letting her manhandle him like this. However, she let go of him, letting him flop onto the concrete. \"Too easy. C'mon, 'hero,' we need you to fight too if we're gonna enjoy dominating you.\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher was burning with embarrassment. The fight barely began, and he was already naked and erect. He got up to his feet, and saw the mares huddled around each other. They were planning something. Perhaps the opening to their first \"real\" combo. They broke away, and...</span></div></div>",

On seeing the sight of the huge, blue-clad horse barreling towards him, the Pint Puncher's desire to fight returned. Maybe it was Lovey's distance or maybe it was sheer instinct and self defense. Either way, he was glad it did. Everything was back to normal. Well, everything except his still-present erection, nudity, and the 12 foot tall blue clad anthro horse charging toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero took off into the air, focused on creating separation between him and his foe. Unfortunately, he lost sight of the other members of Mare Storm in focusing on Gummy. As he soared higher, he felt a soft force come crashing down into his head. He flew right into the under breast of Squishy! She laughed as she bounced her chest over the hero's smaller body, sending him crashing back to the turf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Pint Puncher recovered from the surprising blow, his eyes opened wide in shock to see Gummy had capitalized on his error, She was seated on his still erect crotch and had her hands firmly planted on his shoulders. A familiar blue energy started to emanate from Gummy's hands and it quickly spread to the hero's downed body. Gummy clenched her cheeks over the Pint Puncher's erection and smiled as she seductively rubbed his chest and shoulders. He tried to push her off, but whatever she was doing to his body sapped him of his super strength. He was pinned good. But that quickly became the least of his concerns as he felt a familiar funny feeling running through his body. Sure enough, he was once again transformed into a squishy, malleable version of himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGummy bounced her ass happily in place over the Puncher's crotch, flattening it immediately. But the group had other plans for him. The blue clad villain blew him a kiss and shook her ass as she walked over the hero's helpless body. He looked around desperately, unsure of what they were planning and terrified of what was in store for him. He wouldn't have to guess long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn overwhelming shadow hung over him.

Pint Puncher tried to crawl away, to make some attempt at escape, but Gummy's parting bounce had plastered his hips and waist to the turf. He couldn't get away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquishy smiled as she towered over the hero. She turned, displaying her round, spandex covered ass to him. She smacked it and let it jiggle and bounce in the air, knowing he was helpless to do anything but watch. Squishy bent her knees in a deep squat, letting her ass hover just a few feet over the small, helpless hero. But suddenly she stood back up and stepped away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a pathetic, helpless little hero, but I haven't heard you scream or beg once yet,\" she said mockingly. \"I think that means I need to take this up a level. I'm going to love this, just let me know if it becomes too much for you dear. But you'll have to be loud, voices tend to get muffled down there,\" she said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown...where, the Pint Puncher wondered to himself. As if she was answering for him, Squishy grabbed the hero in a secure fist and brought him around to her lower back. She pulled the orange spandex away from her waist, displaying her enormous, fur covered ass to the hero. He swallowed hard at the sight, but was unable to verbalize his terror. Not hearing the begging and pleading she was hoping for, Squishy plunged her hand down to her ass and pulled it out empty. The once mighty Pint Puncher was now just an outline showing on her ass through her orange spandex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was ready. She caressed and rubbed her large cheek and leapt into the air with all the force she could muster. She landed with an earth shaking SLAM! The Pint Puncher was still very much feeling the effects of Gummy was plastered as flat as a sheet of paper to her round backside. Squishy laughed and smiled as she \"rode\" the hero, bouncing and grinding in her seat happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must be enjoying this girls, I can't hear him begging or complaining at all, can you?\" Squishy said with a laugh. </span></div></div>",

At least, normally she wore green spandex. Currently her trademark color covered just her upper body, as her spandex pants had been ditched somewhere along the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquishy laughed loudly, having an idea of what her friend had planned. She shifted her weight over the hero a final time and slowly stood to her feet. She fished the Pint Puncher's flat form from it's position plastered to her ass and tossed him to Stinky. The 12 foot tall mare, who lived up to her name, caught the battered hero in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he made contact with her, the Puncher's flat face winced. He couldn't get much air in through his flattened nostrils and squished lungs, but even in his condition Stinky's horrible BO registered. She didn't waste any time making it worse. Taking advantage of his still gummy, stretchy body, Stinky tied the hero's left hand to his left foot and his right hand to his right foot, making a pair of loops. The Pint Puncher knew what was coming, but without his super strength, had no ability to resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky smiled as she let the hero fall to the floor. She lightly placed her feet in booth loops she had created and bent over, grasping the Puncher's body firmly and pulling upward. Slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero was positioned so that his head was moving directly toward the villain's ass crack, the epicenter of her stench! He could do nothing but watch as Stinky slowly, sadistically pulled his body toward her crack. He was no longer paper thin flat, but was doing everything in his power to keep his mouth and nose shut tight. He wanted as little of that smell as possible! Even with his mouth clenched shut and minimizing his breathing, the Pint Puncher felt his mind starting to get cloudy and hazy due to Stinky's stench, and he hadn't even made contact yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No complaints hero? Ok then, up we go!\" Stinky said cheerfully, ending the slow journey with a quick, forceful yank. She pulled him much deeper between her cheeks than necessary, but it felt good. She enjoyed the sensation of wearing the helpless hero and holding him in the smelliest part of her body, heaping humiliation onto physical pain. But she wasn't done yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Squishy said, let's take it up a notch hero,\" Stinky sang. She bent her knees slightly before blasting a rancid fart over the hero's body at point blank range. There was nothing the Puncher could do but take it and absorb it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, I think we've found a new calling for you Puny, since you've clearly failed at this hero thing,\" Stinky mocked, \"But with that failure comes inspiration. You are the best thong and fart absorber I've ever worn! I can hardly smell a thing!\" she sang. The mare clenched her cheeks over the hero, trapping the odor in with him as she blasted him several more times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she hit him with a fart so powerful, he was blasted straight out of her ass. Unfortunately for the Pint Puncher, the knots in his limbs were still tied securely. He shot away from her crack only to be pulled back like a rubber band! He snapped back into place between Stinky's cheeks, causing her to yelp in pain. </span></div></div>",

She deftly undid her knots and tossed the recovering hero to her larger friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gummy? Ya mind?\" Brawny requested. While she enjoyed watching her friend's take advantage of toying with humans who were afflicted by Gummy, she herself liked knowing that all the crushing was because of what she was doing, not because of anyone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-clad horse smiled and snapped her fingers. With that, the Pint Puncher had recovered fully. Well, he still felt all the effects of his torture and smelled like Stinky's ass, but he was fully 3-dimensional once again. Surging with a rediscovered pulse of super-strength, the hero leapt into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is to say, he tried to escape, realizing that at this point, he was overmatched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrawny smiled. She grabbed the hero's leg as he tried to fly away and slammed him into the ground. He was dazed, and Brawny wasted no time. In one step, she positioned herself directly above the hero and lifted her foot high in the air. It was all the Pint Puncher could do to cover up before her foot was brought down over him rapidly in a loud, painful STOMP. She was unrelenting, as she brought her large foot down over the battered hero again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMP!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this pattern quickly grew boring for Brawny. She expected more of a challenge from a hero with super strength. She lifted him up by his head and smiled. The red-clad mare licked her lips in anticipation of how much she could dominate a human who didn't even reach her knee, even if he had super powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrawny squeezed his head in a vice grip, enjoying the pained look on the Puncher's face. He helplessly kicked at the air and fruitlessly attempted to pry her fingers off his head, but the pressure was relentless. Just before he blacked out, Brawny slammed him to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hero rolled over onto his back, he saw Brawny at her full 20 foot height, caressing her chest, giving a very clear signal of what she was about to do. That was about enough for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Wait! Please....no more! I submit, I'm begging you!\" They had finally broken him. But sadly, his words didn't reach Brawny until it was too late. She had already leapt into the air and was cascading into a full body press onto his battered form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo!\" the hero screamed, until he was silenced by an earth shaking BOOM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrawny had landed chest first onto the hero, burying him under her massive left tit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, did I hear him give up?\" she giggled, finally rolling off of the hero, revealing his barely conscious body in a deep crater. </span></div></div>",

She carried him in her arms and stroked his hair from his face, all the while her eyes darting up and down his battered body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there, your'e starting to feel better now, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, the Pint Puncher felt the pain drain from his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, so much better,\" he muttered in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not so bad, right hero?\" Lovey said, emphasizing her will over the hero's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not....not so bad,\" the Puncher responded mindlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep within his mind he felt the urge to struggle, to argue, to do anything but what Lovey was suggesting. Maybe it was the beating he had taken at the hands of her friends, maybe it was the submission he had already shouted to Brawny, or maybe it was Lovey's hypnotic influence, but he just didn't feel like fighting. He felt at peace here, in the horse's arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can have so much more fun together when we're not fighting. Wanna see?\" Lovey asked, pulling the hero toward her massive chest. The Pint Puncher nodded, his mouth dropping slightly open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, just stand still here. No matter what, don't move. And stand strong,\" the mare explained, placing the Pint Puncher on his feet and standing beside him. The other members of Mare Storm snickered and tried to hide their laughter at what they knew was about to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLovey quickly exited her pink pants and stepped over the hero, standing so that she had one leg on either side of his body. She bent at the knees slightly, placing her hands on his shoulders so that her hypnotic suggestion would still be effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, when I count to three, I want you to fly straight up with as much effort and energy as you can, Ok hero?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" the Puncher responded without moving a muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lovey returned to standing straight up. She took a moment to ensure her aim was true and that the hero was standing directly beneath her crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1......2......3!\" she counted calmly, adding extra emphasis to the final number. In unison, Lovey dropped her hips and the Pint Puncher took off like a rocket, his head colliding with her large pussy. He wasn't a perfect fit, but due to the impact on both sides, he sank in past his shoulders!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!!!\" Lovey screamed in ecstacy. The impact woke the hero up from his hypnotic trance, but it was too late. Her grip on him was too tight and the quarters too cramped for him to fly out. Lovey slammed her thighs shut, sending him slightly deeper. The hero tried to kick and fight his way out, but each movement just sent Lovey further and further into depths of passion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Kick...squirm! Fight!\" Lovey ordered. Whether it was by hypnotic command or survival instinct, the hero obeyed, but it served no purpose except Lovey's. Finally, the villain orgasmed and released a panting, battered, beaten, and exhausted Pint Puncher. But before he can get away, he feels Lovey's hand on his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay,\" she commands. He has no fight left in him. He obeys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle is won, for now. Mare Storm has conquered the Pint Puncher. But their joy really comes after submission. </span></div></div>",

I think he's learned his lesson\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Squishy rolled her eyes, though she kept her complaints to herself as she reached back and dug in between her enormous buttcheeks. It took a moment for her to find Puncher as she made an effort to push him in as deep as possible. Eventually her hand brushed across a very light protrusion in her skin, which she concluded to be his flattened body. She grinned as she peeled him from out his fleshy prison and tossing him onto the ground with a wet splat. Lovey waited for Pint Puncher's body to return to a more solid state before she leaned down to meet him eye to eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright love. What do we say?\" she asked in a sweet, yet condescending tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher didn't hesitate for a moment before he turned to Squishy and sat up onto his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for trying to escape again...\" He said as sincerely he could manage. Lovey smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now kiss and make up~\" she cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher swallowed nervously. He was no stranger to this process. As Squishy pulled down her tight body suit, he knew exactly was was expected of him. She presented her massive, sweaty ass to him and we went to work lavishing it with kisses. It was absolutely degrading, but he had little opinion but to obey. After a minute of kissing Squishy's ass, she pulled her pants back up and turned to him with a smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted! Although I expect you to try and make it up to me over the weekend~\" she said patting him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I almost forgot that tomorrow was your day! Me and Gummy were planning on taking turns with him later on if you wanna have some fun\" Lovey offered before scooping up Pint Puncher into her arms. In the time spent in their company, Puncher could never get used to someone like her. She regarded him with such loving tenderness, yet she reveled in any opportunity to torment him along with her comrades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'll wait my turn. Me and Stinky are gonna go out for a bite to eat anyway\" she said before giving her large rear a slap. \"If I wanna stay nice and plump, I gotta get a good meal in!\" she snickered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear ya. If you guys need me, I'll be in my room~\" she giggled as she gave Puncher a light squeeze, pressing his face into her massive breasts. With their business done, she skipped down the polished halls and up the broken escalator that lead to her \"room\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After Pint Puncher's crushing defeat, Mare Storm were quick to establish their rule over the city. They weren't all that concerned with actually subjugating people, regulating their actions to bullying random people at their leisure. They had chosen a mall to be their base of operations after clearing out any unwanted guests. The only people allowed to stay were the employees, as none of the mares wanted the responsibility of keeping things in order. They were left alone for the most part, save for one unfortunate janitor who had attempted to help Pint Puncher escape when the broken hero managed to sneak away from his captors one night. To make an example out of him, Gummy used her powers to mold him to a thong and handed him over to Stinky who made a note to walk around the mall with her outfit off and her new undergarments on display for all to see. After that, the staff were quick to report Pint Puncher whenever he looked like he was trying to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Humming softly to herself, Lovey opened the doors to the bedroom department, the area in which she chose to be her room. The staff had been kind enough to make a custom bed to accommodate her much larger body. Unlike her associates, she didn't need to threaten people in order to get them to serve her. She hardly even needed to use her hypnotic powers. Her affectionate tone and sweet demeanor painted her as the most benevolent one among her group. After ducking down to avoid hitting her head on the entry way, she walked into the room and flopped down on the bed, Pint Puncher still wrapped in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gave us quite the scare, love. For a second, I thought you finally managed to get loose! It's a good thing Brawny has strong legs, huh?\" she giggled as she gently caressed his beaten body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher hadn't planned on escaping, not at first. After two weeks of trying and failing to escape, he decided to bide his time and wait for the most opportune time to break away. Any time he tried to escape, they would dogpile on him immediately. It didn't help that two of them possessed powers that enabled them to incapacitate him entirely. If Gummy wasn't peeling his flattened body off of her ass, Lovey would be there to seduce him back to the mall. Ironically enough, his latest escape attempt actually involved him taking advantage of his elasticized body. When he was certain they weren't looking, he grabbed a door frame with both hands and pulled back as far as he could before letting go and launching himself high into the air where he collided and managed to break through the skylight. For a fleeting moment he tasted freedom before he heard a crash from down below. Using her powerful legs, Brawny had leap up with frightening speed and managed to catch Puncher in mid air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I'm really sorry... I'm... just not used to being inside all day...\" Puncher muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know it stinks being cooped up in this place all the time, but it's for your own good. There are a whole bunch of nasty brutes out there that wanna hurt you! I could never let them hurt my special little guy~\" she murmured as she continued to massage his tired body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher closed his eyes and sighed. As much as he hated his current predicament, he couldn't deny how much he genuinely enjoyed his alone time with Lovey. She was just as evil as the rest of them, but her soothing touch and kind words were a nice break from the cruel games that he normally faced throughout the day. Still, he wanted nothing more than to be free from Mare Storm, and to accomplish that goal he needed be in control of his mental faculties . The better he behaved, the less like Lovey was to hypnotize him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. Can we go outside together if I'm really good?\" Puncher asked peering up at her. The lower half of her face was obscured by her massive boobs, but he could feel her smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see, love. Let's get our mind off of that for now, why don't we? This is our alone time... just you and me. Stinky and Squishy went to that Italian restaurant on the first floor and Gummy went to hang out in the sports section with Brawny, so we aren't gonna be bothered for awhile~\" she giggled before pulling him up to her face, her eyes managing to mesmerize him without the use of her powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make the most of our time together...\" she said softly before closing her eyes and pursing her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Puncher felt a lump in his throat as he stared down at her, his eyes wide and his face reddened. This was something that he hadn't come to expect with Lovey, as she seemed more keen on using his smaller body as toy and nothing else. While he had known her to be flirtatious, she had never expressed a genuine desire for intimacy. He found himself completely flustered and unsure what to do as she patiently waited for him to act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I have to do it...  I gotta play along or else I'll never be free...' Puncher thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It shoud've been easy for him. He had done well in playing along up until then, so it really shouldn't have been to hard for him to take that small extra step. Still, something held him back. A nervousness that was quite unlike the kind he had been feeling since his capture; a nervousness bred from bashfulness rather than fear. He didn't know what to make of it at first, but then he was hit with a horrifying notion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'D-do I... do I actually... love her...?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n No. That couldn't have been the case. The more likely solution was that he was suffering from some form of Stockholm Syndrome, no doubt brought on by her affectionate treatment in contrast to the rest of the group. He knew full well that her loving demeanor masked her villainous nature, and that her kindness was done for the sake of conditioning him in such a way that he'd become attached to her. He was just a plaything to her, just like the rest of her crew. She didn't care about him in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, Pint Puncher still bring himself to truly care. Any attempts to rationalize his desires were undercut by his trained longing for her. He wanted nothing more than to lean in and kiss her deeply, to give himself to these newfound feelings, regardless of how they were formed in the first place. Yet he knew that the moment he gave in, he would be granting her a power over him more effective than any trance. He would willingly submit to her whims and thus, forsake his duties as a superhero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n His heart was pounding in his ears and sweat began to form upon his brow. Would be be able to resist his newfound urges?</span></div></div>",

Any remaining reluctance he had melted away the moment their lips made contact, his eyes glazing over and his muscles becoming lax as he allowed the towering equine wrap her arms around him in a tight embrace. He could feel her lips curling into a smirk as she no doubt felt pride in getting him to submit. Puncher knew very well that she didn't really have any love for him, but at that point he didn't care. After a month of torment and isolation, he was starved for affection and positive reinforcement, two things that Lovey provided in spades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... it's about time you came around...\" Lovey murmured as she pulled apart to let him catch his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher said nothing, though the lovesick expression on his face told Lovey everything she needed to know. She had finally laid claim to his heart and mind. Now all that was left for her to take was his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Undress me\" she ordered as she leaned back and placed her hands above her head. In his eagerness, Pint Puncher forwent the delicate approach and  instead opted to use his super strength to rip the tight spandex suit off in a single tug, the sudden jerking motion causing her massive breasts to jiggle and sway as they were exposed. Normally, the destruction of her favorite outfit would warrant a hefty punishment, but she decided to let it slide. Besides, she could always simply order one of the mall staff to make her a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She allowed the former hero to drink in the sight of her nude body, his eyes lingering on her wide hips and heaving bosom as he sat on his knees with his trembling hands resting on his lap. It took Lovey a moment to realize what he was doing and once it hit her she couldn't help but laugh. She had underestimated the effectiveness of her coddling and never noticed how well trained he had become. The villainess licked her lips as she began to fondle her breast, her other hand slowly snaking downward, delicately tracing  an invisible line from her sculpted abdomen to her drooling sex. Pint Puncher watched on, completely enraptured as she toyed with her large,glistening pussy, her eyes locked on his relatively diminutive form the entire time. It didn\u2019t take long for the tantalizing display to do it's trick as the hero\u2019s manhood stood at full salute, aching with barely contained lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, love. Don\u2019t keep me waiting~\u201d she said in a low sultry moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher didn\u2019t need any more prompting as he inched himself closer to Lovey\u2019s opened legs, his gaze fixated on her inviting entrance. He was no stranger to the sight, having flown face first into it in his first encounter with Mare Storm. Still, he felt a tinge of self-doubt as to whether or not he could sufficiently satisfy the statuesque beauty that laid before him. Sensing his uncertainty, Lovey decided to take the reigns as she grabbed his shoulders and swiftly shifted positions which him laying flat on the bed while she hovered over him, her warm, womanly juices raining down onto his throbbing member. Not wanting to waste any more time, she brought her expansive hips down onto his, a delighted gasp escaping her lips as his length was completely swallowed by her cavernous pussy with a wet slap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n In terms of size, the hero was nothing to write home about, although that could be more easily attributed to the extreme size discrepancy between them. That didn\u2019t stop Lovey from moaning lustfully as she bounced up and down on his sensitive length, her hands pinned on either side of his head as she rode him. Pint Puncher in the meanwhile, was riding a wave of pain and pleasure simultaneously. As wonderful as her inner walls felt around his cock, his mind reeled in pain from the pounding his pelvis was receiving as her hips crashed down onto his in an aggressive manner. It wasn\u2019t all bad though, as the constant bouncing caused her ample bosom to jiggle and sway inches from his face in an hypnotic display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It wasn\u2019t long before Lovey was on the verge of her climax, her eyes screwing shut as she reached down and grabbed Puncher by the back of his head and pressed his face up into her right boob, forcing her hardened nipple into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuck!\u201d she barked as she continued to ride his length. He was more than happy to oblige her as he grabbed onto both breasts with eager hands and went to work suckling on her swollen teets. His hands squeezed and kneaded the soft, yielding flesh eliciting pleasured winny from his equine lover who in turn hastened the pace. Where it not for his super endurance, Pint Puncher was certain that his pelvis would\u2019ve been crushed into powder by then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bouncing came to an abrupt halt as she slammed her hips down one more time, her snatch completely encasing his manhood. She yanked him away from her breasted by his hair before forcefully tilting his head back so their gazes met. Lovey\u2019s face was flushed with arousal, sweat pouring from her brow as she leered at down at him with hungry eyes. She savoured the control she exhibited over him. Many villains before her had manage get the upper hand on Pint Puncher, but none of them could lay claim to his affections like she did. The once proud hero laid beneath her, panting and soaked in their combined sweat, his face contorted in pure bliss as his eyes shined bright with an intense, unyielding love for his equine mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 come on, love\u2026 let\u2019s finished this together\u2026\u201d she whispered she age forcefully pressed down onto his groin, pushing him in as far as she could. Puncher could only respond with a shuddering cry, his eyes rolling back  in his head as he finally hit his peak. His orgasm paled in comparison to Loveys as her feminine juices thoroughly covered both his pelvis and the bedsheet beneath him. With that done, she unceremoniously stood up from the bed, his stiff manhood slipping out with ease. While she allowed him to bask in the afterglow, she shift through get belongings in search of an item she had been saving for such an occasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It took her some time to find it in her scattered surroundings, but she was in no real hurry. Even if apint Puncher had the energy to leave, she was confident that his desire to escape had been effectly quashed. Her hunch was confirmed when she glanced over her shoulder to find him laying on his side with his eyes fixated on her naked bum. No longer was ashamed to be caught admiring her body, as he had thrown away any sense of modesty he had left. Lovey giggled and swayed her hips back and forth, watching with glee as Puncher's eyes followed it's movements like a hypnotist's pendulum. She walked back over to him with her hands behind her back, her hands clutched tightly on the object she had been searching for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a surprise for you~\" she cooed with barely contained giddiness. Before he could even guess what it was, she thrusted her arms out and held the gift inches from his face. Even in his love dazed state of mind, Pint Puncher was taken aback by what she had gotten him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was a light pink leather collar with his superhero name neatly embroidered on the front in cursive. If the emasculating color wasn't bad enough, a silver bell dangled from the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took me <b><i>forever</i></b> to make this, but it was totally worth it! Try it on! Let's see if it fits!\" she said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n For a moment, Pint Puncher's previous displeasure began to show as he frowned at the sight of the collar. Lovey was quick to pick up on his negative reaction and pulled her gift back with a wide-eyed, innocent expression. \"Do you... not like it...?\" she murmured as she pouted in an exaggerated manner, her eyes beginning to tear up. Her act worked perfectly as Puncher\u2019s displeasure was replaced by overwhelming guilt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I didn\u2019t say that--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working my fingers to the bone for weeks to make the perfect gift for my favorite little buddy and he hates it! I\u2019m such a failure!\u201d she wailed as she dropped the collar and buried her face into her hands. It was a struggle for her to keep herself from laughing at her own acting, but it did it\u2019s job as Puncher quickly picked the collar off of the ground and placed it around his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t cry! I love it, see?\u201d he said with a nervous chuckle and jingled the bell to get her attention. Lovey stopped and peaked through her fingers to look at him. Puncher sighed in relief but was soon lifted off his feet as she brought him in for a bone crushing hug, his head getting buried within her cleavage as she shook him about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, you\u2019re such a sweet little thing! I don\u2019t know how I went through life without you~\u201d she said before releasing him from her iron grip and letting his body fall back onto the bed. While he still wasn\u2019t all that keen on the idea of wearing a collar like a pet, her happiness was more than enough incentive for him to stomach the indignity of it all. He knew well that his life would be spent at the mall, his acting role amounting to little more than Mare Storm\u2019s plaything, but he found his lack of personal freedoms to be a decent trade-off to spending time with Lovey. His past heroics seemed trifle and unimportant now that he had someone like Lovey taking care of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He didn\u2019t so much as blink as Lovey a leash on his collar and ushered him out of her room. He cared little for the stunned and horrified looks he got from the mall staff as they watched their greatest hero walk alongside his loving new owner. After all, the only person who\u2019s opinion mattered to him was Lovey\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go pay the girls a visit, okay love? I can\u2019t wait to show them how handsome you look in your collar!\u201d Lovey squealed in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPint Puncher said nothing, but the proud smile on his said all that needed to be said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No longer did he have to worry about safety of the city, nor did he have to worry about its citizens. As Lovey explained, the only people he ever needed to worry about were the ones that worked in the mall. Food and shelter were no longer a concern for him and he didn't have to concern himself with clothing, as the only thing he ever wore was his collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It took a while for him to get accustomed to his new role but his kind and patient owners were more than happy to ease him into it. Over time he learned the ins and outs of servitude and how best to go about worshiping their lovely bodies. Each member was unique and had different needs that needed to be met at all times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Brawny had him by her side while she worked out in the sports and fitness department. He would lend aid by acting as her spotter and would slavishly clean the sweat off of her muscular form with his tongue once she had finished. When she was feeling particularly playful, she would forgo her daily workout to put him through a rigorous training session, sitting on his back and offering phony words of encouragement as he struggled to do a hundred push-ups. A successful workout would result him being stuffed between her gigantic tits, his tired body getting a thorough rubdown as she carefully kneaded them together with uncharacteristic tenderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Squishy wasn't all that interested in playing with the former hero, preferring to keep him sandwiched between her mountainous cheeks at all times. An ass as grand as her demanded constant praise and attention, which he would provide in spades as he kissed and massaged every inch of flesh he could reach. The only difficulty he had was in staying conscious in such a hot and stuffy environment and there were days where she would forget all about him and he'd pass out from the heat only to be found when the titanic mare had to use the restroom. Upon discovering his unconscious body, she would slam her fat ass down onto him as punishment for his \"laziness\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With Gummy, he didn't' really have to do much other than lie still and keep quiet. With her powers his compliance wasn't even a factor, as she could easily gummify his body in order to get him to do what she wanted. That said, she gave him plenty of incentive to comply, as she would reward his obedience by keeping his dick intact when she transformed him into a pair of panties. It didn't seem like much of a reward at first, but Pint Puncher couldn't even begin to describe how heavenly it felt to have his length wedged between her meaty cheeks, each of her steps causing his length to rub up against the sweat-lick walls of flesh that encased it. Many a time would he be brought to an intense, screaming climax only to have it go completely ignored as his voice was muffled by several hundred pounds of mare ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was only one member of the villainous team of mares that gave him trouble and that was Stinky. Pint Puncher tried with all his might to get used to her horrid stenches to no avail. Whenever she would order him to breathe in her noxious fumes, he would immediately and without hesitation bury his nose into her spandex-clad rear and inhale as though his life depended on it. There was only so much he could bare however, and it didn't take long for him to crumble onto the floor, his eyes watering and his lungs crying out for clean air. She would chastise him for be unable to stomach her gas, although it was clear that part of the fun for her was watching the once proud protector of Glam City voluntarily putting himself through hell in a vain attempt to please her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Lovey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Of all the members of Mare Storm, she was hands down the least demanding... at least that's how he saw it. Despite having been made to engage in all sorts of degrading and demeaning acts at her behest, he couldn't see her as anything other than selfless and kind. The manipulative mare was mindful to phrase her commands as though they were mere requests, using Pint Puncher's blind adoration to her advantage. On the rare occasion where it seemed as though he would reject her request, she would put on a hurt face, weeping and verbally denigrating herself until he was racked with guilt and compelled follow through with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ass kissing, foot massages, back rubs, and tongue baths; those were the most mundane acts of servitude expected of the former hero whenever he in Lovey's company. The real challenges came whenever she was feeling bored. She'd dress him up in emasculating clothes, parade him around the mall like a dog on a leash, have him service her privates in front of a crowd of onlookers, use his face as a seat while she conversed with the staff, and much <i>much </i>more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n One thing she absolutely <i><b>loved</b> </i>to do was to tease him right up until the point where he was about to cum and have him tread through the mall on his hands and knees, his dick painfully erect and leaking precum everywhere. She would walk right in front of him completely nude with his leash in hand, her perfect ass swaying with each step and her tail fanning her pussy's intoxicating aroma into his nose. If they could circle around the mall twice without him touching his cock even once, she would reward his self-control by taking him back into her room and riding him into the ground until he was screaming her name in ecstasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher was granted very little time to rest living under the roof of Mare Storm. If he was wasn't being used as the team's plaything, he was being fucked absolutely senseless by one of its members. By years end the man who once stood as the city's greatest hero was reduced to a subservient pet. Eventually the mall's resources were depleted and the group was forced to branch out into the rest of the city, although conquering it was barely even a hassle for them. The rest of the city's villains were quick to part ways from their former stomping grounds, as the team's dominating victory against the Pint Puncher was enough to discourage others from contesting their authority. Of course that meant the rest of the world would have to deal with a cavalcade of villainous superpowered anthros running rough shot, but that wasn't <i>their</i> problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Glam City's champion spent the rest of life beside Lovey, acting as her loyal and brainwashed pet. The tales of his heroism were lost to history, all of his achievements and victories rendered moot. All of that meant nothing to him, not anymore at least. All he could think about was how lucky he was to be under the care of such gorgeous, powerful women. And as he laid in the arms of Lovey, his head resting between her soft, pillow-like chest, the memories of his past as Pint Puncher slowly faded into nothingness...</span></div></div>",

He was well out of reach of most of them, but Squishy's large size created an obstacle he couldn't avoid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast there little guy!\" the orange clad mare shouted as she easily stretched out her hand and caught him in mid-flight. Squishy was angry, not only did his escape cost her of treasured play time, but he had burst a hole in her favorite orange spandex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that!\" she yelled, squeezing the Pint Puncher in her fist as she held him close to the hole he created. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his super strength, the hero was unable to pry Squishy's fingers apart enough to make an escape. He was forced to look at Squishy's massive ass, her flesh escaping from the hole that made his escape possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made a huge hole in my perfect costume you brat!\" she seethed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched the hero struggle in her grip, her angry eyes changed.  This was an opportunity. An excuse. A reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This costume is useless,\" she said in now fake outrage. The Pint Puncher was unable to keep track of where the enormous horse was carrying him as her hand flew rapidly. Soon, he was presented with her ass again, now completely bare. She had peeled off the tight spandex bottoms and now stood fully nude from the waist down. Her ass flesh rippled with every slight move she made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to help me replace it!\" She said, tightening her grip on the hero. \"No...more accurately...you're going to <i>be</i> my replacement!\" she said, her tone turning to joy and excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gummy? Do you mind?\" She asked her friend, kneeling before the blue clad horse. Gummy smiled and a familiar blue aura surrounded the Pint Puncher's body and he felt a disconcerting weakness overcome him as his muscles were sapped of their strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you my dear,\" Squishy said to her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hungry eyes turned to the weak hero. She had to take action before he did whatever it was that undid Gummy's ability previously. She stretched and pulled the hero's now putty-like body in several directions, putting extra emphasis on his arms and legs. Her tongue stuck out of her mouth slightly as she concentrated on her work, anxious to put her plan of torment into action. Tying several knots in very key places, she held up the hero's now unrecognizable body and smiled broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" she said happily as her eyes fell upon a very thin, very stretched out, white thong. \"Well, almost perfect. We'll have to see what we can do about adding some proper orange to your costume,\" she said with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends cheered her on as she slipped the hero's body up over her thick legs and strong thighs. She struggled a bit getting him up and over her hips, but his stretchy body accommodated her form without much difficulty. Her smile somehow grew larger as she felt the hero's body slip between her powerful cheeks. She flexed her cheeks and let out a sound that was a mix of a sigh and a moan as she felt the Pint Puncher's thin, stretched body manipulated by a simple movement of her ass. True power. She had him, and they both knew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't wriggle his way free. If he undid Gummy's manipulation, who knew where he'd end up. His reformed body could get shot straight up her bare crotch or worse, straight down her anus. The hero shivered with the thought that this could be his final defeat, and that it would come as a thong with the majority of his body buried between a massive mare's bare ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it?</span></div></div>",

The Pint Puncher's erection was caught between her tits, and her rump was hanging just inches above his chin, though she could slam it down on him if she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I could just give you a happy little reward for saving my friend!\" she cooed, gently squeezing her breasts for emphasis. \"But, I'll have to see how good a guy you really are. Won't you kiss a cheek?\" At that, she shook her butt lightly, indicating which \"cheek\" she meant. If the Pint Puncher refused, he'd likey be stanked. If he accepted, that horse may toy with his erection. What could he do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Perhaps that was because her strikes were so calculated. Most often, her mission simply seemed to be kidnapping some unlucky civilian; she\u2019d suddenly swing in from the darkness, grab them, and whisk them away, never to be seen again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Pint Puncher always rushed to try and intercept her, she was usually long gone by the time he made it to the scene. While these instances were tragic, the arctic fox was usually pretty low on the Puncher\u2019s list of priorities, as she only appeared once in a blue moon, and wasn\u2019t nearly as destructive as many other threats. Unfortunately, she seemed to be becoming more and more active recently, and it the Puncher couldn\u2019t afford to ignore her any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the villains, the Kunoichi\u2019s case file is the one of the closest to empty. Most of the other villains he faces only terrorize the city for fun, and pretty much have no idea what they\u2019re doing; they\u2019re dangerous, yes, but not particularly smart or subtle. This vixen seems to have a higher purpose in mind, however, and tries to leave as little evidence as she can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this, while the Pint Puncher has documented most other villains to the point that fighting with them was almost routine, he knows next to nothing about the Kunoichi. While there are plenty of myths surrounding her, all from people who claimed to have witnessed her, most of these rumors are wildly exaggerated. All he can know for sure is what little he\u2019s seen personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019s spotted her a few times... usually from a distance, but still, he knew roughly what she looked like. The vixen was about seven feet tall -- short, by anthro standards -- and dressed in a slick latex bodysuit that shined in the moonlight, and didn\u2019t leave any of her curves up to the imagination. Her pure white fur would normally make her easy to spot at night, so her outfit was designed to be the perfect camouflage; every single inch of her body was completely covered in black, besides her hands, feet, tail, and piercing blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time he saw her, usually holding some helpless pedestrian in her grasp, he\u2019d immediately soar towards her as fast as he can; a futile gesture, as she\u2019d always either use one of her gadgets to throw up smoke, or simply glide away with her grappling hook, disappearing without a trace. Since these kidnappings were always random and unpredictable, Puncher didn\u2019t have any leads to go on, and the investigation seemed like a dead end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight, however, it seemed like she was on a bit of a crime spree. Five people have gone missing already in the span of just a couple hours, and each case shows every sign of Kunoichi\u2019s handiwork. Whatever plan the fox had been trying to put into action, the Puncher guesses she was probably running out of time, and growing desperate. Perhaps this will be the night she finally slips up. He can\u2019t handle this one by brute force alone, though. He\u2019ll have to be clever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's the first phase of his plan?</span></div></div>",

He's a little curious what Big Smelly Borris meant with it. The boar has several ideas himself on how to 'steam' a hero, but the extra large maw should make things interesting. Pint Puncher couldn't care less how interesting this was to the boars. He saw himself approaching that large, vile maw again and began to struggle in his captor's grasp. The grime and filth that was rubbed onto him was greasy enough to allow him some wiggle-room, but the boar was too fast. By the time he even had a chance at escape the hero already found himself surrounded by Big Smelly Borris' closing maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench of boar breath was gruesome and the large tongue took over from his hand, wrapping around the hero and pressing him into the roof and sides of the maw. Light faded as the jaws sealed shut, a low chuckle echoing through the empty space. Without the ability to see the Pint Puncher was thrown around inside the large mouth, Big Smelly Borris playing with him. It felt no different than the torment he endured from regular Borris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large tongue coiled itself around the hero's waist and slammed him down. Below him a large puddle of thick saliva had formed and he landed with a big splash. The tongue had already done a solid job of slathering boar saliva all over the hero, but this was just insane. The large muscle relaxed a little, pinning the hero below it and holding him down in the pool of slobber. He could wiggle enough to stop himself from drowning, but the Hulking Hog had only just started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe patted his belly, shaking up the gas forming inside and sent it racing to meet the hero. Big Smelly Borris clenched his jaws shut and introduced the hero to a monstrous burp. It was muffled and sounded a little on the weak side, but the boar succeeded in keeping all of the infernal gas in his maw. The Pint Puncher could barely identify the throaty gurgling as a belch, but the stench quickly convinced him otherwise. Searing hot gas washed over him, straight from the boar's putrid gut. It was potent enough to make his eyes water and make him scream for mercy. The cruel boar responded by pushing the hero down into the pool of saliva for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat of the gas was terrible in its own right. Pint Puncher was used to a little spice from several villains but this was something else. He didn't know Borris could handle this sort of temperature. The saliva began to boil, filling the maw with dense mist. It smelled excruciating, like boar breath but a thousand times more pervasive. Even more hellishly the mist seemed to amplify the stench of Big Smelly Borris' burp. In celebration he added a second, accidentally opening his maw a little and letting out a cloud of smelly steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot damn, you weren't kidding about the steaming.\" Hungry Borris said, impressed with the performance. Big Smelly Borris could only mumble in return as his mouth was full. The hero's super endurance dealt with the boiling saliva effortlessly, but he was powerless to stop himself from breathing the contaminated air. Thick clouds of saliva vapor and stomach gas made the hero scream for mercy. The boars all giggled, listening to the pathetic pleas coming from inside Big Smelly Borris' maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he contently pats his belly, commending it on a job well done producing the noxious gas tormenting the hero. He opens wide to reveal a naked hero splashing in a puddle of drool, pinned by a large tongue. The Pint Puncher gasped, sucking in the comparatively fresh air rushing in around him. A large cloud of the world's stinkiest steam escapes into the sky. Big Smelly Borris fishes the hero out and closes his maw, pursing his nasty lips around the hero's waist. Unceremoniously he is spat out, landing in the strong embrace of another boar. Who receives the hero?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher tried to push himself away from the source of the horrid gas. But the eyewatering stench had made it almost impossible to see where he was putting his hands. The hero realized his mistake all too late when he put a hand right on top of the gassy pucker of Big Smelly Borris. It twitched beneath the sudden pressure and opened, allowing half the hero's arm to slide in. His other hand was placed close by and slipped, following the first into the boar's ass. Outside the torment of the Dutch Oven the boars were having a laugh when Big Smelly Borris suddenly yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah! I didn't know you were that eager, little hero.\" He said with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's he doin in there?\" Hungry Borris asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's put his hands in me butt... ooooh, I think I get it. The oven ain't hot enough. Very thoughtful of ya, Punchy. Here, let us help. Give him a little hand back there, would ya boys?\" The other boars snorted with glee and approached the big butt that was busily working to pull the Pint Puncher into its depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his arms sinking into the hungry pucker past their elbows the hero was now closer than ever to it. Pestilent gas still sputtered from it, leaking past his arms and straight into his face. The noxious stench made it hard to focus on anything and the worst had yet to come. The trapped hero felt large hands rubbing along his back, feeling his unfortunate position in the boar's shorts. They began to assist the sputtering pucker, pushing and squeezing to move the hero closer. He wanted to scream, to command them to stop. But every word he said would be lost on the sadistic villains. Not to mention he'd have to breathe in the contaminated air all around him. No amount of torment could beat that. A rough shove quickly changed his mind. As the foul ring now hovered inches from his face he realized that no matter how foul it was in these rotten shorts, things were going to get a lot worse inside. He yelled incoherently, panic setting in as his nose touched the surface of Borris' asshole and soon began its entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords failed him to describe the stench. His previous torment was child's play compared to this all new nightmare. His head was pushed in with much fanfare, all three boars chuckling darkly. Big Smelly Borris felt the hero go inside and farted, giving the hero a warm welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep goin, his head's in and he likes it. Just feelin him squirm is makin me hard. Push our little guest into the oven boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two made light work of the struggling hero. Shove after shove pushed him into the cramped, fetid tunnel. Thick slime lubricated his entrance, but the narrow passage proved difficult. The Pint Puncher had no room to move, the constricting tunnel around him clamping down with a steady rhythm as fart gas straight from Borris' bowels flowed past him. The stench was so pure and undiluted the hero wasn't sure how much longer his nose would keep working. It'd take weeks for him to be able to smell anything without there being a disgusting hint of boar farts in there. The roiling of the innards around him was scary to listen to. Those monstrous bowels had digested just about everything under the sun, and the hero might soon become part of that list. If the gas wasn't going to do it, Hungry Borris laying claim on him afterwards almost certainly will. He was going to need a miracle to make it out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is good. My bowels haven't been tended to this well in years.\" Big Smelly Borris guffaws. \"Feels like I should reward ya for services rendered. Why don't ya pop on out and we'll discuss things.\" Boisterous laughter followed as the boars gloated over the Pint Puncher's misfortune. \"Dedicated to stewin yerself I see, I can respect that. I'll send yer gift to you then. Hang tight, just listen to the rumbles, that means it's comin for ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOminously a loud rumbling began to roll through the immense gut. The hero could do nothing but track the noise as it thundered through the long intestines before finally reaching their destination. The horrid fart was so immensely foul the hero's vision began to fade. Consciousness slipped and in seconds the Pint Puncher went motionless inside Big Smelly Borris' ass. The force of the fart pushed him halfway back out and the boar quickly recovered him, laying the unconscious hero out on the floor before him. The villain poked him, drawing barely any response. With pride he looked at the other boars, Hungry Borris in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks 'spiced' to perfection if you ask me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No argument there. He looks delicious.\" the ravenous boar replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's all yours. Just one last question if you will...\" Big Smelly Borris said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want your hero regular or with some cream filling?\" The boar patted the front of his shorts, drawing attention to the large boner they failed to conceal.</span></div></div>",

Now which hole to choose... you make them all so tempting, Punchy. Should I ram myself into that tight little butt, or are you more of a blowjob type of guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Raunchy Borris piped up with a suggestion. \"Why not both? I can't just stand by idly whilst you fill this pathetic wretch up with your male vigour. I want in on that. So you just pick a hole and I'll fill the other end.\" The hero whimpered a little at the prospect of two large boar cocks invading him. But in his current state just staying conscious was a challenge. There's no way he was capable of putting up a fight. Big Smelly Borris continued looming overhead, circling his victim like a starving beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a tough choice, but my dick definitely feels a little more draw to that cute rear of yours, Punchy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boars stepped up, one looming behind him, one towering in front. Both boars pulled down their shorts and speedo respectively, letting their twitching manhoods swing free. In spite of Big Smelly Borris being a good bit taller, their dicks were almost equal in length. Whether the raunchy one was simply super well-endowed or the other lacking didn't matter. Both those swinging rods looked too big for the hero lying between them. Nothing they couldn't sort out with a bit of willpower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Smelly Borris was first to satisfy his needs, grabbing the squirming superhero by the ankles and forcefully spreading his legs. His manhood lazily flopped onto the hero's butt, making him wriggle even more. Before long the thick tip managed to drive itself between the hero's cheeks and began its entry. The passage was unbelievably tight, but steadily the villain pushed more and more of his throbbing rod inside. Not keen on letting the other boar have all the fun, Raunchy Borris picks the hero's head up from the ground, holding it in front of his own erection. His bigger colleague in crime provides some timely assistance, driving his manhood in so deep the hero yelps in shocked surprise. The Horny Hog doesn't hesitate for a moment and plunges himself as far down the Pint Puncher's neck as physically possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boars were at least halfway there, their cocks steadily plunging ever deeper into his shuddering body. There were no words to describe how violated the hero felt. His innards were pushed and stretched, struggling to cope with the invading pillars. He faded in and out of consciousness, the lines between reality and waking nightmare blurring as the pair of hogs drew ever closer to their inevitable climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it was there, a loud bellow and a grunting moan. Big Smelly Borris was the first to open the floodgates, but Raunchy Borris followed mere seconds later, spurred on by the hero's slowly inflating belly. They would pump every last ounce of spunk into the hero, as much as would fit in that puny body of his. As their balls neared depletion they began to pull out of the squirming little hero. The shaking bulge growing in the Pint Puncher's gut a testament to their virility. Both boars felt understandably careworn after delivering such a brutal beatdown. The only one that wasn't tired yet was Hungry Borris, and the sight of the helpless hero stuffed full of cum filled him with delight. At long last he'd enjoy the one meal that had always been denied to him. Saliva dripped down all along his maw and with a warm smile the other two stepped back. With the biggest and hungriest grin the drooling boar approaches the hero.</span></div></div>",

One of them wore green panties, a scull and crossbones pattern on the rear, and looked similar to the classic Helen. One of them wore the familiar pink panties, but they had more curves and wore makeup. The last one was larger than the two of them, and bore orange panties. Where did these three come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the Pint Puncher could debate further, the three of them turned towards the hero, their expressions morphing from confusion to hunger. The green-pantied hippo leapt, boosting her height with a fart, towards the hero. When she was directly overhead, she farted down on him, leaving him coughing and hacking. When she got behind him, she put him into a full nelson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, poor hero, wound up in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" the green hippo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he wanted to get <i>close</i> to his favorite hippo?\" the pink hippo said, shooting him a wink and blowing him a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe he wanted to add to my weight!\" the orange hippo said, patting her stomach. The hero knew enough to figure what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you guys?!\" the Pint Puncher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, the critter doesn't know who we are,\" the pink hippo said, feigning sorrow. \"Well, don't forget it again, but we are Helen. At least, together we are Helen. When that star fell down, we became these three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already met Gassy,\" the green hippo said, tightening her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Flirty,\" the pink hippo said, getting uncomfortably close to the hero. She smooched him, her lips big enough to completely swallow his face. Her lips popped off, leaving a lipstick mark on his face. Then, Gassy tossed him forward, leaving him stumbling onto his belly. While he tried to get up, the orange hippo suddenly smashed down upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Crushy!\" the hippo crushing the hero shouted out. She gave him a few painful bounces before getting off, letting the hero get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Together, we are Helen!\" the three said in unison, standing in ring around the hero. He was getting up, but he was too dazed to make the first attack. Something the three were more than happy to exploit.</span></div></div>",

He coughed and sputtered, feeling the thick fingers wrench themselves close around his neck. Breathing became a challenge and the extra large hippo held him high for every nearby terrified onlooker to see. Embarrassed to already be in such a position the Pint Puncher tried his trademark punches on her arm, but Crushy isn't having any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the villain known as Helen had split into these three hippos Crushy was definitely the one to inherit her domineering attitude and titanic strength. The explosion seemed to not only have separated these aspects, but empower them too. Her muscular arms had no problem overpowering the Pint Puncher and she was going to abuse that as much as she possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, feisty one. Maybe I need to put my other hand to use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero grimaced defiantly until he felt her grab him. His look turned to one of sheer horror when he felt her warm hand on his groin. Flirty looked at the scenario filled with glee. She couldn't wait until she got some time with the hero. She'd show him how well her hands could take care of his little hero. Crushy had a different plan for the hero's genitals. Her hand closed firmly, crushing the hero's balls. He shouted in surprise before howling in pain. The merciless tower of a hippo squeezed his entire groin in her powerful grasp. He reached down to relieve his manhood, but the hero couldn't do a thing to move Crushy's powerful fingers and lighten their death grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body, or at least his groin, was as putty in the hippo's hand. She squeezed, crushed and kneaded the yielding flesh with ease. Time crawled by as he felt every little shift and twitch of her large fingers. She was holding on to his balls, her large thumb pushing against his length, seeming convinced that if she simply pushed hard enough his member would be absorbed back into his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she paused her torment of his cock. The oversized Helen hoisted him up to eye level. He stared straight into her piercing steely gaze. Even that was amplified within her extra-crushy version. She made sure he could hear every letter she said, speaking slowly and clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you go and play with the other two. But beware, if you don't behave...\" Her crushing grasp on his groin went up a thousandfold for a second. But after that savage demonstration the hippo finally showed a shred of mercy and released his aching genitals. The strong grip around his neck was a different story entirely. It held him tight enough to reduce all his conversation options to panicked sputtering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held out her arm, offering the dangling hero to the other two Helens. Both looked at eachother and at the struggling hero. What do they do with him?</span></div></div>",

He was still a little shaken from the brutal belly smothering he'd received. The two walls of grey mass had crushed and disoriented him, but the hippo wasn't willing to wait around for him to catch his bearings. Her hands let go of his shoulders and took hold of his head. Crushy might've been bigger, but even this hippo barely had enough space to wrap all her fat fingers around his head. She left his mouth and nose open, smirking deviously. Feigning concern, she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look so good Punchy. Let me help. It's important that you keep your head in the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she began to squeeze. The pressure on his skull gave him a thumping headache and he yelled out in pain. It wasn't nearly as bad as Crushy's manhandling before, but the hero knew that this was just the start. That big gut in front of him was bubbling and broiling louder and louder. She twisted his head, forcing him to look up at her. The hippo leaned down, brushing her large tits against the hero before being face to face with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, oh dear. You look like shit, Puny Puncher. It's alright, I'm sure you can still fight your way out of this. Just take a deep breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words were filled with malice and spite. Gassy opened her maw wide and squeezed a little tighter. As the Pint Puncher howled in pain once again she let the foul gasses bubbling in her belly release. The moment he inhaled after his scream a thunderous long belch washed over him, the stench invading his sore lungs. He physically felt her hot gas push into his body, disgusting him to no end. The horrifying stench shot up his nose, instantly setting it ablaze and making his eyes water. She held his head tightly. He could do nothing but breathe the rancid gas cloud enveloping him. It hung around him for an agonizing few seconds before it dissipated. He hacked and coughed loudly, desperate to get her foul burp out of his lungs again. He felt dirty beyond belief and Gassy wasn't done with him yet. She let go of his head, allowing the hero to slump to his knees. His eyes were tearing up, making the hippo before him little more than a blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he wiped the tears away and regained his vision the vague rotund shape cleared up.

The Pint Puncher found himself suspended off of the ground, still too weakened by Gassy's previous attack. Without another word, the hippo mashed his face against her lips. He began kicking and flailing as he felt her lips suck his face, but the Helen component held him tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held him close to her and kept up her powerful efforts with her lips. She even gave the poor hero a few licks while he was in her grip. He sputtered and groaned as he was assaulted. To his horror, he felt a hand reach between his legs.

He tried to crawl back on his feet but the hippo leaned down and put a large hand on his chest, pressing him back down. After the vicious belly grinding and the noxious burps of Gassy he was in no state to push the looming flirtatious hippo away. She smiled broadly and reached down to his groin again. Her gentle caress gave the hero conflicting feelings. On the one hand it was disturbing that the large beast had such an intimate interest in him. On the other hand it was downright blissful compared to the savage vice of Crushy when she got a hand on his package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't think you'll be needing this...\" She said with a laugh before taking hold of the stretchy spandex covering his manhood. With a loud ripping noise she tore it away, leaving him exposed beneath her many curves. The powerful hippo discarded the scraps of cloth and went back for more. Her leathery skin brushed against the pinned hero. He tried squirming, but he was too weak to escape her seductive games. Again she took hold of his member, gently running her large fingers around the shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good Punchy, all ready for the big hippo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villain didn't wait for an answer and stood tall, towering over the hero. He wanted to get up quickly before she could do what he feared she was about to do, but the hippo was not one for patience. Without a shred of subtlety she drops herself down on her victim. Her flabby body swallows up most of his, leaving a pair of feet sticking out on one side and a screaming head on the other. The hero yelled in pain under her immense weight but Flirty didn't hear any of it. She was far more focused on her own little pleasures. Under all that mass was the distinct warmth of his erection. She slowly ground herself back and forth along the length of the squished shaft, muddying the screams with confused moans. Her thick hide was proving to be very stimulating and soon the hero begged her to stop. His words fell on deaf ears as she had only one goal in mind. Heat was building between her legs too and the moment the Pint Puncher noticed it he began to beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't do this. I'll do anything you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain his words were lost to Flirty, but the other two took notice. They sat back and watched the spectacle, chuckling to see the little man squirm beneath her so much. They knew he was pathetic but this was a new low. Both Crushy and Gassy encouraged her not to hold anything back. With a lot of huffing and puffing the monstrously thick legs parted and a piercing stench filled the air. The Pint Puncher was repulsed by the vile stink but it would prove insignificant compared to Flirty's plans for him. She felt her womanhood practically steaming with pent up lust, dripping warm arousal onto the hero. Without a hint of mercy she re-adjusted herself on top of him. She made sure her hungering pussy was ready to...</span></div></div>",

He knew one villainous fox that usually went out in the nude, and these foxes looked just like her. Except, they had fur of different color. And slightly differing body structures, though not completely different from Felicia. One of them bore cyan fur and a lighter blue underbelly, and seemed to have more noodle-y limbs. Said limbs were twisting and turning unnaturally as she twisted around unnaturally. Next was a red fox, except she bore white fur resembling an apron over her front, as well as a notably larger stomach. The last one, boasting green fur. The three of them turned towards the hero, and all seemed to gain a similar mischievous idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well, look who wandered on our turf, Felicia,\" the cyan one said. As she stepped forward, she stretched her limbs, making long strides towards the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I was wondering when my meal would arrive,\" the \"apron\" wearing Felicia said, patting her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'd look a lot nicer between my legs!\" the green Felicia said, stretching as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which of you are Felicia?\" the hero asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" they all answered simultaneously. The hero was just confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, I think we need to demonstrate what we mean,\" the cyan Felicia said. Suddenly, she coiled around the hero like a snake, and squeezed in tight, causing the hero to instantly feel the air escape his lungs. \"I'm Felicia's fantastic stretching powers, which also includes...\" Suddenly, the hero noticed his vision getting eclipsed by two pillow-y surfaces. \"...her fantastic asset growth!\" She held him in place as he flailed about, before throwing him out, leaving him gasping for air. \"I'm, of course, Stretchy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Felicia's stupendous hunger,\" the hero heard. He looked ahead, and saw the \"apron\" Felicia, who suddenly flicked her tongue forward like a frog would. He felt it wrap around his neck, and pulled him towards her. He suddenly found himself face first in her smelly maw, which begin licking his face, before she spat him out. \"I'm Hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Felicia's devastating odor!\" the hero heard. He looked up, only to see a green foot held over his face. She brought it down, and he was struck with the horrid smell of sweat. From the previous beatdown, he was too weakened to fight back. She dug her sole into him, before scraping it off of him. \"Call me Smelly!\" The Pint Puncher groaned as he got up. He couldn't relax for long, for... </span></div></div>",

They had identical speedos. The only glaring difference among them was the fact that their fur were of differing colors. One of them was a fiery red and seemed looked like he was literally steaming. The more muscular one was a bright yellow. And the last one was pink, and was feeling his groin and a nipple. The hero had no idea what he stumbled into, but he knew it couldn't be good. Especially when the three turned towards the hero, and a hungry expression suddenly grew on each of their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the hero could react, the yellow cougar leapt forth, and wrapped him up in a bearhug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Let go of me!\" the hero shouted out, trying to push against his chiseled front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No can do, puny,\" the cougar said. \"I just wanna squeeze as much of your strength out of you as possible.\" The Pint Puncher soon realized he was very literal. As he pushed against him, he felt his strength waning. Meanwhile, the cougar holding him seemed to be getting bigger as time passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... what are you?\" the Pint Puncher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are we?\" the yellow cougar asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hurt,\" the pink cougar teased. \"Surely you wouldn't forget these lovely faces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no way this l'il man could forget the great Rowland,\" the red cougar said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rowland?\" the Pint Puncher asked incredulously. \"Which one of you-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all Rowland,\" the yellow cougar said. \"Red-y, pink-y, me, we're all Rowland. We're all one piece of a muscular sum. I'm obviously his supreme strength. You can call me Rougher.\" With that, Rougher lifted the hero, and slammed him into the concrete. He was getting up, but the bright red Rowland picked hi up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Burner, and I can't wait to cook you up, shrimp!\" the red villain said. He gave him a powerful bearhug, and surrounded himself in flame. The hero, meanwhile, kicked and flailed in pain. His super endurance may've prevented him from getting horribly burned, but he still felt the intense heat, the sweat dripping down his face, and the sweat coming from Bruner. Burner removed his arms, and let the hero fall down. Then, the pink Rowland put the hero onto his back, and quickly placed his groin over the poor warrior's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Lover,\" the pink Rowland said. He began scooting himself forward and back, side to side, rubbing his, terrifyingly, growing bulge against the hero's face. He tried to push him away and wildly kicked, but Rougher took away his strength. He could only lie there and take it. \"Oh, I can't begin to imagine how much you want this. A l'il guy like you surrounded by three muscular beasts that want you as close to their bodies as possible? I imagine that'd be Heaven for a lot of people.\" He finished his taunting, and got off, letting the hero suck in as much fresh air as he could. However, his moment of reprieve wouldn't help him that much, for... </span></div></div>",

The bright crimson hue of burner was unmistakable and so was his brilliant smile. Evil shone in his eyes as he folded the weakened hero into another powerful grip. He channeled all his might into pure heat. Not a flame in sight but the deep red fur began to reveal an almost orange glowing skin beneath. The hero had never felt such intense heat wrapped around him. It made both him and Burner sweat profusely. Every bead of sweat evaporated immediately. As the hero struggled for every breath in the powerful grasp he had to breathe in the cougar's sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLover stood back, making jokes with Rougher. \"Damn, they're giving a steamy romance an all new meaning.\" They chuckled and exchanged more horrible puns. Neither the hero not the scalding hot cougar cared. Pint Puncher was too busy trying to stay alive and Burner had far too much fun 'cooking' this pesky hero. Suddenly a distinct smell filled his nose. It was powerful and synthetic. No part of the cougar's foul arsenal of bodily odours got anywhere near this peculiar smell. But it was familiar to the hero. He couldn't quite place when and where, but he'd smelt this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he remembered what it was the hero redoubled his efforts. He had no doubt in his mind that this smell was burning spandex! Burner was roasting his outfit right off of his body. With Lover nearby and ready to pounce the hero shuddered to think what the lustful cougar might do with him. Burner enjoyed the weakling's struggles and vowed to hold him even longer as a result. The Pint Puncher was undeterred by these threats, desperate to seek escape before the spandex quite literally melts off his body. The scorching hot cougar tightens his hug and soon enough he notices too. The little hero was about to lose his clothes. He couldn't let that get in the way of all the fun. The cooking was almost complete, the suit rapidly slipping off his body and dripping down into a heap of burnt plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen not a thread of spandex was left on the hero Burner released him, letting his steaming body flop onto the ground. He was groaning in pain from the intensity and heat. With his body exposed to the cackling trio of cougars he felt himself get bright red, almost matching burner in hue. As a token of complete overkill the red cougar kicked the hero in the head, knocking him silly for a minute. Burner crowned himself champion in this fight. He'd need a minute to stoke his furnace, but the other two were more than ready to go toe to toe with this little punk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the hero's thoughts completely absorbed by the shame he is forced to endure he was a sitting duck for the cougars. A pair of large hands takes hold of the naked Pint Puncher. Whose hands are these?</span></div></div>",

He came back to his senses, and, sure enough, he was being hoisted by Lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lost that get up for us? How thoughtful!\" Lover said, his eyes scanning over the hero's body. He held him close to his body, though kept a hand between the two of them. This hand was currently wrapped around the hero's exposed embarrassment. He groaned out and shook at the feeling of his fingers wrapping around his shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-let go of me!\" the hero shouted. He pressed his hands against the cougar's chiseled chest, but that just made him feel more embarrassed. He didn't know why, but something about touching his thick pecs made him feel weird. He tried to push, but, not only was he not pushing against him, but feeling his hands press into his powerful muscles added more and more to his embarrassment. And, if that hungry smile on Lover was any indication, he knew it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you got down there?\" Lover taunted, licking his lips. \"Well, it's a good thing I've got more than enough for the two of us, but, for now let's see what we can do for you~\" To the hero's horror, Lover's hand stroked forward and back, each stroke making the hero shudder. \"Atta boy, I feel your little friend trying to grow. I bet those citizens would love to see how much you're enjoying this.\" He kept up a steady pace, making the hero wince and groan. With one hand, he held the hero close to his chest, which stunk of sweat. But somehow that just added to the weird feeling. He had no idea why he was feeling hard. He knew he couldn't be getting hard over Lover, he was some hulking monster that constantly beat him down. He was just some jerk, he couldn't be feeling this weird about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, how close are you?\" Lover asked. \"Lemme know! I want to savor every drop I can milk out of you!\" The hero wasn't sure whether or not he could grow any more red. Then...</span></div></div>",

The cougar's response was disappointment following with a devious smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, well why didn't you tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned his head down to meet the superhero's face, pursing his lips and closing his eyes. The shocked hero saw this and immediately turned his head away. Undeterred the amorous monster planted a warm kiss on the Pint Puncher's cheek. The gentleness and softness of Lover stood in sharp contrast with the inescapable tight grasp he held on the hero's torso. It was pressed against the cougar's sweaty pecks, making the naked hero feel a little disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, I know you want to. You can't hide from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe defiant hero sought to prove his tormentor wrong. With one hand squeezing him into the wall of sweaty muscle and fur and another torturing his manhood the cougar had no way of forcing him to play along. That is when he felt the steady pumping of his member slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way, hehe.\" The cougar chuckled a little at his own pun. He then started to squeeze the hardening mass in his hand. Pain shot through the hero but as soon as the villain had started he lightened his grasp again. \"Did you get the hint or shall I squeeze again?\" The hero was not so easily broken, but a second and third squeeze, each more ferocious than the last, finally forced him to submit to Lover. He turned his head to face the cougar, preparing for the nightmare to come. The last thing he saw before closing his eyes were those big lips approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLover held nothing back, placing all of his signature love and passion into a kiss for the ages. Both Rougher and Burner giggled a little at the hero's humiliation. Though slowly their giggles faded and they became downright impressed with the sheer length of the ongoing kiss. Pint Puncher twitched and struggled, desperate for air. He received what little oxygen he could find only through the foul filter of cougar breath. Lover had to breathe for both of them, his large slobbering maw covering both the hero's mouth and nose. He didn't mind as it gave him plenty of time to explore and defile the hero's mouth with his big tongue. The coarse surface pushed and pried everywhere, culminating in dipping itself as deep as possible down the hero's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher barely even noticed the cougar had started pumping his member again. He didn't have the air to think straight and the nice sensation down below made him feel as conflicted as ever. He was being actively tortured and yet his boner couldn't get harder. Lover expertly finished off the kiss, leaving both of them a little dumbstruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was impressive, little man. I can see why you like being near me so much. There were some sparks flying there.\" The hero offered no response, still too dazed to talk. Burner couldn't help but chuckle at the bad wordplay. \"but I could tell from the way you stopped fighting me that this is just the beginning. You want so much more of me.\" The next line he whispered softly in the hero's ear. \"And that feeling is very much mutual.\" That got the hero squirming and moving at full power again. \"That's the spirit. But lookie here, there's someone else that wants to join in on our fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero froze in sheer terror when he felt the smoothness of Lover's shaft brush against his leg. For the first time he offered some words again. \"no. NO. Anything but that. I beg you, keep that thing away from me.\" The cougar was deaf to the hero's pathetic pleading. His mind was occupied with just one question. Where to stick his quickly rising member? Pint Puncher's mouth? Or his ass?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His own near painful erection was ready to provide the love. The Pint Puncher struggled in the cougar's grip, but he was still weakened from the pummeling and kissing he'd received earlier. He felt his back touch the hairy chest with a wet splat. The powerful arms of the villain held him tightly against the sweaty surface, moving him up and down a little to get him into position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, stop! I'll do anything for you. Just don't do this! Don't...\" The hero's increasingly pathetic pleas were cut off when Lover put a large paw on his face, covering his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssshh, quiet now. Let me enjoy this moment with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero felt it. The heat of Lover's member pressing against his butt. The warm tip tried to find its way in, poking his buttcheeks before sliding between them. It left a trail of warm pre, a disgusting reminder that the cougar was pent up with lust and ready to deliver it all right up his ass. After some difficulty the villain finally made contact with the hero's pucker. It twitched with uncertainty before being forced to yield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLover showed no mercy at all, driving himself deep into the hero. The pained shrieks might be muffled, but he could tell from the paralyzing horror that gripped the Pint Puncher's body that he was giving the hero an all new experience. It only widened the villain's smile further as he pledged to make this first time special for his opponent. Rougher and Burner looked on with glee, seeing the hero's eyes bulge so wide with shock they might just pop out of his skull. Neither of them may be as lust-crazed as their counterpart, but they couldn't deny getting turned on by the spectacle. With every low grunt the cougar pushed himself a little deeper, determined to push his full length inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intense heat of the invading manhood was a clear indicator of his progress. The Pint Puncher could feel it thrust ever further into him. Every disturbing movement was felt. The steady pumping, the potent throbbing, all set to a chorus of deep grunts just above his head. Lover didn't have any taunting words for the hero, his eyes were closed and his mind occupied with the ecstasy of the moment. The hero couldn't produce a decent sentence without interrupting himself with another scream whenever the cougar pushed in deeper. Both of them knew that no normal human could provide the villain with love like this. Only by virtue of his super endurance was the hero able to survive this. When he felt the base of Lover's cock push against his butt a moment of relief washed over the hero. But neither of them knew that the villain had one last unexpected trick up his sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amorous cougar was so lost in his intimacy with the hero it took him a moment to realize what was happening. The other two saw it a lot sooner, but sheer curiosity kept them quiet. As Lover ran out of manhood to push into the hero he'd started growing. It took him a moment to realize his perspective was slowly changing. He grew very slowly, adding another foot to his already imposing height. The Pint Puncher felt the shift too, both in the tight hug moving a little and the member inside of him swelling even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh... I just love you so much, little hero. Look at what it's making me do. Don't fret, I'll make sure you get all the love you could ever want.\" The cougar embraced his lust-driven growth and concentrated himself on adding just a little more. With his member shoved completely up the hero's rear, how much more growth can Lover draw from his lust?</span></div></div>",

Already he felt the oversized manhood throbbing within him, it pushed up further and further, pushing his body out of shape. The strong hands of Lover ensured the hero remained firmly jammed down. No amount of his member would be allowed to grow outside the hero's warmth. The lustful feline knew this was only just the beginning. He tapped into his most primal urges and they had shown him the staggering depths of their potential. There was so much room left the cougar could scarcely believe his luck. If it already felt good right now, how much better would it be when he was a little larger? But why settle for a little? What if he was a lot larger? He growled softly with malice and lust, gripping the hero's head tightly to ensure no pointless pleas or high-pitched screaming would interrupt him. It was when his hands made such light work of restraining the hero that he really felt his dominant urges bubble up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm... this feels so good. Your little head in my growing hands. Your little manhood paling before mine. Your little body struggling to fit around my dick. It makes me want to grow even bigger.\" He released the hero's mouth expecting a response, but all the Pint Puncher offered was disjointed screaming. Lover quickly shut him up again and concentrated. He'd only added two feet since he started growing. It was time to think a little bit bigger. First he'd offer the struggling superhero one last bit of mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mere, let me deal with that little problem for you.\" He reached down and wrapped a large hand around the Pint Puncher's dick. Lover's musk was thick and its effects were powerful enough to drive even to tormented hero into an erection. The cougar barely needed to pump before his victim was brought to shameful climax. Lover laughed out loud at the hero's pathetic display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That was all you got? I barely touched it and you blew everything? Pathetic. I guess I'll have to let you feel how a real man takes care of things. Here, a little sample of what's to come.\" The throbbing member pushing deep into the hero stopped growing for just a moment before firing a shot of gooey, hot cougar spunk into his prey. The squirming doubled in intensity, but the hero could do nothing to stop it. \"There, all lubed up and really for the big finale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurner and Rougher backed away a little to give Lover the room he needed, grinning sadistically at the hero. The growing cougar rose up even faster than before. Another foot in height was added in seconds. The Pint Puncher felt his body distort under the overwhelming pressure of the invading member. His frame was visibly getting inflated by the huge cock of Lover. The cougar relished all the little feelings this blissful experience brought him. The comically small head held in his powerful grip. The ever deeper exploration of the Pint Puncher's innards. The puny hero soon had to contend with a manhood the size of his torso. It warped him out of shape and soon Lover realized he was either going to skewer the hero completely or lift him away from the base of his member. There simply wasn't enough hero to fit all of his throbbing love into anymore. He'd grown three times his original size, the hero looking more like a condom with weakly flailing novelty limbs. Lover had reached the pinnacle of his lust, tightly holding on to the Pint Puncher and grunting with pleasure. His climax was impending, but how would he unleash it upon the trapped superhero?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Pint Puncher was flying in fast, but he froze in mid air at a terrifying sight. Three gigantic, terrifying elephants loomed over the city! They each bore a...resemblance to Quaker, but they were all a bit different. All three were nude, just as Quaker never wore clothing, but their bodies had very distinct shapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was wide eyed, and looked down on her body in surprise. She was curvaceous beyond words, her thick hips allowed her full ass to stand out from her body like a shelf. Her hips tapered into a narrow waist, but her body jutted out again at her chest, where her chest seemed to balloon. Normally, the hero thought Quaker carried a big ass and large breasts, but this anthro woman made her look like the original Quaker was just entering puberty. Her face shifted from an expression of surprise to one of joy, as she fondled her assets and moaned loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second had a body structure more similar to the normal Quaker, but her body was caked in dirt and earth. It was as if she has been buried in the sand and took the sand with her when she stood up. The layer of earth was thick, making it completely impossible for the Pint Puncher to see a sliver of her skin. She was already occupied toppling buildings and terrifying citizens, likely the primary cause for the disturbance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the third stood with her eyes busily scanning the ground, as if she was looking for something. She seemed to find what she was looking for as she grabbed two civilians and stuffed them between her large breasts. When she looked up, the Pint Puncher's mouth dropped in awe at the look of sheer glee on her face. Her body was proportioned to be slightly larger than Quaker's all over, including her belly, her overall height, and even her large feet. She revealed a LOT of flesh, but her curves didn't quite measure up to the first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Quaker was bad enough, but facing off against three massive elephants was enough to make the hero want to look for another zip code. But on hearing the civilians screaming from between the third elephant's breasts and seeing the destruction the dirt covered anthro was carelessly wrecking, he knew he had no choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" the small hero yelled at the top of his lungs. All three elephants froze at the unexpected disturbance and their eyes locked on him. He swallowed hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know who you three are, but you need to get. out. of. my. city,\" he commanded, with all the confidence he could muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dirt covered elephant spoke first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that cute? The hero doesn't recognize us,\" she said with a hint of a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could he forget us? After all the fun we've had?\" the largest elephant asked rhetorically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'd be happy to remind him,\" the curvaceous anthro spoke up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are Quaker,\" the dirt covered elephant said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? But....but there are three of you. Which of you....\" the hero responded in confusion before he was cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of us darling,\" the curvaceous elephant spoke. \"We aren't quite sure what happened, but after that star fell, I became us,\" she said with a seductive smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might not know us yet Pint Puncher,\" the largest of the three cooed, \"But we certainly know you. How about some reintroduction?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the dirt and earth covering the second hippo shifted itself and formed a huge arm, which hurtled toward the Pint Puncher, grabbing him in a massive, rocky fist and drawing him closer to the trio of elephants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Dusty,\" the elephant holding him captive said. As she spoke, a large plateau sprouted from the middle of the street, which Dusty was all too happy to slam the hero onto with a hard slap. \"We all have our original earth manipulation powers, but I have greater control than ever. My creations are strong enough that even your super strength won't allow you to punch your way through,\" she said gloating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word, as the Pint Puncher swung with all of his might at the rocky hand that still held him captive, it did nothing. He didn't even make a crack. All he was left with was some bruised knuckles and a bruised ego for his trouble. But that would be the least of his worries soon. Dusty dropped him onto the plateau's flat surface and lifted the rocky hand high into the air, bringing it down on him rapidly as if she was swatting a fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero saw stars, but he didn't have much time to recover as the largest of the three now loomed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Touchy,\" she said casually, lifting her large foot over his small body, bringing it down slowly. He was too battered to push her off, but she still enjoyed the sensation of his squirming and struggling beneath her sole. \"Mmmm, keep that up and we're going to get along great hero. There's a whole lot more of me now, and I just love the sensation of you puny humans wiggling against my skin. If you're good, you might get to experience. Every. Inch,\" she said, drawing out her last few words with a gentle rub. The hero started to get a bit excited despite himself as he felt Touchy focus her rubbing on his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally withdrew, but the prone hero wasn't alone for long, as the most curvaceous of the trio joined him on the plateau. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! Is that for me?\" she cooed, referring to the beginnings of his erection. \"I'm Lusty, but I'm afraid I'm going to need a little more than that to satisfy me Puny,\" she mocked. \"Let's see if I can get your shy little friend to be a bit more bold hmm?\" With that, she slowly lowered her massive breasts over the hero's body and massaged her tits across nearly the entirety of the plateau. The Pint Puncher was right in the middle of her fleshy prison, and she felt his erection starting to grow despite his protests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, there he is. He's coming to say hello!\" Lusty exclaimed with a laugh. \"Hmm, if that's all you've got to offer though, I might need to get a little more....creative,\" she said with a giggle, lifting up his entire body and brushing his face against her crotch. \"Not quite yet though,\" she teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher swallowed hard. He was in trouble. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There, he sees Muro the arctic fox, though not the same color of the fox. One was a shade of light pink, one was a shade of light green, and one was a shade of lavender. They looked at each other, confused, until they noticed the Pint Puncher. Then, they grinned at once, a crude idea crossing each of their ideas. The 3 of them advanced towards the hero, slowly walking around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, what have we got here?\" the lavender one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like a fine piece of meat~\" the pink one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I can't wait to bury that boy beneath me!\" the green one said. The hero felt his skin shiver at each of their perverse looks, though he tried to look strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever you are, you better introduce yourself!\" the Pint Puncher said. Eventually, the three of them stopped. The pink one was standing in front of him, the green one behind and to the left of him, and the lavander one behind and to the right of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I recall being Muro,\" the pink one said. \"But to you, tonight...\" Suddenly, the two arctic foxes behind him lunged forwards, wrapping their hands around him and pinning him in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What're you-?!\" the Pint Puncher immediately spat out. Before he could complete his sentence, however, the pink Muro spun around on his heel, and thruste backwards, pounding his butt against the Pint Puncher's groin. He stiffened immediately, feeling a horrid stirring below. Oh dear, Muro was doing that thing again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call me Stimulator~\" the pink Muro said, beginning to rub his butt up and down on the hero's groin, him slowly getting more and more erect. He tried to struggle out of the other two Muros' grip, but they held him tightly. He was sure he should escape, but some... presence was whispering to him, telling him not to fight back. To enjoy the foxy bodies around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just listen to ol' Whisperer, and everything will feel juuuuuust fine~\" the lavander Muro whispered, attempting to coax the hero into more and more bliss. And, unfortunately, it was working. He was slowly getting more and more erect as Stimulator's butt kept rubbing and rubbing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a hand pressed against his nose and mouth. And suddenly, he was struck with a rancid smell. At that, his struggling came back to full force, and he was knocked out of his daze. He soon realized that the green Muro's face was pressed against his face, and it stank!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to give Stinky his share!\" the green Muro said as he rubbed his smelly palm into the Pint Puncher's face. The other Muros couldn't help but giggle at the hero's distress. Even Stimulator, who was a little upset at the hero not holding still for his release, couldn't help but giggle. Soon, the two Muros at the back moved away, and Stinky threw the Pint Puncher onto his back, before straddling his waist and pressing his still stinky hand into the hero's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smell that? That's a fraction of what's inside my shorts,\" Stinky warned. \"Once I let these other two turn your brain to mush, I'm going to enjoy emptying allllll of my musk onto your cute little face!\" With a cruel laugh, Stinky shoved his hand forwards, slamming the hero's head against the ground, momentarily dazing him (well, moreso after smelling a bit of Stinky). He lied there, dazed, an unfortunate position for any fight against a vaillain. A position that these three would surely exploit.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It'll all be over before you know it~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky wasn't kidding! That foot smelled absolutely horrendous! Pint Puncher wasn't sure he could handle a direct whiff without fainting! He struggled and shoved, only to have his legs held down by Stimulator. Just a touch from the pink fox made his blood hot. Stimulator giggled and traced his finger over the Pint Puncher's bulge. \"Or you can be a good boy and cum for me. Once you do, I promise you'll never want anything but us ever again~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs good as it felt, Pint Puncher still struggled...until he felt Whisperer speak softly into his ear. \"Come now...there's no need to struggle.

Why else would you keep throwing yourself at kinky villains? You've always hoped that one day you'd lose...haven't you?\" D...did he want this? The amount of times he'd been gassed or toyed with...and he always came back for more! \"Mmm...you see it now, don't you? Deep down...you've always wanted to submit.

He knew he had to respect his fellow Muro's wishes, but the moment he wrapped his hands around that hero, he instantly grew a desire. The longer he saw him sniff... the more greedy he felt.

Lydia had transformed into an anthromorphic eel, with bright red fins running from the middle of her scalp down to her mid back. In addition, she acquired a coal-black, one piece bathing suit, partially swallowed by her rump and straining to contain her breasts. Despite appearing human-like, she was still incredibly long, with almost six and a half feet of belly between her arms and legs. She could easily wrap her midsection around her prey and squeeze them like she were a snake. As if that weren't enough, the same event altered the poison in her body. Instead of slowly draining foes of their life force, when she deploys it on someone, she can eat away at their will. She usually unleashes her poison through her mouth or her rear. After thoroughly destroying her foe's will, she usually proceeds to swallow them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAphrodite - Formerly a mere seahorse, Aphrodite was affected just like all of the other villains. In response, her body transformed from it's usual Seahorse state into what appeared to be a horse built for the ocean. Instead of her small form, she was 32 feet tall, boasted legs and haunches like a horse (though with flippers for feet instead of hooves), an upper body that'd resemble a horse if they could grab stuff with their hands, and a horse-like head and snout. Strands of aqua-blue hair flew from her head majestically. She also bore a dolphin-like tail and a trident made from a pearl. A new body wasn't all she got though. Additionally, she could produce a vacuum-like vortex from any orifice on her, in an attempt to draw someone into whatever part of her she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho'll the hero face?</span></div></div>",

And one villainess would certainly prove that. A group of fraternity attendees were driving out into the ocean on a boat. The group were simply drinking alcohol, the driver not though, and screwing around. However, nearby there was a certain villainess watching the group. A certain figure was stealthily swimming towards the boat, barely not breaking the surface. She got close to the boat, and jammed the rotors, bringing the boat to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" one of the attendees said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go check it out,\" another one said. The first attendee walked over to the motor and looked down in confusion. However, quicker than he can respond, a tail wraps around his neck and yanks him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-?\" the second attendee asked. The rest of them ran towards the edge. They all looked down, confused, when suddenly, someone leapt up. Before they could realize what it was, something wrapped around the group of them. They noticed their friend was wrapped up by a tail, which was connected to a very long body. A tail hung from between a set of powerful, long legs. Running up from them was a long belly which was wrapped around the group of them, and above them were a pair of slender arms, a bust nearby. And wrapping the whole figure was a tight, black swimsuit. And poking out of the neck hole: Lydia, bearing her familiar eel face and sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, they come with an alcohol filling too,\" Lydia noted, brandishing a grin, which was made more terrifying by her sharp teeth. \"Man, I wonder how many I can down before I get intoxicated.\" The group screamed as a thin tongue licked around her lips. However, her fun would be interrupted, for a certain white blur was flying toward them. Said blur landed at the opposite end of the boat, catapulting Lydia upwards, and causing her to lose her grip on the attendees. They all flew off of the boat, while Lydia landed on the other end of the boat. The group quickly swam towards shore, trying to get far from the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the eel lady was shaking off the daze of the strike. She pulled her head up, and saw just who caused the attack. Of course, it was the Pint Puncher. She growled, getting back on her feet.

With his resistance fading he began to approach the gaping maw faster and faster. Aphrodite smiled as she maintained her grasp on the hero, salivating ever more as he was drawn closer to her mouth. She could practically taste the hero already. He would make a fine addition to the prey in her belly. His super-powered squirming would feel heavenly. She stopped daydreaming the moment she felt his hand touch her mouth. Instantly it became clear the Pint Puncher would not go down without a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his last moments outside her maw he had adjusted himself to grab onto her upper jaw whilst planting his feet on her lower jaw, forcing them open with all his strength. She tried to bite down, but the hero's might surprised her. It took all her focus to even get a small bit of progress and the moment she stopped trying to chomp down he pushed those jaws right back open. Suddenly she realized she'd found another game. Aphrodite could tell from his weary groans that he couldn't keep this up forever. He had to slip away or her throat was his only destination. With that in mind she began to occupy all his time with powerful attempts to bite down on him, forcing the Pint Puncher to use all his strength. His body trembled under the immense duress the villain was putting on him, but he never faltered. Not that it mattered to Aphrodite. She already had an ace in the hole and she was about to showcase it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher grit his teeth, hoping to outlast the monster before it could eat him. When he saw her long, slender tongue approach he knew things were about to get considerably more difficult. He tried his hardest to ignore the slimy muscle as it dragged its soggy surface over his body. His resolve finally broke when it coiled around his waist and pulled. It was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back and he folded beneath the pressure. Almost literally as the powerful jaws shut, trapping him inside. His struggle left him aching with strained muscles and unable to fight back against the rapidly approaching gullet. Aphrodite capitalized quickly on the weakness of her opponent. Now was her moment and she would seize it to the fullest. His squirming legs were fed to her throat first, the powerful muscles clamping down and pulling in more of the hero. In several loud gulps he was but a wiggling bulge sliding down her neck to join the rest of her prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mammoth stomach of the villain he landed atop a small group of slime-soaked people. They were beginning to panic, seeing their hero swallowed up just like them. The Pint Puncher quickly told them to quiet down. This was all part of the plan. He needed to get in to save them. His lie was convincing enough, but now the hero faced a new challenge. How is he going to save these people from digesting in here? Trying to push back up her throat would take super strength and he'd just end up in her maw again. She probably wasn't going to just let him go after a stunt like that, not to mention there's no chance for any of her victims to crawl the same way. Punching her gut would probably cause her to squeeze her belly. The hero could probably handle that, but the other people in her stomach would surely die. The only other way was the back door. He shuddered at the thought, but unless he could come up with a different plan, crawling through her intestines seemed like the only viable option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do the Pint Puncher and the other swallowed humans escape?</span></div></div>",

He'd been cooped up in his safehouses monitoring the city all day, only to fail to catch a single trace of suspicious activity. Now that it was past midnight, the high-strung hero decided it was about time to give himself a break. Maybe the onslaught of evil, super-powered animals was finally over. Maybe he could just relax and focus on stopping regular criminals from now on, like he's always wanted. He chuckled at the thought as he flew through the darkened city. He was currently on his way to his favorite bakery, to pick up some of the delicious pastries that always manage to calm him down. When he landed, though, he realized just how ominous the city was tonight. There wasn't a single person in sight, nor a car on the road. He felt a chill as he peered through the door of the bakery, only to see over a dozen people huddled inside, staring at him. <b>\"Are you all alright in here?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s him! It\u2019s the Pint Puncher!\u201d</span> A panicked voice shouted from within. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cRun!\u201d</span> The hero stepped back in awe and horror at the spectacle of all the civilians desperately fleeing from the building and running away down the street. What has gotten <i>into</i> them? Was there some villain inside? The Pint Puncher stepped curiously into the bakery to investigate, only to see that familiar baker, Jenny, hiding behind the counter, peeking out at him, looking absolutely terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOh God!\u201d</span> She whimpered as he walked in.

Just please, don\u2019t hurt me!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat? Jenny, you know me.

The superhero watched her leave, dumbstruck. Why were they all so afraid of him now? Before he could ponder the question for long, he overheard something interesting on one of the bakery's TVs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\"><i>\u201c... martial law has been declared in the city after news broke of its one and only defender succumbing to \u2018corruptive influences\u2019...\u201d</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his attention to the television, to see it was turned to the local news station. There, a reporter in a green dress was speaking in a panicked voice before a backdrop of what looked to be pure chaos. <span class=\"clgreen\"><i>\u201cYes, to those tuning in now, all reports and witness testimonies have been conclusive; the Pint Puncher has gone mad,\u201d</i></span> she said. The Pint Puncher felt his heart skip a beat when he heard those words. This had to be some sort of misunderstanding. His eyes were glued to the screen as he waited for any clarification. <span class=\"clgreen\"><i>\u201cThe following footage of his unprovoked massacre in Maplewood Park has sent shockwaves through the city. Be warned that the footage you are about to see is graphic.\u201d</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another graphic content warning, the screen switched over to shaky camera footage of the Pint Puncher in the local park. He recognized the scene immediately \u2014 it was from a fight he had with Quaker last week. However, it seemed someone had carefully edited Quaker out of the footage, and replaced her with random civilians, so it looked like he was just punching people at absolute random, sending them flying. <b>\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d</b> He clenched his fists in fear and anger when he realized what was happened. <b>\u201cNo\u2026 no, no, no! That footage is <i>fake</i>! I\u2019m being set up!\u201d</b> Unfortunately, there was no one around to hear him. In the eyes of the citizenry, he was already a guilty man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Pint Puncher paced angrily, pondering his next course of action, the television screen returned to the reporter. <span class=\"clgreen\"><i>\u201cThe city has been taken under military jurisdiction. They want to assure citizens that they have multiple contingencies in place to deal with the situation once and for all,\u201d</i></span> she explained. <span class=\"clgreen\"><i>\u201cA strict curfew is now enforced.

He was almost blinded as the helicopter shined its spotlight through the windows, a voice on a megaphone shouting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cCome out with your hands up! We have you surrounded!\u201d</font></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201d</b> Normally, the Pint Puncher would comply, but he couldn't be sure who to trust at the moment. As far as he knew, the military could be in on this conspiracy. Besides, any time spent locked up in a cell getting interrogated was time he could've been spending getting to the bottom of this mystery. Knowing time was of the essence, the Pint Puncher rearing back and punched a whole through the back wall of the bakery, sneaking out into the darkened alleyway behind the building. Unfortunately, the punch made a ruckus, and before he knew it, two heavily armored soldiers were pointing their guns at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cThere he is!\u201d</span> One of the shoulders shouts, their gun-mounted flashlights blinding the hero. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d</span> The Pint Puncher freezes in place, slowly raising his hands in the air... until, in a moment, he takes off soaring into the sky at maximum speed! The soldiers fire off a few shots, but he's far too fast for them, and the superhero escapes in an instant. As he flew back through the city, he cursed himself for having not noticed all the recently-installed military fortifications donning every major building, as the soldiers slowly spread out and searched for him. Luckily, the darkness of night kept him from being noticed most of the time, and he was more then fast enough to dodge the few stray bullets he had to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he landed at his most secure, most secret safehouse. <i>This</i> was the bunker he went to when every other place he could hide was probably compromised. The place was completely, 100% secure... or so he believed. But, as if the night couldn't get any worse, he eventually finds the safehouse busted open and ransacked, papers and valuables spread all over the floor. Whoever had broken in was long gone by now, but they didn't seem to have taken anything, so it couldn't have been the police, nor robbers. As he tried to figure out who had infiltrated his bunker, and <i>how</i>, he noticed a strange IRC program had been left open on his laptop, with a single message from an unfamiliar user; 'DoughyDoe86'. Raising a brow, the Pint Puncher sat down and started typing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">&lt;<span class=\"cpink\">DoughyDoe86</span>&gt; bin watchin the news! looks lik ur in trouble!

Judging by the username, it wasn't hard to put two and two together. One of those damned evil animals was behind all this! He should've known from the very beginning. They couldn't defeat him mano a mano, so they tried to turn the people against him. Well, he wasn't about to stand for it! The truth would win out, in the end. He just had to clear his name... and he figured that address was the best place to start. Finding nothing else of value in the safehouse, the Pint Puncher took the skies once again, eager to meet his opponent somewhere they weren't hiding behind a computer screen. Making his way to the address, he finds he had been led to...</span></div></div>",

The outside bore white bricks with red highlights, as if forming an outline for the building. From out here, it looked to be about 6 floors high, and 6 rooms wide. The Pint Puncher double checked the address, and sure enough, this was 3184, Vixen Drive. Cautious, the hero opened the door, and walked in. The inside looked pretty standard: white walls with beige carpeting. The first thing that hit him as strange was the lack of anyone at the front desk. Instead, there was a laptop.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The address had led him to a warehouse by the sea, in a very remote part of town. A fitting place for a fight, he supposes. After he faced whatever dastardly villain was behind all this, he\u2019d be able to clear his name once and for all. Now, normally he\u2019d use his strength to breach the building from an unexpected angle, but it seemed like the place was heavily fortified and barricaded, leaving him only one choice of entry; the front door, which was hanging wide open, as if inviting him inside. It was dangerous, but it was the only way in, so the Pint Puncher slowly inched his way down the hall, his fists raised, ready for absolutely anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Click!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second he wandered into the darkened warehouse, he was suddenly blinded by a brief flash of agonizingly bright light. He had walked into a trap! He stumbled around in a panic as he rubbed his eyes, his vision clouded by a blurry blue haze that slowly faded away. When he could see again, he found himself standing on a stage on one end of the warehouse, seemingly alone. Along the floor in front of the stage was an arrow of chairs, though instead of an audience, each chair held an old CRT television pointed towards the stage. He flinched, covering his eyes as a spotlight shined onto the stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuspended above the chairs was a huge flat-screen television screen, which clicked to life on its own as the Pint Puncher stood there, baffled by his surroundings. What was this? The stage looked set up for some kind of game show. As the screen before him flickered on, it showed what looked to be a chunky doe woman, with a black t-shirt and jeans which both seemed to be a few sizes too small for her. She was huddled over a computer screen in a darkened room, her office chair creaking under her weight as she chomped down on a few potato chips while fiddling with her keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squints as she leans forward, staring into the screen as if straining to see the young man on the stage, before smiling. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOh, hey! Well, if it isn\u2019t the man himself!\u201d</b></span> She smiled, her face lighting up in excitement. The sheer size of the screen she was broadcasting from made her look like a giant. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cSorry we couldn\u2019t meet in person. I\u2019d rather not run the risk of getting punched.\u201d</b></span> She laughs. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cAnyway, allow me to introduce myself; I\u2019m Kelly, and soon, I\u2019m going to be known as the doe who defeated the evil Pint Puncher, once and for all.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</b> The hero shouted, pointing at the screen angrily, clenching his other fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe simply giggled at the Pint Puncher\u2019s childish display. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cTemper yourself. I don\u2019t know if you noticed, but I\u2019ve got the entire building rigged to blow with the push of a button,\u201d</b></span> she points out with a devious grin. The Pint Puncher\u2019s heart sinks when he looks around and notices that there were, indeed, dozens or perhaps hundreds of high explosive devices hidden around the warehouse, with wires running along the floor allowing them all to be detonated remotely. The superhero was tough, but if she set off the explosives, he would be blown to dust. He was trapped. Just as he was realizing his situation, the smaller televisions in the chairs started blinking to life. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOh! It looks like we have an audience.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humiliated hero watches in bewilderment as the televisions turn on to show what looks to be like webcam footage from people all over the city. Not only could he see <i>them</i>, they could see <i>him</i> \u2014 and they looked rather <i>angry</i>. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cWelcome, ladies and gentleman, to my very first livestream! Here with a very special guest; the Pint Puncher!\u201d</b></span> The \u2018audience\u2019 booed loudly as the hero stood there stoically, trying to keep his cool and plot out his next move. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cNow, now. I know our former hero might not be winning any popularity contests nowadays\u2026 but he can still put on a good show! With a little help, of course.\u201d</b></span> She giggled as she loudly tapped at her mechanical keyboard, apparently setting things up for the \u2018oncoming\u2019 show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, first off, by very popular request \u2014 the costume. Take it off,\u201d she said, getting some cheers from the \u2018audience\u2019. A smug grin spreads across the doe\u2019s face as the Pint Puncher freezes up, looking both horrified and confused in equal measures.<span class=\"cdorange\"><b> \u201cYou heard me. Let\u2019s see the man behind the mask.\u201d</b></span> It took some goading, but knowing what the consequences would be for disobedience, the Pint Puncher sheepishly pulled off his signature mask, revealing his true face to the \u2018audience\u2019. For a moment, he hoped that would be enough. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cI said take it <i>all</i> off\u2026 or I'm ending this stream with a <i>bang</i>.\u201d</b></span> The Pint Puncher notices her finger hovering over the detonator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmid the sadistic jeering of the crowd, the humiliated Pint Puncher slowly slipped off his spandex suit, knowing it was his only option for survival. Every inch of clothing he removed only left him feeling more and more humiliated. Despite the fact that he was technically alone in the warehouse, the fact that he was apparently being broadcast to the internet. Even if he did manage to clear his name, he wasn\u2019t sure if he would ever be willing to show his face around town again. Eventually, his suit and cape slipped to the floor at his feet, leaving him completely exposed on the stage. The doe smiled, waiting for the audience to quiet down before she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cNow, just so you know, this first stream here is a little bit \u2018premium\u2019. Maybe you recognize some of those faces,\u201d</b></span> she said, waving her arm out dramatically in front of her as if gesturing to the \u2018crowd\u2019 of television screens, each representing one of the stream\u2019s viewers. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cThese are some of the family and friends of your victims in Maplewood Park\u2026 and tonight, they\u2019ll be deciding your fate.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d</b> The Pint Puncher stood, shocked, before he realized what this was. <b>\u201cN-no!

Save it for the judge! \u2026 if you even survive that long, that is,\u201d</b></span> she laughed, before flicking a switch. Suddenly, all of the television screens turned off, except for one; showing a young woman who looked <i>pissed off</i>. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cAlright, well, it\u2019s up for our top donor to throw the first stone.

Hearing something robotic lumber into the factory, he immediately braced for a fight. What came around the corner, though, wasn\u2019t nearly what he expected. From the smooth, shiny, segmented white design, he recognized it as one of Nexxxus corp\u2019s infamous sex robots. This was unlike any of the models you\u2019ve seen in their advertisements, however. It seemed to have a tail, a snout, and the ears of a fox\u2026 and most notably, it was seven feet tall! As it stepped forward, he realized that the robot was based on one of his rivals, Felicia\u2026 and it was quite an anatomically correct representation, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cRecognize the chrome, Pint Puncher? That\u2019s Nexxxus corp standard, baby. They make fun toys for all the lonely men and women out there,\u201d</b></span> you hear the doe say over the speakers while he gazed in shock. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cI heard they were having a special promotion - making bots based on all your favorite super villains. But just looking up to the schematics, they just didn\u2019t live up to the originals.\u201d</b></span> She laughed. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cSo I thought\u2026 why not hack the shipment, take control of the bots, and make my own \u2018improvements\u2019?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew what she meant by \u2018improvements\u2019. The entire robot, besides its crotch, ass and tits, was covered in makeshift combat armor and wrapped in spikes and barbed wire. One of its hands was removed, replaced with what looks like the long barrel of a machine gun. The most notable feature, though, was the bot\u2019s glowing red eyes, which felt like they pierced his very soul. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know, it has all the latest in pleasure technology! Why don\u2019t you two get acquainted?\u201d</b></span> The doe pressed a button, and suddenly the robot turned to face the Pint Puncher, its eyes glowing brighter as it prepared to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s every move was jagged and uncanny, every part of its body twitching unnaturally as it slowly raised its gun. <span class=\"cnavy\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><b>\u201cH\u0334o\u0360w\u0335 \u0334\u0328c\u0327a\u0336\u035c\u0362n\u0337 I\u034f s\u0321er\u0334\u0362ve\u0361\u0341 \u035ey\u035fo\u0358\u031b\u0489u\u0341,\u035e \u0328\u0358m\u034f\u0341\u0338a\u0327\u0338\u035cs\u034f\u0360t\u034fe\u0334\u031b\u0358r\u0358?\u0358\u0335\u201d\u0360</b></span></span> It spouted a garbled, distorted pre-recorded line through its broken speakers. The puncher was so frozen by terror that he just barely flew out of the way when the machine opened fire! Bullets tore wildly through the walls of the warehouse, throwing up dust and debris as the pint puncher narrowly dodged the spray. The bot was capable of rotating its entire torso around to continue firing at the hero, eventually pinning him down behind a concrete beam. Amidst the gunfire, he could faintly hear the \u2018audience\u2019 cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in cover, the Pint Puncher tried to compose himself, coming up with a plan as the bullets slowly destroyed the beam he was hiding behind. Eventually, he heard the gun click off, the barrel overheating. Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, he flew at the bot, his fist raised. <b>\u201cTake <i>this</i>!\u201d</b> He said, soaring towards it and landing his fist against its torso with incredible force. <b>\u201cAgh!\u201d</b> His punch made the robot slide back a bit, but it seemed mostly unharmed. Meanwhile, the Pint Puncher was clutching his blooded fist in agony. He was used to punching organic opponents - apparently, it wasn\u2019t a good idea to try and punch something made of metal, spikes and barbed wire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cnazy\"><b>\"T\u0336\u0358\u035ch\u0362\u035c\u0335a\u0360t\u0338\u034f w\u0335as\u035d\u035f\u035fn'\u0362\u0341\u035et\u0358\u0360\u034f \u0321v\u035e\u034fe\u0338r\u0334\u0315\u035fy\u035c\u0358 \u0341\u034fn\u0328i\u0328\u0337\u0337c\u0341e\u0337\u0328.\u0341\u0489\u0358\"</b></span></span> The robot \u2018said\u2019 as it recovered from the blow. As the Pint Puncher clutched at his damaged punching hand, he looked up to see the F.E.L step forward and raise it\u2019s own fist! Before he could react, the machine\u2019s huge, metallic hand collided into his stomach, sending him flying into a nearby, concrete wall. With a groan, the Pint Puncher crumpled to the floor, beaten and humiliated in front of the entire internet. He tried to muster up the strength to fight back as he heard the robot approaching\u2026 but before he could, it bent over and lifted his naked body up by the neck. He gagged and wriggled weakly as it held him in the air, convinced it was planning on choking him. However, to his surprise, the robot instead suddenly pulled him in for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wriggled a bit as the bot pressed him against its surprisingly soft body, pressing his head between its large, pillowy breasts. He\u2019d been in similar situations with Felicia before, to his shame, so he could confirm how accurate this bot was to the real deal. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span class=\"cnavy\"><b>\"L\u0321\u0327\u031be\u0336\u0489\u0360t\u035e'\u031b\u035e\u0362s\u0358\u0337 \u031b\u0361h\u0336\u035ea\u0341\u035ev\u0340\u035c\u0321e\u0489\u0489 \u0321so\u0337m\u0360\u0322e\u0361\u034f\u0360 \u0358\u0334\u0341f\u0336u\u0361\u0315\u035dn\u035c,\u0338\u0337 \u0338\u0335\u0334m\u0338a\u034f\u0334\u0336st\u0335\u0327e\u034fr,\"</b></span></span> that distorted by feminine voice rang out once again, as it slid to its knees, placing him down on the floor before the bot.

It would be an alluring sight\u2026 if the hacked robot wasn\u2019t constantly twitching creepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cAw!

Of course, it\u2019s already far too late; in only a moment, the bot wraps its arms around him and buries his head deep between its \u2018breasts\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach was larger than his head, and compared to the solid, shiny chrome that composed the rest of the robot, its soft, perky breasts felt surprisingly life-like. His position, partially nuzzled into its cleavage, could actually be pretty comfortable if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that his airways were blocked off by titflesh. The FEL \u2018smiled\u2019 for the crowd as she held the defeated, naked superhero tightly against its body, pressing his head deep into its cleavage with the other hand. His squirms slowly became more and more frantic as he realized it wasn\u2019t going to allow him any air, much to the bemusement of the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher was starting to panic as the pillowy breasts squished tightly around his head, smothering him as his lungs screamed for air. The FEL was a marvel of engineering, however \u2014 and against its sheer mechanical efficiency, the weakened superhero was completely defenseless. His terror only worsened when he felt what remained of his strength gradually slipping away, and his thoughts becoming murky and hazy. All the while, the FEL carefully monitored his life signs, programmed to stop before doing any permanent damage; and, sure enough, just as the hero was starting to go limp, the FEL finally freed his head from between its breasts, allowing him a gasp of fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot stared at him blankly as the hero refilled his lungs, his mental capacity slowly returning to him. He eventually comes to in a daze, his mind still feeling a little foggy as he tries to register what was happening. Suddenly, he looks up at the robot\u2019s vulpine face, horror dawning in his eyes as he remembers what was happening\u2026 only for his head to be shoved deep into the vixen\u2019s cleavage once again. His torture continued like this for a while, the FEL smothering him with her breasts till he was barely conscious, before letting him get some air and starting the process all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience laughed and cheered as they watched the cruel and unusual torture unfold, fueled by a mixture of arousal and righteous indignation. After all, in their minds, the Pint Puncher was a monster who deserved anything that happened to him\u2026 that they got to watch a robotic, voluptuous vixen amazoness dominate some scrawny twink was only icing on the cake. After only three \u2018rounds\u2019 of this torture, though, and they were starting to get bored, and the doe decided it was time to move things forward. The vixen freezes suddenly as the doe types in a new command, giving the Pint Puncher some extra time to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis respite was brief, of course; the moment the doe pressed <i>Enter</i>, the Pint Puncher was dropped roughly onto the concrete floor. He lies there on his back, battered and broken, coughing as he tries to work up the energy to flee far, far away from the sadistic crowd and their murderous sex robot. Before he could, though, he notices a shadow cover him\u2026 and reluctantly opens his eyes to see the FEL\u2019s huge ass looming over his face! He screams as the FEL suddenly falls back onto him, the hundreds of pounds of mechanized vixen suddenly descending onto his face, crushing his head against the concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the Pint Puncher finds his head lodged between two enormous, plump, pillowy orbs\u2026 though this position was decidedly less comfortable than the last. The \u2018vixens\u2019 ass was so huge compared to him, simply by sitting down, his face was instantly lodged into its crack. The Pint Puncher wriggles underneath her with renewed vigor as the FEL grinds softly against his face, its cheeks jiggling as it gets \u2018comfortable\u2019. The hero couldn\u2019t decide which possibility he was more afraid of; that he might be smothered beneath it completely, or that his skull might just pop beneath its immense weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that its hands were free, and the humiliated hero was restrained by the weight of its ass, the FEL had a lot more options to \u2018entertain\u2019 the crowd. It playfully kneaded and pushed up its breasts, and idly rubbed its synthetic clit while grinding on the man struggling wildly beneath its ass, all for the \u2018entertainment\u2019 of those watching online. Every couple of minutes or so, it would stand up again, giving the hero a few seconds to breathe before it jumped up and slammed its ass back down on his head once more, putting the hero through yet another cycle of pain and relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the FEL stood a final time, turning to look down on the panting, limp former hero. A pathetic sight, indeed. The constant smothering had drained every tiny bit of energy and willpower from him, leaving the Pint Puncher feeling dazed and woozy, unable to even comprehend his surroundings. No permanent brain damage had been done or anything, but the \u2018hero\u2019 certainly wouldn\u2019t be fighting back anytime soon. The bot strutted around the stage, seemingly proud of its triumph over the man, revelling in the cheers and admiration of the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOh! Is it over?\u201d</b></span> The doe said over the speakers, turning her attention away from her other screens. Apparently, she had gotten too distracted by random youtube videos to even pay attention to the stream. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cHaha! Alright, the Pint Puncher\u2019s looking pretty out of it. Maybe y\u2019all know something that will cheer him up?\u201d</b></span> The crowd jokingly shouted out a few suggestions, most as lewd as they were lethal. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cHeh, yeah, yeah. So, user 41: Smith. What\u2019s next for our friend here?\u201d</b></span> The Pint Puncher could only lie limp as the next audience member made their decision, the robot looming ominously over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does this next user demand?</span></div></div>",

Long had he lived in peace, until he found himself pushed out of his home by lumberjacks. Any time he settled anew, they came and scared him and his herd off. When the incident hit, Tallio found himself empowered. His body changed, standing on two powerful legs and reaching fifteen feet tall. His powers manifest themselves as statue-like echoes. He is able to step away from any position, leaving an echo of himself behind. The echo cannot move and is every bit as strong and tangible as the reindeer himself. With it he holds down enemies, pins them underfoot, humiliates them or masks his movements. They vanish after a few hours or if hit with a sufficient amount of force, though nothing short of a superhero can pack enough of a punch for that to happen.<br>\r\nTallio loves to use his big feet and ass to push people to the ground before stepping away and letting the echo pin them for hours. He's also no stranger to humiliating those who displease him by rubbing his manhood against them or sticking his fingers in unsavory places and leaving an echo to hold that stance. Those truly unfortunate may even receive additional attention from other echoes, each placed carefully by Tallio to ensure no part of his victims is spared.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a quiet day so far for the Pint Puncher. He didn't get many of those anymore, and he relished the opportunity to assist here and there with menial things like catching a robber or helping out the townsfolk. Sadly his peace came to an end with a loud scream from the outskirts of town. It could be anything, but the superhero knew trouble was stirring. The kind of trouble that would need a superpowered punching to resolve. He dashed through the skies like a white streak, confident that whatever horrible event was ahead of him would be sorted easily. But on landing he didn't know what to make of the strange sight before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small group of oversized reindeer were holding several civilians pinned. Each of them trapping their victim in humiliating poses, mashing their heads against the reindeer's crotch or ass. Worse yet, a few seemed to be stuck in a scene of depraved indulgence, featuring the reindeer sticking his finger down their throat or up their rear. The hero had never seem anything like this. When he commanded the animals to release their captives they didn't even look at him. The more he stared, the more it became clear they didn't even move. Each of them was frozen in place, trapping their victims in their grasp. Only one of these statues seemed to move. In the middle of the small square a reindeer stood tall, holding a squirming man in his powerful arms. The villain stood well over twice as tall as the man, handling him with ease and squeezing out screams with every powerful flex of his bearhug. He snorted and huffed as he laid the hurt on his helpless victim. The Pint Puncher had seen enough, he needed to stop this new villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the hero could act he saw the evil reindeer glow with energy. What happened next had to be his power. The supervillain stepped away from his previous position, yet a ghostly apparition remained. The ethereal shimmer quickly crystallized into the statuesque shapes that were surrounding him. The man was now locked within that painful bearhug and the reindeer turned his attention to the Pint Puncher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, little hero. I'm Tallio and I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeary of all the villain monologues the Pint Puncher interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I get these speeches a lot so let's just skip the pleasantries. I need you to release these people and leave...\" Now it was the hero's turn to be interrupted as the reindeer loudly yelled back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave? LEAVE? All you fucking humans ever want is for me to leave! But no matter how far into the woods we go, you just show up again and tell us to leave! No! It is your turn to leave! I'll be the one occupying your lands. And with these great powers I shall make you all beg, grovel and kneel before me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep sigh the hero raised his fists, ready for the inevitable fight. Before him stood the fifteen foot tall humanoid reindeer, huffing and grunting with rage. His tall frame was well-muscled and his eyes were filled with a burning desire to wreak havoc. Confidently the Pint Puncher flew forward to attack. He might not know Tallio, but from what he'd seen so far, this should be easy.</span></div></div>",

As soon as he came within arms reach, Tallio reached out and wrapped his arms around the hero's torso before pulling him into a bearhug. The Puncher instantaneously felt like he was getting crushed on all sides. However, he wouldn't feel that for long, for Tallio leapt, still holding the hero, before spreading his arms and bodyslamming the hero. The reindeer's body completely eclipsed the hero's tiny body as he disappeared beneath him. So, with that, Tallio glowed with energy, him stood up, leaving an apparition of himself still lying on top of the hero. Then, it crystallized, and the hero felt himself still crushed under the villain's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of squirming, the hero managed to peak around one of the echo's shoulders and look up at the reindeer, who stepped into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regretting bad mouthing me now?\" Tallio said. \"Here's a fun game: you try and free yourself. If you can lift that echo off of yourself in 15 seconds, we'll continue. If you can't lift it, I'll pound you.\" The hero didn't want to know what the deer had in mind for him, so he immediately began pushing.</span></div></div>",

To his surprise the pinning statue was still able to be moved. He managed to free his arm and slide out from under the statue, but Tallio wasn't going to sit idle forever. He was counting down the seconds until he'd put another beatdown on the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five... Four... Three...\" he said, his smile slowly widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperation set in and the Pint Puncher did the one thing he still had left in his arsenal. With his free arm he punched the echo as hard as he could. The crystalline surface didn't shatter, but turned to smoke as the echo vanished into thin air. A glimmer of hope for the hero, who now knew how to free the trapped civilians. He got on his feet and taunted the reindeer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that it? What else you got?\" He hoped goading the supervillain would make Tallio reckless, allowing him to outsmart the reindeer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry your little head, I'm just warming up.\" The villain replied, his voice calm but his eyes showing the fury present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two clashed again, the Pint Puncher careful not to let Tallio grapple him so easily again. He could do without another crushing bearhug. He landed a punch in the reindeer's gut, but he barely seemed fazed by it. Another punch was deflected and the reindeer curled and arm around the hero's waist, throwing him to the ground. With quick reflexes the superhero rolled away before the large butt of the reindeer could pin him. Neither of them was giving the other an inch, exchanging heavy blows. When the next lull in the action presented itself, they backed away from eachother, breathing heavily. It was clear to Tallio that brute strength alone wouldn't bring this hero down. Thankfully he brought more to the table. Before the Pint Puncher was ready the reindeer hit him with a blow to the head. It wasn't particularly strong, but it distracted the hero long enough for Tallio to enact his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Pint Puncher looked up again his opponent had created several echoes, all in nearly identical poses, taunting him to come closer. Tallio was hiding inside one of them, he knew it. He had to look as closely as his fatigued eyes could. If he struck the wrong reindeer, he might leave himself vulnerable to a surprise attack. He couldn't afford to give his enemy such an advantage. He looks closely, then rushes forward and strikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid the Pint Puncher pick the right target?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A mighty strike connects, but the reindeer shatters and turns to smoke. The hero heard a dark chuckle behind him as the real Tallio capitalized on the moment. He has time to look over his shoulder and see his nemesis' fist approaching. Tallio lands a brutal strike, right in the Pint Puncher's face. The force of the blow knocks him clean off his feet. His world is a blur as he tries to recover, but he can't find his feet before a pair of strong arms wrap around his waist. The reindeer hoists him off the ground and begins to squeeze him in a powerful bearhug. With pressure at a maximum, Tallio bows out and lets an echo keep the hero in this position. But the villain's plan is far from complete. With not a moment to spare, the hero seeks to free himself from his prison. A solid punch to the head will do, but as he stretches his arm in preparation, a strong hand grabs it. The hero looks in horror as he sees the reindeer pulling on his arm, twisting it a little to stop him from freeing himself. He leaves an echo to keep the arm locked in that painful position before grabbing the hero's free arm and doing the same to it. With three echoes holding him down, Tallio walks up in front of the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, looks like you're in quite a bind.\" He says mockingly. The hero tries to kick him, but the reindeer simply steps back, taking hold of the flailing legs and leaving them pinned in yet another echo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his limbs bound and a distressed look on his face the Pint Puncher tries to pull himself free. But the echoes are unmovable. His strength meant nothing to them unless it was paired with a sudden impact, and as best he tried, headbutting the echo bearhugging him wasn't enough. He only ended up hurting himself as Tallio stood there, laughing loudly at his pathetic escape attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, you look ridiculous. Next, I think it's time I properly expressed just how much I hate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words he punched the Pint Puncher in the gut, making the hero wheeze and cough. Another punch followed and soon Tallio was using the hero as his punching bag, alternating heavy blows between the hero's body and head. With no way to defend himself the superhero could only endure the beating as the reindeer worked up a sweat. After a few minutes of intense one-sided sparring the reindeer stood back to appreciate his efforts. The hero's face was bruised and beneath the spandex his body probably didn't fare any better. The stoic grimace on his face was replaced by a sullen, lost look. The villain would be disappointed if that was any less than a concussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit, that felt good. Most of you pathetic humans don't last a minute in a fight.\" He laughed sadistically, thinking about all the humans he trapped in his echoes before the hero showed up. A devious smile spread across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder, what would break you more... my personal attention as I strip away that little suit of yours and get intimate... or watching me have my way with these little humans you cherish so much, knowing you can't do anything to save them.\"</span></div></div>",

His smug grin was insufferable, but the hero was both too beaten to notice and too fearful of what the reindeer was about to do to him next. In all the commotion he even managed to miss the villain's steadily rising boner. The sight of the restrained hero, bruised and weak, was turning him on like he wouldn't believe. He paced around his nemesis before walking up behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, let's rid you of some of this ghastly spandex.\" He said, placing two large hands on the hero's shoulders. Without mercy they pulled at the fabric, stretching and tearing until most of the Pint Puncher's back was exposed. Tallio pulled the ripped cloth down, freeing the superhero's butt. The cute little buns amused the reindeer, whose manhood twitched with excitement. But before he got intimate, he introduced the hero to his adventurous hands. One reached around and placed itself on the hero's mouth. The villain pulled himself close, brushing his furry chest against the hero's back. The Pint Puncher could feel the rock hard pecks of the reindeer behind him. Warm breath rushed past his neck and Tallio's large head leaned down to gloat some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be scared, I promise I'll start you off gently. I just don't want you to start screaming too soon.\" He patted the hero on his mouth before holding it closed with a firm grip. The Pint Puncher was made of stern stuff though. If he could endure a beating like the one he'd received mere minutes ago, how much worse could the reindeer throw at him? The thought barely had time to form when Tallio proved the hero wrong in on foul move. He dunked his free hand right down and took hold of the hero's buttcheek. Not satisfied with a handful of butt, the long fingers stray forward in search of a prize worthy of the reindeer's attention. In moments he found the Pint Puncher's floppy manhood. With a powerful squeeze he took hold of his new toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superhero winced as Tallio began to tease him, squeezing and rubbing the soft member. He couldn't help himself anymore, feeling his base instincts taking over and his manhood hardening. The reindeer smiled at his victim. \"See, you like it too... just let me work my magic.\" The hero tried to fight back, but his bindings were immovable. He wanted to cry out for help, no matter who would hear him. Not a sound escaped as the villain firmly kept his mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... keep struggling, you know just how to get me going...\" The hero paused. Did that disgusting animal just confess to being turned on by this. At this moment the Pint Puncher slowly looks down, his curiosity peaked by an unsettling feeling. The feeling of something smooth brushing against his inner thigh. But the reindeer didn't have any smooth surfaces down there with the exception of... oh no. Between his legs he stared at the reindeer's throbbing member, easily doubling his own in size. Horror washes over the hero in unprecedented amounts. What the hell was Tallio planning to do with that? Super endurance or not, that thing was going to hurt no matter where the villain put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jealous?\" Tallio taunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the villain proceed?</span></div></div>",

The Pint Puncher winced as he felt it twitch with built up lust, dreading what would come next. If he was lucky, the villain would just jerk off and cum on him. But Tallio had far more evil plans for his new nemesis. He softly moaned until he felt his tip reach its mark, the hero's tightly clenched asshole. He lowered his hands, taking a firm hold of the superhero's waist and pushed forward slowly and deliberately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, you're tight back there. Lemme teach you how to loosen up a little.\" The reindeer taunted between grunts and moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it seemed like his super strength also translated to a superpowered ringpiece, but Tallio's perseverance soon bought him entry. The Pint Puncher yelped as he felt the villain's manhood enter him. It looked big on the outside, but feeling it push against his intestines made the reindeer's girth feel so much bigger. His enemy was unrelenting, slowly pushing more and more of that throbbing, flared member into his ass. The hero could barely believe just how long the invading boner was as it just seemed to keep coming. There was no end in sight until he finally, mercifully felt the reindeer's waist push against his butt. The prying member felt like it was poking somewhere between his lungs, his super endurance stretching his intestines to fit the monstrous manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this feels as good for you as it does for me. I'd offer to let you return the favor, but I'm not sure you're into butt stuff that much.\" Tallio said with a savage smirk on his face. \"Your pathetic body trying to squeeze out my massive dick is like a massage to it. A really good massage I'll add. I don't even need to pump to....\" His sentence devolved into a drawn out groan as the hero felt the reindeer's hot spunk flood his intestines. Tallio didn't last long, emptying his balls in his opponent with enough vigor to make the Pint Puncher's belly swell up a little. The superhero's shocked gasping was overpowered by the reindeer's near feral grunting as he made sure to put every last drop of his climax as deep into his enemy as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Tallio withdrew, pulling his deflating member out of the hero's ass with a big smile on his face. When it popped free a small dribble of cum leaked out of his opponent's ass. Now the reindeer stood before a crossroad. He had the hero at his mercy, he could end him right here. But he kinda liked what he experienced so far. Maybe he could let him go lick his wounds. It would give him time to claim this part of town as his own and subjugate the people in here. He'd be stronger than ever before with all the human slaves he could desire. And when the Pint Puncher came back for revenge, he could humiliate him in front of everyone. The thought of letting his hated nemesis run off after all this made him ponder deeply. After carefully weighing his options, what does Tallio do?</span></div></div>",

And if your hurting asshole isn't enough motivation, allow me to give you just a small sample of what awaits should you dare return.\" The reindeer put a hand on the hero's throat and squeezed. He smiled widely as he felt the puny struggles and listened to the choked coughing and sputtering. Long before he would leave any kind of damage, Tallio releases his grasp. With a final taunt he walks away. \"Goodbye little hero, thanks for the good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed, the Pint Puncher still stuck within the unrelenting hold of the reindeer's echoes. The painful sensation of being molested by a reindeer man twice his size still lingered within him. His gut hurt from being forcefully filled with cum. He'd been on the receiving end of dirty deeds from other villains before, he knew the pain would pass. Just like the beating he took, he would have to take his lumps, fly off and recover. Going after the villain the moment he gets out was a risk not worth taking. If he failed again, there'd be no second chances. Having felt the reindeer's strength and seen his tricks, the superhero knew he'd need to be at 100%. But what about all these people? He couldn't leave them as slaves and playthings for the sadistic reindeer? If he left now, Tallio would wreak havoc on them for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he felt one of the echoes get unstable and turn to smoke. He rushed the process, pulling his arm free and swinging it at the other echoes. They too shattered with ease. The exhausted hero fell to the ground and crawled up on his feet. His legs were still a little shaky and hurting all over from the beating he'd received earlier today. Does he take the risk and pursue Tallio immediately or does he slink away to lick his wounds?</span></div></div>",

Then tallio set down on the ground spreading his legs and created another echo. The pit puncher thought he it\u2019s a trap and watched him. The last position of the deers echo was him lying on the ground with his back and had both oh his feet\u2019s stretched up to the air, which kinda looked like a yoga practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then the deer finally moved to the pit punchers direction and reached out for a punch.

In that point he was happy No one was here, watching the humiliating deer destroying him. Tallio then started to squeeze the kids balls with the other hand, making him moan louder.

He tightened his bearhug before finally releasing his victim, all but throwing him at the echo. The superhero slammed into the unmoving echo and lay draped over its head. Before he could move another muscle Tallio was already upon him again, dragging him into position between the echo and his own muscular chest. He wrapped his arms around both and resumed his mighty squeeze. Where it was just two arms crushing him, now he was flattened between two muscular bodies, one bristling with angry determination and the other rigid and unfeeling. He screamed in pain, but this only spurred the reindeer on further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! You like that, don't ya?!\" He growled excitedly, straining himself further. \"I'm gonna squash you flat.\" The superhero offered nothing more that groaning and whimpering as he didn't have the air to scream anymore. Tallio was unrelenting, squeezing the hero flatter and flatter between his broad chest and that of the echo. When he finally stepped back the Pint Puncher flopped onto the floor like a wet rag. When he looked up at the reindeer he was faced with the disgusting sight of Tallio's throbbing boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember him, right? He had so much fun violating you last time. Better get ready, but he's going for another round, and this time...\" The reindeer exhaled deeply, stepping away from the freshly formed echo. \"...he's going in both ends.\" The echo stood proudly, his turgid rod pointing straight out, waiting for the hero's touch. \"But who should pound that cute little butt of yours? The echo, or the original?\" He pondered out loud. \"What do you think? Should I give you a chance to taste what a real man feels like?

Tallio poked and prodded the hero's rear with the echo's erection, tormenting him with the inevitability of what's to come. In spite of his best efforts to brace himself the superhero still gasps with shock as the reindeer dick enters his butt. Tallio slowly slides the hero further towards the echo, that cute little butt devouring the echo's rigid length. The pathetic whimpering was roundly ignored, even when it grew into pained screaming near the end. Only when the entirety of the echo's member had been shoved inside did the reindeer relent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go. Does it bring back pleasant memories?\" Tallio's voice was dripping with malice and his own cock couldn't get more rigid. He let go of the hero, leaving him impaled on the echo whilst getting into position himself. He took hold of the Pint Puncher's arms and held him up, leaving him to stare right at the reindeer's throbbing boner. He thrust it forward, prodding the hero with his rigid length and even poking him in the eye once by accident. But even beaten and weary the superhero refused to let it anywhere near his mouth. He turned his head away every time until Tallio finally had enough of playing around with his prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open up.\" He said slowly and threateningly. Unsurprisingly the hero refused, prompting the reindeer to start twisting the hero's arms. It didn't take long to push them to their limits and as Tallio's overwhelming strength applied more pressure the hero couldn't help but cry out in agony. His screams were silenced as quickly as they started. The reindeer didn't hesitate for an instant and thrust himself forward, his member finding its mark and sliding itself into the Pint Puncher's open mouth. The only noise still coming from the superhero is suppressed gagging as the reindeer simply moves forward, forcing the rest of his manhood in. The hero's mouth was quickly filled and his throat was stretched out to meet the demands of the girthy invader. Super endurance would see him uninjured, but it could do much to help him breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the stuff. Choke on my dick, you worthless little hero.

His only hope of surviving this was for Tallio to blow his load before he lost consciousness. In a desperate attempt to speed up the process, the hero began to moan, the walls of his throat vibrating around the reindeer's girthy cock. Tallio gasped slightly, his typically menacing visage breaking for a moment he looked down at the hero in surprise. He was stunned to see the hero's head struggling to bob back and forth along his shaft, not in an attempt to free himself, but to please his tormentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sight of his foe desperately trying to pleasure him sent shivers down Tallio's spine. Had his brutal beat down and subsequent anal violation left the hero broken and submissive? Perhaps he had finally come to see things as they were, that someone as powerful as Tallio were meant to be worshiped and obeyed. He pushed the thought out of his head for the time being as he allowed the beaten hero work his meat. Feeling particular generous, he decided to give him a little assistance as he grabbed onto the back of the Pint Puncher's head and gradually pulled his hips back, his massive length easing out of the hero's throat until all that remained was the tip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n For a fleeting moment, a sliver of hope revealed itself to the Pint Puncher, a hope that even someone as wicked as Tallio could had it in his heart for mercy, but that hope dashed as the cruel reindeer thrusted his hips at full force, his powerful cock once again stretching out the walls of his throat as it struggled to contain it. In and out it went, the hero's face getting utterly battered by Tallio's musky crotch ever time he hilted himself. If there was any consolation to this, it was he was granted a brief millisecond of air before his windpipe was once again clogged by what felt like two solid feet of fat reindeer dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God... you might be a pathetic little weakling but you have a real talent for this. Maybe this was your true calling, huh?\" Tallio snicked as he gave a condescending pat onto the poor hero's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher paid his taunting no mind as he was more concerned with trying to stay conscious The brief moments he got to breath weren't nearly enough to sustain him. His lungs were on fire and his eyes began to water as the Tallio decimated his gag reflex. Just when everything began to grew dark, he felt Tallio's already massive cock swell up considerably in his throat mid-thrust. The reindeer let out a loud cry as he hilted himself one final time, unleashing a torrent of piping hot cum down the hero's throat. Enduring Tallio's orgasm was an endurance in and of itself for the Pint Puncher as his stomach nearly tripled in size from the sheer volume of spunk deposited into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eventually, Tallio pulled his spent cock out of the violated hero's mouth with an audible '<i><b>pop</b></i>. The Pint Puncher coughed and sputtered, the taste of his meat still lingering on his tongue as he took in greedy gulps of air. He wasn't quite off the hook yet, as Tallio grabbed the back of his head and whipped away the saliva off his flaccid manhood using the bound hero's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit, I'm surprised. You actually did something worthwhile for once in your miserable little life\" he said with a snicker.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact...\" he began placing a hand on his chin as the gear began turning in his mind. \"You did so well that...\"</span></div></div>",

The Pint Puncher fell on the ground, still shivering from the brutal torment he just endured. He barely reacted when Tallio put his arms around the hero's waist and hoisted him up. With the beaten man thrown over his shoulder the reindeer looked around. This neighborhood was mostly houses and a few shops, but nearby was a small apartment complex, about four stories tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building's roof door flew off its hinges as the supervillain kicked it open. His brute strength had made light work of all barriers in the apartment complex and now Tallio stood on the roof, overlooking the large expanse of houses around him. He'd deal with the rest of the city later, for now it was time to claim this part of Glam City as his own. He dropped the hero on the floor beside him and laughed maniacally. All the people within earshot looked up at the strange creature. He saw the fear in their eyes grow as he grabbed the Pint Puncher by his throat and held him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was this the mighty superhero you hoped would stop me?! Well, take another close look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wrapped his victim in a tight bearhug and began to squeeze harder than ever before. Angrily he whispered to the beaten hero. \"Scream, you little bitch.\" The painfully tight grip on the hero's body soon began to pay off as he cried out in agony. This only drove Tallio to up the pressure. The sound of his nemesis in pain was almost as intoxicating as the terror in the eyes of all the onlookers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see them all, down there? I'm going to violate every last one of them. Their strength shall become my own and with it I will take over the rest of this vile city. All will bow before me or scream like you are as I make an example out of them too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero could only pray for this to be over soon. Hopefully the villain would tire of playing with him before it was too late. He regretted not recovering after his first defeat and flying straight back in. His overconfidence had led to this and now he might have to pay the ultimate price. His breath ran ragged in the reindeer's crushing grip, the muscular arms loosening and almost threatening to drop the Pint Puncher off the roof. But that wasn't what Tallio had in mind. He stepped back, letting an echo hold on to the hero. It gave him a moment to think about his next step. So many delightful options and so little time...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Tallio was in no hurry to act as he considered his next choice of action. He had all but broken the hero, both mentally and physically, so all that was left for him to do was dispose of him. That said, the thought of simply snuffing him out seemed a bit too anti-climatic for his liking. He needed to do something special, something that'd forever cement his dominance over him and the rest of the city folk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon enough, a lightbulb went off in his head and a sinister grin spread along his face as he peered down at the Pint Puncher's exposed rear. What better way to demonstrate his superiority over the citizens of Glam City than to violate their greatest champion right before their eyes? That thought alone was more than enough coax his manhood out of its sheath. He grinned and stood across from the bound hero, the tip of his monstrous cock dragging along the crack Pint Puncher's ass. The Pint Puncher could only whimper at the familiar sensation as his sphincter clinched out of instinct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please... not... not again..\" he wheezed as he looked back at his tormentor with a look of weary resignation. By that point he couldn't even find it in himself to feel fear at his predicament. He knew that Tallio would have his way no matter how much he begged and pleaded, but he was still obliged to at the very least vocalize his displeasure. His words only succeeded in amusing the villain as he began sawing his ridged length up and down his rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't pretend like you don't actually enjoy this. You had every chance to run away and never look back, but you immediately came looking for me\" Tallio snickered before he pulled his hips back, aligning his fully erect cock against the hero's pucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be glad that I let you suck me off beforehand\" he hissed as he plunged himself deep inside the hero, burying his meat all the way to the base in one smooth motion. At first the Pint Puncher wasn't sure what he meant but it all made sense as he felt the familiar warmth of the villain's thick cock entering his body all at once. The agony he'd experienced the first time around was significantly lessened, no doubt the result of him foolishly rushing in and not giving his anus enough time to recuperate. Tallio frowned as the hero's insides yielded to his powerful length almost immediately, the pleasant squeezing that he had previously enjoyed not quite measuring up that time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems as though your body's starting to get used to me. It wouldn't surprise me if your ass was molded to hold my dick specifically. It certainly feels like it is\" he said with a smirk as his placed his hands on the hero's hips. The Pint Puncher didn't so much as blink at Tallio's constant taunting. He was mentally spent and all he wanted was for the sinister reindeer to have his fun and be done with him. All he had to do was endure, just a little bit longer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him, it wouldn't be that easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He felt Tallio's massive length slide gradually slide out of his body and for a moment he wondered if his lack of a response had deterred his tormentor. That thought was quickly quashed as Tallio's cock came shooting back inside him at a frightening speed, forcing a loud yelp out of him. Before he could even grasp what was happening, Tallio reared back and repeated the process several times, his muscular hips slamming into the hero's ass with each violent thrust. The pain he had previously felt had returned in full force as his insides were absolutely brutalized by the villainous anthro's bestial erection, the outline of which showed in his stomach every time he hilted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-damn...\" Tallio grunted. \"I've claimed a lot of humans today, but you're the best I've had, bar none...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher didn't even hear him as he was more focused trying to keep his wits about him. With every thrust he could feel his insides becoming more and more situated with the invading appendage and the white hot pain was slowly becoming a dull numbness as Tallio continued to mercilessly pound his ass. What's worse was the other effect that this treatment was having on him. For whatever reason the hero's own manhood was rock hard and threatening to blow at any moment. Perhaps this was his body's way of cooping with the trauma or maybe the previous beating had thrown his body chemistry out of wack somehow. Regardless, it only served to intensify the hero's torment as his face burned bright with shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n By then the crowd of citizens beneath them had more than tripled in size as they all stopped to watch the debached display. Tallio could feel their eyes on him and smiled as glanced down at them from the corner of his eye. They stared on in horror and revulsion as he ruthlessly fucked their greatest champion into submission, more than a few of them shedding tears as they realized that the same fate would soon befall them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, keep on watching! Don't any of you dare look away!\" Tallio shouted, his voice almost cracking at the euphoric high he got off of his demonstration of power. \"Your 'hero' has been reduced to being my personal plaything, and the same will happen to the rest of you should you choose to disobey me!\" He cackled as he bottomed out, forcing another cry out of the Pint Puncher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was so obsessed with taunting the people beneath him that he completely missed the moment when the Pint Puncher climaxed. His senses where completely thrown into disarray and his body went limo in the echo's grasp as his cum stained its stomach. Once it ended, numerous emotions entered his mind, the most prominent one being shame. Even if he somehow by some miracle managed to turn the tide in, there was no way he could ever this humiliation down. He was also incredibly fearful at the thought of Tallio taking notice. He couldn't even imagine what the cruel anthro would do to him should that happen...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whenever the pain began to numb for the hero, Tallio seemed able to push his throbbing cock in deeper, earning another shocked gasp. The Pint Puncher was reduced to whimpering, no longer having the strength to plead for mercy. All he could do was hang on and hope the reindeer would finally have had enough of tormenting him after his climax. The supervillain didn't leave his nemesis waiting for long. Heat began to build up in his groin and radiate out along his shaft. It felt white hot to the reindeer, who thrusted himself back and forth with great ferocity. Finally he slammed himself in as deep as he could physically manage, his hips colliding with the hero's but as the villain's cream was shot right into the hero's depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uncomfortable warmth spilling into his body made the Pint Puncher wince, but his nightmare was about to go up a notch. Alongside his head the reindeer leaned in to taunt him, but Tallio looked down to see the hero's own erection, steadily going flaccid. His teasing smile turned to a bitter scowl and he angrily whispered in the hero's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came... You didn't just come from my pounding, you came before me... You insolent little bastard. You stole my thunder for all to see.\" He laughed darkly. \"Hoho, this needs punishment of the most merciless kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the reindeer's dick still buried deep in his ass the hero had no way to fight back as two strong hands wrapped around his neck. Tallio began to wrench them shut, but stopped long before putting the hero in mortal peril. Instead he stepped back, letting an echo hold the superhero in this most unfortunate position. The strange touch of the echo's shaft penetrating him was offset only by the grim laughter coming from the reindeer. Tears welled up in the restrained hero's eyes. The hands holding his neck forced him to look down on the crowd. Their fear and disbelief burned brighter and more painfully than anything the reindeer could do. He had failed those people, and Tallio was about to take full advantage of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villain casually hopped off the roof, landing on the pavement in front of the apartment complex. He stood tall, looking over the fearful masses with glee. Many of them were still looking up at the hero. Once he cleared his throat all eyes turned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that your hero isn't in any state to save you, I suggest you submit to me. I don't need much from you, just power. None of you have all that much, so it should be easy enough to harvest. All you need to do is kiss my dick. Or, if you want to try fighting or running, you can get the same experience as your little hero.\" The reindeer pointed up at his haggard looking toy. \"That's what happens to people with super endurance. Imagine what I'll do to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearful whispers rummaged through the masses of civilians. Did they have a choice? Could they just let this villain get away with this? Tallio's manhood grew rock hard again hearing their terrified chatter. Those closest to him could smell the foul musk emanating from the reindeer and as he confidently strode up they'd be first to endure this humiliation. He stood before them, not uttering a word and staring at them, then his cock. The largest of the citizens, a brutish looking gym enthusiast, spat at the supervillain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way bro, I'm not touching your dick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have it your way, 'bro'\" The reindeer replied with the broadest cruel smirk. He leapt forward and grabbed the man in his arms, squeezing mightily. Just a few seconds of this overwhelming bearhug had crushed the air from his lungs and left him on the brink of unconsciousness. But he shot right back to crystal clarity when he felt the reindeer's strong hand tear away his pants and underwear. Tallio did not make idle threats and steadily buried his throbbing manhood into the shrieking citizen. The panicked wiggling was so stimulating the reindeer hit another climax before he even got halfway in. Like a used rag he dropped his crying victim on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone else want a ride on this dick? Or are you going to be good boys and girls and just give it a little kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher fought back more tears as he watched the gruesome display. The unmoving echo dick in his ass still sending plenty of pain through his own system. He was helpless to stop Tallio as he watched the fearful masses crowd in on him to pay their foul tribute. Once the first few had put their shaking lips on the warm shaft others followed more readily. He had to act, to do something to stop this. But the hands wrapped around his neck barely afforded him the air needed to stay awake. He could only watch as the reindeer's evil plan took effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTallio bristled with pride as he felt the power he longed for coursing through his body. Slowly he started to grow. Each citizen submitting to him granted only a minute amount of power, maybe an extra millimeter in height. But now that they were kissing his shaft by the dozens he felt the effects far more readily. After a few minutes they no longer had to bow down to reach his shaft, as it was now at eye level. The reindeer towered over them, easily twice as tall as even the biggest members of the crowd. The beast's horrid musk got more potent as well, making anyone near him cringe with disgust. He kept a close eye on the people around him, directing anyone he suspected of skipping out on their subjugation to give his manhood another kiss. But as intoxicating as consuming their power was, the supervillain had to accept these people had no more left to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to test his new strength, he pushed the crowded masses aside and tried jumping up to the roof where the Pint Puncher was watching. The empowered villain easily cleared the jump, but on landing he crashed right through the roof, smashing the floors beneath his weight and collapsing the whole building. Standing amidst the rubble the reindeer was surprised, but his shock soon made place for pride. None were stronger now, especially not the puny hero. The collapse had shattered Tallio's old echo, but the hero was too weak to do anything. The supervillain smiled cruelly, reaching down and picking up the superhero. His hand encompassed most of the hero's torso and squeezing it ever so gently made his nemesis cry out in pain. The Pint Puncher had been reduced to such a frail little thing. Tallio had finally grown tired of this brat. It was time to finish this.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Tallio daggled the hero's limp body in front of his face, a pleased smile on his face as he examined his handiwork. The Pint Puncher had been so poised and confident when they first met, no doubt expecting his foe to be another easily dispensed thug. Yet there he was now barely an day later, broken in both body and spirit, his stomach utterly swollen with gallons of reindeer spunk. The fire that once burned bright in his eyes was no where to be seen and in its place was a look of sorrow and deep-seated self-loathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to take a swing at me at any time, little man\" the villain taunted. \"Come on 'hero', try and take me down. I bet if you really dig down deep, you can find a way to turn the tables!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n His smug grin waned slightly as the Pint Puncher remained silent. At first Tallio assumed that he was just being stubborn, but there wasn't even a hint of malice or anger in his victim's expression. He just hung there, too weary to struggle, to damaged to resist the whims of his aggressor. The hero's lack of activity thoroughly irritated Tallio, as he hoped to wring out just a bit more fun out of his toy before he disposed of him. He wanted to squeeze the brat in his massive fist and demand that he at the very least offer a token effort to fight against him, but he had a feeling that nothing would come it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was then that he decided to do a little test. He lowered the broken hero down to his waist where the familiar sight of the villain's titanic manhood greeted him. He expected the Pint Puncher to start squirming in his grasp, desperate to free himself from any more potential harm, but that didn't happen. Instead the once fearless hero continued to hang limp, regarding the sight of Tallio's monolithic member with complete apathy. The reindeer wouldn't be denied his entertainment however, as he brought his captive close to his musky crotch, effectively using his diminutive body as a washrag as he rubbed him up and down the smooth surface of his length. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n For the Pint Puncher, this was horrid treatment was nothing. Tallio had already violated him three times in less than an day, the last of which was done in front of a captive audience of people. There was nothing the cruel reindeer could do to break him further. Even as his naked body was coated in Tallio's intense musk, he couldn't bring himself to feel anything other than indifference. His self-esteem was so utterly destroyed that he didn't so much as blink when he felt his own member gradually spring to life again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" Tallio huffed as he spotted the hero's erection. \"How pathetic are you? You're actually turned on from me using you as my plaything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that he unceremoniously tossed the Pint Puncher aside, a look of disgust on his face as he turned his back to him. As good as it felt to use his body as his personal cumdump. he had no further use for a the hero. Part of the fun was watching the hero try and fail to fight back, so seeing him tacitly accepting his new role was a major turn off for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm done here. As much fun as you are to abuse, I've got a whole city to subjegate. Feel free to come around at any time though. If you're really good, I might let you have fun with me again\" he said with a smirk, his cock twitching at the thought of having the hero's puny body wrapped around it again. He was about to walk away when he got another idea. Turning back, he planted a foot on the hero's chest and forcing the air out of his already spent lungs before he stepped away, leaving an echo there to keep him pinned to the ground. He then stepped in front of the hero and crouched down, letting his massive shaft linger mere inches away from the hero's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little something to remember me by\" he chuckled as stood back to his full height. once again leaving an echo behind as he walked away from the hero. The villain paused for a moment and looked out the crowd of civilians who where looking at their once unbeatable champion with sadness and disgust. He whistled to get their attention before nodding his neck in the direction of the city. He didn't need to give them any further instruction as they followed him from behind, fearful of inciting his wrath. Even the massive gym enthusiast was quick to obey as he waddled his way up to the group, his ass still thoroughly stretched out and aching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher in the meanwhile was still in a daze as Tallio's oppressive musk seemed to seemed to completely grab hold of his senses. He would receive no respite from the stench this time, as the echo's shaft perpetually hovered near his face. The last time Tallio had left him at the mercy of his echoes, it took hours for them to fade away. Given his recent increase in power, there was a good chance that they would be able to last even longer. That prospect alone was enough to bring the hero out of his funk just a little bit as he couldn't imagine having breath in Tallio's musk for that long without going mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking past that dilemma, he was still pondering his next course of action once he was finally free. Given the discrepancy in their strength, he couldn't deny that Tallio had let him off easy. He had managed to him decimate before, so Puncher couldn't even fathom the damage he would case to him in his powered up state. Still, it didn't feel right to let the villain enslave the city he'd sworn to protect. Even if they saw him as a failure and a weakling, he couldn't let that stop him from fulfilling his role as their protector. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He labored over his decision for some time, fluctuating between his newfound fear of Tallio and his desire for redemption. Every time he became to psych himself back up, his subconscious brought his mind to the towering pillar of meat in front of him and his mind would be flooded with images of his body getting stretched far beyond its limits. What was even worse was how his body reacted so such thoughts, as his manhood throbbed with need. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hours went by and eventually the Pint Puncher reached a decision...</span></div></div>",

But as his super endurance patched him up he began to feel something boiling deep within that he hadn't felt for a long time. A righteous anger of such seething intensity he couldn't lie still any longer. He cracked his knuckles and swung at the echo's looming manhood, striking it with enough force to shatter the echo. The Pint Puncher stood up, breathing heavily and feeling amped up. He couldn't stop, now more than ever. He refused to let this reindeer beat him. No matter the odds, he was the hero of Glam City and he would defend this city from all villains, no matter the cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first, he dashed into a nearby building and locked himself in a toilet. Minutes later he raced back out towards the supervillain, his belly emptied of all the horrid reindeer's seed. He was going to deliver mighty vengeance for every humiliation he suffered. Tallio was in for a punching that would enter into the city's legends. By the time the superhero was done with him the reindeer would beg to be taken to jail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut rage alone would not be enough. The hero knew Tallio was now stronger than ever before. He needed something to tilt the odds in his favor. Perhaps the very thing that got him into this situation could now help him. The reindeer's insults stung, but one stuck out more than others. It was in no small part the Pint Puncher's arrogance that made him underestimate the reindeer. Tallio and his echoes had abused that to its fullest extent. But standing tall and empowered might lead him to the very same downfall. Hopefully the supervillain would be off guard, believing the Pint Puncher to have been dealt with. That might provide the window needed for a surprise attack. A powerful knockout blow could decide the fight before it even started. The superhero prayed to whoever listened that things would be so fortunate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't hard to follow the trail of devastation left behind. Houses, suddenly abandoned as the supervillain had demanded tribute and obedience, adding the people to his horde of followers. Hopefully he hadn't forced too many of them to submit their power or Tallio might well become unbeatable. No. Nothing would be unbeatable today. The Pint Puncher would show everyone that there was nobody that could defeat him. Or he would die trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a few more streets he spotted his nemesis. Tallio was standing tall, holding a pose whilst people took pictures. He had his eyes closed and was basking in the attention. A more perfect opportunity would not present itself. The Pint Puncher accelerated to full speed and with two outstretched fists aimed straight at the villain's face he was about to make his heroic entry. Some might consider it a cheap shot, but after everything the reindeer put him through the hero felt no regrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole crowd gasps in unison as the superhero shoots in and clocks the reindeer straight in the face with a punch so mighty the shockwave shattered nearby windows and brought the onlookers down on all fours.</span></div></div>",

Having demolished Glam City's greatest hero, the citizens were quick to bend to his will as he trekked through the city adding to his already sizable following. He had grown a great deal from their continued worship, nearly doubling in size since he'd last dealt with the Pint Puncher. After all he had done to the hero, Tallio thought that he would either cut his losses and go into self-imposed exile, or he'd be so psychologically damaged that he'd come back literally begging to be the reindeer's slave. So confident in his victory was Tallio that he didn't at all expect to be sent flying from what had to be the hardest blow he had ever recieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The attack was not only powerful enough to take the villain off his feet, but held more than enough force to send him careening through a nearby office building, For a few minutes, all Tallio could see was stars as he clenched his aching jaw. Did Glam City have some kind of superweapon that he didn't know about? With all the power he'd accumulated, he couldn't imagine what else could've been responsible for causing him such pain. As the dust cleared he expected to see a tank or perhaps some kind of organised militia, but instead he was greeted by the familiar sight of the Pint Puncher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" the reindeer grumbled as he dug himself out of the rubble and staggered to his feet. His anger waned upon looking at the Pint Puncher's face and seeing the white hot fury that laid beneath his gaze. Tallio could practically feel the bloodlust oozing out of every pour on the hero's body as he simply hovered in place with his arms folded and for what must've been the first time in his life, Tallio felt uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a lot of nerve showing your ugly mug around these parts. Especially after I exposed you for the pitiful little nothing that you really are\" he sneered before gesturing over to his enslaved followers. \"See all those people? They didn't even hesitate when I offered them the chance to surrender their energy to me. Word spreads fast in Glam City, and when they heard about our little scuffle, they were more than willing to turn their backs on you. And you want to know why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tallio leaned in and narrowed his eyes, malice dripping off of every word he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. Are. <i>Weak</i>. This city doesn't need a defender that's just going to beg and plead for mercy when things stop going his way in a fight. But by all means, if you want to disappoint them even more, feel free to stick around. As nice as it feels having a whole gaggle of sluts on their knees worshiping my dick, none of them can measure up to you. Your heroics are laughable but you can work my meat like nobody's business\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That was all the Pint Puncher could take. Enduring Tallio's taunts was bad enough but him dredging up the memories of his humiliating defeat pushed him over the line as he let loose a mighty roar and charged onward. This sudden outburst caught Tallio off guard, leaving him no time to prepare as the hero's fist collided with his chest. The diminutive hero fought like a man possess as he landed blow after blow, the intensity of his attacks sending shockwaves through the city streets. Tallio gritted his teeth and swung blindly at his attacker, desperately trying to get a grip on him and cease this assault, though each attempt either resulted in the hero dodging his hands or simply batting them away with his superhuman strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Off in the distance, the citizens of Glam City watched the battle in awe and admiration. Several of them bore witness to their hero's brutal defeat and to see him getting the better of Tallio was more than enough to renew their trust in their hero. Some called out words of encouragement, cheering on their valiant champion as he fought and from their it quickly blossomed into uproarious praise and support for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Such an enthusiastic display did not go unnoticed by the Pint Puncher as...</span></div></div>",

You're still as weak as ever and when it comes to being big I've got the upper hand.\" The supervillain stands grand, proudly showing off his towering new height. \"And if you think such weak illusions will hold me back, you haven't been paying attention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTallio stepped forward, leaving an echo behind like a statue for his worshippers to admire. The villain barely even noticed or cared that he'd stepped on a handful of his worshippers that were too slow to get out of the way. The hero tried to charge again, but this time the reindeer sidestepped him, leaving an echo for the Pint Puncher to collide with. Having fought the dastardly reindeer before the superhero started to get wise to his tricks, avoiding the impact and soaring around the echo for another attack. Like an angry mosquito clad in tattered spandex he whizzed around Tallio's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still you little pest! What are you going to do?! Annoy me into submission?!\" The villain yelled, increasingly frustrated. He flailed around wildly, occasionally smacking a building and taking a large chunk out of it if not reducing it to rubble completely. Though the hero struck true over and over again the reindeer had a point. None of his blows seemed to leave any lasting damage. Whether it was the hero's doubts or just blind luck will remain a mystery, but out of the blue one of Tallio's wild swings connects. The hero is quick to recover, but he knows he's on his last legs. With far too little time to recover he feels his muscles ache. No amount of cheering could overcome the fact he's running on fumes after fighting the evil reindeer two times already today. Another big hit like that and he might not be able to get back up before the villain is upon him. And if Tallio managed to grab him it'd be game over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing else for it. He had to give it every last scrap of power he had. A shattering blow that would end this fight here and now. A knockout punch so hard even the reindeer's thick skull wouldn't be able to protect him. The Pint Puncher let out a mighty warcry so loud all nearby windows rattled. Tallio was taken aback by this display of power, but he could see the beads of sweat on the hero's forehead. This was his desperate last hurrah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it, you pathetic excuse for a hero!\" The villain roared. He loosened his arms and prepared a mighty swing himself. If that obnoxious brat thought he could go toe to toe with him he was going to prove the hero dead wrong. He had grown tall enough that his fists were bigger than the hero's whole body. He thought for an instant about all the other parts of him that were now bigger than the hero's whole body, but those musings would have to wait until after he'd secured his victory here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher shot towards the reindeer in an explosion of sheer force, blowing all nearby windows to splinters. Tallio leaned back and threw a mighty punch himself, aiming to meet the superhero's outstretched fist. The reindeer would prove that even with all the yelling in the world the hero was still nothing. Nobody that saw the spectacle dared to even breathe, watching these two forces of nature collide.</span></div></div>",

These villainesses met up with one goal: to defeat the Pint Puncher and claim him as their own slave. The members are as follows:<br>\r\n-Paula, \"The Warden\" - The infamous warden of the gang, Paula comes with her normal attire, usual black fur and black latex suit, as well as cherry red lipstick. Her gang gave her more rubber that she can manipulate, with which she typically uses to trap her victims in jails made of rubber. One of her favorite techniques is to trap a target within her latex suit and excite them until they can now longer stand.<br>\r\n-Clement, \"The Inquisitor\" - The infamously smelly villainess, she's known as the gang's go-to if they wish to torture some poor fool. When The Lipstick Stars aren't dominating their prey in wrestling or milking them for all they're worth, she hits them with stench after stench. Some say they don't even always use her to extract information. They say that they just use her because they like seeing their victims squirm. In addition to her usual appearance, she boasts shiny green lipstick.<br>\r\n-Lydia, \"The Executioner\" - The infamous lady with the bottomless gut, she's the one the gang primarily uses to get rid of toys they're no loner interested in. In combat, she usually squeezes prey until they can't breath, or uses her poisonous gases to leave them vulnerable to the other Lipstick Stars' devices. Ultimately, she is the final destination for all of the Lipstick Stars' toys. In the end, she always devours the toys, whether they disobey them, or whether they're just sick of them, she's ready to devour anything that can fill up her gut.<br>\r\n-Celica, \"The Leader\" - And the villainess responsible for organizing the gang. She hasn't been talked about before, though that's because she's been saving her power for just the right moment. Celica is a black tiger dressed in what the Pint Puncher would describe as a shadow-y version of his own suit. She bears black fur and even blacker stripes, hips twice the length of the hero's shoulder span, 13 feet in height, giant breasts, and dark blue lipstick. She boasts the horrible power to suck someone's power out of their body and into her's with a mere kiss. She wishes to plant a kiss on the hero and suck his super strength and flight out before taking those powers for herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rowland flew back from the force of a powerful strike. He landed on his feet, skidding back, arms up in a guarding stance. He was in some abandoned warehouse. He had no idea how he got here, but all he knew was that some guy in the shadows was trying to beat him up. He emitted a flame to try and see the source of his attacker, and saw a surprising sight. He thought he saw the Pint Puncher's outfit, though it seemed much larger than normal. He also noticed that the suit was a lot blacker than usual, and he could tell that wasn't just the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Rowland asked confused. He looked up at the attacker's face, and saw a feline head atop a torso sporting a massive rack. He got to know a lot of villains, but he never saw anyone like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me your superior,\" the figure responded. \"You may not realize it yet, but in just a few short moments, you'll be outdated.\" Rowland grit his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you honestly think someone like me can be replaced?\" Rowland shot back. Then, he began charging towards the figure. However, a snake-like figure in the dark smacked against his stomach, throwing him away from the mysterious figure. Rowland suddenly felt himself in the clutches of some rubbery substance. He felt his wrists pinned down to his sides, and he felt his legs lifted above the ground. He strained against the bindings while the lady in the evil Pint Puncher outfit approached. As she got closer, Rowland began to notice more and more about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like a black tiger, boasting incredible hips and a bust, as well as lips painted with dark blue lipstick. \"I'm Celica, and I'm about to rock this world.\" Suddenly, she kissed Rowland on the lips. She held her kiss for 3 seconds before pulling away. Rowland began feeling funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you do to me?\" Rowland asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took your powers,\" Celica answered. \"Every. Bit. Of it.\" Rowland's eyes shot open in fear. He struggled against the restraints of the rubber, but he felt himself losing his amazing body. His opposable thumbs faded, his limbs shrank back to normal form, and his muscles faded. Before long, Rowland was reduced to a normal tiger. Celica then snapped her fingers, producing a tiny flame. \"Felicia's elastic body, Olivia's invisibility, and now Rowland's pyrokinesis. I think we're ready to take the city, girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher heard reports of villains suddenly disappearing. Under normal circumstances, this'd be good news. But the missing villains were in the middle of mischief when they suddenly vanished. Felicia was reeking havoc downtown one moment, then disappeared. Olivia was groping unfortunate individuals while invisible one moment, and then she disappeared the next. Now Roland disappeared. And he was always late to these fights. The villains would disappear before he had the chance to get involved. He knew either they were planning something, or something far more dangerous is afoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard tells of a smelly villain using their power to manipulate wind to send their stench all over downtown. He knew he had to get to this villainess, fast. Or else risk having the one behind these attacks disappear before he could find out what they could possibly be planning. He flew to the source, and wound up on one roof. He saw a certain black-and-white skunk lady facing away from him. However, this skunk lady was now wearing green-spandex instead of her usual attire. When the villainess turned around, he also spied her lips painted green with lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the meaning of this?\" the Pint Puncher wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, looks like you fell for it hook-line and sinker!\" Clement declared. She clapped her hands, and the Pint Puncher heard movement around him. Behind him, to his right, he saw Lydia, except she wore a purple bathing suit and purple lipstick. Behind him to his left, he saw Paula, except instead of her normal latex suit, she wore cherry red latex along with cherry red lipstick. Then, he heard a chuckling nearby. He scanned around, curious, when suddenly, a figure faded in from out of nowhere, as if they were just invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been waiting for this moment,\" the figure stated. The hero was confused. He never saw this villain before. She was a black tiger, wearing dark blue lipstick. But the most striking feature of her was her tight spandex, which looked like some sort of perversion of his own suit. It was like some evil version of his own suit. \"Like the get up? You've been a big inspiration for me~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who-who are you? And why are you wearing that?\" the Pint Puncher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this? This is just the suit of the heart of the city. Once I'm done with you, I'll make sure to brandish the memory of the fallen hero to the town all the time. Once someone sees me, they'll see the person that finished the Pint Puncher once and for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know your name,\" the Pint Puncher argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's because I wasn't ready to reveal it too soon. But I've done some training, and I think I can afford some exposure. First though, I need to beat you here.\" The black tiger went invisible again, and suddenly reappeared outside of the perimeter the three villainesses formed. \"The name's Celica, by the way. And you're history!\" With dramatic flare, the villainess snapped her fingers overhead, wordlessly ordering the other villainesses to attack.</span></div></div>",

Before he could respond, Lydia curled her torso around his midsection, before standing upright. The way she moved always weirded the hero out. She had a knot around his midsection, yet he stood upright and towered over him. She could easily maneuver her upper and lower half at the same time while constricting him. He didn't have any more opportunity to consider, before she strained, crushing his abdomen. After a brief squeeze, Lydia tossed him away, leaving him stumbling onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really should watch your back when the <i>executioner</i> is in town!\" Lydia declared, tauntingly smacking her rear at him. She twisted her torso so her upper body was facing him, her rear still pointed at him. \"I may not be able to kill you yet, but I can make you hurt a lot.\" Her lower half twisted around, her front facing him. \"Course, I'm not the only one here that wants to toy with you. What do you ladies say? Do I still get to play with him?\"</span></div></div>",

The Pint Puncher turned towards Lydia, who shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard them,\" Lydia said. Then, suddenly, she flew forth, gliding through the air. She dove under the hero's arm and around his torso, putting her upper half in front of him and her lower half in front of him. She grabbed his wrists and held them up, keeping him trapped. And then, she squeezed. Just to make things worse, she coiled around the hero's neck, and squeezed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say hello to the gallows hold!\" Lydia shouted, constricting him. The hero's air supply was suddenly cut off. He couldn't breath! His ribs were being crushed under the eel's coils, and he couldn't breath! He couldn't believe he was letting himself get beaten like this. As if things couldn't get worst, Lydia's rump came into view. She planted one foot on one of her coils, then the other, then Lydia helped hold her rump up. \"You remember what I can do, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOO!\" the hero howled as the butt covered his face. Then, just as quickly as he was enveloped, Lydia unleashed a bubbly fart onto him. Lydia's stench smelled like rotten fish! He probably would've been more grossed out if Lydia's special power didn't take hold. In addition to her constrictable body, Lydia's gasses were known to infect those who smell it with hypnosis. He already felt it take control. He was getting lulled into a dream-like state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good~\" Lydia said. \"Now... sleep~\" At that, against the hero's will, he felt his eyelids begin to shut. Part of him said he needed to stop them. Part of him was screaming that he needed to stay awake, or else they'll do whatever they can to him! And yet... sleep was inescapable. He was enveloped in darkness, and found himself in a slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero finally woke up, and got up. He rubbed his forehead instinctually, but realized something. There was no mask on his face! He looked down at himself, and realized he was stripped down to his underwear! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did-?\" the hero asked. But then, the last thing he remembered came into mind. Those four ladies! He remembered Lydia squeezed him, and now he was stuck in some random spot, half naked. He looked around his waking area, and got a good read on his situation. Three of the walls were sheer steel, the floor and ceiling were steel as well, and the only other wall was without a wall. However, it wasn't quite open. No, instead there was a wall of red rubber stretched over the gap, a few prison-like bars formed from it. He was in a makeshift jail cell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero peered through the gaps in the rubber. They were all thinner than one of his fingers, and, after pushing them, he found he couldn't budge them. He was trapped! Through the gap, he could see Paula, sitting down and looking at the cell. Of course, her rubber suit molded off of her body and over the gap, forming an inescapable wall. By now, Paula was just wearing a thong and a thin bra over her breasts. She tauntingly smacked her lips at the hero, who shivered at the notion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-let me go!\" the hero demanded, pounding against the rubber bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, boy,\" Paula said. \"I've been given explicit orders to make sure you stay where you are. Now sit back down, and wait for one of the Lipstick Stars to treat you~\" At that, Paula turned around and leaned on the wall adjacent to the rubber wall she set up. Lipstick Stars? Was that what those four called themselves? If he was in their custody, he needed to find a way out of here!</span></div></div>",

Originally, she was a small Bombay cat living in a shoddy old animal shelter. It was there that she subjected to a great deal of neglect. The owner, while ultimately well meaning, was very inept when it came to animal care and often took in more than he could accommodate. It was do to his mismanagement that a fire broke out in the store and his life was taken along with most of the animals. Kim managed to escaped by the skin of her death, though she came out of the incident with singed fur and the tip of her ear clipped slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her life outside of the shelter proved to be just as miserable, as she spent most of her time scrounging for food and looking for a place to sleep. No one would give her the time of day and quite often, she would be subjected to abuse by rowdy school children or bitter homeless people. Such experiences instilled in him a deep seated distrust of humans. That changed ever so slightly when she met Pint Puncher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was nothing remarkable about him at the time. He was simply a bright eyed young man with a desire to do good. All he did was pet her on the head and give her a few bits of beef jerky he had been carrying, but in Kim's eyes it was the kindness thing that anyone could ever do for her. Ever since that day she made a note to follow him around at a distance, often watching him from the shadows. This behavior would continue on even after her transformation, though she's much more inclined to interact with Pint Puncher in her new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Standing nearly ten feet tall, Kim cuts quite the imposing figure. She has large perky breast, a round supple bottom and thick muscular thighs. For the most part, her body is obscured by her jet black fur, though she's able to materialize clothing using her ability to control shadows. She possesses cold, soulless eyes that seem to only come to life whenever she's around Pint Puncher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Aside from the immense strength and speed brought on by her towering body, Kim has the ability to control shadows. At a moment's notice she can completely meld into the darkness, shapeshift, or paralyze people by seizing their own shadow. Once someone truly angers her, she can capture their \"essence\" by stealing their shadow, thus robbing them of their powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kim has a very simple way of thinking: No one matters but Pint Puncher. She has an unyielding hatred for all living things, regardless of what species of creature they are, yet she deeply loves Puncher and wants nothing more than to spend time with him. She violently protective of him, to the point where brutally torture anyone that attempts to do him harm in her presence. Whenever she's with him, she becomes jovial and playful, doing everything she can to show him how much she cares for him. Unfortunately, this often is to Pint Puncher's detriment, as her idea of showing affection tends to involve her roughhousing him in some way. Spending so much of her life alone left her emotionally and mentally stunted and as a result, she doesn't know how she's supposed to treat those she cares about. This is reflected by her speech patterns, as she tends to speak in a very broken dialect, even referring to herself in the third person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kim really doesn't have an end goal. She just wants to be with Puncher, though she's not all that hesitant to cause wanton violence and destruction in order to get to him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> It wasn't a very good day for Pint Puncher. What started as a simple patrol of the city streets soon became a fight for his life, as he was suddenly ambushed by two of his most dangerous foes. He had been flying through the city when he was suddenly knocked out of the sky by a large boulder that had been lobbed directly at him. Before he could recover from the surprise attack, he found himself pinned against the sweaty sole of Quaker. As he struggled to fend off her enormous foot, he could see Boris standing to the side with a wide grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it going, little man?\" Quaker taunted as she pressed her foot down on him, squeezing the air from his lungs. \"I didn't mean to surprise you like I did, but I had to get your attention somehow. The funny thing is, I wasn't even trying to hit you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wanted to work up a sweat fighting you, but I guess we'll have to get right to the meat of things\" Boris chimed in with a chuckle. \"Quaker, I'm a little tuckered out from breaking you out of the penitentiary. Would you mind tenderizing him for me? Feel free to add your own unique spices to the mix\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to tell me twice!\" She snickered before lifting her foot off of Puncher and holding it up high in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No... please... don't...!\" he pleaded as he held his hands up in a futile effort to protect himself. His words fell on death ears as her foot came plummeting down onto his much smaller body, the resulting impact causing the earth to cave in beneath him. His mind was rattled by the immense pain, though he wasn't given much time to linger on it before Quaker lifted her foot again and stomped it back down with even greater force. Over and over again, Quaker stomped down on Pint Puncher with all the force her heavy frame could manage. The brutal assault was percilessly short, though she kept her foot on top of him and twisted it as though he were a bug. It would take him days to wash out the smell of mud and sweat from his costume, though Boris would ensure that he'd never have to worry about such a thing ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Quaker lifted her foot to admire her handiwork, though was surprised to see him missing. At first she thought that he had managed to give them the slip before the sound of pained groans caught her attention and she glanced at the bottom of her foot to find Pint Puncher plastered to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, look Boris! I think he likes playing with my feet!\" She chortled as she held her foot up higher to allow him a better look at the broken hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I hate to cut into your fun hero, I haven't eaten all day!\" Boris bellowed slapping his enormous gut. After peeling his beaten body from off Quaker's foot, he held him up to his nose and gave him a few sniffs. \"Hm! Quite the exotic flair you put on this, Quaker! You and I need to hang out more. I could use some of that African spice on more of my food!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you~\" Quaker giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't... don't do this... please...\" Pint Puncher mumbled, his energy all but sapped from his brutal beating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be more willing talk things out with you, but I can't think on an empty stomach!\" Boris snickered before dangling Pint Puncher over his gaping maw. All seemed lost as Pint Puncher closed his eyes and prepared himself for the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And <i>waited</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Opening his eyes, he could see that his situation hadn't changed. He was still hanging percariously over Boris' massive mouth, but something seemed amiss. Any pretense of playful sadism was gone from Boris' face as he trembled as though he were struggling to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up and eat him, Boris! We've got a city to take over!\" Quaker ordered impatiently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ah... Aah chaan!\" he cried, attempting to speak with his mouth still opened wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you can't?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah chaan whoo~!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... can't move?\" Quaker repeated curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Scum.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Quaker blinked and looked around as a voice echoed around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there! Show yourself!\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Scum.</i>, the voice repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly, Quaker began to feel a sinking sensation, as though she were standing in a thick puddle of mud. Looking down, her eyes widened at the sight of a pitch black, gooey substance pulling her down into the earth. She gasped and attempted to pull herself free, but couldn't so much as budge as she was slowly consumed by the black ooze. Boris didn't know what to make of the sight, but soon found himself in the same situation as he began to sink into the ground as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what's h-happening to us!?\" Quaker cried as she pound her mighty fists against the earth in the hopes of freeing herself. Whatever the substance was, brute force proved useless against it as it her hands were ensnared as well. Her attention was soon shifted forward as a tall, imposing figure slowly rose from the ground several feet away from her and Boris. A black pillar stood in front of them before a set of cold, piercing yellow eyes formed near the top. The pillar quickly took shape, molding into a voluptuous cat woman who stood with her hand outstretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. You hurt him. You are <i>scum</i>\" she spat bitterly before turning her attention to Pint Puncher who hung limp in Boris' hand. Her cold eyes softened upon seeing him, her body language becoming significantly less hostile. With a wave of her hand, Pint Puncher was lifted out of Boris' hand by the same black substance that ensnared the two villains. With another gesture, she brought Pint Puncher over to her and sat him down onto the ground gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was cut off as the strange cat woman hosted his body up and embraced him in a crushing hug, his head almost disappearing into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... safe~\" she cooed happily as she shook him back and forth. Her gaze soon shifted to the other two, who remained frozen by the black ooze. Her eyes immediately became cold and lifeless again as she sat Puncher down and turned to face them. Boris and Quaker were completely dumbfounded by the sudden turn of events, as neither of them had ever been such a compromising position before. After staring at them wordlessly for a solid minute, the stranger pointed at them and uttered a single word that sent chills down their spines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Die\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, the ooze began pulling them both down with renewed vigor. Quaker thrashed and screamed in desperation while Boris remained frozen and unable offer the slightest bit of resistance. Pint Puncher watched the sight in a mixture of confusion and horror. He had fought the two of them many times before not once had he ever seen them show the slightest bit of fear. Up until that point, he had been the most challenging opponent they had ever faced and even then, he often fought them on an even keel. They had never been put in such a situation before, where they were completely helpless and powerless before a deadly foe that sought their demise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They had done so much harm, not just to him but to Glam City as a whole, but the sight of them panicking and fighting for their lives left Pint Puncher feeling uneasy. He couldn't let them die like that, especially in such a slow, gruesome manner. He turned to the tall cat woman and grabbed onto her leg, looking at her with fearful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Spare them! They don't deserve this!\" He pleaded. His intervention came as a surprise to the stranger as she knelt down to meet his gaze, her eyes becoming soft once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are bad. They hurt you. Kim make them go away forever. Then they can't hurt you anymore... \" she explained calmly as she placed a hand on his back. Despite her initial display of strength, her hand was soft and warm, gently massaging his back in an attempt to comfort him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim... Don't do this. Let them go... please...!\" he cried before looking back at the two villains. They were almost completely gone as the ooze reached up to their necks. It was only a matter of time before it reached their mouths and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i>PLEASE</i></b>!\" Pint Puncher begged as he fell to his knees in front of her. The strange cat woman now identified as Kim tilted her head with a frown before looking over to the doomed pair. She snapped her fingers and instantly they stopped sinking. Quaker looked down at the ground and saw that the ooze was gone. Before where it felt like she was sinking into a thick fluid, she now could feel that her body was submerged in the ground. Letting out a shaky sigh of relief she looked over at Pint Puncher with a look that caught him completely off guard; it was an look of genuine, earnest gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you... s-so much, Pint Puncher...\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher simply nodded before looking back over to Kim, who seemed completely disinterested in the pair now that she had released them. She stared at him with a bright, happy smile as she fiddled with her tail like a shy schoolgirl. Somehow, her giddy demeanor unnerved him the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puncher... Punchy... Punchy~\" she tittered as her face reddened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yeah... I guess you can call me that\" he said as he took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim\" she said pointing to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. You told me that already\" Puncher stated as the tried to think of a way to depart from the bizarre amazon that stood before him. Without warning he was suddenly scooped off the ground into yet another crushing embrace, his head having to bear the weight of her enormous boobs as he was pulled into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim loves Punchy...~\" she mewled as she ragdolled him about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The disoriented hero thought of his next move...</span></div></div>",

Second maybe he misinterpreting what she mean by love maybe she just  admires him as a hero or she just really big fan of his he shouldn't jump to conclusions and panic last thing he needs to do is accidentally make new villain by letting fear control his actions. So he takes this chance take some deep breaths to make should he full calm down before speaking to kim and hopefully  prove his fears wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim by love me what do you exact mean by that?\" As he try's to say that as calmly as he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim blinks confused while loosening her grip on him little why is punchy ask such silly question and responds with \"Kim loves punchy.

Using his super strength, he managed to pry himself free from her iron grip and jumped back several feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry! I'll send for someone to come get you two!\" He called to Boris and Quaker being taking off into the skies. Granted, his assistance would most likely come in the form of law enforcement that would lock them awau, but he didn't see them complaining after what they had just been through. As he soared away, Kim stood looking quite confused. She had saved Puncher and did as he asked in freeing his attackers. Why was he leaving as though he were fleeing? She racked her brain trying to think of an answer before it finally hit her. He wanted to play! Why else would he take off so suddenly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Play! We play!\" She cried excitedly before getting into a hunched position and launching herself with such force that it shattered the ground beneath her feet. Pint Puncher blinked as he could sense something swift approaching him. He glanced over his shoulder and gasped at the sight of Kim rocketing towards him with her arms spread wide, no doubt to give him another ribshattering hug upon catching him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He managed to swerve and avoid her by the skin of his teeth, though the towering feline wasn't the least bit fettered. Before she could get any further, she extended her arm to an absurd length and wrapped around the nearest building to stop her ascent before pulling herself onto the rooftop for a smooth landing. A mischievous grin was fixed onto her face as she launched herself once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This process repeated itself for a few minutes. Pint Puncher would just barely avoid her lunge before she would collect herself and try it again. Occasionally she would get close and give the fleeing her a peck on the cheek as she passed by, showing him that she was merely toying with him. The game came to a swift end as he was tackled right out of the air and crushed in her vice like grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caught you~\" she cooed before peppering his fast with kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kim! Stop! Y-You're too... ugh, heavy...!\" he stammered as they plummeted back down to the earth, plowing through rows of buildings as they fell at a downward slope. Luckily for him, Kim took the brunt of the damage, though it didn't seem to effect her in the slightest as she continued to kiss him. Eventually they reached the end of their destination, plowing through the roof of an old flowershop much to the surprise of the customers. When the dust cleared, Kim was sitting on top of Pint Puncher, her plump rear pressing down hard onto his groin as she rubbed her feet on either side of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim caught Punchy~ Kim wins~\" she sang happily as she wiggled her massive ass on his tender groin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher could only grown in response, both by the numbing pain and by the merciless teasing of his private parts. Kim giggled at his reaction, though her playful demeanor did a complete 180 when she noticed the numerous people staring at them in stunned silence. These people were nosing in on her playtime with Puncher. Such a grievous sin could not be easily forgiven. She looked over at the crowd with a bitter gaze and said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite coming out in a cold, hushed whisper, Kim's words cut through the air like a knife. Her very presence seemed to cause a certain tension in the air, as though they were in a room with with a dangerous beast rather than a statuesque feline. They exited the store swiftly, yet moved with caution as to not potentially put her on edge any further. While Pint Puncher felt somewhat slighted by their lack of assistance, he was relieved to see them spared of Kim's wrathful hand. His attention was brought back his stalker as she continued to rub her massive paws along his face, her plump rear bouncing up and down on his crotch as she giggled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she stopped, her body stiffening as her face became stern. With one fluid motion she moved her feet from his face and rolled onto her stomach, her hefty breasts covering the lower half of his face as she laid on top of him. She didn't seem to notice or care about the obvious discomfort that she was causing him as she sniffed the top of his head, her fact contorting in disgust and anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stinky\" she said irritably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs first Puncher wasn't sure what she was talking about but he quickly recalled the events that led up to their meeting. Not ten minutes ago he was being peeled off of the bottom of Quaker's foot, his body reeking of dirt and sweat. He made it a point to thoroughly bathe after dealing with the numerous evildoers in the city, as he didn't want any of his fans to catch him smelling like another person's bodily fluids. Having it brought to his attention made his face redden in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. Sorry about that, I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words were cut short as Kim pushed her chest forward, completely burying his head in her furry cleavage. He let out a muffled as he struggled to pull away, his super strength doing him little good against Kim's bulky frame. He wasn't sure what she had planned for him and he wasn't given much time to guess as she placed her hands on either side of her breasts and began rubbing them all along his head. Part of Puncher somewhat enjoyed it, as it felt as though we were recieving a massage with two large pillows, but the lack of air and the less than Kim's less than pleasant odor ruined whatever enjoyment he could get out of what she was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot content inforcibly smothering him, she began to rubbed her entire body against his, her powerful hips pressing down onto his as her breasts moved up and down along his face and neck. This went on for a solid minute before she pulled back, leaving the soaked in sweat and gasping for air. She looked down at him with a proud smile before leaning down to take in his scent again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more stinky! Now you mine!\" she giggled. It was that statement that made her intentions clear to Puncher. She wasn't bothered by the rank stench coming from his body; she just didn't like the fact that it wasn't her stench that radiated off of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Play some more, yes?\" she asked as her tail wagged frantically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No more playing. I want you to tell me who you are and why you're following me!\" Pint Puncher demanded as he attempted to wipe the sweat from his face. His confrontational tone didn't seem to register to Kim as she stood in front of him with an innocent smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim is Kim. Kim follow Punchy because Kim loves Punchy!\" she explained before reaching forward to give him yet another hug. Pint Puncher grabbed onto her arms and pushed them back, his expression remaining stern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've established that already, but why exactly do you love me? I've never seen you before in my life!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim blinked and cocked her head to the side in confusion. It never occurred to her that her love wouldn't recognize her in her current state. The last time they had saw each other was prior to the event that caused them to gain their respective powers. Back then she was nothing more than a filthy alley cat scrounging for food. Come to think of it, she didn't recall ever seeing him wearing that silly outfit of prior to the event. She was certain that he was the young man who so selflessly fed her when all others had ignored her. His disguise was useless against her acute sense of smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You give food when Kim was small\" she explained as she made gestures with her hands to illustrate how small she used to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPint Puncher raised a brow at her claim. It was safe to assume that she was once a normal cat, but that fact didn't exactly narrow it down. After thinking it over for a minute, the memory came back to him. He had been walking home from the store when he spotted a small black cat digging through the trash. A wild animal scourging for scraps certainly wasn't a new occurrence, but the haggered fur and clipped ear had given him pause. He had felt sorry for the poor thing and gave it a few pieces of jerky before going on his way. He didn't think much of it after the fact, but his small act of kindness had created an intense obsession within the feline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim had shadowed him ever since that moment, watching the hero-to-be just out of his line of sight. The only thing that kept her from interacting with him directly was her previous experiences deal with humans, who would all turn their noses at her due to her disheveled appearance. Just when it seemed as though she\u2019d never get to be with him, an incident occured that caused her to transform into a towering and curvaceous anthro along with granting her numerous otherworldly abilities. With her beautiful new body, she was confident that the hero love would embrace her with loving arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember now\u2026 you were that cat with the burnt fur\u201d Pint Puncher said before eyeing her thick body with an upraised brow. \u201cYou\u2019ve\u2026 grown\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kim giggled and struck a pose, her massive breasts jutting out as she placed a hand on her wide hip. The hero had to admit, she was certainly easy on the eyes, but that fact alone wasn\u2019t enough to dissuade his distrust of her. She might have been attractive, but she was still unstable and quite dangerous. Plus, she knew his secret identity, having singled him out despite him wearing a mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Kim? I'm gonna need you to wait right here while I go take care of something important\" he said slowly. He still had to contact the authorities to come and get Quaker and Boris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kim's face soured for a moment, her eyes burning with disdain. She knew exactly what he intended to do and it angered her to think that he would waste his time aiding the two that only sought to harm him. Not only that, but she felt more than a little jealous that he seemed more interesting in interacting with those two slobs then her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Feeling embittered, she decided to... </span></div></div>",

He had expected her next coarse of action to be a bit more... aggressive. What was even more surprising was the tenderness she demonstrated as their lips made contact. He'd been on the recieving end of many unwanted kisses from his many foes and none of them handled him so gently. Were it not for the feline's less than pleasant tuna breath, he'd even go so far as to say it was pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Or at least, that's how it started out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Seconds into the kiss he began to feel his body growing more and more weak. His vision was getting blurry and it felt as though the air was being sucked directly out of his lungs. He cried out as he kicked and squirmed against Kim's powerful embrace but his struggles amounted to nothing in the face of her overwhelming strength. It wasn't as if she had him in an unbreakble hold, but for some reason he couldn't even so much as breath through his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mercifully, Kim began pulling away from the kiss, though any relief the hero might have felt was replaced by bewilderment. A long, glowing green substance bridged their mouths together, roughly as thick as his forearm. Kim's lips curled into a smile and she quickly sucked it down, a visible bulge forming in her throat as she swallowed it whole. The moment the bizzare glowing liquid exited his mouth, the discomfort Pint Puncher felt had ceased and he felt... normal. The <i>wrong</i> kind of normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more fighting bad guys! Kim protect Punchy!\" The feline declared proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kim... What did you to me?\" Puncher asked fearing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kim tilted her head and without warning, dropped the hero. Pint Puncher landed on the ground and hissed in pain as he landed on his rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Would you mind being a little more gentle? That hurt! That...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He petered off as he looked down at his still aching butt, the realisation hitting him hard. Three foot drop to the ground hurt him. He'd been thrown through buildings, trampled by giants, and chewed like gum, but that one drop managed to hurt him. He looked up at Kim with fearful eyes, though she continued to look at him with that ever cheerful smile of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you... Did you take away my powers?\" He asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah huh! Punchy no fight no more! Kim keep Punchy safe now!\" She said beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim, you can't-- I can't believe you would-- you need to give them back!\" He cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy no need powers. Kim strong! Kim keep stinky bad guys away!\" She insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher pinched the bridge of his nose and tried to collect himself. This was no run-of-the-mill villain he was dealing with. There was a small chance that he could reason with her given the lack of baggage she had with him. He began to make his pitch when he was suddenly pounced on, Kim's hands resting on his shoulders as she pinned him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more talking. We play now!\" She giggled excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero swallowed nervously, a new wave of fear washing over him. He had a hard enough time dealing with her when he had his powers. He dreaded to think what the towering anthro had in mind for him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They were in her way. \u201cThat fat swine and elephant.\u201d Kim seethed. As long as they continued to exist, she would not have her beloved Punchy\u2019s undivided attention. She needed to get rid of them. \u201cBut what about Punchy?\u201d Wondered the dark feline. Kim\u2019s ears lowered against her skull and she slumped forward as she looked to the floor.  For some reason he did not want her to kill the fat pair, even though they were his enemies and tried to end his own life. If it were up to Kim, she would have snuffed the two out right then and there. She just wanted to keep him safe, but she did not want to upset her little love. Kim racked herself on the head with her fists and shook her head just at the thought of displeasing her sweetheart. If she killed them the he would certainly be angry with her and she could not bear that. No. There had to be another way. Kim\u2019s pointed ears suddenly perked up and she stood up straight as her gloomy eyes lit up while her lips twisted into a devious smile. \u201cYes. That would work\u201d She thought. She knew how to get rid of her elephant and boar problem without technically killing them. In fact, the two may prove useful to Kim. The pantherine feline watched her Pint Puncher fly off into the night sky before she sank into the shadows of the empty shop. She swiftly moved across the floor and up a wall before slipping through the large hole she and Puncher had made in the ceiling, disappearing into the city streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuaker had been trying to free herself for a good while now but did not seem to be making progress. Her powers had abandoned her. She was stuck from the neck down and could not do anything to free herself. \u201cHey! Boris! You still with me?\u201d The elephant called out to her fellow ne\u2019er-do-well. She could not turn to face him but she knew he was there. She could smell him. He did not answer, seeming to have lost consciousness from the previous ordeal. \u201cDammit!\u201d Quaker cursed. She slumped her head and uttered a defeated sigh. \u201cI\u2019d never have thought I\u2019d need that pain in the ass to show up and save me. Where is that good for nothing pintsized Puncher when you actually need him anyway?\u201d Quaker said to no one in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow slid down a nearby rooftop and into the dark alley. Quaker almost missed it while she was lost in her thoughts. \u201cW-what was that?\u201d She asked herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuaker stared into the shadows before her. Nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. Her large fan-like ears did not detect any movement besides a few non anthropomorphized rats scurrying in the dark. The only noise she heard was the bustle of the city at large. Something moved in front of her earning a started yelp from the once formidable pachyderm. Quaker hated feeling like this. Helpless, vulnerable, weak! She was jumping at shadows. \u201cCalm down, Quaker,\u201d she thought, \u201cyou\u2019ll be out of here in no time. That fool hero is probably on his way right now. He gets me out. I\u2019ll probably do some time in some holding facility but I\u2019ll bust out and be back to theorizing the city and sitting on Puncher in no time.\u201d She assured herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKim won't let fat elephant hurt Puncher!\u201d Said an unseen voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuaker nearly jumped out of her skin. \u201cWho said that?!\u201d She asked in a panicked voice. \u201cwho\u2019s there?\u201d  After a second, she saw them. Two piercing, baleful eyes in the dark. \u201cWait! t-those eyes!\u201d Quaker uttered in a shaky voice. The color drained from her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgly fat elephant lady won\u2019t do anything ever again.\u201d Kim hissed. She moved towards Quaker and Boris\u2019 motionless body, slithering along the floor as a black trail of living shadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou again?! Stay back!\u201d Quaker shrieked. Kim steadily drew closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no! Stay back you damn cat!\u201d Quaker demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim advanced, those intense eyes fixed on her target. Until she was close enough. Kim lunged forth at a horrified Quaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPint Puncher heard a bloodcurdling scream from somewhere below. He stopped in mid-flight. \u201cThat sounded like Quaker.\u201d He stated. He was on his way to claim the elephant and her boar partner in crime for the authorities. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d He wondered. He resumed his flight, picking up the pace as it were, until he reached the alley where he left them. He descended to the floor and was puzzled to not see anything. Anyone. Then he saw it. A black pool of inky shadow in the darkness of the barely illuminated alley, where Boris and Quaker should have been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-how did she get here before me?\u201d Puncher pondered, immediately recognizing what he saw. \u201cStop Kim!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe still pool of shadow seemed to react to the sound of his voice. It began to swirl and bubble before it took the shape of a familiar humanoid-pantherine female. \u201cPunchy!\u201d Kim cred with glee. She ran at the object of her obsession with her out stretched arms intent on scooping him up into another hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d Barked the Pint Puncher. This caused the tall black cat to stop in her tracks. Her giddy smile fading a little bit. Was he angry with her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done, Kim!\u201d He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe definitely was mad. She could hear it in his voice. \u201cK-Kim help Punchy. Now Kim and Punchy can play and be together.\u201d Kim said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are Boris and Quaker, Kim? What have you done?\u201d Inquired Puncher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim smiled and put her hands on her broad, shapely hips. She then thrusted out her ample bosom. The Pint Puncher was confused at the display. What was she doing? He noticed that the amorous felid looked...thicker than when he last saw her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKim?\u201d The Puncher asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat could see that her future soul mate was struggling to make sense out of all this. He was so cute when he was confused. She just wanted to pounce on him right here and...and. She shook her increasingly lewd thoughts from her head and instead focused on clearing up things for her little Punchy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKim knows Punchy not want Kim to end smelly boar\u2019s and ugly elephant lady\u2019s miserable existence. So, Kim thought of way to remove them for good without killing.\u201d She explained. The Pint Puncher did not like what he was hearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying Kim? And what have you done to your body?\u201d He asked. She was a lot curvier than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKim...repurposed bad boar and elephant.\u201d She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRepurposed?\u201d Repeated Puncher. He was surprised that she knew a word as complex as repurposed, but the more pressing question was, \u201cRepurposed them into what?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim giggled cutely as she ran her hands over her curves. \u201cKim turned bad people into Kim!\u201d She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPint Punchers eyes widen as the realization set in. Somehow Kim had absorbed Quaker and Boris into herself. They had become additional mass on the cat\u2019s frame! Kim gracefully spun around to face away from the hero before she looks over a shoulder back at him with an amused smile and rubs her hands across her enhanced physique until her hands slid down her sides and around the swell of her plump buttocks. Kim was surprised to see the Puncher walking up to her, his eyes fixed on her stuffed rump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre...they still alive?\u201d Asked a bemused Puncher. Kim smiles down at her object of desire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Kim can feel them.\u2019 Kim answered, her smile growing wider at the Puncher. She could see he was unable to look away. \u201cPunchy want to touch, yes?\u201d Puncher glanced up. Kim nodded to him and he extended a hand forward to lay a palm on Kim\u2019s right buttock. The mass of supple flesh was warm and her short black fur was soft like silk. The heat coming off her backside was considerable, a lot of it radiating from her vulva, which was visibly swollen. The hero tried to not notice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cKim thinks they mostly go to Kim\u2019s lower body.\u201d Indeed. Quaker and Boris were far from dead as they were both enveloped by Kim\u2019s musculature and fatty tissue. They had not been truly consumed but somehow condensed and compacted by Kim\u2019s shadows. Quaker along with Boris had been given a fate far more sadistic and twisted than death as she and Boris had been evenly distributed across the Kim\u2019s rump and legs. Quaker and Boris were transformed from some of the Pint Puncher\u2019s oldest nemeses into a new rotund ass and legs for Kim. The elephant could feel every inch, dimple, and curve surrounding her as she had been spread across Kim\u2019s ass, her very essence soaking into the cat\u2019s flesh which had expanded to accept her and Boris\u2019s additional mass. Though Quaker\u2019s and Boris\u2019 minds were intact all control was surrendered to Kim\u2019s as the boar and elephant ceased to exist outside of Kim. Boris had lucked out as he had been, and still was unconscious. Quaker however was all too aware of her surroundings, but unable to move even a little bit of her converted mass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe true horror of her plight was made all the more real as she can suddenly see her dark surroundings. Kim\u2019s skin presses outward into the cool night air of the alley as Quaker along with Boris were made to act as her buttocks. She can see the Puncher looking at her, feel his hand on her round form. He pulled away. She was utterly humiliated and wished she had simply died instead of ending up like this. Her captoress rubs her hand in a circle around Quaker\u2019s plush pillowy form before slapping it. Hard! Her jiggling fat rippled in response.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformation had left Kim with a pair of sculpted, powerful thighs. Shapely in appearance and made all the more impressive by the law of conservation of mass. Kim now carried two other individuals, spread evenly throughout the layers and sinews of her muscle and fat. However, she did not actually appear to have and elephant and boar packed within her curves. To the uninformed she appeared to be a really tall, muscular female cat that was thick in all the right places. Kim\u2019s rear and calves had blown past what they originally were, now far wider and full. Their curves are virtually perfect, her black fur covered ass was a tight bubble from top to bottom thought would likely jiggle with her every step.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim turned to face her Punchy. \u201cNow Kim can be with Punchy!\u201d She said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero finally broke his gaze on the cat\u2019s admittedly alluring backside and backed away. \u201cNo. She can\u2019t.\u201d He stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim stopped and frowned. She had thought that by adding those two to her curves that the Pint Puncher would not be able to resist her. \u201cKim doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to let them go.\u201d The hero declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim raised an eyebrow. \u201cDoes Punchy not like Kim\u2019s body?\u201d She inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I-I mean yes, I mean...look this is wrong. You can't do this to people no matter how rotten they are!\u201d The hero said blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim narrowed her eyes at her Punchy. Why was he being so difficult? She just wanted him to love her. She did all this for him after all. Kim cocked her head to one side and crossed her strong arms over her sizable breasts. She had an unamused look in her eyes. \u201cWhy?\u201d Kim simply asked. She liked how the two looked on her curvy, athletic body. She was not really wanting to give them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I want you to.\u201d The Puncher said. She was dangerous, unstable, but he knew she was enamored with him, and likely to do whatever he wanted to please him. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to displease me, do you Kim?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, Kim\u2019s eyes lit up, she gasped and stood up straight. \u201cNo! Kim no want to upset Punchy!\u201d She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let Quaker and Boris go.\u201d Puncher repeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim\u2019s eyes looked to the floor and her arms fell to her sides. \u201cKim...not know how.\u201d She claimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how?\u201d Puncher echoed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim squirmed where she stood, unable to look her obsession in the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe never did this before. Kim not know how.\u201d Kim admitted. In honesty she did not really know that she could absorb people to begin with. It was merely a theory she had for a while that happened to be proven true in real time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then. I wasn\u2019t expecting that.\u201d Said the Puncher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPunchy mad at Kim?\u201d The cat asked worriedly. The hero simply looked at the female feline for a while before sighing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not mad, just disappointed.\u201d He admitted. \u201cI guess it can\u2019t be helped. Look on the bright side Puncher. They are alive, and they are contained...in a sense. Just because she can\u2019t release them doesn't mean we can't find a way latter on.\u201d He thought out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat just left Kim herself. She was too dangerous and unstable to be allowed to walk away. Yet he doubted the authorities had a cage capable of holding down someone like her. The only thing that brought her out of her dark state of mind was himself. She went from a murderous hellcat to a gentle kitten just at the sound of his voice. He had an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKim,\u201d he began, \u201cwould you like to come home with me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim perked up at that. \u201cOh yes! Kim would like very much!\u201d She shrieked giddily. She grabbed the puncher and buried his face into her furry cleavage as she rag-dolled his body in a bear hug. The hero managed to break free of her embrace and fall to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Good. Here\u2019s the thing though. No killing and no more absorbing people. Also, you do exactly as I say. Got it?\u201d The Puncher said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim nodded eagerly in response. \u201cYes! Yes! Kim do whatever Punchy asks of her.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then. Let\u2019s go.\u201d He replied. Punch rose into the air, still facing Kim. She merged with the shadows and slithered up a wall to a nearby roof where she took her humanoid form again. The Puncher turned and began to fly over the city careful not go to fast while Kim followed from below. She leapt from rooftop to rooftop with the agility and grace expected from a superpowered feline. Puncher noticed that he swayed on her feet a bit, no doubt adjusting to the extreme weight gain below the waist. When she approached a gap too large to jump even with her superpowered legs that she had used earlier to effortlessly snatch the Pint Puncher from the sky, she instead melted into the shadows of the city as kept pace her source of infatuation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero figure everyone would be a lot better off if he kept this loose cannon under his close eye. At least he could get her under control. Besides, an amazon of an anthropomorphic cat could come in handy. \u201cI always wanted a sidekick.\u201d He thought. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, here we are!\" Pint Puncher declared as he opened the door to his small one story house on the edge of town<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kim's eyes went wide in wonder as she surveyed her new environment. Given his hectic lifestyle the hero never really had time to tidy things up and as a result his home was a bit of a cluttered mess with clothes and clutter scattered about. Not that it really mattered with how rarely he ever had anyone over. The moment he decided to become a superhero he knew that his social life was just about over, as he couldn't risk any potential harm coming to those he got close to. It was a small price to pay for keeping the citizens of Glam City safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the mess. It's not often that I get to stick around here\" he explained as he walked in. Kim didn't seem to mind it at all as she bolted in and started looking around in wonder. She went from his television, to his walk-in kitchen, and to his bathroom, marveling at the every mundane trinket and utility she saw. She paid special attention to his bed as she grabbed onto one of his pillows and taking a big whiff of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything smell like Punchy... Kim like new home!\" She cried happily before crawling onto his bed. Pint Puncher winced as he could hear his it groaning beneath her weight, though by some miracle it managed to hold steady. She was completely enamored by his scent as she lazily rolled around with her nose pressed against his pillow, her eyes fluttering in content with every breath she took. The hero couldn't decide if her behavior was cute or unnerving, but as he caught wind of the musty odor emitting from her fur, one thing was certain: she <i>desperately</i> needed a bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. We need to get you cleaned up\" he instructed as he walked up to her. Kim blinked and sat up to look at him with a confused expression. Her understanding of words and terminology seemed wholly inconsistent, as one minute she was using words with three syllables and the next shewas having trouble with basic phrases. The hero sighed and decided to try and slow things down for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need a <b>bath</b>\" he said with extra emphasis being put on the last word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bath?\" the ditsy cat woman echoed. Her eyes lit up and she nodded vigorously before she sprawling out atop his bed, exposing every inch of her voluptuous body to him. She made sure to draw attention to her heaving breast as she arched her back and shook her shoulders to make them jiggle in an enticing display that left the hero red faced and shamefully aroused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kim, what're you doing?\" he asked in complete bewilderment, his hands reaching down to try and cover up his growing erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punchy bathe Kim!\" she chimed happily as she ran a hand along her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero wasn't sure what she was getting at, but it quickly dawned on him that cats bathed with their tongues. He shuddered at mere thought of it and was quick to correct the record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Kim, not like that. I meant with soap and water.  As big as you are it'd take hours to get it done your way\" he explained. The ditsy anthro just stared blankly at him, his words seeming to go in one ear and out the other. Puncher sighed and walked in the direction of his bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. I'll show you what I mean\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kim was happy to obey as she rolled off of the bed and followed behind him on all fours, her heartbeat quickening as she breathed in his scent. She'd spent so long watching him from a distance, sometimes following him for days on end in the hopes of one day working up the courage to go out and speak with him. Deep down she feared that his kindness was an one off incident and that he'd eventually grow to treat her with the same amount of contempt and disgust that other humans did. Yet there she was, mere inches away from the object of her affection as she roosted in his home. That fact alone made her shiver in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pint Puncher lead her into his cramp bathroom and over to the tub. He knew that there would be no way for fit into it comfortably, but his options were limited. It was either that or try and rinse her off with water from the sink. Kim watched him curiously, cringing as he turned on the faucet and let the water flow freely. Like most of her kind, she wasn't exactly fond of the idea of getting wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that should about do it...\" Pint Puncher muttered as he ran his hand along the water's surface to check the temperature. He used almost all of his soap to better ensure that he killed the stench that clung to her fur. \"Come on. Get in\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Kim get in water? Kim no like water! Make fur all sticky!\" she said with an irritated huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably because you never dried off properly. Don't worry, that's what I'm here for\" he said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n His titanic admirer pouted and sat down with her back turned to him, her tail swishing back and forth in defiance. She couldn't believe it. How could he ask her to do such a thing? And what exactly did it have to do with bathing? She'd always dreamed of the day that they could cuddle up together and clean off the filth from each other's pelts, but apparently human's didn't know how to properly groom themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim...\" Pint Puncher began slowly as he placed a hand on her back, rubbing it in a way that caused her tail to quicken slightly. \"I know you don't like water, but this is how humans keep themselves clean. You're too big to be cleaning yourself off with just your tongue. It'd take hours for you do get it done\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No water!' Kim snapped childishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hero sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. Taking care of the hulking feline would prove more difficult than he thought, as he just assumed that she'd follow his instruction to the letter. <i>She's a cat... of course she's not going to listen</i>, he mused. Still, he was confident that he could sway her into obeying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you get in, I'll let you get into bed with me\" he said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As expected, that instantly got her attention as she went rigid and her tail stopped swaying. He could practically hear her heart racing as heat radiated from her body, particularly in her lower region. She looked back at him with a look of cautious optimism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Promise?\" she asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise\" the hero assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kim bit down on her lip as she weighed her options. As much as she hated water, she couldn't fathom the idea of turning down a chance to nuzzle up to her love all night long. It was one step away from her achieving her deepest desire and that prospect alone created a familiar warmth in her loins. Still, she didn't want him to think that she was giving in easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Kim get in water... but Kim want Punchy to do one thing first!\" she said sternly as she turned back to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Pint Puncher raised a brow and gestured for her to continue. He was interested in seeing what kind of offer she would make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim want Punchy to...\"</span></div></div>",

On the day he was to be sent away he escaped and vanished into the woods. Gustav was presumed dead, unable to deal with the many predators lurking in the forest. But his environment had made him hardy, ready to fight for his survival. He thrived, growing fat and strong among a family of boars who had taken in this strange pink outsider. He lived happily until the calamity struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe now stood on two sturdy feet, his strength and endurance amplified along with his belly. His whole body had grown considerably, the hog now standing at least 20 feet tall. The massive girth of his waistline led Gustav to officially adopt Gutsy as his supervillain name. Better yet was the revelation that he attained the power of extra sticky sweat. He could stick almost anything to his big, sweaty belly and adding in other bodily fluids further amplified the effect. Only through concentration could he cancel out his powers long enough to release anything from his sweaty grasp. He honed his skills on the farm he grew up on, subjecting the farmers to endless torments with his sweaty body. He stuck them between his jiggling buttcheeks and underneath his horrid armpits before deciding to add them to his gut for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his petty vengeance complete Gutsy began to hunger for more. From his lair he goes out to abduct unsuspecting strangers, sticking them to his sweaty body.

He adjusted his flight down and prepared to punch that obscene gut so hard the pig would see stars. When his spandex-clad fist connected it just kept going. the huge, mushy belly absorbed the blow drawing only a slightly annoyed \"oof\" from the pig. The villain laughed at the hero's frustrated face. It would soon turn to fear as the sweaty belly revealed it's power to the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" He yelled out as he found his fist to be stuck to the glistening surface. The sweat acted like glue and even with his super strength, the pig was unmovable. Gutsy smiled and spoke, his voice rich with malice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I'm a right sticky bastard.

Before the Pint Puncher could react, the villain shoved him close, introducing his whole body to the sweaty landscape of his belly. A sickly splat announced the hero's worst fears coming true as he found himself trapped, barely able to move on the pig's stinking sweaty gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, little hero. All nice and secure. Now let's take you somewhere fun. I was going to find a few more humans to play with, but with a prize catch like you there can't be any delay. Come, I know a few shortcuts to my lair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go you filthy swine!\" The Pint Puncher yelled out. The pig paid it little mind, bringing his hand down and scraping up a handful of sweaty grime from his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're gonna be silent or I'll shut your mouth with this.\" The hero's eyes widened at the sight of the grimy gunk and he shut up immediately. Gutsy laughed, patting his belly and smearing the goop out evenly. He walked down a narrow alley, coming up to a wall. The pig could probably see over it, but the hero only saw the derelict brickwork approaching. Without even slowing the villain barged straight through, reducing the wall to rubble. The hero yelled in pain at the heavy impact his body just endured. Fortunately that seemed to be the one sound the pig didn't object to. He hummed a cheery tune, very pleased with himself. He knew these old factories well and there were plenty more walls to introduce the hero too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter yet, the feeling coming from his ass was heavenly. He paused for a moment to pull the source of his delight out of his crack. The Pint Puncher couldn't see it, but he heard a female voice coughing loudly. Gutsy needed to work hard to pull her free from his sweaty crevice. He was almost surprised to still find her alive and squirming, knowing the foulness that he hosted there. The hero gasped as he realized that must be the abducted woman from earlier. With a deep chuckle he slammed her onto his back, letting her recover for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral painful interactions with shoddy brick walls later the pig and his bruised hero belly-sticker arrived at a large warehouse. It reeked of sweat and Gutsy smiled. He was greeted by an oversized keypad and quickly punched in the code to the door. It slid open and an even more potent stench washed over him. Both the hero and the captured woman winced at it's foul potency. He walked down the stairs into a long corridor, lined with cages. Seemingly at random he stopped, opened a cage and put the woman inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just stay put here, human. You'll be plenty of fun later. I got a superhero to tend to first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jiggling gut of the pig shook as he laughed loudly, shaking the hero with it. The pig kept humming to himself as he brought the hero into a large chamber. The walls were all made of rough metal, glimmering with traces of pig sweat. The ceiling had a few bright lights in it and in the room were a few pieces of heavily reinforced furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's just you and me, hero. And this is the perfect place for us. Everything's nice and strong, so I don't have to hold back a thing. It's even been soundproofed, so nobody will hear you scream. As a matter of fact, let's have a little sample of that...\" He walked up to the wall and mashed his gut against his, crushing the hero between the unmoving wall and the immense girth of his belly. Muffled screaming could be heard as the Pint Puncher's entire body vanished under the smothering rolls. The already sweaty walls were easy to peel himself away from and the pig took his new toy to the center of the room, pondering what to do next. </span></div></div>",

His spirits didn't lift when he felt the large hand of the pig grab hold of his waist. With some concentration Gutsy weakened the power of the hero's sticky bonds, allowing him to be pulled free. He chuckled as the hero flopped around in his hands like a rag. It gave him an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking a little worn there... Let's lay off the pain a little and introduce you to my powers even more. You've probably already guessed that my sweat is super sticky. But just to hammer that point home, lemme give you a tour of all the sweaty places I have for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big splat the hero was slapped back onto the expanse of sweaty belly before him. The sticky grease didn't seem as hellishly adhesive as before. Gutsy kept himself in check so he could rub his whole body with the Pint Puncher. The large hand around the hero's waist never left. It began to drag him around, smearing more and more of the pig's disgusting sweat on him. The bright white spandex was tarnished and greyed by the abundance of sweat it was soaked in. But the front of the sweaty pig was only the beginning. The hero's first visit to the boar's pits would be a nightmare that'd haunt him for some time. He wasn't kept there for more than a few seconds, but the hellish stench paired with being completely surrounded by sweaty flab was uniquely disturbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGutsy was only getting started, dragging his victim onto his back. He was glad to be agile enough to reach these far away places on his body as he was about to show the hero just how bad things could get. Though his eyes were all but glued shut by the generous coating of sweat, the Pint Puncher could see it coming. Two rancid, smelly hills down the slightly hairy road that was the pig's back. Slowly he was dragged down, towards the villain's rear. Too weak to fight back the hero was pushed headfirst between the pig's asscheeks. The smothering pressure and unrelenting stench were nearly indescribable, but there was one more place Gutsy was aching to introduce the hero to. He didn't even stop when the Pint Puncher was passing by his asshole to let out a smelly fart. Along the crevice he went, reaching beneath the pig and soon catching his first whiff of the potent musk hanging in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of being mostly pinned between Gutsy asscheeks still the hero began to squirm. The villain's smile grew even further, dragging the hero along mercilessly and introducing him to an erection the size of the Pint Puncher's body. It was quickly trapped between the huge overhanging gut and the puny hero being rubbed against it. The Pint Puncher could feel every disgusting throb as the pig nearly climaxed right there. But that would have to wait. Gutsy had plans for his super-enduring victim. He dragged him along the underside of his belly back up and pulled him free to dangle in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm... doesn't that feel great? Being coated in the sweat of a real man? But wait, there's more. My sweat isn't just super sticky. It gets even stickier if I mix in my other bodily fluids.\" The hero didn't have much strength and awareness left, but that phrase made him snap to attention, looking at the pig with sheer horror in his eyes. He already had enough trouble fighting the sticky sweat on its own, and now he was told that was just its weakest version? He shivered in fear, knowing a demonstration was in order. Gutsy chuckled darkly. He too was thinking about how best to showcase this effect. What bodily fluid does he introduce the hero to?</span></div></div>",

He looks around the room and walks up to his torture device of choice. In truth, most of the equipment in here was there just to hold his victims in place as he ground them into submission with his chunky body. He laid the hero on what looked like an oversized metal saddle. It was heavily reinforced to handle everything Gutsy could throw at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher tried to fly away from his position, but his attempts were slowed by the sticky sweat covering him. Though the smooth metal didn't stick nearly as much as the huge filthy belly of Gutsy, it was still taking him too much time. The pig saw his attempts and quickly hoisted himself over the hero, straddling the saddle. Below that gut was a horrifying sight, hovering just above the hero's body. The supervillain stood fully erect, his throbbing member twitched with excitement, pressed into the overhanging pudge of Gutsy's big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready, puny hero. 'Cause this piggy is gonna give you the ride of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge mass was quickly lowered to stop any escape attempts. With that taken care off the pig then slowly settled atop his victim, making sure the grinding built up as gradually as he could manage. Most people were already screaming their lungs out before he even sat down, but this one was silent. He winced and groaned a little, but the screaming didn't happen until after he put his weight down. The monstrous belly isolated the hero with the throbbing dick rubbing against him. More and more the pig began to grind back and forth, the smooth spandex feeling quite nice to rub against. The tip of his member occasionally bumped into the hero's head, sending a wave of pleasure throughout the villain's massive body. Soon he'd let the hero feel just how well he was doing down there. He could feel it rising up within him, the heat building up to unbearable levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I should've kidnapped you ages ago, little hero. You're so much more fun than your fragile little friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero tried hard not to think about what the pig might be doing to his prisoners in here. Mercifully the villain helped him out, though only by inflicting even more pain on him. Gutsy put as much weight on his victim as he could, delighting in the futile wiggles and screams coming from beneath that hefty belly. Even the hero could feel the pig's climax surging up the length of his crushing manhood. With a loud howl he shot burst after burst of white-hot cum all over the hero's face. The smothering gut left almost no room for the sticky goop, forcing it to find every little nook and cranny. The Pint Puncher felt it fill up his little prison, coating his body in warm slime. Even as the pig began to lift his gut off the hero, his manhood saw fit to add a few more spurts of cum to the already impressive volume sticking to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still alive? Good. I hope you liked that, because this little piggy is ready for more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the slime-sodden hero and held him up high to inspect him. The Pint Puncher sputtered in the pig's grip, but he was unable to fight his way out. Gutsy already had a new prison picked out for him. He brings the hero to his sweaty...</span></div></div>",

Policemen attempted to enter to get to the bottom of this, but they never came out. Of course, there could only be one guy that could solve this crime. While the policemen were planning another raid, a white-clad figure flew down, near them. This was the Pint Puncher, walking up to the Tunnel of Love, getting ready for a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe policemen saluted as he stepped forwards, stepping into a boat for the Tunnel of Love. Then, it was cast forwards, going into the tunnel, while the hero sat there, waiting for the villain. He hadn't uncovered who exactly the villainess was, but he figured if they were powrful enough to beat these policemen, they couldn't be slouches. Were he in there before, he probably would've noticed the lack of mannequins, likely the result of a certain hungry frog. As he went through, a figure stood in the shadows, looking upon the new attendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure, Hilda, grinned as she anticipated messing with this hero.

Many people have tried to explore them to gather whatever, through varying levels of success. However, something has taken residence within. Within, many explorers appeared to be made of gold. They weren't gold statues, the clothing was too modern! Indeed, deeper in, some man was put onto his knees next to other statues, who were stuck on all fours. And, touching him, was a jackal person, and at the jackal's touch, the man turned to gold. With that, the jackal sat on the statues that were on all fours, sitting proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis jackal bore a blue and white tunic (a skirt wrapped around his ankles, that traveled up and around his hips), his tunic clung tightly around his hips, he bore a Pharaoh-like crown, and had shadow-black fur. Of course, this was the Anubis, up-and-coming \"king\" of Egypt. Now, no creature like this would go on without attracting attention. He could already hear the whistle of something flying through the air, coming towards him. He simply sat there, cross-legged, waiting for the invader while he sat on his chair of petrified humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind rushed into him, kicked up by something zipping through the halls of the pyramid. Anubis shut his eyes, resisting the strong wind. Then, he opened them up, spying the cause of it, a certain, white-clad hero. Of course, the Pint Puncher arrived on the scene. He looked around, spying several men, set up like statues, adorning a king's chamber. Many of the men were either boasting an erection, bent over and spreading their rear, or both. An unfortunate indication of what Anubis is capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, a tomb raider's broken into our realm,\" Anuis said. \"You're either really bae, or really foolish to challenge us.\" Of course, Anubis' \"our\" and \"us\" talk was less about any allies about him, and more about him speaking for his supposed \"kingdom.\" Anubis were pretty tall, were he standing, the hero would be about pec-high to the muscular jackal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the fool for thinking you can win!\" the Pint Puncher declared. \"You're only powerful when you can get your hands on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't act all high and mighty, peasent,\" Anubis said. \"Our kingdom wields many secrets and traps, the likes of which you'll be completely helpless before.\" With that,the jackal stood up, getting ready for a fight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He shook his head, shaking off the sock. At that, he immediately tried to wipe off the smelly gunk from that sock. However, the moment he paid attention to that over the mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment, the mouse ran over to the stumbling hero, him too weak to fight back, and he wrapped an arm over his neck. He held his head under his arm, and bent him down, him trying to push out of his grip/ However, the mouse simple snickered as he used one of his feet to work off one of his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought I was some simple grunt, right?\" he said. \"While I'm not among his more powerful men, he has made me run laps while wearing these silly shoes, never taking them off.

He reeled back and doubled his efforts, which made the mouse struggle to keep him down. With a mighty shout, the mouse kicked at the hero's legs, knocking them out from under him and causing him to fall onto his knees, the mouse coming down with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse used a free hand to scoot the shoe down underneath the hero's face, and he felt the full force of the mouse's several-week-long foot musk erupt into his nose like a geyser of stink. The mouse lifted a leg over the hero, and soon was on top of him, his hands on the back of the Pint Puncher's head, threatening to shove him nose-first into that shoe. He could simply lift it up over his face, but it's far more humiliating for a small henchman like him to force the hero down into that shoe. The hero fought against the stink, feeling a moment of weakness overtake his body as he struggled to stay up. He couldn't let himself lose like this!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The latter would strike the canine's head again, this time with more force but to no avail did the king's body moved an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you have to offer me peasent? You're not much of a challenge to a powerful ruler like me. You should just bow to me like a slave and your punishment won't be as harsh\" The bipedal furry would taunt the kid, making the Puncher's blood boil with rage. The hero clenched his fist tighter and prepared to punch again, but this time, the jackal caught the boy's fist effortlessly with one hand. In a panicked state, the Puncher tried to use his other fist to push the Egyptian tyrant away but Anubis successfully blocked it mid punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in a tough predicament, the boy used all of his might to pull his hands away from the enemie's grasp. However, the villain responds by bending the hero's fist back and pushed with his godly strength. The Pint Puncher gasped in pain as the jackal pushes him with more force, sending the kid onto his knees as he is still struggling to keep his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Puncher then saw a glint of yellow spreading through his arms, his eyes widen when he couldn't move his arms anymore. The jackal then let go of the hero's arm and then hold his legs, also slowly turning it into gold. The Puncher tried to free himself from the hold but it was too late, all of his limbs were turned into solid gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnubis gave a scoff as his gaze remained stoic, staring at the pathetic worm \"How does it feel to be fallen prey to the Pharoah's curse?

Before the hero could question what was happening further, Anubis began working his hands, rubbing into him and gently rubbing up and down his back. Even when his hands worked into the golden parts of the Pint Puncher, he felt as if he were being massaged. The hero was still weary, positive the jackal was up to something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, his hands got low, kneading his thighs and buttocks, rather thoroughly too. He felt a warmth burn up in his chest as the jackal got to work on him. But things only got worse when his hands brushed by his front, slowly getting closer and closer to his crotch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I could easily finish you off,\" he said. \"I could stuff some dirty underwear over your golden face and leave you to smell that for an eternity... I could sell you off to some commoner villain and let them have their way with you... but instead, I'm being awfully hospitable to you...\" Eventually, both of his hands were now sensually rubbing around the hero's groin, making it grow and grow and making him blush and groan in embarrassment. \"Even though you're a degenerate pervert...\" It didn't take much rubbing from him to have the Pint Puncher at full mast, his clothed cock begging for attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Anubis' hands retreated, only for his arms to wrap around the hero's shoulders as his legs came out above either of the Pint Puncher's legs, coming around to his front. He gave the Pint Puncher a couple of seconds to watch his toes rap along the ground... before he brought both feet up and placed them on either side of the hero's member, drawing a shuddering moan from the hero. And then, the stroking began...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel that? Those perfect feet? How clean and smooth they are? I put a lot of care into making sure a commoner could eat off of them. And now, I'm about to get them dirty from your peasant cum. You better be grateful, boy.\" He kept up his effort, pumping forwards and back, stroking the hero while holding him in this pose, the gold helping to keep him in place. The hero could tell he was in trouble. If he came now, odds were he'd be completely vulnerable to the villain! He had to find some way to escape!</span></div></div>",

After long-term exposure to nuclear radiation caused by a nuclear plant disaster, Ad\u00e8cia slowly mutated into an anthropomorphic creature with above average human intelligence and even learned their language. Her beautiful nine foot tall toned body was covered in <span class=\"ctan\">light brown</span> fur that radiated in the sunlight. A perk of being an Ibex was that she had all natural meaty thighs that could crush great boulders several times her size with relative ease. Her thighs supported her ample buttocks that practically ate up the <b>black</b> sprinter shorts she wore. Ad\u00e8cia's cheeks can clamp together to wring any poor villain who was [un]lucky enough to get their face wedged between them. Her copious breasts were contained by a tight <span class=\"clblue\">bright blue</span> crop top. After the nuclear plant disaster, Ad\u00e8cia felt guilty that she wasn't able to do anything to help the people. Seeing so many innocent humans suffering and dying with nobody around to help them gave her a strong sense of justice. The Ibex made a name for herself after rescuing the mayor of Glam City from the likes of Shenny. The mayor held a ceremony for Ad\u00e8cia the following day where she was recognized for her deed and was awarded a gold medal and offered free permanent residence in a luxury hotel in the city center. She vowed to continue helping the citizens of Glam City from then on. Ad\u00e8cia frequently patrols the city, assisting people in danger. In a fight, she can just about match the Pint Puncher in strength and can hold her own against various types of opponents. Her bulky legs give her extreme athleticism that allowed her to move at great speeds, jump to tremendous heights and utilize parkour to move about the urban environment and scale any surface. She can use her horns to ram and toss enemies up to twice her size a long distance. Ad\u00e8cia is unable to fly and thus relies on structures to parkour off of to maneuver around. Due to this, she tends to fall short in fights that are outside of the city with little to no structures around. She also has heightened senses, which is both a blessing and a curse for the Ibex woman. Ad\u00e8cia is good friends with The Pint Puncher, greatly admiring the boy for his efforts to help innocent people and even secretly in love with the spandex clad hero.</div></span></div></div>",

She enjoys smothering victims in her sweet smell, which she's seemingly able to track to the ends of the earth.

He likes to ride into towns to claim he's gonna yank all of his their folks out under the cover of night if they don't offer up their gold. Often, quite a few citizen disappear. When fought, he uses his lasso, it being a lot more durable than it looks, and seems to be able to knock prey of their feet with finger guns. When he's got a victim down, he likes to bind them up and slip them into one of his used, smelly leather boots, usually combined with some stimulating touches to slowly make them associate the feeling with the smell. And if those boots don't work, he usually puts his diet of beans to work.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Marching through the streets was a tall, muscular, antelope lady sauntering through. She wore a tight blue body suit and blue lipstick, the body suit given holes to show off the more interesting body parts, including exposing the crotch and ass. She hadn't quite managed to get her hands on anybody, but she hoped she could find somebody. Still, she pouted as she marched, clearly bored out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, either for her or for the city, a certain hero's been notified about the problems going on down there. The Pint Puncher has been sent to stop this criminal before she can do anything funny! So, the white blur sped down the streets and towards the blue-clad lady, who began to hear the approaching hero. She turned and saw him, and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, something's gonna happen,\" she sighed. She then stretched her legs a little, then stretched her arms, and put up a defensive pose. And then, in came the Pint Puncher, floating before her. Even here, the villainess could tell the hero was only about butt high compared to her. Heck, he might even have to get on his tip toes to get cheek to cheek with her hindquarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be scaring quite a few people,\" he said. \"I'm afraid that I have to ask that you leave.\" The antelope chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, already?\" she asked. \"But I didn't even get to show off what I can do! Come on, lemme show you, kid~\" The hero rose a brow confused as the foe turned around. She hardly seemed close enough for a gas attack. Still, he saw her hike up her tail, and he held his breath, ready for a nasal assault. And yet, instead of the push he expected, he felt a pull. He was slowly getting dragged forwards, towards the foe. He got even more confused and looked ahead. The slit in the back of her suit was slightly spread, exposing her butt crack a little bit. Her buttocks seemed to be spread, and... pulling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pint Puncher was slowly made more aware of the rushing of air around him, as if the wind itself threatened to pull him into her backside. He tried to fight the pull. He turned around and tried to fly away, hoping that the wind will somehow tire out before he can be made a victim. He may not be small enough to be devoured by him, but it'll still be humiliating!</span></div></div>",

He gritted his death and put all his effort into escaping but he could only keep it up for so long before exhaustion began to take over. He could feel his body being tugged toward's the villain's awaiting derriere. After minutes of fighting against the relentless winds, his body could take no more of the strain and out of instinct, he let his body went lax to try and conserve energy. That brief reprieve was all it took to send him careening into Sabrina's plump ass. He tried to scream, but he wasn't given a chance to before his head was completely sandwiched between Sabrina's hot and sweaty cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty neat power, huh?\" she taunted from above, her voice almost inaudible to the hero as he tried in vain to pull his head out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She sighed happily as his hands kneaded into her butt cheeks, his desperate struggles feeling more like a pleasant massage. It was made all the more better by his angered shouting, his voice reverberating against the walls of her meaty cheeks in a way she found pleasant. She smiled mischievously as she leaned back against him, effectively using his body as a seat as all her weight came down onto his shoulders. Between the sweltering heat around his head and lack of fresh air, the hero couldn't muster the energy needed to push back against her. His body crumpled almost immediately beneath Sabrina with his arms getting pinned beneath her powerful thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you are a keeper! I can't wait to bring you back home!\" Sabrina giggled as she rubbed her butt side to side, grinding the hero's head into the ground. Although he couldn't quite hear her, the hero caught the timber of what she was saying. He needed to get away free himself from this bizarre woman and create some distance in order to mount an offence. The first step was to pull his head out of her crack, but that was easier said than done. Already, he could feel himself tittering on the edge of unconsciousness as she leisurely bounced on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Will the Pint Puncher free himself from this perilous predicament?</span></div></div>",

The boy gulped, he wasn't sure if she could follow through with her threat, but he wasn't willing to test that theory.

She began to grind her cunt against the brat's face as he continued working her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Pint Puncher could taste was the salty and tangy slime of Sabrina's vaginal fluids and the occasional sweat drop.

One the night the phenomenon that created the intelligent, anthropomorphic creatures that plague the world. There was a mysterious explosion that tore the facility apart. Many dangerous wildlife specimens were loosed on the unsuspecting populace, many of which would undergo the changes. Three in particular would find each other in the swamps outside the hero\u2019s city. They would come to be known as the Sisterhood of Scales. The Pint Puncher has not had many encounters with the three. Which is probably a good thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail \"Abby\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Age: 22 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Height: 7'10\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Weight: 800lbs <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eye Color: Yellow sclera. Blue-green irises <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Skin Color: Smooth, grass green scales cover most of Abby's body save for her lower jaw on down to her inner thigh and the underside of her tail, which are cream in color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysical Appearance: Full figured. Physically strong. large breasts, thick thighs, wide hips, and rotund buttocks. Long powerful legs and thick, heavy tail as long as her body.  Wears a white tank top with the bottom torn away to expose her midriff, also wears denim short-shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbilities: Superhuman strength, armored skin resistant to everything short of armor piercing weapons...or a bomb. Enhanced endurance and stamina. Adept swimmer. Strong sense of smell and a devastating bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacter info- Abigail was a rather large female American alligator being held at the doomed lab. When the strange event occurred, Abby underwent drastic mutations that transformed her into a veritable giantess. Standing well over the heads of her fellow fem fa-tales, Abby is the battering ram of the group. If the Sisterhood needs a wall busted down, or a city block leveled, this she-hulk\u2019s their girl. In a fight Abby is a walking tank. Police standard issue firearms may as well be spitball shooters as far as she is concerned. Abby could wreck a city block on her own. If there is a saving grace it's that the crocodilian is not that bright. She was not blessed with the same intellect as her sisters, it's possible all that extra brain power went to her marvelous body instead. Abigail is also the most playful and childish of the group. Many a policeman has found themselves under the gator\u2019s prodigious backside, struggling for breath as their heads are swallowed up by the cleft. They are usually found later, unconscious, and laying in an ass shaped crater. It's a demoralizing sight to this brickhouse of scales and teeth barreling down a city street but at least she doesn't bite...too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikes: Basking in sunlight, swimming, food, wrestling/sitting on people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDislikes: Responsibility, mean people, remarks concerning her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViper <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Age: 24 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Height: 5'5\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Weight: 126lbs <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eye Color: Yellow sclera, dark irises <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkin Color: Viper is covered in smooth, primarily rose red scales. Her lower jaw, the front of her neck, chest, belly, inner thigh, and the underside of her tail are pink-gray in color. Dark cherry colored ring-like patterns on Viper\u2019s skin run down the length of her spine and tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysical Appearance: Long red hair swept to one side in a punk-style. Thin and athletic. Lean, pear shaped figure. Defined musculature but not bulky. Modest sized breast, curvy hips, tight, round, bubble butt, long legs. Possesses a serpentine tail a foot longer than she is tall. Wears a black dudou ,and green and black stripped sleeves on her arms. Also wears black leggings that expose the toe and heel of her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbilities: Inhuman flexibility of skeletal structure. Uncanny contortionist. Viper can bend her limbs and contort her body in ways to bypass the limitations and obstructions that would hinder other creatures. Able to slip through small spaces (like the bars of a prison cell). Each limb is a potential strangulation tool. Acrobatics. Super human reflexes and sense of balance. Possess a non-lethal venomous bite that paralyzes victims. Naturally gifted martial artist. Can sense heat signatures. Can swallow large objects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacter Info: Cruel and violent. That about sums up Viper. Expanding on that, hailing from South Korea, Viper was, well, a female viper before the lab disaster gave her arms and legs. The snake is the trio\u2019s spy and infiltration specialist. She\u2019s selfish and ruthless, as she's sadistic, relishing inflicting pain on her enemies. If that were not enough, Viper is also extremely hot-tempered, as she can easily lose her temper at the faintest slight or blow received. The serpent is also sexually provocative; has a devious sense of humor and a foul mouth, often taunting her opponents before the fighting starts. Viper prefers to fight up close. She quickly closes the distance before laying the smack down on her target. This includes beating her opponent down in a viscous display of taekwondo. If the object of her ire is lucky though, Viper will simply paralyze them with her venomous bite. Rendering them helpless. Then she coils her tail or limber body around them and a good slow squeeze is all it takes to seal the deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikes: Sunbathing, fighting, torturing/toying with foes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDislike: being one-upped, weakness, shedding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimiko \u201cKim\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Age: 27 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Height: 5'8\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Weight: 145lbs <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eye Color: Violet  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkin Color: Kimiko\u2019s body is mostly covered in glossy green scales.

The angrier she gets, the more powerful her abilities become. Basically the only way to stop her is to break her focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacter Info: Kimiko is a special case. In the wild she was a skink, a tiny lizard native to Japan. When she was captured and taken from her homeland to the lab that held her future partners, she underwent extensive gene manipulation experiments in an attempt to create an actual dragon. Kim became an amalgamation of many different reptile species. Her base is still that of her original skink form, but she now possesses DNA from various other lizards, including the komodo dragon and some dinosaurs. Chiefly she resembles a tall lizard woman. As the leader of Viper and Abbie, Kim is calm and collected. All ways thinking. Calculating. There is a dark side to the lizard. Something that keeps even the wily Viper in line. The lizard believes she is destined to rule and her goal is to bring all the world underneath her heel as it\u2019s one true \u201cDragon Queen\u201d, starting with Glam City. However, a certain nuisance, a self-proclaimed hero in white has been standing in her way. This will not stand! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikes: Obedience, getting her way, sun bathing <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDislikes: The Pint Puncher, being denied, physical endeavors.</span></div></div>",

The people of the underground organization treated her and other abducted animals to cruel experiments with the intention of creating a drug that would alter cells to force and intensify evolutionary traits of various animals into other life forms to create super powered beings that they planned to use to force their rule over earth. Lor\u00eeta was eventually found to be the only creature able to survive the experiments and was made the sole guinea pig for the organization to further test on. A year after her capture, results began to show as the jackal's physique became anthropomorphic and gained an average human level of intellect. Her fur was golden yellow with two beige stripes that went down her back to her waist. The jackal stood four feet tall with a well toned, yet curvaceous body. She had relatively small breasts, but great beefy thighs. She also found that she had now possessed super strength and the gift of shape-shifting. After another year in captivity, she now stood at an even eight feet tall and had mastered her new abilities and used them to destroy the underground organization along with all the humans inside of it leaving only a crater behind. Lor\u00eeta's long experience in captivity had left a mental scar in her mind. Living most of her life in cages and operating tables in a heartless environment gave her a misanthropic view on life. Seeing all humans as evil and selfish creatures that she needed to rid the world of by using the powers they gave her as a weapon against them. She wandered the lands for a few months, laying waste to some small towns and villages in her path, before making herself home in a large cave in some foothills where she lived in relative solitude. Unbeknownst to Lor\u00eeta, she was residing in the outskirts of Glam City which was home to a certain boy wonder. Lor\u00eeta was shocked when one day she had come across another super powered creature, a t-rex by the name of Taurus who's life was parallel to her own, even having a mutual hatred towards humans. A close bond quickly grew between the two and Lor\u00eeta was introduced to a number of other super powered animals such as Helen, Quaker, Sabrina, Tallio and more. While the jackal was not fond of most of these other villains, perceiving them as big of a burden as humans were and even getting into scuffles with them, she did find their forms to be useful for her shape-shift into. Lor\u00eeta refined their forms in the hills with occasional sparring with some of the more tolerable villains and even learned to shape-shift into any villain almost instantaneously. She even discovered that she could even mimic others unique abilities when shifting into them, but was unable to access their full strength. Lor\u00eeta also found that shape-shifting took a toll on her. Prolonged use of her ability gradually drained her stamina and the bigger the form was, the faster her stamina was drained. Lor\u00eeta is able to endure most hits, but still remains weaker than the almighty Pint Puncher.  She had heard from the villains that there was a superhuman by the name of The Pint Puncher in a nearby city who made an oath to protect humanity. This angered Lor\u00eeta, who vowed to one day beat down this Pint Puncher and destroy Glam City. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"> The Great Gadali  </font><br>\r\n           <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom origins unknown, The Great Gadali is a five foot tall curvy fennec fox skilled in the arts of witchcraft. She is a millennia old witch dressed in a black off shoulder gown with a very spoiled personality. Gadali is seen more often than not traveling with her two giant feral pet grey wolves. A female wolf known as Lela and a male wolf referred to as Deacon are centuries old wolves tamed by Gadali and given magical enhancements to keep their bodies from aging as well as improve their size, strength and senses. The wolves both stand at seven feet on all fours and obey <u>any</u> command given to them by Gadali without hesitation. Gadali routinely torments the citizens by siccing on them her two subjects to trample, eat, smother, insert and stink up while she relishes in their suffering. Occasionally she will order her pets to bring back an unwilling human to indulge her in sexual acts. If the brawn of her wolves is not enough to take down her opponents, Gadali is able to place an alteration spell on them to transform them into twelve foot tall bipedal behemoths capable of toppling over skyscrapers in one swing. Lela and Deacon normally fight together, using their numerical advantage and overwhelming strength to bring down whoever dared to oppose their master. Gadali herself is no stronger than the average human and hugely depends on her wolves to pick up her slack. If forced to fight, the fennec can utilize a few spells such as teleportation, creating afterimages, size manipulation and temporary immobilization. </div></span></div></div>",

But first, she'd need to draw him out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the edge of the city, there's chaos. In the zoo, there's a certain hippos stamping about, a certain hippo whose appearance was a warning for everyone to run. The infamous Helen, the infamous stink-bomb, was sauntering through the zoo with a confident stride, the citizens fleeing as fast as they could. However, it seemed her saunter wouldn't go on for too long. She looked up in time to see the white comet that was the oncoming hero. The hero came in close, and soon stopped before her, crossing his arms. Helen rose a brow at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Do you normally just float around like a big dummy?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your game here, Helen?\" the Pint Puncher asked. \"You never show up unless money's involved, or unless you can beat on me.

And then at that, her body seemed to shimmer in a strange light. The Pint Puncher looked on confused, and witness as she transformed into a new form!

It seemed like a strange for a live turkey to wander about, but no-one seemed to mind as one ran towards a crowd, gobbling up a storm. In fact, a few kids seemed to laugh at it. The turkey spied all of the turkey being served at the restaurant, and when she was right in the middle of a crowd, she decided it was time to feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turkey started to shine gold, much to the surprise of the crowd. The parade even stopped as she shined. The light expanded, taking the vague shape of a 16 foot bbw. The light dispersed, and the crowd collectively gasped as they saw the infamous Debra. Before anyone could even scream and try to run, the large turkey squatted, and let loose a loud fart, a horrid, broccoli fueled stench wafting throughout the street. The crowd couldn't get away in time, and they all fell unconscious. Meanwhile, the fiendish Debra stood high and mighty, laughing a mighty laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cleaned one of the floats, leaving it like a large table on wheels for a big babe like her. She took the unconscious citizens and placed them carefully upon the newly cleaned float. She raided one of the restaurants of all their spices and sauces, headed over to the citizen, ad carefully spread the spices and sauces all over her soon to be meal, humming a cheery tune as she did. While she was spreading them, the float suddenly split apart, Debra stumbling back in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the dust cleared, Debra spied a familiar boy in white spandex, wearing a cape and a mask.

She rubbed her gut jiggling it almost tauntingly at the Pint Puncher. \"And maybe I'll have to add you to it!\" She lifted her hands up and let her big gut plop down, her stomach jiggling about. \"Besides, I've still got some gas in the tank.\"</span></div></div>",

Her feathery fingers dug deep between her cheeks and pushed the hero in further. His head was pushed towards the source of the rumbling and sputtering noises. Little light shone in the depths of the villain's buttcrack, but whatever ray of sunshine poked in revealed the horrors ahead. Before him lay the turkey's foul pucker, relentlessly muttering and releasing its foul payload. It twitched erratically and when the supervillain pushed the hero against it's slimy smooth surface the pucker opened. A dark passage lay before him and he was powerless to resist the turkey pushing him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want the heat turned up in the oven? I will gladly provide you, little hero.

With patience and gentle pushing the turkey overcame her hesitation and pushed the hero into her ass completely. With a sigh of relief she sat back, blocking the exit for the weakened superhero. Her plan to expose him to the purest form of her gas was given an extra dimension with his every movement. Each powerful clench of her colon forced the air from the puny hero's lungs. Whenever she relented he reflexively sucked in a lungful of her fart gas, choking and coughing on the vile stench. It all proved exceedingly stimulating for her, prompting her only to flood the hero's cramped prison with more farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, here's the heat. Happy roasting, punchy!\" She taunted as she released an inhumanly strong fart. Any nearby creature without superpowers would be floored immediately. The Pint Puncher merely got pushed halfway out, but Debra's ass had taken a liking to its prisoner. Instead of assisting him on the way out the powerful muscles now clamped down to prevent his escape. Worse yet, the monstrous turkey butt began to pull him back in. Each time the clenching pucker relented a powerful force dragged his body inside. With her captive sucked back into her rear she resumed the torment. The most noxious and foul gas was pumped into the cramped space holding the hero. The brute force of her clenching butthole forced him to breathe it in. Her foulest gases were the only breathable thing in there. Under such duress, what hope does he have? </span></div></div>",

To the Pint Puncher's horror, the owner of the sound was none other than the other infamous people eater. In came a large boar, wearing wrestling shorts. This was Borris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for leaving me a buffet, thanksgiving roast,\" Borris said as he stomped in, looking at the trail of downed humans she left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off, pig!\" Debra shouted at him. \"These are all mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should know what happens to anyone who keeps me away from my meal,\" Borris threatened. \"Just like that tiny hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, you can have that brat there, and I can have the rest of this crowd,\" Debra argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fine,\" Borris said, fingers crossed behind his back. The two turned towards the Pint Puncher, a hungry look in both of their faces. The Pint Puncher kept up his stance, thinking he could handle whatever the two smelly villains they could bring.</span></div></div>",

The hero realized what was about to happen and struggled even harder. She held him close to her but, grunted, and blasted him with a foul, broccoli fueled fart. The Pint Puncher groaned out in disgust as her foul gasses choked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I've done that plenty of times,\" Borris said. \"Though that smells like a flavor I should try applying sometime.\" Debra held the hero by his ankles and dangled him in front of her face, grinning cruelly at the weakened hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for the tenderizing?\" the turkey asked.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The main character is a young, human male that one day got the power of super strength and flight. Being able to live out his superhero fantasies, he adorns a white full body spandex and white wrestler mask and blue cape, and saves the day as the Pint Puncher. Unfortunately, it seems that the phenomenon that gave him his powers also gave animals super powers. Worse still, they seem like they want to use them for evil. They all earned the ability to walk upright and talk and understand human language, but they each have a super power specific to them. Now, in addition to the normal criminals, the Pint Puncher has to worry about great big monsters that want to eat him, squish him, stink him, or otherwise humiliate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEncouraged practices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Vore<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Stench play<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Squishing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Undressing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Tongue play<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Size play<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Domination<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Don't write in blood or gore. You can allude to a character meeting their end, but don't actually write about them wasting away in some creature's stomach or reduced to a stain underneath a creature. Also, don't write about broken limbs or bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The villains can only be super powered animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Make sure stories don't end to abruptly. For example, there is a character called Borris who's able to inhale many things and seeks to swallow the Pint Puncher. If you write that he manages to inhale the hero, don't have him swallow him outright. Extend the torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. During character selection, make sure there's always an option for someone to add in another set of villains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Villains can be male or female, large or Pint Puncher sized. But they must always be able to walk upright and be able to speak and understand human speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Villains can team up. If you so chose, you can have villains team up with villains from a set of villains later in the villain selection. For example, if you so choose, in the Hank chapter route, you can have Muro come in for an assist.<br>\r\n-That being said, I won't allow repeat team ups. For example, if in the Hank route you have Muro come in for an assist, in the Muro route, you can't have Hank come in for an assist<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Villains may not even be real or living animals. If you wish, bring in dragons or dinosaurs, etc. Just make sure they aren't human or part human, so no minotaurs or centuars, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. The Pint Puncher can't perform sexual moves. He just sticks to strategic planning, flying, and hitting hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. Unless under mind control, the Pint Puncher isn't willing in any of their acts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNEW: Two new events have begun!
