Luckily, your girlfriend Alex was nice enough to come over and help. \"Hey, I found something really weird.\" she said. You walked over to her, and she was holding what looked to be a very old book. \"This is like something out of Harry Potter. Wanna check it out?\" she asked. You said sure, as you could use a break. You went your room, as she sat on your bed. \"Huh, this thing said it is filled with magic spells. Where the hell would your family get this from?\" You shrugged, as you didn't know where it came from either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this one sounds interesting.\"</span></div></div>",

She said the chant, and gave it a few minutes. You then noticed her hair was a different color. Instead of her usual brunette color, she now had a bright purple. \"It worked! This book is legit. What else could be in here.\" she said. You wanted to stop her, but she said another chant. You asked what it that one does, but then you started to shrink. After a few seconds, you were now as tall as she was. However, when you looked to her, she had grown to your previous size. \"That one swaps sizes with another person. I'm finally tall!\" she said. You looked at her with annoyance, and she felt bad. \"I'm sorry baby, but this is so cool. Please let me keep this for a bit, and you can do something to me okay?\" she said. She gave her usual look, and you gave in. \"Yay, and I will make you dinner too. Come one lets go do that.\"</span></div></div>",
