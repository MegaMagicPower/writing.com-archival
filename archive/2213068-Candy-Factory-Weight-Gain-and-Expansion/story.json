With nothing to lose, the town's Mayor had accepted the offer, and now, after a surprisingly quick construction, the factory was fully up and running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one month, the factory was almost fully staffed, though still recruiting from the local population. Several new \"Expansive Candy\" stores had appeared throughout the town overnight, fully stocked and ready to start selling. Already, the candy had been a big hit, with the new stores completely selling out after their first day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJob vacancies had appeared just as quickly as the factory; almost two hundred vacancies for the townspeople to apply for. These had included anything from cashiers, office workers and taste testers to engineers and salespeople. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the factory gears up for mass production, the townspeople are about to undergo a transforming experience...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Characters:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lucy: <br>\r\n</b>Job: Just starting a job in the offices of the Factory. <br>\r\nAge: 24<br>\r\nAppearance: Red hair, slender figure with large breasts. <br>\r\nPersonality: Lucy has jumped between jobs since finishing college, and thought the office job at the factory sounded pretty simple. She tends to lose concentration easily and can be a little lazy. She is very friendly and outgoing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Allyson: <br>\r\n</b>Job: Just starting a job at a candy store as a sales assistant. <br>\r\nAge: 21<br>\r\nAppearance: Brown hair, curvy figure. <br>\r\nPersonality: Allyson has just finished college and wants to save up enough money to go travelling before she moves on with her career. She is very intelligent, and can be quite reserved. She figured this would be an easy way to make money and isn't really that excited about the job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Megan: <br>\r\n</b>Job: Just starting a job as a factory worker. <br>\r\nAge: 23<br>\r\nAppearance: Black hair, very slim. <br>\r\nPersonality: Megan is a naturally curious and innovative person. She loves finding out how things work and is a good engineer and very technologically skilled. She was very excited to get a job on the factory floor fixing their candy making machines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lana: <br>\r\n</b>Job: Just starting a job working as a company taste tester. <br>\r\nAge: 21<br>\r\nAppearance: Pink hair, slightly curvy build. <br>\r\nPersonality: Lana is very quirky, frequently a comedian among her friends with a dry, sarcastic sense of humour. She shares an apartment with her friend, Rachel, and noticed that the taste tester job was the best paid job at the factory, so thought it would be easy money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr create your own...</span></div></div>",

Truth is, this was Lucy's 10th job in under a month. She has been looking for something pretty simple but things have not been working out that way. While she was normally very friendly to other people and usually having a hyperactive personality to match it, she was, in no other meaning of the word, lazy. She's always been someone who lost focus easily, even when doing the simplest task such as getting coffee for others or typing up reports and spreadsheets. \"Okay...almost done. And...seeennnddd.\" she said pressing send before falling asleep right there at her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, she soon awoke with a yawn before realizing she was alone and the lights were out. \"Oh...must have fallen asleep. How embarrassing.\" she said as she got up. \"Well, I guess I better get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, since Lucy was still a new employee, she had no idea about the factory's layout and ended up going to... </span></div></div>",
