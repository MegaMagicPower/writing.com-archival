But eventually with the help of their friends, Dojima, and Teddie, the two young women were able to be more public about their relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one fall afternoon Chie was at her usual eatery of choice, Junes, chowing down on her second piece of steak. Yukiko was beside her and Yosuke was on his break, sitting across from the pair with a gleam in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing her latest bite, Chie glared at her friend/pain in the rear Yosuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that look for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just wondering if you'd like to make a little wager,\" Yosuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie spared a glance at Yukiko. Her girlfriend nodded slightly, intrigued at the possibilities that could arise from whatever Yosuke was planning. Plus she thought Chie was even more adorable when she was getting worked up at Yosuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle whatever it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying you'd be able to handle not eating steak for two full weeks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kung fu fan's eyes widened for a moment before narrowing once more. Go without steak? Could Bill Gates go without his computer? Could Washington have gone on without his wooden teeth? Shaking her head at her outlandish comparisons, Chie soon nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll do it. But if I win  you have to treat me to a steak buffet here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only fair. And if I win you have to dress like a girly girl for a whole school day, comprende?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie nodded and the two shook hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke then removed Chie's plate out from under her and the young woman saw red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Yukiko could hold her girlfriend back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starting right now, Chie. Good luck!\" Yosuke then walked off, a smirk lighting up his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Chie was sufficiently calmed down, Chie looked at Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't eat here anymore, can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie's shoulders drooped then and her face fell but Yukiko soon lifted it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Chie, we can eat at....\"</span></div></div>",

Chie got a confused look on her face. \"What's that?\" She asked as they left June's. \"It's a Mexican read restaurant that sells great fish tacos!\" Chie stopped walking, put her hands on her stomach and stuck out her tongue. \"Fish tacos? That's sounds horrible!\" Yukiko laughed. \"No, no they're really good... they kind of taste like stake!\" Chie's eyes lit up. \"They taste like stake?\" Asked Chie. \"Yes.\" Replied Yukiko \"So I can eat them and I won't lose the bet?\" Chie was starting to get excited. \"Yes.\" Yukiko said again. \"What are we waiting for?! Yosuke took away my steak before I was full!\" Chie took off running and Yukiko chased after her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lied to me, this taste nothing like stake!\" Chie had taken her first bite out of her first fish taco and she was let down by the taste. \"I know, I'm sorry I lied I just wanted you to try something new, but if you don't like it I can get you something else.\" Chie took another bite out of the taco before replying. \"I said it doesn't taste like stake I didn't say I don't like it!\" Chie took another bite and Yukiko laughed and took a bite out of hers. As they continued to eat Yukiko started to get full but Chie did not. In fact she started to eat even faster and for every one that Yukiko ate Chie ate two and a half! \"Wow you must really hungry!\" Yukiko marveled at the sheer amount of food that Chie had eaten. \"Yeah I guess so, normally if I are this much meat I would be full, but I guess the same doesn't go for fish.\" Chie looked at Yukiko and saw that she was staring at something, her stomach. Chie looked down and saw that her stomach was poking out from underneath her green jacket. \"Oh no,  I should stop I'm getting bloated,\" Chie pulled down her jacket to try to cover her stomach and looked over toward Yukiko's stomach. \"And you're getting bloated too!\" Chie added. \"Hey I was trying to keep up with you, and I-I kind of like feeling full and your big belly kind of looks cute!\" Chie's eyes went wide with shock. \"Yo-you do? Because sort of like it too!\" Chie blushed a bright red. \"Then how about we....</span></div></div>",

She needed to see if she couldn't beat the beef bowl record, but more importantly it just gave her an excuse to eat meat. Lots and lots of meat over multiple days as she trained to beat the record. Chie clasped her hands together, rubbing her palms as she forgot having just recently considered swearing off meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh it smells so good. ...Wow, what's come over me?\" Chie said aloud, thinking about her sudden boost in appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nonchalantly shrugged it off, picking up a juicy hunk of meat and throwing it in her mouth, savoring the taste as she chewed it up, She dug through the deep bowl with her chopsticks, seeing if she couldn't add some rice to go with it, to balance out the greasy, delicious chunk. She took a quick gulp of her soda, saving it so she could make room just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uurrrp!\" <i>Man is it me, or is this bowl really starting to grow on me?</i> Chie thought after a belch as she realized how her palate was practically dancing with the meaty flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if something was happening, like her greater food intake was somehow making her more gluttonous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Nah, that couldn't be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie continued to dig into the bowl sitting in front of her. She was eating faster now, noticeably, but she didn't really seem to see it or maybe she was just too into her meal to really bother caring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished the bowl within about three minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn...half a minute too slow...</i> Chie thought, failing to cover her mouth as another unladylike belch passed her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Another\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised the man at the counter as they brought Chie another bowl. She, this time, did what was considered unthinkable for the Rainy Day Special. Chie planted her face right in the bowl, chowing down as she ate and ate and ate, the food inside disappearing within moments as the food vanished into her mouth, down her throat and into her growing, bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Another.\" Chie said with a serious tone, a ravenous glare to her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd another bowl was brought...and another...and another...Chie only continued to glut herself, stuffing her mouth full of food in an almost mindless manner. As she ate, of course, the bowls took their toll on her body. Fat piled on, expanding her stomach into a soft doughy mass, making her face round, plump and cherubic with a second, flabby chin, swelling her breasts into large, fat spheres and of course her ass was pumped full of cellulite as it grew and grew under the gluttonous girl along with thickening legs, the fat oozing over her seat as it failed to contain it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she grew and still Chie ate. Even as she outgrew her clothes, Chie ate more. Even as she felt the stool give out under her, she used her fat ass as a substitute seat. Even as they began to reach closing hours at Aiya, Chie belched and forced her way past the counter, into the stock room, and gleefully stuffed her face with the raw ingredients. Even as the employees tried to stop her, annoyed and perturbed by her demeanor, they couldn't do much about Chie as her blobby, lard-filled form spread outwards. Juices and grease form the meats she ate and the stocks and broths she drank spilled on her due to her careless gluttony, filling and pooling in her folds and increasing number of chins. Chie's body blew out more and more, filling the room with it's quivering bulk as she finally ate out the whole back room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BBUUUUURRRP!! Ah man that was good! Best meal I UUurrrp! Had in a while!\" Chie smiled, closing one eye as she stuck her tongue out and pat her belly. She waddled out the back doors somehow, leaving the cooks in despair as they stared at the empty room. That was when they realized Chie left without paying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie stretched her doughy arms, watching the sun set as she flooded a section of the streets with her flowing flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahhh~ Man I could use a nap...or maybe a quick snack first...\" Chie paused.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps her meat-loving mind had been slightly warped by her astounding show of hunger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case she was still thinking over her next course of action when she felt a slight breeze blow all around her glorious form. Strange she usually went everywhere with her signature green jacket, so what could be the problem?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breeze almost serving as a sign intensified for a moment a slight chill surging through her dough-like back, confused she reached for her back despite her best efforts she was unable to so due to the hundreds of pounds in her arms alone. Frustrated she allowed her thick limbs to fall to her sides her fingertips rubbing upon the edges of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn instinct she shifted her vision downward her chins colliding into one another as the neck sunk into the rest of her enormous form. She didn't seem to mind that what she did mind however was that she was stark raving nude!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the other girls would have most likely died of embarrassment, especially Yukiko, and while Chie wasn't shrieking like a violet the realization that she was nude, not so much how ridiculously fat she had become, made her panic for a good minute or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to find something anything to at least cover her massive breasts, massive...breasts...No! She shook her mind clear of those thoughts now wasn't the time she had to find some cover!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around she wondered what she could her eyes eventually coming across a pair of trash cans. Wobbling on over the ground quaking with each of her footfalls Chie grabbed a hold of a single can and using what muscle she had buried underneath the tremendous amount of fat she crushed the entire can into a disc-like shape. She repeated the process with the other afterwards with a bit of an adjustment here and there Chie was able to effectively cover the tip of her now huge breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't much but it was something and that's what counted. She'd have to live with the fact that her fat-filled butt was exposed while thankful that her belly was thick enough to cover her greater feminine area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done Chie could return to deciding wither to get one more quick snack or sleep off her previous meal?</span></div></div>",

She normally would have thought herself horrified, freaked out of her mind. But the cascading, flowing fat just seemed to have an uncanny allure to it, like ancient gold. And like ancient gold, that allure brought forth terrible greed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's still plenty of hours in the day...I need to get more food in me before I sleep.\" Chie said to herself. Lifting her thick, blubbery legs with surprising ease, Chie managed to walk in spite of her incredible size, which must have been about five tons at most! Her body wobbled with each step as she looked down, her grand self shaking sending some sort of electricity through her mind. Chie shook her head as she tried to get her mind off...whatever this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her belly with gluttonous desire, Chie finally stopped down the road at the small cafe that served steak croquettes. They were just about to close, when the woman who worked the counter turned her head. When she saw Chie's massive form looming over, she nearly fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuhhh...can I get...basically whatever you have left over for the day?\" Chie asked as she rubbed the back of her head with her left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman just nodded fearfully, assuming that based on Chie's size if she'd wind up being her snack. Chie was a meat lover yes, but gluttonous as she was she wasn't a cannibal. Everything the woman brought out, unsurprisingly, Chie chowed down on within mere moments. She was petrified as she could actually see Chie becoming fatter and fatter with each mouthful. The woman at the counter feared being engulfed by Chie's fat, holding a hand out to shield herself somehow, but...the moment her hand touched the uncannily soft skin she felt something spark within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRRPPP!! Oh man that was great~ Just what I... Aaaawww~ Needed...\" Chie said drowsily, interrupting herself with a yawn as she rubbed at her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh...time for bed I guess. ...Can't sleep here though, I'll block traffic. I could always sleep by the flood plains, then I'd be out of everyone's way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie waddled off, causing the woman to collapse on her face as she fondled Chie's flab. Chie found herself able to cover a surprising amount of ground now that she saw how fast she was actually moving, making it to the flood plains only slightly faster then normal, actually. Chie found the humid airs of the plains pleasant on her thick, fatty form, sitting herself down slowly, the bottom of her creamy belly spreading out further as it sat atop her blubbery legs, pressing her massive breasts against her face and thick chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep tight~\" Chie muttered before drifting off to pleasant dreams.</span></div></div>",

What if this time was no different and her shadow self got a hold of the other girls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo shaking those thoughts away Chie realized she couldn't get any of them involved, least of all her dear friend Yukiko.

Besides she liked her bed and didn\u2019t wish to flatten it to pieces\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day come morning her mother was actually quite surprised at the hefty breakfast Chie had made for herself, of course the woman knew her daughter to have a large appetite (she always equated it to her child being a \u201cgrowing girl\u201d), but this meal was rather large even for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not wishing to pry she trusted Chie and soon enough saw her off\u2026although she did seem to notice something seem different about Chie, the blonde girl had this new aura of proud confidence if she had to label it\u2026still she trusted in her daughter\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way to school Chie smiled as she subconsciously balled up one of her fists only to open it up once more after getting a better feeling of the new amount of strength that flowed within her. One couldn't even begin to imagine the power she now possessed by just looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike her shadow before her Chie had concealed herself in her usual everyday body shape, looking no more different then she had in days past, it was best to retain this form for a while so that no one would be the wiser to what had happen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing a hand over her straight as a line stomach however did make her miss her bigger now more natural body\u2026but there would be plenty of time for that later, right now it was best she stay in disguise and begin her plan of finding a worthy opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust outside the gates she began to wonder just how she was going to do such a thing, no one at Yasogami was as big as she was and being the competitive type that she was Chie didn\u2019t want her fights to be complete squashes. No she wanted to prove herself and prove she had the strength the power to protect everyone she held dear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that begged the question who or what could contest against her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen an idea struck her, it was rather ridiculous in theory but maybe\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy shadow was able to create meat products that were highly addictive and highly fattening I wonder if I can\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held that thought dashing toward any near location where she couldn\u2019t be seen to well. Hiding behind a well-sized and heavy shade-giving tree Chie balled up her fist once more this time however instead of a mild flex she concentrated on food, more importantly she focused on meat in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggled for a while until at last she felt an object of sorts begin to form within her hand, upon completion Chie came to notice that she had seemingly created a patty with her mere thoughts! She smiled for it smelled divine, was obviously juicy-looking, and cooked to perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take her long to devour it down. It truly was perfect and was all the proof she needed to be convinced that she did in fact inherit her shadow\u2019s newest ability. Admittedly she should have seen that coming due to the fact that like her shadow she could alter her weight and size to whatever she saw fit, she chuckled a tad for once poking fun at her own absentmindedness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless she now had a way of \u201ccrafting/molding\u201d a challenger but who should get the \u2018honor\u2019?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako was an obvious choice, the girl was already large but somehow unless she was truly desperate the often lazy and ill-tempered fatty wasn\u2019t that high of a selection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo Chie needed to use someone else. Maybe someone unexpected like Yumi or Ai, perhaps someone like Rise it would be interesting to see how she\u2019d adjust to a bigger lifestyle, then again there was Naoto could her food-making skills actually sway a mind as strong as hers? Of course there was also Yukiko\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! She shook away the thoughts of using her longest and closest friend no Yukiko wasn\u2019t an option by any means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill class was starting and soon she\u2019d have to decide on whom to seek out and use\u2026</span></div></div>",

Was something the matter, did you see anything strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I had forgotten the homework and was wondering if you remembered, I asked Yosuke to give it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's all, sorry musta dozed off.\" Chie chuckled before letting herself fall onto the chair, it sounded like it was about to break, Chie went a bit pale, she forgot she could hide her APPEARANCE of being fat, but she's still quite large in reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This school needs some new chairs!\" Chie chuckled once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lunch time hit Chie got up, she needed to bait Rise now, she told Yukiko that she wanted to see Rise for some 'guy tips' Yukiko understood and Chie went up to the roof and set the bait, a nice greasy fattening burger with slices of roast turkey on the side, she stole a slice for herself and got Rise. \"So Rise I was wondering, what do you think of you and me having a little sumo match, nothing big. Just having fun and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno Chie-sempai, do I have to gain any weight?\" Rise asked a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a smidgen, you won't notice it at all! I'll treat you to every meal.\" Chie said opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Semapi I...\" Rise was going to object when she got a whiff of the bait, the aroma was enough to melt away her argument and almost her desire to stay thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That smells wonderful!\" Rise drooled and walked over taking a bite out of the burger, the grease and juices dripped onto Rise's delicate fingers which she then licked to prevent even a drop of the burger being wasted. As she ate Chie took notice of how the school uniform was shrinking, then losing a button, Rise finished the burger and ate the Roast Turkey. The second button strained but kept on. The bell rung signaling Lunch was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it.\" Chie whispered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was AMAZING Semapi, did you make that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I did! I can give you more if you agree to sumo.\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise's doubt returned but licking some juice off her lips, she then said. \"Fine, shall I head over to your place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie realized that her mother couldn't see the food she makes for Rise, they don't have enough for what she has planned, so she'd get suspicious. \"How about your place instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me.\" Chie smiled, once school was over she'd head to Rise's place and stuff the Idol until she's ready for the sumo match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce school finished Chie headed straight for the Tofu shop.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before entering the shop she thought over how she was going to about things. Obviously fattening up Rise to her actual super heavyweight size was part of the plan but would the redhead be the only one to gain or for \u201cinsurance\u201d sake should she binge as well just so she\u2019d retain a bit of an edge over the soon to be plumped idol?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo\u2026while she was competitive and had willingly infused her very being with the abilities of her darker self Chie still had her honor. If she was going to go up against Rise she\u2019d make it so that for the most part the two of them were on equal footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought in mind she strolled into the tofu shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Rise was finishing up on a few things when she heard someone make their way in. A part of her already expecting the visitor and to her credit she was spot on. Chie came into the shop and she greeted the tomboy with one of her usual warm smiles. Chie responded with a kind greeting of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter explaining that her grandmother was out helping a few friends Rise made for the door with the intent of closing up early, she was given the okay to do so if wanted anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done Rise thanked Chie for coming over and followed up with a slightly embarrassed look that left her friend rather puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to be honest Sempai\u2026I was rather surprised at how good your cooking was. I mean all I know is how to make tofu and that\u2019s only because I follow grandma\u2019s notes and recipes to the limit. So have you been secretly practicing with a \u201cHow to\u201d book or something like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised by the question Chie stumbled a bit thinking up a decent excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh no not really just trying out a few things and well you know sometimes you get lucky right?\u201d Chie chuckled nervously hoping she could get away with her false statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky for her it seemed that Rise bought into it giggling alongside the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see well that explains it I guess. Anyway I\u2019ve been thinking about the match you want us to take part in\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh Chie hadn\u2019t really expected for the redhead to give it a second thought still she decided to play it cool and hear out what Rise had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thinking why you choose me and well I guess it wouldn\u2019t work out with the guys. I mean Kanji would beat up on anyone that would dare to call him \u201cfat\u201d, I can\u2019t see Yosuke-Sempai agreeing with the idea, I\u2019m not even sure if Teddie CAN gain any weight, and Souji-kun if he were still here\u2026he\u2019d lose his ho\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead coughed for a moment the same look of embarrassment reappearing, her soft cheeks almost matching her hair-color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie couldn\u2019t help but smile and giggle at the girl\u2019s emotion. She wasn\u2019t completely dense she (and most likely everyone else in their circle of friends) knew that Rise harbored feelings for their now departed team leader. The redhead at times didn\u2019t even attempt to hide such emotions and perhaps was the most affected when Seta had made his leave from town\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Rise-chan I\u2019d never do something like that to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise gasped with still something of a blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026heheh\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe coughed again trying to regain control over her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah as for us gals well good luck trying to convince Naoto-kun as for Yukiko-Sempai\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry she\u2019s out of the question.\u201d Chie burled out a little quicker then she had hoped, Rise raising an eyebrow in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s my best and oldest friend and I\u2019m not about to put her through any of this\u2026please understand Rise-chan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise thought it over for a moment before smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand completely, Sempai.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good I thought you\u2019d be mad with me.\u201d Chie stated chuckling as she could almost feel a few beads of sweat roll down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise shook her head giving a definite no then went on to say that she was eager to try out more of Chie\u2019s wondrous cooking, her way of shifting away from the current conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie in ways remembering why she was here in the first place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving her free access to the home kitchen Rise stepped away to find a good place for her to relax and eat leaving Chie to pace around wondering how she should start in fattening up Rise.</span></div></div>",

So many that making them would require a lot longer then her instantaneous ones she can make with her new power, she needed something. Chie then realize, fries go good with steak, if cooked right, but then again Chie is a bad cook. That being said she realized she had plenty of time, so she tried making a batch of fries, when she tasted one, YUCK! It was soggy and too chewy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother batch, another failure, this time too hot to eat right away, last chance before Rise questions where he food was...Chie summoned her inner fatness, and prepared one last batch, she nibbled a fry, then consumed it whole! Tasty! She felt a gnat sized tremble in her stomach, when she channeled her 'inner fatness' she must have used some of the new magic, she must have gained half a pound from that fry alone, which given what she had intended for Rise would be PLENTY. Making 3 steaks she came out, she saw Rise on her knees waiting by a table. \"Perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie realized her position meant her belly would expand to under the table, not out in plain sight, didn't want Rise catching on to how big she was going to be. Chie placed the plate down. \"G-Gee Sempai, are you sure I can eat all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can Rise-chan! Go on, try them.\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise trusted Chie and took a fry first, she ate half of it, silence followed by Rise putting her hands on her cheeks smiling. \"SO GOOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie sighed happily as Rise scarfed down the fries, while chewing them she cut the steak on top, a gulp of the fries and she bit down onto the steak, she froze for a moment before dropping her fork onto the plate, tears filling her eyes. \"It's so...heavenly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was wonder just how good her food was, to her it was good but to Rise it's like she was in Nirvana! Chie thought little of it and watched Rise devour the steaks and fries, the sounds of chewing and the feeling of bliss distracted Rise from her attire ripping, the bottom of her shirt and the top of her pants, and a large gut sinking under the table. 'I'll go get you a drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks *URP* Sempai.\" Rise said blushing, Chie went into the kitchen fast, unzipping some of her jacket and rubbing the fat hidden in it looking at Rise's growing stomach, her thickening limbs, new chin forming and breasts almost breaking her bra. Chie loved this more then she should, getting a drink she handed it to Rise who downed it in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That felt good.\" Rise said eating the last of the steak, she yawned, Chie quickly got behind her realizing Rise was going to fall back and flip over the table with her stomach. Rise landed on Chie and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, close call.\" Chie said, she then carried Rise up to her room and tucked her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's it for today I guess...\" Chie went to leave when she turned and looked at the huge gut, could she really wait until Rise was ready at a reasonable rate? Or should she wake Rise up and do serious 'training'?</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s possible that she may very well protest against another stuffing, of course she could always agree but Chie wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to risk it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen like a spark of lightning dashing through the sky another idea came to her. What if she stuffed Rise in her sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly Chie was really curious about her new abilities her shadow had been very vague about them and even now it seemed to her that she had to learn about them through experimentation. In retrospect she <i>REALLY</i> should have had her other-self explain in detail what she was capable of after their merger. Regardless she thought might as well test out a bubbling theory\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rise\u2019s unknowing form slept soundly Chie stepped forward toward her a surprising sly grin on her face and a simple chocolate cupcake in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding right beside her Chie used her free hand to gently stroke and rub away at the big belly the pop idol now sported. Her grin never left as she watched and heard the redhead moan softly her in deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise opening her mouth just a bit was all she needed to quickly stuff the delicious treat into the unsuspecting redhead. Instinctively Rise swallowed moaning once more at the wondrous taste still very much asleep however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards Chie smiled a moment later had yet another cupcake in her hands and repeated the process. Just as before Rise ate what was given to her in doing so Chie swore she felt the creamy globe of a stomach expand just a few inches. Her smile grew a bit more after realizing she could very well stuff her friend without having her be awake or hell even aware of what was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the darkness was starting to get to her or maybe it was her competitive streak that wanted as Rise to be as good a challenge as she could be.

A polite burp later, after having hosed down an entire can of whip cream, Chie rubbed the edge of her exposed gut she was sure it would soon begin to grow out further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had definitely eaten enough to add about another hundred pounds to her already heavy frame. A mild chuckle leaving her lips as she felt her new poundage starting to add up getting bigger and heavier by the passing second as she grew however Chie remembered that after she was done it was best she\u2019d check up on Rise just so she could get a better look at the size difference between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet before she could even get to that she\u2019d be surprised in the next moment by\u2026</span></div></div>",

Rise-chan doesn\u2019t even remember ever being thin so much so she thought I was crazy for even bringing it up.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise continued to wander about oblivious to the blonde\u2019s thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Amazing, no this is fantastic! Yet another talent I\u2019ve discovered and with this anyone I change will never be able to remember a time when they were thinner. And if it worked with Rise\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSempai\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie blinked thrice before shifting her focus over to Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell good to have you back with me, Chie-sempai. That smile of yours and given what you said earlier, are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie quickly retorted that she was fine and that she just had a couple of things on her mind. Rise accepted the excuse not even bothering to think twice about it Chie\u2019s smile from before nearly made it's return but she held it back this time around in order to play along with the redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo when is our match?\u201d Rise repeated her question from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh um well I still don\u2019t have a date set. Still working a few things but don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll be sure to tell you once I have a solid date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie noticed the bit of disappointment in the plumped out redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She\u2019s really looking forward to it\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough however Rise returned to her bubbly state asking if the blonde would join her for another binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie rejected the offer though; ironic to her lie from earlier she did have a few things playing out in her mind at the moment, informing the redhead that she had a few things she had to take care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as before Rise bought into what Chie was selling. The blonde then bid farewell stressing that she would inform Rise of when their match would take place. Rise ever oblivious nodded and saw her friend off before returning straight back into the kitchen\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie came out of an alley, after making sure no one spotted her entering or exiting, looking as she did if she were back to her originally thin weight. For the moment her disguise was still needed so as to not raise suspicion from anyone she may know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise may have spotted her in her heavier form but the redhead was seemingly altered in mind to always believe that not only was she always fat but perhaps that so was Chie. A lucky break for her but out here she needed to stay \u201c<i>thin</i>\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued on her way her thoughts went back to Rise. Her food had convinced the pop idol that her days as a thin average-sized girl had in fact never existed instead everything she had ever done she had done as a very plus-sized woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Chie knew that if anyone were to catch sight of Rise an explanation or two would be required especially if one of their friends spotted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne specific friend came to mind and that was none other then Naoto Shirogane. If the detective prince laid eyes on the fatten idol the blunette would no doubt waste little time in seeking out the cause for the sudden weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grumbled for a moment pondering that perhaps if she knew then what she knew now she would have gone after Naoto first\u2026oh well it couldn\u2019t be helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the question was how to get to Naoto? Even she had enough sense to figure that the direct approach was rather risky. Where Rise was easier to work with Naoto was always at the top of her game Chie figured she had to be a little crafty with the younger yet more intelligent girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had to be a way of tricking Naoto into her hands\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she was reminded about her dark horse choices from before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe honestly had no idea where to find Ai and would most likely have to make her move come the next school day, no that was too long, but Yumi she recalled that along with being labeled a hard worker by Souji he had also mentioned that she had taken up a part-time job at Junes which wasn\u2019t too far from where she currently was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile appeared once more as the gears within her mind began to turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one side perhaps it was best she went after Naoto right this moment and see if she could somehow trick the girl into trying her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the opposite end however she was near Junes and while she admittedly didn\u2019t know much about Yumi she figured that working the raven-haired girl into having a taste of her special food would still be easier then doing so with Naoto. In the end not only would Yumi be fatten up and oblivious to ever being thin but maybe just maybe she could even use the young woman as a way to lure Naoto right into her hands\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t help but chuckle curious if Naoto, and possibly even Yumi, would be as eager to compete against her as Rise was after they were changed by her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all this was still in the spirit of competition\u2026wasn\u2019t it\u2026</span></div></div>",

Of course her breasts weren\u2019t spared from any sudden growth either the restrains she used on them burning into her flesh as her chest fought to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while Chie continued to stuff away like a maniac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Naoto-kun but I can\u2019t have you know the truth\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth what was she talking about?

There was only one way to do that, make Naoto so big she would never move again. Chie lost herself to her madness and made an entire cow's worth of steaks and burgers, taking them in hand she stuffed Naoto's mouth full, despite the amount being more then what most people consume in a week she swallowed it all, perhaps there were some physical alterations in there as well, another sign of Chie's powers growing more? Chie was too busy making a truck sized cake and shoving it down Naoto's mouth to really notice. \"Eat up Naoto....you look so famished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFamished? She was equaling Hanako at this point, her clothes were on their last seams, her tape on he chest was ripped and even her shoes were starting to tear, but to Naoto this was nothing new, after all she believes now she was BORN fat, and that she pigged out as a child. She remembered the first time she ate her weight in food, she remembers winning eating contests, she remembered at 13 the doctor telling her she'd be immobile by 16. A false memory that was going to become truth in a matter of minutes. \"So much food, better wash it down Naoto-kun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto was in a daze, not realizing what was going on where she was, or hell WHO she was at the moment, the shock combined with the memories of her life being changed forced this current condition on her, Chie got off the bloating body of her friend and formed a jug of cream, tall as her and wide as her fat self, she couldn't help but take a swig. A single gulp and she felt a good 20-30 pounds instantly, she smiled like a deranged killer and lifted the jug. \"Open wide Naoto-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in a hypnotic Trance Naoto listened, despondent and empty as the jug's tip went into her mouth and the fatty cream poured in, chug after chug Naoto's frame was less and less like it was before as her butt bulged out of her pants, her breasts pouring out and jiggling like waterbeds, and a sea of fat forming, her legs and arms sunk deeper and deeper into fat, her fingers and toes became thicker and thicker. \"There we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie lifted the empty jug and placed it down and began to admire her work. Naoto was now fat beyond belief. Immobile, unable to move of her own accord, her memories began to finish altering, to the point she has no recollection of actually willingly going into the TV world, that she just sat behind giving ideas and moral support as she binged on food. To Naoto Shirogane, she was always a useless blob of a girl, and her goal in life was to become the fattest detective ever. \"Chie-senpai. Is it time for my 4th dinner yet? I can't see my watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie chuckled like mad, it worked, it really did! She was helpless now. Naoto was now a helpess fat blob and Chie LOVED every second of it. \"Why Yes Naoto it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie grabbed Naoto and with her mighty strength lifted the Detective Pudge and carried her over to Rise's place, where she decided to hide all of her projects now. Chie got there and dropped Naoto inside. \"Rise-chan, Naoto came over for some dinner, mind being a dear and helping her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of Rise's heavy body came down and shook the place a bit as she walked in, seeming bigger then before, she looked at Naoto.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Chie was finishing her thoughts and moving on she saw a familiar red attire with long black hair on it. It was Yukiko Amgai, her long time friend. She looked a bit pleased to see Chie. \"Oh Chie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was at a loss, how many distractions can she have in one day? Perhaps it was Karma, but her friend walked up not a care in the world it seems. \"Oh Yukiko, didn't expect to run into you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well I was on my way to Rise's place.\" Chie froze, she couldn't have Yukiko see Rise and Naoto! She was the second smartest girl in the group, there was no way the truth would elude her that long, and Chie swore she wouldn't fatten her friend so altering her memories was out of the question. She needed to act fast so she could only respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why do you need to see her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kanji wasn't sure if he remembered his homework and since Rise is in the same class I figured I'd ask while passing by and relay it to Kanji later over the phone.\" Yukiko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA solid reason, and one that she wouldn't deter from that easily, but Chie needed something, besides food that is, to stop Yukiko from walking in on two fattened friends. \"Oh you know I had lunch with Rise earlier and she mentioned she needed some supplies so she went to Junes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie felt calm now. \"Huh? I was sure I saw her head straight home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well maybe she forgot and went there halfway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right...\" Yukiko said a little confused by Chie's defense at all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then why don't we both go to Junes?\" Yukiko asked, Chie stopped dead in her tracks again! If she said 'No' she couldn't go after Yumi without risking Yukiko spotting her, but if she does go then the lie she just told will unravel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was winging it at this point so why not. \"S-sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked, Chie pondering what she must do, the easy way would go against her very principle, Yukiko was a valued friend she couldn't do that to her, or could she? Her eye changed color again, and Chie wondered, she felt amazing ever since she started this, Yukiko might too given enough persuasion. Chie was slowly losing herself to the idea, she then realized what was going on, she shook her head, she was slowly becoming more and more like her Shadow, as she did she got more powerful, already the law of conservation of matter was ignored by her, even memories were at her whim, whose to say what else she can't do if she obliges her Shadow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two reached Junes Chie needed to hunt down Yumi and decide what she'll do with Yukiko, and more importantly if she's willing to sacrifice more of herself to do so </span></div></div>",

She perished the thoughts of doing anything to Yukiko, that was her intent from they very beginning and she would stick to it. There was no power or no reasoning behind betraying Yukiko to her Shadow. Still she had lied to her and she needed to escape that while hunting for Yumi. \"Chie are you sure Rise said she'd be here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess she must have left. Why don't you just call her and ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be a bit much to walk all the way back just to ask.\" Yukiko said getting on her cell phone, she conversed with Rise, Chie monitoring it to make sure nothing funny happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation went as normal as could, before Yukiko hung up Chie stopped her. \"Hey mind if I gave Rise a message?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure.\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rise, how's everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Chie-senpai. Me and Naoto were just talking about how good your food was, will you be giving us anything again soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh maybe tomorrow after I finish up some work, but expect another entry to be arriving soon.\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Senpai.\" With that Rise hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Entry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just a little 'sumo' match if you can call it that. I conned Rise and Naoto into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, mind if I watch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Noooo, it's just for fun and the more people that come well the more attention it might cause...wouldn't want to ruin anyone's reputation over something that's just for fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....\" Yukiko said a bit confused by all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie is there something you're not telling me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not.\" Now that she thought about it Chie was keeping one eye closed the whole time. Something was amiss and she knew it, however Yukiko knew that with Souji gone Chie wasn't herself, maybe this was coping. She decided to end her questioning there for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I better get going.\" Yukiko said leaving, Chie sighed so hard it almost made her fat burst from her jacket, but she calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew glad that situation is over.\" Chie said to herself, now then onto the important matter at hand, Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recollected from what Souji said is that she had short black hair and was quite slender. Chie gave a quick scan, she saw nothing in the grocery department, nor electronics, however her search came to an end when she found a woman fitting the bill resting at a table. She didn't know for sure, but her gut (no pun intended) instinct said it was her. Chie needed a way to confront Yumi now, this was a much easier situation then the Naoto one so more options were available this time around. She still needed to act fast as she was obviously on break and Chie didn't know how long that would last</span></div></div>",

After all she didn\u2019t really know who Chie was so unlike with Naoto or Rise earlier there was really no reason to go completely postal as far as the feeding went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for now her best smile was all that was needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Ozawa-san right? Hi there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a tad bit startled the raven-haired young woman shifted her vision from high above to more in Chie\u2019s approaching direction. As Chie had expected Yumi wasn\u2019t exactly sure who it was that was calling out to her although she had to admit the person did seem a little familiar she just couldn\u2019t place it is all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello\u201d she responded rather curiously, \u201cDo we know each other?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly well not on a personal level anyway\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie went on to introduce herself the moment she did so her name suddenly became a little clearer to Yumi. She had indeed heard of Satonaka from Souji as well from what she had heard during the school hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn athletic as hell tomboy who ironically wasn\u2019t a part of any sport team, was never without her usual green-colored jacket, and had a strong liking for steaks or any meat products in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat aside Yumi couldn\u2019t help but wonder what it was that Chie wanted from her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d introduce myself to you since I hear you too were kind of close with Souji-kun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde instantly caught sight of the other girl\u2019s eyes lighting up when Seta\u2019s name was dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you and a few others were really close with him weren\u2019t you.\u201d She said in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup so when I saw you here I figured what the heck might as well go say hi.\u201d Chie smiled her best, non-corrupted, smile once again attempting to wrap someone around her empowered fingertips\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them chatted for a short while coming to better understand one another as well as sharing memories of Souji. Even with her plan still well in mind Chie could see that his departure had also pulled away at the heartstrings of Yumi\u2019s heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed quickly attempting to re gather her own thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey if you have time why don\u2019t I go get us something to eat?\u201d Chie asked her mindset and focus now back to where they should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at her wristwatch Yumi realized she still had a bit of time and agreed to a quick meal. It was all Chie needed to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat. Anything in particular?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo not really. Surprise me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting on her lower lip Chie did her best to stiff a near sudden chuckle. Oh she was going to surprise Yumi alright\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcusing herself Chie stated she\u2019d be right back while Yumi cheerfully awaited her return with their meals. Glancing over from side to side Chie had to make sure no one was watching her before she found a store corner decent enough for her to sneak into and craft her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later she returned with two food trays in hand.</span></div></div>",

Or better yet get  this, never seen these at Junes before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, the food didn't look like the Junes norm. Chie had gotten, well made but Yumi didn't know that, each of them a whole pizza, 2 foot long hot dogs, fries, onion rings, and milkshakes. Yumi was stunned that Chie would even think that either of them could put it all down. She didn't want to insult Chie's kindess so he decided to start with the fries, the moment she bit into one she froze as Chie casted a shadowy glaze at the young woman, she smiled as already a paunch of fat appeared with just one bite. \"It seems my power is growing as I do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as Yumi shoveled the fries and onion rings down, like a slob, the grease and salt getting on her fingers, and without warning a gut growing out of her shirt, Chie could barely contain her excitement as when Yumi finished just the mere appitizers she was already sporting a belly big enough to fit the table if Yumi so wished. \"Why? Why am I so hungry? Why? T-that's right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi remembered the days she acted in front of a mirror, and each passing second she remembered herself being fatter. She moved onto the foot longs, and sips of the milkshake between bites to cool her mouth from the mustard. Her arms became thicker, her legs following, her breasts and cheeks swelling. She was clearly getting fatter, already within 2 minutes tearing the clothes she wore and she wasn't even halfway done, she finished the hot dogs, which were like sticks compared to her plump fingers which she sucked on to get the grease off. \"S-So good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi was mesmerized and Chie had the most evil smile, watching Yumi begin to struggle to lift the Pizza. The young actor bit down, and her gut jiggled as it expanded, the chair she was sitting on snapped like weakened wood and she broke the concrete under it! She was reaching Naoto's weight level, Chie looked at her hands realizing how much her power evolved as Yumi began on the Pizzas, once she did she fell backwards belching, now equal to Naoto and Chie couldn't help but rub the bloated gut, she looked into Yumi's eyes, seeing she was in the process of her memories being altered. \"Well, that's 3 down two to go...two...no...one...? Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie shook her head, little did she know she was going to change soon as well.</span></div></div>",

How she had strive so hard to show that even a girl as big as her could properly act out any role given to her and how Souji had befriended and treated her so kindly despite the size difference between the two\u2026as well as her enormous binging after his departure\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAah\u2026no it\u2019s just one not two\u2026I\u2019ll never involve Yukiko in this\u2026\u201d muttered Chie as she could feel a burning sensation flowing all across her body the epicenter being in her left eye not even having a moment to consider herself lucky that Yumi was in a dreamland of sorts so the raven-haired woman couldn\u2019t make out her mental struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clutched the left part of her face nearly biting down on her tongue in the process growling in frustration the blonde girl suddenly grabbed a hold of the table with her free hand\u2026then proceeded to fling it aside as if it were a piece of cardboard! Her strength obviously having grown along with the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood flew everywhere as the poor piece of furniture sailed through the air landing who-knows-where, not that it concerned Chie in slightest. Still grasping at her eye Chie took a few sharp breathes the mental strength needed to keep her power from completely controlling over her was starting to become more and more taxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later despite her breathing still heavy she removed her hand to reveal that her eye had altered once again into a golden state. She was well aware of this however and with one last struggle forced it back into the standard hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around her breathing shifted into a more controlled state she had fought off her temptations but something still felt off\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise she heard a woman shriek nearby! A simple brunette stood in shock at the strange scene before her, food tossed every which way a massive blob of a woman lounging about and a much smaller blonde woman with a surprised look on her face. Was she the cause of all this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit Chie hadn\u2019t really expected a random bystander but unlike with Naoto this time around she kept her cool in fact she even smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unknown woman gasped as the blonde girl seemingly disappeared in a cloud of smoke\u2026only to reappear behind her and force a pastry of all things down her throat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her around in the opposite direction Chie shoved the young woman, now with a bit of a potbelly poking out of her blouse, away. Somehow Chie knew the girl\u2019s memories would be altered into not only believing her sudden gain was no big deal but that she'd have no recollection of what she just saw or experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie chuckled as she realized she now had a way of dealing with any sudden onlookers that would stumble upon her or her fatten friends. Just a few extra pounds and they\u2019d remember nothing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she wasn\u2019t blind to the fact that she had gain a method of teleportation in the same manner that her shadow had used back in the TV world. She assumed that\u2019s what felt different about her after she had regain control over herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring over at Yumi Chie figured that the girl may come around soon just as Naoto did after she was stuffed to hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBest make my way back then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor kicks she teleported back toward Yumi\u2019s stranded form as she did she couldn\u2019t help but be curious as to how far she could go with this new ability and if she could potentially teleport more then just herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless looks like it was time for Rise to have yet another guest over for a quick bite and even if she couldn\u2019t warp herself and Yumi all the way over toward the tofu shop Chie still had the means to stop anyone who could ask any questions about Yumi\u2019s stunning new size.</span></div></div>",

You just do what I say and everything will be fine, alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde smiled as if what she had just said was the simplest thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way I locked you out I...wait a second...you're Satonaka aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you and Amagi, everyone's always talking about the two of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious Chie allowed her to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personally I don't see what's so interesting, what everyone sees in Amagi, or what she sees in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie muffled a low growl as she felt her shadow eye begin to flare up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly what do you have that all the others even Risette or the detective prince included don't have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Keep talking' Chie thought as her anger rose and so did the pain in her altered eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing you have nothing you are nothing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last Chie had enough and before Ai could blink the blonde girl found herself pressed back first onto a nearby wall. She attempted to struggle her way lose panic-stricken that Chie had caught her by the throat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you want to talk that way about Yukiko in front of me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of Chie's pure golden eye terrified the poor girl never more so then she already was, a strong part of her almost felt like fainting right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to make this real easy and perhaps have a little fun at the same time but now...no I'm just\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...I'm sorry please don't kill me!\" Ai pitifully begged through her sudden interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill you? No I'm going to do something far worse to someone like you. It's almost a shame you won't remember a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please no I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pleas of forgiveness suddenly cut short as a burger of all things was stuffed down her mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie's anger began to subside slightly as Ai's resistance began slow down as she was continuously stuffed. She was already looking rather portly but Chie wasn't about to forget what Ai had stated about Yukiko. She'd never let someone have the right of talking about her best friend like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ai-chan I don't know if you can hear me but we're going to play a little game. It's real simple really I'm going to continue stuffing you until I feel you've had enough or...until I just flat-out get bored. So don't hold it against me but I gotta teach you to not disrespect Yukiko, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo clear response not that it mattered Ai really had no say in this anyway. Moving her back onto the middle of the floor Chie continued stuff Ai with a seemingly endless amount of food, grinning like a cat as the other blonde ballooned further and further in weight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't before long Chie realized that she could be compromising herself, being by the front door of the Ebihara estate. \"I think we need a bit more privacy don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie's hand was wrapped strongly around Ai's mouth, who put everything into trying to open it to scream for help, but Chie's strength was amazing even despite the rumors and her seemingly small frame. Chie snuck like a ninja around Ai's house, again thanks to the powers her shadow gave her when she stumbled upon an open door, this was Ai's room, left open as she went to meet her captor. Chie opened the door and dragged Ai in, kicking the door behind them closed and placing the Queen on her fancy bed. \"You rich folks always have to make everything fancy don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi couldn't respond as she was crying in sheer terror over her position. Chie smiled and placed Ai down on the bed, and she made a massive two foot long hot dog with the works. Then like a bolt of lightning she shoved the massive thing down Ai's throat nearly choking her. \"P-Plea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ai could even finish her plee the tomboy had a stream of yogurt seemingly flow from her hand into her mouth filling Ai's cheeks. \"Shhhhh, you're gonna spoil the moment...when you forget all of this and become just like everyone else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Chie know that this memory alteration was the easiest one yet, for she does not know Ai's hurtful past, back when she was nick named 'Piggy-Hara' and was fat. The yogurt was forcibly swallowed out of fear of her head exploding and when it hit the wasn't a brain freeze affecting Ai's brain, but Chie's power to alter her memories. The parts where she was already fat stayed the same, but it changed when it got to her turning point in life, he dad struck it rich and she had a new life, except for the fact she still had not lost enough weight to hide her fat figure. \"Open wide, Ai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie formed three large pizzas, and layed them on each other, rolling them up into what could be called a Pizza Burrito and shoved it down Ai's throat. The large gulp allowed what was a gut seemingly of a pregnant woman to become lower and her hips and thighs to start taking some of it too. Ai's past changed so she lost even less weight and more and more people insulted her because of it. Once done there Chie moved onto a very special treat, a whole 30 pounds of turkey meat, stripped from the bone, ready to be dropped into Ai's mouth, who seemed distant, her memories being altered. Chie dropped the pounds of poultry into Ai's now opened mouth. Chie's powers had truly reached impossibility. Each pound she dropped into Ai resulted in 10 pound gains! \"Hope you like breast meat, cause yours is gonna be great after this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi's gut grew more and more, as did her chest resulting in a massive upper body gain of 300 pounds! Her gut ripped apart her clothes like tissue paper and covered half the bed, and her breasts  1/3 of the gut. Ai had never lost weight, but instead gained weight. \"Hey Queen Piggy-Hara! How's the fat farm treating you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did her family get payed her weight in gold or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi remembers cutting classes to avoid the bullying she was suffering from, and how she was forced into management and eventually met Souji. He was the first kind person to her, and for that she was willing to think Suicide over him. Chie didn't know these feelings Ai had, instead she was pondering her next weapon of choice. \"Ohhhhh I know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaviar, rich people food. Chie never had some, so she tried her own. \"Silly me of course it's gonna take good to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment that one egg dropped Chie felt a sudden push, as if she gained 50 pounds. \"OOF...seems I may have put too much kick into these...well for me and my friends anyway, for you though Ai...it's perfect...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi was slowly coming back when Chie poured the caviar down, like dough in an oven Ai's body grew and grew, her clothes, her shoes, rings, bracelet's, her choker anything on her body was now in pieces on her bed and floor as she grew from 500 pounds to 1000, from that to 1500, to a ton. \"Uggggghhhhh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can she even move?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WATCH OUT! IT'S A MONSTER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FREAK!\" Ai was constantly insulted, and could never avoid it, her cart made to carry her immobile body could only go so fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...for the Finale...\" Chie said to the distant Ai as she held out her arms and formed a MASSIVE behemoth of a Burger, 10 patties that were like tables, covered in everything you'd put on a burger. This was a masterpiece to Chie, which brought a joyful tear to her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi woke up to see the burger and was pushed onto her gut to eat it by Chie, so close to this burger that she smelled every single seasoning, topping, and juices, that she couldn't help it. She dug in, and devoured this thing bit by bit, crying all the while. \"What's wrong Ai-chan? Is it so good you can't help but cry tears of joy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ai ate, her body reached sized not possible by humans, 1.3 tons, 1.9, 2.6! At a Massive THREE TONs is when she hit her limit. There wasn't a part of her body that wasn't fat, her fingers, her face, her everything! Breasts bigger then Hanako! Her gut filled the entire room, and five whole chins adorned her face, and on those chins were two things, grease from the burger, and tears from her eyes. Ai was a freak to everyone in her memories, people threw up at the sight of her, tossed things at her. Chie had no clue what she did, but she was going to. In the commotion of Ai ballooning out she knocked over her dresser, and inside was her Diary. \"Man Ai...I dunno if I can ever top you...heeeeey what's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi was simply sitting there sad because Souji was no longer around to be the only one who saw her as a human being. \"I bet you won't mind Ai, will ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie looked through, feeling her anger justification for any action at this point, she came across an entry talking about what Ai discussed with Souji on that fateful day, how someone she loved tossed her love back because of her appearance and how others mocked her. Chie read more of Ai's past and saw pictures of Ai during her weight loss, something she kept to remind her of what she once was and how far she's come. It all hit Chie, Ai went through a rough life of her own, and her attitude was partially because of societal norms. Seeing Ai cry made Chie realize that she had just erased the only time Ai wasn't insulted herself. \"What have I done?\"</span></div></div>",

Still glancing over at the depressed blob girl Chie knew she was doing the right thing. Well not the right right thing, that would've meant her not turning two of her friends and two fellow classmates into extremely obese versions of themselves, still it's the little things that count right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later Ai at last began to come around, her memories altered, her mind hazy, and pounding like the beat of a drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...what the hell happened to me?\" she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you're up, Ai-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chi...Chie-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, I'm friend remember now let me help you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused but still rather understanding Ai latched on Chie's extend hand who then helped her back to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel Ai?\" Chie asked as she gave her a quick glance over unsure how Ai would react.</span></div></div>",

Do you like em?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like em!? I LOVE THEM! THANK YOU CHIE!\" Ai hugged Chie who chuckled sheepishly at the gesture before feeling her spine getting crushed by Ai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl had almost forgotten her reasoning for fattening girls this whole time was for a test of her strength, and that fattening the girls probably had the same effect. Ai's hug was like a vice, and Chie's body was saved by her concealed layers of fat under her clothes. \"N-No problem Ai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl released her hug with tears of joy in her eyes. Chie decided to use this time to explain the whole situation to Ai. \"A Sumo contest? Chie-chan I doubt any girl would be able to push me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we'll just see about that huh? Come on, we can talk more on the way to Rise-chan's place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Ai smiled, and the two left Ai's home. It had gotten dark out, and the night was chilly. The fat concealed on these two girls made the cold nothing to them though as they strolled down the street, Ai walking close to Chie. A blush was on Ai's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Chie have you done something with your eyes?\" Ai asked looking at Chie's golden eyes, which Chie forgotten about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...they're...color contacts. I wanted to try a new look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look nice.\" Ai responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww thanks Ai.\" Chie enjoyed a compliment about her appearance, it was one of the things she lacked confidence in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway to the Tofu Shop Chie noticed Ai's stomach growling. \"Getting hungry are you? Well don't worry once we get to Rise's place we're gonna have a BIG feast and get so much fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi chuckled a bit before looking at Chie directly into her eyes. \"Mind if I feed you Chie-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure?\" Chie was a bit confused with this request as they finished their walk to the Tofu store, where the aroma of a feast was coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh hope we're not too late, come on Ai-Chan!\" Chie started rushing in and Ai stopped her with a hug,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ai-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie...thanks for being with me. I would have been alone had you not stopped me from jumping off the roof of the school building.\" Chie was shocked, she never knew Ai went to that level of extremes. Stopping Chie looked at her and realized she must have replaced herself with someone important in Ai's memories, maybe a lover. She knew she needed to take responsibility for her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ai, it's nothing. You know I care a lot about you.\" Chie put a smile on both girls faces before she was met with a kiss on the lips from Ai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and broke the hug leaving the speechless Chie to stand outside for a few seconds before walking in. \"Ah Chie-sempai you're back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie looked at the girls, Rise Yumi and Naoto had grown quite a bit, Yumi was equaling Ai's true shape of 6 tons, Naoto was overshadowing them at an unbelievable 9 tons and Rise the poor girl worked so hard making the massive dinner that she was only 4 tons. The meal was a massive spread that could have fed every military branch and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was pleased by this sight as she and Ai went to sit down. \"Okay let's let loose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi and Chie removed their fat concealing clothes and let it all out and Rise placed their shares of food, plates covered in mountains of food slapped together into a mountainous mess of a meal. \"Dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi dug in right away and looked to Chie ready to feed her when she wanted. Chie was ready to eat too when she then realized.</span></div></div>",

Even dear \"little\" Rise-chan with all her hard work has still overshadowed us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie quickly stared over in Rise's direction realizing the harsh truth in her shadow's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that Naoto-kun's putting everyone else to shame...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost felt the need to tune out her shadow as the truth was becoming rather annoying to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's okay because all we have to do is eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last she was starting to speak Chie's language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat so much that we make them look like twigs by comparison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie admittedly liked the sound of that, after all the bigger she was the stronger she'd be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shadow however hushed for a moment as the blonde turned over in Ai's direction. She watched as Ai took a few bites from her meal before eying over at Chie, a simple smile on her lips. Chie recalled the kiss from earlier how it had felt...not bad really, not that she would admit that to anyone in the room or any where else but at the same time she knew it was obviously meant for another, who ever that was. In the end all she had done was steal a kiss from Ai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt still puzzled her so she decided to shift her thoughts back into the crazed binging her shadow had mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe attacked Rise's massive feast with the usual intensity she did with most of her meals while overlooking the eating styles of the others. As expected Naoto and Yumi were rather proper in her table manners while Ai and Rise were a tad bit more loose. It seemed so fitting she thought with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it eat and grow fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shadow playing the role of cheerleader as Chie continued stuffing a triple-layered cheesecake down her gullet. She could already feel her stomach bloating and stretching out further but a part of her was still annoyed that the others were still far ahead of her! She needed a faster mean of weight gain too bad her shadow didn't have any perks for her to use...wait a minute she didn't need her other self this time around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit of effort but she scooted over near the still feasting Ai, Naoto and Yumi deep in conversation as they ate and Rise simply enjoying herself so neither girl saw Chie make her move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ai...about...\" she wasn't really sure how to go about this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is it time now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that was easier then she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! I uh need your help if I'm going to put on a little more weight.\" Chie said seemingly teasing Ai as she gave her belly a playful slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Chie-chan if I have to I'll feed you everything on the table!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie nearly drooled a waterfall right then and there. This was going to be perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's get to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi didn't have to be told twice she instantly grabbed as much as she could stuffing it all into Chie's awaiting mouth. It was rather ironic for her to be the one being stuffed this time around. It amused her for a moment before she got back to eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd eat she did with Ai's help along with her own feasting Chie was quickly ballooning with new found flab. She inched closer to Rise's size yet before she could realize she had already surpassed the redhead. Ai continued to stuff away Chie's blubber raising spreading out as she neared Yumi's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes fatter fatter!\" Her shadow exclaimed so very pleased that Chie was working her rather quickly to overcoming even Naoto's tremendous size, who had already gain another ton or two of weight.

Hey who's down there!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me Sempai.\" Rise replied straining under the fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-chan! My jacket under me, can you get it and get out!?\" Chie asked worried as she felt Rise move around under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yumi-chan! Naoto-kun! Try lifting my gut a bit!\" Chie shouted as the two girls nodded to each other before summoning their strength their fat gave them and lifting the massive gut enough to give Rise enough room to crawl up to where the jacket was, right under Chie's massive rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie's face became a bright red as Rise came out from under Chie's gut and handed her a familiar jacket. Chie put it around her arm and the fabric stretched like rubber to her other arm. Chie's fat started to shrink into the jacket and gave her arm leeway to put the zipper together and zip up her jacket. The girls watched as Chie returned to a skinny figure with a relieved sigh. \"That was scary...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi and Naoto were chuckling. \"C-Chie, Sempai...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laughed which confused Chie who looked at them, Ai sat up and wrapped her fat body around Chie. \"Nice ass Chie-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie looked back as saw her butt was as big as her upper body! The jacket was simply covering her upper body's fat. Rise joined Ai in hugging Chie. \"My, my Chie that appitite has such a wonderful effect on her figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kissed her round rear which made Chie's face was like a red sun and an embarrassed twitch in her eye. Her shadow also took a moment to laugh as Chie went into the other room, coming back out with familiar black pants, returning Chie's full attire. \"You girls...I love you so much some times, but LIMITS! LEARN THEM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" Ai and Rise looked away, Chie sighed and hugged them, after breaking the hug she yawned and rubbed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess all that eating left me sleepy. Mind if I sleep here Rise-chan? Mind calling Yukiko in case my folks call her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Sempai. I need to stay up to work on breakfast anyway.\" Rise smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh Chie-chan...mind if...I sleep with you when I head to sleep?\" Ai asked bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie blushed again, she hates to admit it but the kiss on her rear did feel a bit nice. Chie still needed to keep up with the lie she made, and put on a smile. \"Sure Ai-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie walked off, her weight making each step a massive thud. She found Rise's room and decided to use her bed. The moment she tried sitting on it bent the thing to a near breaking point which resulted in her getting back up and using the sheets and covers on the floor. With a big yawn she closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep, like an adorable baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know what was going to  happened while she sleeps.</span></div></div>",

The pleased expression grew in size as she had realized what had occurred. It was still very much Chie's own body but while her subconscious slept her shadow much to even it's own surprise was able to sneak in and take utter control of the young woman's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had somehow reversed roles! No doubt an ability born from the bond they had made with one another at least that's what the shadow believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her mind the horse had up surd the king or in this case Yukiko's charming prince and at the very thought of the raven-haired woman a thought began to form. Chie would never approve if she were still awake so the shadow had to do so now while the young woman slept away oblivious to any of her tricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring over at the nearby sleeping form of Ai she gently tapped the shoulder of the blonde girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C..Chie-chan?\" she asked drowsily sleep still very much in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ai I know it's late and all but why don't we make things easier for Rise-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi wasn't really sure what she meant by that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you and I go stay at the Amagi Inn. You know just the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow stated as she leaned in and cupped the other girl's chin, a teasing smile on her lips. Ai nearly melted at the expression directed at her and the feeling of \"Chie\" holding on to her as she was. She practically agreed on the spot unaware of how the shadow was using her simply to accomplish it's goals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now Ai-chan, let's go together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow stated extending an arm out, the smile from before still present as ever.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sneaking out of the Kujikawa residence wasn't easy considering the 20+ tons stepping on each floorboard but the other three were fast asleep by the time the lovers made it out into the crisp chilly night. The two walked in the direction of the inn, each step leaving a crack in the pavement from their weight pushing down on it. Ai had her arm wrapped around Chie's as if they were lovers, which to her they were. The Shadow looked at Ai, a small part of her remembered what she said about Yukiko before the memory alteration and had a bit of resentment for it. Looking at Ai, however, she saw how close she held on to her the Shadow could feel her dependence and remembered what she revealed to Chie about the school roof. As they passed the halfway mark on the long walk the Shadow stopped and Ai walked a step ahead before stopping herself. \"Something wrong Chie-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ai...how do you feel about me?\" The shadow asked which puzzled and concerned Ai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie-chan where did the come from? You know I care a lot about you, that you mean the whole world to me for saving me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you feel about Yukiko? She's a close friend of mine after all.\" The shadow was seeking what Ai thought after her alteration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...really don't know. Everyone at school likes her though, the guys love how pretty she is and the girls are jealous of her beauty. I am too, before you gave me these clothes I was so fat and everyone picked on me for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you were skinny like how you look now...what would you think of her then?\" Ai looked into a puddle at her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd probably think of myself as beautiful as want the attention...so I would feel loved. I used to think the only way to get love was to be skinny, now I'm just glad I have you. If I had this kind of body though I'd probably always try to one up her I guess...\" The shadow was quite displeased, but Ai was being honest about wanting to be loved that much she could tell. Still she wanted to change that tone about Yukiko, but she broke the awkward silence with a kiss on Ai's lips. A sinister though crossed her mind as she moved her hands into Ai's skirt and rubbed the soft plump rear of her now lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ai you must be getting big, even the clothes I got you are starting to reveal your bigger nature.\" The shadow said in a sultry tone but deep down she was concerned, to press the limits of those clothes, she may have passed Chie up in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shadow placed her hands into the jacket pockets to start her latest scheme and pulled out a candy bar in each hand. \"Ai, want a bite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Ai grabbed it and within a second started eating the bar to nothing as Shadow Chie did the same with her own in the other hand. The candy bars themselves were a delicious 300 pounds of fat treat, Ai's was special however as it contained another memory alteration, however it wasn't telling her about her weight back in her past, the new memory had her sitting next to a black haired girl on the side of the road with a lonely dog, crying with her until a young tomboyish girl came up to them. The shadow has done something different with the memory alteration, simply put she put in memories of her own times with Yukiko into Ai, so instead of a duo it was a trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie-chan? Can I ask you something?\" Ai asked after finishing the candy bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Ai-chan.\" The shadow knew the question ahead of time so it made her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it wrong that I love you AND Yuki-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course no Ai-chan, after all I love both of you too.\" She smiled kissing Ai again, before they resumed their walk to the Inn. Before long they made it, the Inn was always open, ready for visitors to come in at any time. Though they weren't quite ready for these ones. Chie and Ai walked up and at the counter was Mrs. Amagi herself, Yukiko's mother. She looked much like her daughter, except older and lack of youthful luster, she was tending the evening guest registration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ai-chan wait here.\" S.Chie said walking up to the quite upset eyes of Mrs. Amagi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie? What are you doing here? Just cause it isn't a school night doesn't give you a reason to bother Yukiko at such a late hour, it's past midnight!\" Shadow Chie rolled her eyes, Chie would never admit it but she got a bit tired of Mrs. Amagi being a stick in the mud, but her shadow took great pleasure in what she was about to do. The Shadow conjured ups a baseball sized meatball and shoved it into the middle aged woman's face and pushed it down her throat, she watched the large lump go down to Mrs.Amagi's gut, then within seconds the kimono Mrs.Amagi wore was blown off by the sudden shift to a one ton woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh Chie-sama, are you here to visit Yukiko?\" The now blimped out woman asked bowing, her memories altered much like the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" The shadow chuckled and motioned Ai to follow, and the girl did so as Mrs.Amagi huffed and heaved her body leading the pair to Yukiko's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go Chie-sama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mrs.Amagi.\" The shadow smiled such a devilish grin seeing the woman waddle away, now believing her to be eternally indebted to her for 'saving' Yukiko they day she found her. With that out of the way she asked for Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh? Chie...is that you?\" She heard yawning, clearly having woken Yukiko up, the door slide to the side as the girl was in her pink kimono, eyes closed and yawning still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Yukiko...\" The shadow could barely contain herself as she walked in towards Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie what on earth are you doing at this *yawn* time of evening?\" Yukiko opened her eyes and was shocked by what she saw, a sight familiar to her and right now the only female who knew the eyes Chie had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! It can't be! You're Chi...\" The Shadow kissed Yukiko on her lips to seal them, upon removing them she placed a hand on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh Yuki, it's okay, I would never hurt you, you know that. I am your prince after all right?\" The shadow smiled kissing Yukiko all over, Ai walking in, a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Yuki-chan! I'm so glad to see you!\" Yukiko was confused as ever, and tried her best to escape from the Shadow's clutches, however the Shadow held her in a strong embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko...it's time you joined us all.Me, Ai, Rise, Naoto and Yumi. We're all getting nice and fat. I wanted to be fat and strong to protect you, but we don't need to do that do we? We can make you strong too Yukiko. Then we can be equals, isn't that what you want?\" The shadow formed a red velvet cake and chopped a slice and slowly moved it to Yukiko who struggled hard before the shadow cooed the last thing she'd hear as she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide, my lover.\" As the slice passed her lips and was slowly forced down by S.Chie's fingers everything went hazy for Yukiko, and her sash on her kimono became a haze of shreds on her floor as her gut busted it open. The girl gasped for air once the slice was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie-chan...Ai-chan oh you're both here!\" Yukiko's expression turned to that of lust and joy seeing the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we are! We're friends right?\" The shadow chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends? Chie you know we're all more then that.\" Yukiko smiled as she came in to another kiss, followed by another slice of cake down her mouth reducing the kimono itself to ripping apart, leaving Yukiko's red undergarments left to cover her growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, this is great, both of them are my lovers! Still it's not enough, now I need to get fatter! I should give the girls the same power me and Chie have, to be fed by food Yukiko made, Chie would love that I'm sure of it.\" The shadow's thoughts rang through her head as the trio sat down and prepared to eat, not knowing the scope of what was going to happen that evening.</span></div></div>",

Nothing was around her. Chie was in some kind of blackened void it seems. \"W-WHAT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally woke up all the way she saw a screen, like a TV screen, not 3 inches from her face showing her a POV she was familiar with, her own! \"W-What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Chie, you're up.\" A familiar voice said as her shadow appeared from the abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, YOU! What is this!? I thought we had an understanding!\" Chie shouted trying to move towards her Shadow but finding herself unable to move anything but her lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did, HOWEVER, you didn't comply with your DEEPEST desire Chie-chan.\" Her shadow replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mea...\" She stopped and realized it, apparently too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, all those times you thought to yourself 'fatten Yukiko, Yuki needs some weight, Yukiko should join us'. That was all me, or more to the point US.\" Her shadow walked towards her as Chie saw her physical self look at Ai and wrap her arm around her as Ai put her head on Chie's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie, admit it. We love this. This power to make such good food and stuff it right down these girls throats. The sumo contest? Yes we could show off our power, but the real kick we got was feeding these girls, plumping them up and making them soft fat...lovers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie wanted to look away denying her Shadow's words but found herself unable to move still. \"Chie all you had to do was admit it, convert Yukiko and we'd all just enjoy a life fattening each other up and being together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I REFUSE! Yukiko, she's, she's my dearest friend, OUR dearest friend. I can't taint her memories, I can't alter her to think she was never beautiful.\" Chie shouted admitting Yukiko was always so beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you deny that deep down you WANT to fatten her though? That this entire time your love of your growing figure and that of the others doesn't please you? What about Ai? Didn't you change your tune quite quickly when you found out the truth about her? Tainted her into being a lover? I know what you thought when she kissed us. 'So soft, such a delicate touch'. Admit it, you loved it.\" Her Shadow stated as she simply hovered silently in the abyss. Her shadow snapped her fingers and Chie's Physical self stopped and looked at Ai who stopped and looked back into Chie's own eyes. The real Chie looked at the scene as an onlooker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ai, mind if we get a kiss?\" Chie heard her own voice for certain as Ai smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Ai learned over and the two kissed, Chie could feel the soft lips as if she was actually there. Chie's hands moved to Ai's rear and grabbed it, Chie felt the soft flesh buried under the magic clothes in her hands despite being somewhere else<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressed? It's what we Shadows go through. We're watching you live life, feeling what you feel, thinking what you think.\" Her shadow responded as Chie's physical form made a giant pair of chocolate bars filled with nuts, caramel, crispy wafers, peanut butter. She put one in Ai's mouth who swallowed it without question before eating her own, Chie feeling the ton or two of weight added to her hidden large frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow, just what are you doing?\" Chie finally asked getting to the heart of the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious? I'm taking over. I'm going to do what YOU don't have the nerve to do and I'm going to show you what it's like to be the onlooker! You're going to be the Shadow now, not me!\" Chie's expression became pale and she grew silent as her Shadow stated her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to make one last tasty treat, a shish-kabob of every type of steak we know about. Once I eat it you'll become me, and I'll become you. You'll be MY Persona. After all I'll accept you a lot easier then you accepted me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!\" Chie tried shaking her head as the Physical Chie materialized said kabob, adorned with dozens of entire steaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you one last chance Chie, admit to wanting to fatten all these girls, Yukiko included and I will lose all control, you'll become dominant again and I'll revert to my Persona state, but you'll still keep your powers and use them for our lovers. If you refuse however,  down the hatch this stick of meat goes and I'll give these girls the love and food they deserve. It's your choice Chie.\" Her Shadow grinned.</span></div></div>",

So I stayed and watched, what I saw...Chie please, tell me....WHAT'S GOING ON!?\" Yukiko was clearly scared, not out of what the act was but who was committing it. Chie was her closest friend, they always were close but to find her fattening girls and enjoying it like some sick pleasure, so the shock was still setting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie walked over. \"Isn't it obvious? I'm fattening women. See I've recently gained some new power, I need some way to test it, so I decided to make girls bigger then me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie what are you talking about...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh RIIIIIGHT jacket.\" Chie unzipped her jacket, as she did more and more fat poured out like a stream of water, Yukiko began thinking she was in a nightmare as Chie was just under Yumi in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie smiled and zipped her jacket back up and walked right up to Yukiko. \"Isn't it great Yuki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Chie? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS!? Just please, tell me...I'm your friend Chie...you know that, so why keep this from me, why do all this!?\" Why, the biggest question, WHY? Chies stopped, she thought long and hard as to why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...I want to see if I'm strong enough to protect...yo...\" Chie stopped, protect Yukiko, no she knew Yukiko didn't need protection anymore, and began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...what have I been doing!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie....\" Suddenly her left eye, not BOTH flared up, she covered them as Yukiko went to grab her shoulder, when she did she saw Chie had Shadow eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuki...you'll gain right...we're friends aren't we...come on we can still be friends, I just need to make you like me...fat, so fat.\" The shadow then clutched her head as Chie screamed in agony, inside her mind the two Chies stood back to back, the Shadow was vanishing in certain parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're leaving Yukiko OUT of this! Please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what you want and you KNOW it. We want Yuki, we want HER, she' our friend isn't she, she'll do anything we want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At what cost!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow sighed. \"Soon we'll merge...my powers will be yours, however we need to decide on something it seems, who'll control this body until then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, don't think I'll lose this time.\" Both undid their jackets and got into sumo position and charged one another, the impact sending a shockwave though Chie's mind, meanwhile outside Yukiko was confused and was on the verge of crying and held Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie...please.

She watched Yukiko sway her head briefly before embracing her once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter Chie, all that does matter is that you\u2019re alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tears continued to fall from her eyes as she pulled away however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I\u2019m fine but I screwed up Yuki. I mean I really screwed up. I forget the key rule that with power comes responsibly. I was so obsessed with proving to myself that I could protect all of you that I allowed my dark side to control me. Look at what I\u2019ve done what I was becoming what I could have done to you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t! You fought off those desires not just for my sake but for your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie eyed her best friend a total look of regret still in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s true the power I possess is now completely mine. I can\u2019t feel my shadow\u2019s influence anymore it\u2019s gone and all that remains is me being the owner of its power but that still doesn\u2019t excuse me from what I\u2019ve done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so hard on yourself I\u2019m here for you Chie. Just as you\u2019ve always been for me in the past or did you forget that?\u201d Yukiko explained her hands set firmly on Chie\u2019s shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Yuki.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last a small smile began to creep across the blonde\u2019s lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ll want to stand by a butterball like me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko wasn\u2019t exactly following until Chie pointed at her jacket recalling how her true size was something that made even Hanako looked absurdly thin by comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about that\u2026then I\u2019ll join you. Maybe a few extra pounds will do me some good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie stood still for a second puzzled at what she had just heard and unsure as to how she should response to the fact that Yukiko had stated that she was okay with putting on some additional weight. Was she sure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I am. Chie you know I\u2019ll stick with you through thick or thin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and in her mind Chie expected her dear friend to laugh uncontrollably but she didn\u2019t instead the two of them shared one last hug. The last of her tears fell as Chie thanked Yukiko one final time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow back on their feet Chie stared over in the direction where the immobile Yumi laid resting soundly not a care in the world her memories must have been in their final course of altering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crushing ping of guilt surged through her as she truly came to terms with what she had been doing all this time. Yukiko noticed the pained expression and decided to act upon it by giving her friend\u2019s hand a gentle reassuring squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing this Chie\u2019s mood was uplifted a bit she then turned over toward Yukiko and simply told to not let go. Yet again the raven-haired girl was confused\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyaa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yelled as they suddenly disappeared from the spot they were standing only to reappear right before Yumi\u2019s multi-ton mass! Chie had actually teleported with both of them hand in hand! The sudden sensation was so strange that she released her hold and began to check herself over just to know if everything was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at poor panic-stricken Yukiko that said she had more pressing matters to attend to. Somewhere deep inside she knew there had to be a way to reverse the effects her cooking had on people and unfortunately for her Yumi had been affected the most, seeing as she was clearly many times larger then her other two close friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she was determined to repent for the past sins. There had to be something she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClapping her hands together Chie concentrated before placing them upon Yumi\u2019s soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I can do this! I know there must be a way to reverse all of this and I\u2019m going to find it or so help me\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko encouraging her while worrying for her safety as Chie dove deeper into her power focusing solely on curing Yumi of all her added weight and tampered memories.</span></div></div>",

The poor girl was still reeling in the guilt trip she had been on since returning from the mental struggle with her shadow and this wasn\u2019t helping matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo like I said it\u2019s alright Chie-chan besides I know I can always go to Hanamura-san for help just in case.\u201d Yumi explained while biting away at her sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you mean Yosuke?\u201d asked Chie who admittedly wasn\u2019t used to hearing the boy be referred to by his last name. It did make sense though due to Yumi not being as close as she or Yukiko were with Yosuke and he was her superior in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right Hanamura-san was the one who passed my application and basically gave me a job here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi\u2019s cheerfulness had at least ease some of the sorrow from Chie\u2019s mind at least she knew that Yosuke being the general good guy he was would stick up for Yumi while she was employed at the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind she could at last get on with enjoying her own food\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko unfortunately overestimated herself as well as Chie\u2019s fine cooking being forced to put aside the remaining small portion of her meal. She didn\u2019t have a potbelly by any means but the poor girl definitely felt stuffed by all means, anymore and she\u2019d be forced to make an exit straight to the nearest restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie saw this and mouthed a quick apology to her best friend who waved it off if only to prevent Chie from adding any more unneeded guilt on top of herself. It really did pain Yukiko to see her best friend in such an emotional state but she resolved to be there for Chie and help her get back to being the excitable blonde she always knew her to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tense moment between the two of them was dashed however when Yumi asked if she could have Yukiko\u2019s leftovers. Not wanting to seem rude she agreed passing the plate over in the awaiting girl\u2019s direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYumi-chan, aren\u2019t you afraid that um\u2026it might be too much for you?\u201d asked Chie worried that perhaps the girl wouldn\u2019t be able to handle as much as she believed she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she weren\u2019t in the current mood Chie would have no doubt found humor in the irony that she actively wanted to prevent Yumi from gaining any additional weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about Chie-chan? I\u2019m not exactly rail-thin you know although this clothing is doing an amazing job at hiding it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHold on a minute what did she just say? Its true Chie wasn\u2019t able to shrink Yumi down to her original size but why was she talking if\u2026Oh No!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere her memories still altered? And that added appetite. She wasn\u2019t gaining as fast as she was before but she was still hungrier then she should be even at her size the addiction was still there just in a minor form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo this was bad and was the last thing Chie wanted to worry about. Thinking quickly she excused herself as well asking Yukiko to come along with her, Yumi didn\u2019t seem to mind or notice anything strange with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious Yukiko joined her friend as they stepped far enough away from where they were while Yumi sat contently eating her extended meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the coast clear Chie quickly explained the situation.</span></div></div>",

So...do you have any idea on how to stop Yumi-chan from getting back to being inhumanly obese once more?\" Yukiko asked, hoping for a way to both stop Yumi from getting to be an immobile fatty again and help Chie from being depressed all the time due to her recent actions.

Unfortunately, the transfer could only work on two conditions. The first condition being that both participants have to be of the same gender, while the second being that the transferee has to be willing to participate in the ritual. Otherwise, the transfer will cancel itself out or something unpredictably horrible can happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was what made the guilt-ridden tomboy known as Chie Satonaka nervous. After all, even with all this power stored in her body, Chie could not eliminate her human emotions. So, after taking a deep breath, the green jacket-wearing blonde looked at her best friend Yukiko and answered, \"There....is a way to cure Yumi of her um, food addiction....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Yukiko spoke toward her friend as she replied, \"Well that's great news, Chie! How do we-\" \"But the only way to make it work...is to..transfer the food addiction into another girl, a girl who's willing to...live through it, Yuki-chan.\" Chie answered, interrupting her best friend, giving a grave reminder to Yukiko that some things come with a price, no matter the weight it bears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ready for three and four your sexy big thing you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only four?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make more piggy.\" Rise said happily and with a giggle at the end pinching Naoto's plump cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was my food really THAT addicting?\" Chie was stunned at just how powerful the stuff was, and more to the point how far she had fallen to put the girls on this path, she prayed that she could fix all this once her desire was completed, only problem was moving them, Rise seemed to have gained the strength to move somehow, perhaps another side effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-chan there's been a change in plan and we're having the sumo contest ASAP!\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww but Senpai we're still hungry, we can't compete on empty stomachs.\" Rise replied frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine finish this meal, I need some things to set up anyway.\" Chie sighed and figured she needed to put together the way she was going to get them inside a TV, after all they were far too big to fit at this point, so she decided to use her powers and remake the girls old clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There.\" Chie handed Naoto a new hat and Rise her Sunday best and slipped them on the girls who once the apparel was placed on had their familiar frames back, like nothing had happened, but much like Chie and Yumi they were much fatter then they appeared. Using this magic however left a sensation of hunger in Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Uhhhh Rise mind getting me a little food? Not too much okay?\" Chie said figuring this Rise would consider 'not to much' to be more then what Yumi weighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Senpai.\" Rise said from the other room as Chie sat down, the feeling of her fat jiggle, she undid he jacket letting the fat flow as Rise came out and placed a whole Turkey and Ham before Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Rise, after this we're leaving.\" Chie said digging into the meal.</span></div></div>",

She knew she had to finish this meal fast so she could get the match started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I only hope it does fix things\u2026\u2019 thought Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSenpai if you don\u2019t mind me asking who exactly is going to partake in this proposed match of yours?\u201d Naoto asked after finishing her snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there are a couple of choices\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it came to her that she was still missing one last individual! Ai Ebihara, a girl that Chie had to admit knew next to nothing about except for a few choice details here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMostly things she had heard about the school and a bit from Souji making the job of possibly befriending her that much harder compared to Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her meal done Chie placed the thought of Ai aside deciding that for now it was best to take Rise and Naoto back into the TV world a part of her wondering if Yukiko had already managed to do the same with Yumi?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie bid farewell to friends after having guided them to the steak house explaining that the two of them seek out Teddie who was still housed within. Once again she silently apologized for leaving poor Yukiko with the burden of handling things till she returned with Ai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was also thankful neither had really asked too many questions especially Naoto. She just didn\u2019t have the time to spend playing twenty questions with the detective prince\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having returned to the real world Chie headed straight for Ai\u2019s home lucky for her she had found an officer who knew of the address she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued on over Chie wondered if it was alright to actually alter Ai? After all this time around she\u2019d have to do while being fully aware of her actions. Could she actually go through with it, it wasn\u2019t like before where her consciousness would slip into her dark side. This time there was no dark side to bring out some sort of sick mental pleasure this time she\u2019d have to do it willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t my hands shake?\u201d she asked herself wondering if perhaps her fears and already troubled mental state was causing her body to go entirely numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused just having found the Ebihara household\u2026could she go through with it knowing what she\u2019d have to do. Was Ai really needed or could she pass on her and still save everyone that needed to be saved?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands still refusing to shake yet Chie knew she needed to make a decision here and now.</span></div></div>",

Befriending the fellow blonde was going to be a lot tougher then it was with Yumi then again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really no\u201d Chie stated softly her eyes looking away from Ai\u2019s own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I guess you should leave, huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her hands planted firmly on her hips Ai was all but ready to slam the door in front of the girl before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026but maybe you will in a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ai could question much less react properly Chie launched herself at the surprised blonde closing the door with her foot after pinning Ai to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frighten teen was about to scream in terror when she actually caught sight of the tears in Chie\u2019s eyes! Her mind figured the worse suspecting that this girl must be criminally insane and on the run from the law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Ai-chan.\u201d Muttered Chie pulling her hand back while Ai feared this was it her life was about to come to an end at the hands of some psychopath, who for some reason was a lot heavier then she appeared to be\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes she awaited the chilling embrace of\u2026an \u00e9clair being stuffed into her mouth?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait what? Where was the gun shot, the butcher knife digging deep into her flesh and bones?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead she instinctively finished off the sweet treat gasping for air only to be met with yet another equally delicious snack forcefully enter her mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the eighth \u00e9clair Ai\u2019s vision began to blur as did her mind like the others before her something was happening to her memories and while powerless to stop the process she felt no pain instead her struggling came to stop allowing Chie to roll of the girl\u2019s increasingly growing belly land on her side and sigh deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie figured that Ai must have been a little more then hundred pounds to begin with but her quick stuffing was plumping her up to around two fifty possibly already closer to three hundred her added fatness spreading around everywhere equally giving the blonde a real butterball look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a \u201c<i>small</i>\u201d gain compared to what she had done to the others but it was what she had in mind for now anyway. Lifting herself up to her feet she stared down at the trance-like look in Ai\u2019s eyes the fact that this state of mind in the past had actually brought pleasure to her nearly made Chie rush to Ai\u2019s bathroom, still she had to confirm her curious assumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAi-chan can you hear me?\u201d Chie asked as the second blonde began to come around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSatonaka-san? Ugh what just happened did I randomly pass out or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInteresting but she wasn't completely convinced so Chie decided to play along for a little bit longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm sort of it\u2019s more like you accidentally tripped and banged your head on the floor. But lucky for you doesn\u2019t look like it left you with any sort of bruise or a bleeding cut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u201d Chie chuckled rather awkwardly as she heard Ai curse under her breath. To her relief it appeared that Ai\u2019s memories had in fact been altered to the point where the two of them at the very least knew who the other was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe they were even friends? Chie could dream right. In any case Chie assisted the now heavier blonde girl back up to feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u2026sorry about that\u2026\u201d muttered Ai a bit of a blush born from embarrassment appearing on her plump cheeks. This surprised Chie a bit until she remembered how Souji had mentioned that Ai seem to have a hidden emotional side to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Chie gave the girl a quick pat on the back stating that there was no need to apologize accidents happen after all Ai reluctantly nodded in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with the ice between them had melted away Chie knew she had to move Ai over to the TV world best not to waste any more time. Getting her to look away for a moment Chie conjured up a box of doughnuts then handed them over to Ai the taller girl not even questioning where Chie had gotten them from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm listen Ai-chan\u2026we\u2019re going to take a little trip in a moment but first I need you to leave a note to anyone that may come around the house maybe looking for you or whatever just say that you stepped out and will be back soon, okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi nodded chewing away at a powdered doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rough estimate but to Chie it looked like she could in fact squeeze Ai through the set in the living room. Looking over at the pleasantly plump blonde who had finished off two more doughnuts as she completed the task assign to her Chie was thankful she had yet to fatten up to an even bigger degree but she had to get her in now before Ai\u2019s weight shot up too high\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they traveled through the TV world Chie sighed realizing that in retrospect she could have just given Ai some of the special clothing she had made for herself and the fatten up ladies. Oh well what\u2019s done is done and this way Chie could keep a better check on Ai\u2019s continuous gaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was still gorging away at the box of seemingly endless doughnuts each one adding more and more to her once thin frame (pushing her now close if not pass four hundred) as well as altering her mind so that this other dimension didn\u2019t seem so strange to her almost as if Chie had already told her about it in a past encounter that obviously never actually occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that they were back at the steak house Chie showed Ai in. The last piece had been gathered now it was finally time for Chie to set things right.</span></div></div>",

I think her altered mindset made it easier to take in all the details so she didn\u2019t freak out as bad as I had expected.\u201d Explained Yukiko pointing on over to where the pop idol, the detective prince, and former actress were all chatting with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt in Chie\u2019s mind that a similar thing had occurred with Ai. Yet again she was surprised at how powerful her abilities had become\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later Chie introduced Ai to everyone else in attendance. As usual Teddie attempted to charm his way into Ai\u2019s heart\u2026only to be met with a dual slap to his wide and round face by Chie and Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi didn\u2019t seem to care that the poor bear had just been slapped in surround sound instead she waved in his direction and continued to stuff her face with another fresh doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Sempai how\u2019s this whole thing going to work?\u201d asked Rise curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must admit I too am rather interested to hear the foundations of this competition of yours.\u201d Naoto added in, who now clearly was as fat as she was brilliant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell originally I was just going to go one-on-one with whomever I considered to be the biggest\u2026but now that I think about it how about I make this more interesting for everyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie almost chuckled out loud as she watched her friends who all appeared to be hanging on her every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I mean is\u2026why not make this a four-person elimination gauntlet match.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA four what now?\u201d asked a very confused Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple really Rise-chan, there\u2019s four of you two will start out when one girl is beaten another will take her place whoever survives to the end is the one I\u2019ll challenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not competing in this, Chie-chan?\u201d Yumi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo think of me as the \u201c<i>champion</i>\u201d I\u2019ll fight the person who proves they\u2019re strong enough to go up against me and the only to do that is to beat out the rest of the competition.\u201d Chie explained a near twinkle of joy in her eyes, so very different from the shadow-like look she used to experience\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddie was glad that preparing the \u201c<i>ring</i>\u201d needed for the competition wasn\u2019t at all too difficult a task to accomplish as he had originally thought it would be. Just paint a huge circle in the center of the room were Chie\u2019s exact words however considering the room they were currently in was utterly enormous this prove to be rather time-consuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last he was done though afterwards he shuffled on over to inform the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood now we just have to decide what the entry order is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie stated as Yukiko stepped forward opening her hands to reveal four cookies in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFortune cookies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto stared over at Chie wondering what the blonde girl had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell these don\u2019t really have fortunes instead they\u2019re going to help in figuring out everyone\u2019s entry number. Each one of you go ahead and take one any one really crack it open and call out what your spot is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls exchanged glances with one another before each one took a cookie into their hands, well hand in Ai\u2019s case seeing as she was still feasting on doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good\u2026I\u2019m first.\u201d Stated Yumi, it was clear in her disappointment that she wanted to be anything but a starter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could only wonder who her opponent was. Maybe she\u2019d luck out and be paired up against Ai who was clearly the \u201c<i>smallest</i>\u201d of the group considering she was going to need all the luck in the world now if she wanted to survive to the last round much less win and face off against Chie.</span></div></div>",

We're hunting down Yumi, NOW!\" Chie grabbed Yukiko who was still stunned by Chie's reactions as she dragged both of them out of the TVs in the entrance, the only TVs that Yumi could conceivably cross. Inside the now closed Junes Chie and Yukiko wandered around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have we been this busy?\" Yukiko asked seeing how late it was. \"Wait? Won't we be caught on Camera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal with it when the time comes.\" Chie growled, Yukiko hadn't seen Chie mad like this in quite some time, but she understood the stress, which is why she had to remain silent about something on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the food court the floor was covered in wrappers, bags and other tossed food items from the grocery department, Yumi had indeed been there, and it was clear she had become hungry, Chie sighed, wanting to cry so much, she didn't care if she remained a blob forever, she just wanted to undo it to the other girls but this was all making it harder. The two followed the trail to see Yumi, bloated and fattened to the size she was before Chie attempted to fix her, underneath an ice cream machine letting the various flavors flow down. \"YUMI!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced over to the two, stopping the flow. \"Ohh UUUURP, Chie-chan...sorry, I got kinda hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yumi...we're going BACK, NOW!\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie...\" Yukiko had to decide if she wanted to speak her mind about it. The fact was, she was putting on weight and getting hungry, when breaking up Rise and Naoto's dispute? She ate the food they fought over. Chie wouldn't handle this well, or maybe she would. She also needed to bring up the uneven entrees in the tournament, there were only five. Yukiko took a deep breath and readied her words. How will Chie react?</span></div></div>",

Who knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie...please calm down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she placed a hand on friend's shoulder she could faintly make out a slight trembling Chie really was ready to explode in anger at any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Yuki?\" Chie muttered slowly and a tad bit coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell here goes thought the raven-haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen we can still make this work. Please don't be upset with Yumi-chan we can take her back the same way we did before. I'm sure she's had her fill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them looking over at the mountainous blob of fat Yumi had once again become the girl doing her best to nod despite the size she had taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see there's no need to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde sighed for a moment it seemed that cooler heads would prevail but of course Yukiko still needed to inform Chie of one last thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um there's one more thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonderful what else could possibly happen. Fate sure was making it tough for the young blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have accidentally put on some weight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Chie asked grabbing a firm hold of her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow Chie you're hurting...\" Yukiko didn't get to finish before Chie released a bit of her hold mumbling a quick apology under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards Yukiko went on to explain how it was an accident born from trying to stop Rise and Naoto's binging. Frustrated but not enraged Chie sighed again, it was starting to become a habit, Yuki's growth couldn't be helped it seemed. She was however surprised that her best friend's mind hadn't been altered in any way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it because she hadn't eaten enough to trigger a change or maybe it had something to do with the connection the deep friendship the two shared with one another? Yukiko after all was the most important person in Chie's life and from the very beginning she had promised to herself to never have Yukiko involved. While that last part had been blown out of the window maybe it was that very same resolve that kept her dearest friend safe and sound...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie's thoughts were interrupted however after Yukiko had reminded her that Yumi still needed attending to. She sighed...again, really how many was that now before moving over toward Yumi's vastly immobile form with a snap of her fingers she had clothed the blob girl shrinking her down to her \"original\" size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done maybe now she could finally set the competition into motion. On the way back however Yukiko made a rather interesting if not shocking, at least to her, remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what? No Yuki I can't allow that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh let her join in. It will be fun.\" mentioned Yumi with a smile oblivious or possibly ignoring all together the sudden glare shot in her direction from Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Chie it's uneven as it is and I don't feel right being left out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde argued that it was for her well-being Yukiko retorted that she wouldn't feel at ease being on the side-lines plus she had already put on some weight and had made that promise to Chie from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFair point and Chie was curious if Yukiko really was immune to her powers, this would be the perfect time to find out...so with great reluctance Chie gave in to Yukiko's demand and she'd be added to the lineup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they just had to get the darn thing started thought the blonde... </span></div></div>",

I will not go back to destroying someone's life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she walked back shaking her head, something strange was going on with her, her head felt foggy. \"Going to deny your desire? It's not that simple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie realized who it was right away, she covered her eyes and shook her head. \"No you were out, I beat you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't complete it...then you can't fix it, any of it, and then you too will be caught in your own web.\" The Shadow voice echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP! I DON'T, I WON'T, I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO RUINING PEOPLE'S LIVES!\" Chie shouted falling to her knees crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then all is lost, goodbye Me, you won't need to cry any longer. The truth will flee from you and you won't have to cry anymore.\" The Shadow's voice faded, and Chie clutched her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why now....f-food...starving...\" Chie got up and walked slowly towards Junes, her head still foggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she crossed the street a car's horn blared and Chie looked at it, she put her hands out without realizing it and stopped the car. \"F-Food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver got out as Chie lifted the car over her head, turning it into a car shaped cake and downing it, the onlooker in shock and terror, Chie rubbed the frosting off her jacket. \"So Amazing...my power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Chie was losing control of herself as she made her way into Junes, her stomach still demanding more, it roared like a pack of beasts and stung like a hornet's nest, Chie's body was demanding food. \"Fine, fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into the Grocery department and started taking food and changing it into meat, candy, chocolate or whatever to add more calories to it, even going as far as changing the wrappers, bags and anything that covered the food, she began to pile it all in, people screaming at this bizarre and horrible sight. \"Food is so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople ran out screaming, as Chie ate the Grocery department, ALL OF IT. She made her way to the electronics department. She walked into the TV world and back to the Steak House where she was met by a flustered Yukiko. \"Chie! What's going on, the girls suddenly grew hungry....even....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko was clutching her stomach in hunger as well, was it because of her eating of Chie's food earlier. \"Yukiko...what are you talking about? We need to fatten up for the Sumo Tournament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Chie....what are you...\" Yukiko saw the sincerity in Chie's eyes and it dawned on her, Chie had altered herself without even knowing. Her power grew to the point she couldn't control it because her desire can not be completed, the long haired beauty fell to her knees as she looked back, Yumi Rise and Naoto eating forming piles of meat in the Steakhouse as Chie lifted her friend up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Yuki, open wide.\" Chie grabbed Yukiko and shoved food down her mouth, Yukiko rejected it by spitting it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuki! Why are you being so rude!?\" Chie was offended and Rise came up and held Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Yukiko-Sempai, why are you being so mean to Chie-sempai's sweet, sweet, SWEET offer?\" Chie tried again this time holding Yukiko's mouth closed forcing the Inn inheritor to swallow, within moments she felt pounds stack on, her stockings feeling tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHIE! DON'T!\" She shouted but it was too late, Chie kept stuffing, within minutes the stockings tore and the skirt followed suite, and Yukiko blimped out more and more, slowly being altered like all the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an easy choice, fatten Ai and everything would have gone back to normal, Chie forgot that pursuit of the truth meant risking so much more. The fate of the girls was that they'd keep fattening each other, over and over day after day. All because Chie refused to stuff one more person, however that wasn't all that Chie had done. That night of Chie losing her memories was a large storm, a big one that kept many people awake. Nanako Dojima being one of them she looked at her TV unable to sleep when she saw it, five girls four of which she knew stuffing themselves going 'Food is good, so good, amazing.' The words echoed in not just her mind but in that of every girl in Inaba that saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako walked downstairs and opened the fridge eating a cake she had made in class, it was good. Food is Good. The Story does not end quite yet though, this was just the end of the beginning.</span></div></div>",

Each tray had 2 Quadruple Cheeseburgers with bacon dripping with grease, 4 steaks sloppily placed on top of another, fries, nuggets, bowls of pudding, bowls of Yogurt and sodas. \"Ummm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? I just got what I thought would be good.\" Chie looked at Yumi with a bit of a sinister intent in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No it's not that, I just didn't know you'd get this much for the two of us.\" Chie chuckled mentally, two of us? No the whole thing was for Yumi. Chie put a lot of tender loving care in this time, she wanted Yumi to be her biggest project yet, perhaps it was her Shadow or her stomach but she wanted the girls to be so large that she couldn't budge them in her current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...if you don't want it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no I'm sorry.\" Yumi reached down and grabbed the burger, looking at it was like looking death in the face, grease dripping off the strips of bacon, she slowly took a bite, and the moment she did, it felt like her stomach collapsed in on herself, she began panting, stomach roaring in hunger, the thought of what the food would do to her left immediately, she needed it in her stomach NOW! She began by simply letting gravity stuff her with the nuggets and fries, her mouth was filled with them, almost falling out, but her mouth seemed to expand to fit the massive amounts of spuds and chicken inside her mouth, without a second thought she swallowed them all in one gulp, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Yumi-san?\" Chie had a condescending tone, enjoying her work too much to care that she was pretty much making Yumi permanently fat, if she could even move after this losing weight would be nigh impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEED...FOOD....SO HUNGRY!\" Yumi seemed to become a beast, a starving beast. So much so she didn't notice she had doubled in weight already! She picked up the burger she started with, as well as the other on her tray and began devouring the thick slabs of meat and cheese with large bits, growing more and more each bit by huge incriminates. Within moments she placed  the half finished burgers down, already equal to Rise's size she moved to the pudding, yogurt and drinks, pouring them down into her mouth to wash the grease away, her body get bloating out, crushing the chair she sat on, Yumi slowly reaching Naoto's size, her face looking puffy, her breasts ballooning, stomach pushing the table over which Chie moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie....can I...have your share?\" Yumi asked nervously as her stomach kept growing and growling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Yumi....that's why I got them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" With that Yumi let restraint lose, she finished the first tray within moments and reached Naoto's size! Then she moved to the second tray, simply inhaling the food, the concept of chews lost to her. Her body trembled as it grew out more and more, even cracking the concrete her ever expanding body, her breasts as big as an average teen girl, her stomach covering her slowly fattening legs, as she kept growing, more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually stopped at around 3-4 tons, immobile, she was at this moment in time the fattest woman on Earth, and Chie LOVED it, smiling. Chie stepped forward, ready to act.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps it was the showcase of her power, maybe it was the ease of it all, or how defenseless Yumi now was to her...whatever the case it didn't stop Chie was laughing once more as she caressed the doughy dome that now made up Yumi's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes however began to shine gold as a sudden thought came to mind. Yumi for all intent and purposes was her biggest project she easily dwarfed over Rise and even made Naoto look \"slim\" by comparison but it wasn't enough...no if she really wanted to test her new power then Chie needed a titan of an opponent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree possibly four tons in weight, immobile, and without question the fattest person on earth...but there was still room for so much more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear Yumi-chan you have no idea of how much more you'll become.\" stated Chie as she effortlessly scaled Yumi's enormous belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later having made her way over the girl's puffy nearly sunk in fat face Chie smiled wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you're ready for seconds, Yumi-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got no clear response except for a stiffed moan or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a Yes.\" the empowered blonde stated and with a snap of her fingers she began to stuff the already blob of a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was even remotely aware of what was occurring Yumi sure didn't show it instead her eyes remained rather glossy and her mouth wide open just as before simply inhaling anything dumped into her waiting blackhole of a stomach. It was questionable if she could even feel herself growing once more but she was with just as much intensity as she did during her first meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concrete floor beneath herself cracking and creaking as she applied more pressure upon it. Her stomach and backside swelling spreading out to the point where Yumi began to flood over any nearby objects. Her breasts growing expanding to the point where all Chie could see was a sea of creamy cleavage behind her soon enough they'd be big enough to house her and all of her circle of friends within them. She crackled at the thought of how Yosuke or Kanji would react to such a situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to assume Yumi had already added another ton to her still increasing frame but she still had so much more planned. Stuffing whole cakes, pastries, pizzas, hams, double if not triple decker burgers, watermelons, whatever she could think up she'd drop and stuff into Yumi who eagerly ate everything and anything without any sort of complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while she grew bigger, wider, and fatter in every direction. Like a tidal wave of blubber was her blob of a body engulfing and entrapping anything in the unfortunate path of her unstoppable fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she continued to grow into more and more of a fatten behemoth only Chie, grinning like a Cheshire cat and eyes gleaming gold, knew when Yumi would reach the ideal size.</span></div></div>",

Yukiko wasn\u2019t buying what Chie was selling and now knew that it was good thing she came back to pick up a few things for the inn. This wasn\u2019t Chie or rather this wasn\u2019t the young woman whom she had grown up with and considered the best of friends. This was a different Chie one that was beginning to scare her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA game\u2026that I was hoping to keep you out of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko gasped out loud as she watched Chie open her eyes to reveal her normal set gone and replaced with the twin orbs of a shadow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is all for me to see if I have the power to protect you and the others. But it was something that I never wanted to force you into.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019re content with doing whatever it is you\u2019re doing to other women!\u201d argued Yukiko trying to make an ounce of sense in what her friend was stating much less doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Oh nothing Sempai just hanging out and sharing a meal with Naoto-kun\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone call with Rise earlier had just awoken her to the harsh truth of Chie\u2019s words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026you did the same thing to Rise-chan and Naoto-kun didn\u2019t you, Chie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell now the blonde was legitimately impressed and surprised that her dearest friend was somehow putting the puzzle together piece by piece. Of course that meant\u2026no she couldn\u2019t do THAT\u2026Chie struggled holding back the temptation to fatten up Yukiko. She had made a vow to herself and no matter how much her power begged her to do so she wouldn\u2019t allow Yuki to be mentally altered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead she clapped a slow but steady pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery impressive Yuki, Naoto-kun would be proud of your deduction. Yukiko my dear friend it\u2019s true what I said I didn\u2019t want to get you involved in this but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie faded away! Her friend had actually faded away in the same way their shadows had! Sweet mercy what had Chie done to herself?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko gasped after Chie had reappeared behind her locking the poor girl into a vice grip of sorts. Despite the height difference Yukiko had always been physically weaker then her blonde friend and now the difference in power had increased even further due to Chie\u2019s new abilities. As it stood she had little to no chance of breaking the near submission hold the tomboy had her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease stop struggling Yuki. I made a vow to myself that I wouldn\u2019t hurt you and I won\u2019t I simply need you to know that I will never do to you what I did to them. They are part of the test you on the other hand are different you\u2019ll never be like them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChie what\u2019s wrong with you? What have you done to yourself? Why Chie why?\u201d her questions were silenced as a finger pressed gently on her trembling lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you I gave myself power. Real power Yuki but I have to test it out first and soon very soon I\u2019ll see for sure if I\u2019m strong enough to protect everyone I care for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie watched as Yukiko eyed her slowly nearly in tears no doubt worried for the mental health of her beloved friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me that way, Yuki. I\u2019m doing this because you\u2019ve gotten too close to the truth and I can\u2019t have that. I promise you what happened to Yumi-san won\u2019t ever happen to you but until then\u2026sweet dreams\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko wondered what that meant she got her answer a moment later when Chie actually gave her a small peck on the cheek! Stunned beyond reason the young woman wouldn\u2019t even have time to know if she enjoyed the press of Chie\u2019s lips on her soft skin because her guard had now been lowered enough for Chie to strike her into a state of unconsciousness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChi..Chie\u2026why\u2026\u201d muttered Yukiko tears falling from her eyes as she collapsed straight into Chie\u2019s awaiting arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting back her own personal water works her eyes now back to their original state Chie stared mercifully at Yukiko\u2019s fallen form. She didn\u2019t want to do it but it was a better solution then fattening the poor girl up like she had done with the others. While she hated what she had done Chie held on to that one belief she\u2019d never alter Yukiko in any way so this was the only way to subdue her thankful that she knew just where and how to strike so that Yukiko would fall unconscious but without any major injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon phased back in Yumi\u2019s direction, with Yukiko still in her arms, Chie figured that the girl would no doubt soon come around once her memories were completely altered to better fit her new titanic size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Yukiko out cold and Yumi soon awaking from her mental \u201creset\u201d Chie knew what her next step had to be.</span></div></div>",

Edible Greek Myths! \"Now I've seen everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell attacked her weak point, he nose, she smelled the aroma of well cooked steak, cooked just right to be tender and juicy. Chie had two options, surrender in now and just eat every bit of steak there and accept her new meaty life style, or fight her way through the Minotaurs...which can only be eaten to death, after all Chie had no Persona and can't tenderize the beasts to death with her kicks!

In her mind it was a wrongful desire she was only eating them to reach her shadow yet glancing over at the tables she felt her body ache and twitch at the feeling of wanting to consume it all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo no finding her shadow came first, eating the minotaurs was just business not pleasure she reassured herself shaking away the thoughts from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you meat freaks come at me!\" Chie exclaimed with a confident taunt.

He accepted her regardless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of her friends did, that more than she could ever hope for. Currently Sumer break and that meant school was out. It was just her, her friends, and the blazing sun. But what she wanted more than anything else though, was to gat her crush's attention. Or to be more precise, she wanted to tell Narukami -- er-- Yu, how she felt. They were on a first name basis with each other, that was good first step, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why was it that he seemed to be keeping his distance suddenly? It was subtle but she could tell. Plus Rise kept on globing onto him. Even Yukiko seemed to cut in every now and again. She felt left out. She knew Rise had an obvious Crush on Yu, but did Yukiko too? Did she have to like the same guy she did? She couldn't help but fall back into her old thoughts of jealously. Especially since she and Yu started hanging out more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the fact that she knew Yu liked taller girls. She may not be the sharpest tool in the shed but she had spotted him on more than one occasion looking at taller women. That's why her bestie had the edge here. She was a mere 5'2\" while Yukiko stood at 5'5\". Just how was she supposed to compete with that. Yet another little thing to be envious of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie sighed as she sat on her bed. She stared up a the ceiling which housed a poster of one of her many Kung-Fu idols. They never gave up so why should she. Yeah! All she had to do was find a way to get taller.

Over the past few days the restaurant had been having several special new items. Almost a new one each day. They said the reason for this was because they wanted to do something special for the customers, but the rumor around town was they were desperate for business so they were trying every new recipe they could find, even importing meat from a special farm outside of Inaba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie had tried every new item they had put out, loving each one and ordering multiples whenever she had the money, and she wasn't about to miss the meal today. She ran towards the store, her skirt kicking up with her speed, showing off how toned and tight her legs and thighs were now, they looked like there wasn't a spec of fat on them and couldn't even be indented if she pushed into them. She made it to the store much faster than usual and wasn't even out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Chie-chan,\" said the man behind the counter. \"Here for the special?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it,\" she said with a confident chuckle. \"In fact, can I get two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you have the money for them,\" said the man as he handed her two long steak kabobs with oddly orange looking steak skewered on them. Chie paid the man and quickly finished both of them off, patting her lean and hard stomach in satisfaction over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that was great,\" she said as she hopped off the chair, full of energy. \"Man I feel better than ever,\" she said. </span></div></div>",

Chie's stomach growled in protest of the strange meat she had just consumed. The pain coming from her gut caused Chie to walk into an empty alley, using a nearby wall for support. She held her stomach with one arm while the other helped the girl to stay on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't throw up,\" Chie said gritting her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the pain radiating from her stomach, Chie felt a strange heat wash over her toned body. The heat made Chie sweat all over her body, making the high school girl unzip her jacket and toss it aside. Her green tank top became drenched in her sweat. She wanted to remove the top as well but she only wore her sports bra underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is strange,\" Chie whispered almost panting from the heat she felt. \"Meat never did this to me before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother strange sensation came over her. A sensation that felt like her skin was stretching as her muscles expanded. Chie opened her eyes to see her normally toned arms had gained a little muscle definition. She watched as her arms surged with muscles in front of her eyes. In less than a minute, her arms went from slim and toned to massive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormal girls would have been terrified to see their arms be so large with muscles but Chie was different. She grinned while she flexed her biceps, watching them bulge to the size of small melons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool!\" Chie said in awe of the size of her enlarged arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie's growing didn't finish. She felt her abs tighten and expand until they became six-packs underneath her tank top. Her shoulders widened and her back muscles tightened, Chie's whole torso exploded with muscle, her tank top ripping apart from the strain her expanding muscles created. Before Chie could admire the size of her pecs and abs, her legs popped and cracked while they slowly lengthened until the high school girl became over six feet tall. When Chie's legs finished growing, her thighs had became incredibly thick and huge with muscles while her calves were only a bit smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain from her stomach and the heat she felt soon dissipated, letting Chie admire her new muscles. Chie only wore a sports bra and a small skirt but the muscular girl still flexed her muscles just to see how large they got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she admired her muscles, an idea popped into Chie's head...</span></div></div>",

First of notice were her arms swelling to beach ball like levels practically reaching the tip of her head, her breasts while growing slightly rounder and fuller were nothing compared to fuel of growth her pectorals were experiencing pushing her chest outward to about half a foot to a near a foot level. Her abs cracked and popped converting from a well tone six to an amazing eight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie could vaguely make out the sensation that she was growing taller as it seemed that her legs had finally decided to join in with the rest of her. Thighs and calves expanding into tree-sized pillars pulsing with power while just above her waist expanded as she knew it would her skirt hanging on by a thread by the time she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" Chie exclaimed as she gave a mighty flex once her height had topped off at a little more then seven feet, just a little under it as far as width went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome!\" she proclaimed as she gave one of her enormous biceps a hard flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are muscles for sure!\" she added cheerfully as her other bicep shot into the air with a boom.</span></div></div>",

It excited Chie to think about her friends growing to her size, maybe even bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe high school girl then left the alleyway and went to buy more of the special meat. Despite Chie being a muscular six-foot amazon wearing only a sports-bra, a skirt, and her jacket around her waist, the high school girl still managed to buy more of the meat without attracting any attention to herself. Once she had a few skewers of the strange meat, Chie took out her phone and did her best to call her friends without breaking her phone because of her new strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than ten minutes, Chie arranged for her friends to meet up with her at her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n............................................................................ ............................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Chie tell you what she wanted?\" Yukiko asked Rise and Naoto while the three waited in Chie's room for their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't say anything but to come to her place,\" Naoto answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said she wanted us to try something,\" Rise told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it's some weird meat again,\" Yukiko grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three continued to talk amongst themselves until they heard the handle on Chie's door turn. They each turned their heads to the door, seeing it open and revealing Chie on the other side. Yukiko, Rise, and Naoto were all shocked to see the massive six-foot Chie on the other side of the door, showing off her muscles with a wide grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what happened to you, Chie!?\" Yukiko gasped. \"Y-you're huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" Chie responded still showing off her muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie walked past her friends and looked down at the two fifty-pound weights she left on the floor. She used to have a hard time lifting them before but the massive girl easily picked up the weights, getting another gasp from her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get so strong?\" Rise said watching Chie toss the weights as if they were nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie took out the skewers of the special meat. \"I ate these!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie handed each of her friends a skewer of the special meat, grinning even more as each one stared at the meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys should definitely try it!\"</span></div></div>",

There had to be something more at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Naoto-kun, can't we just look at this and say how cool that Sempai grew so big and strong!\" Rise argued she didn't care for the hidden why just the how and that how was by eating the very meat in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know! Why don't you and I eat this and grow huge together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto could feel her cheeks heat up as the eager redhead wrapped an arm around the smaller girl's form, Rise was always so touchy and affectionate with her something that she doubted she'd ever get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Naoto.\" Rise begged using her cutest sing-song tone of voice that even the detective couldn't resist at those pleading eyes and wide smile. She'd never admit it but somehow Rise had wrapped her around the idol's little finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly Naoto agreed it was best to get things over with...and perhaps later she could investigate the real reason behind Chie's, and theirs apparently, transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you go first, Naoto-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise nodded to Naoto quick questioning, sighing she figured once again it was best to get it over with, \"Very well if you insist, Rise-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Naoto finished up the meat at first the girl didn't seem to feel anything different until a strange sensation began to form inside her stomach much like Chie she her body temperature begin to rise a few degrees something was definitely happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...my body\" Naoto muttered over the sound of her muscles beginning to stretch and grow. Her biceps bulging larger fighting to break out of the sleeves belonging to her jacket. Her thighs and calves attempting to do the same with her dress pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her limbs expanded so did her back and shoulders causing her to grow thicker and wider by the second the threads in her jacket really beginning to stretch outward as she grew larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a strong pack of abs took form Naoto semi-realized that now her torso was growing and that meant..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer already sizable breasts were now swelling in size and shape the binding she had used on them tightening around the thickening flesh which unfortunately meant that such an action was cutting into her air supply!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...help...me...\" Naoto uncharacteristically cried out, her face nearly matching Rise's own hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto!\" her friends yelled in unison!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's her binds!\" Rise explained as she ran over to the growing detective. Thankfully the growth had forced open the blunette's jacket and spotting the under shirt Naoto wore Rise quickly went to work unbuttoning it as well unaware that as Naoto grew stronger she was growing taller as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of that matter to the idol focusing only on saving her friend. At last she spotted the bindings that were tightening around the girl's chest area. Pulling her best impersonation of a cat Rise clawed and scratched away until she finally ripped off the last bind effectively putting an end to Naoto's pain from lack of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course this also meant Rise got an up close and personal view of the detective's breasts and the wondrous amount of cleavage! She nearly passed around right then and there had she not heard Naoto thank her kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that the girl's growth was done and much like Chie Naoto know towered above her, which was rather odd after getting so used to be taller then the blue-haired girl, not to mention her muscles looked amazing and yet she still had a bit of adorableness to her seeing as how her face had remained untouched and her hat as always rested atop her head.</span></div></div>",

Naoto's arm was wide enough that Rise could barely wrap her arms around it. Naoto blushed even harder as her friend went on to grope her massive breasts. Even Yukiko and Chie were blushing as they watched Rise grope Naoto's muscles and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise then stopped groping Naoto and took one of the special skewers. \"That's it, I decided!\" Rise exclaimed. \"I'm going to be just as big as Naoto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise surprised her friends again when they saw their idol friend start to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise!

Yukiko hurried to take out her phone and record the growth that was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth started as a wave of heat came over Rise, making her release a loud moan. Rise fell to her knees as the heat increased. Her moaning grew louder as she felt her muscles and breasts twitch. She looked down at her breasts to see them increase in size and shape. Her bra grew smaller and smaller as Rise grew several cups in less than a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are amazing!\" Rise yelled holding up her growing breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three watched as Rise struggled to stand up. She flexed both of her arms, despite her biceps not having grown in size yet. Rise moaned again when she felt her abs tighten and pump out. The rest of her body soon grew fit but it still looked unnatural to the size of Rise's beachball-sized breasts and eight-pack abs. Rise almost felt disappointed until she felt her muscles catch up. Her legs exploded with muscles, becoming even thicker than Naoto's own huge thighs. Yukiko and the other two muscular girls watched as Rise's flexed biceps rise as if they were being pumped with air. Rise had to bite her lip to stop herself from moaning too loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels so good,\" she said while still biting her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass tightened and ballooned in size, turning her panties into a thong. Before long, Rise's underwear barely covered her increasingly massive body. Her growth continued until the idol was even bigger than Naoto. Naoto, however, still had much bigger breasts than Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her growth stopped, Rise looked down at her slightly less muscular friends and the tiny Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise flexed all her muscles, almost tearing off what was left of her bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just as sexy as you now, Naoto!\" Rise stopped as she stopped flexing and begun to grope Naoto's huge body again. \"Come on, flex for me, Naoto!

Her forearms doing the same but a slightly slower yet still noticeable pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention momentarily moving over to Naoto as the detective cried out as the first thing to grow was her huge breasts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise cooed at the sight of the blue-haired girl's growing chest, easily the biggest part of her body now. The detective later arguing that it was her fault she was like this in the first place. Rise only smiling as she and Naoto continued to grow further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top of the idol began to stretch itself out thin as Rise's shoulders grew to her sides, her back as well stretched outward to better match her swelling form. The idol could hardly keep herself from moaning as it seemed that the combined might of the skewers was only now going to be unleashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body quickly exploding with muscular growth, every part of swelling many times over with unstoppable power. The sole part of her left untouched was her head as her breasts and traps rose and grew around her flushed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol was too caught up in her stellar growth that she hadn't even noticed that the detective was going through an amazing transformation herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like Rise every portion of Naoto's body began to swell uncontrollably reaching a massive size one moment only to outdo herself mere seconds later. Her own clothing becoming skin-tight as her upper body stretched larger and larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn clear contrast the detective was not enjoying the process of her body becoming a gigantic mass of muscles. As her feet began to sink into the floor Naoto silently hoped for the change to end unfortunately for the poor girl she would continue to grow onward much to her chagrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end the growing pair filled up a good deal of the room. Their muscular forms cramping to the side walls while the ceiling appeared to be one good flex away from tumbling on down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile it was only now that Yukiko was finally able to get her best friend's attention about their growing friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Yuki?\" Chie wondered as she turned over only to come face to face, sort of, with the now gigantic idol and detective!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUH?! Wha?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl practically shell shocked at the sight before her, while Rise could only grin like a cat and Naoto left as the definition of embarrassment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chie smiled rather confidentially as she watched another group of shadows head toward her. She mildly flexed her arm and leg muscles they were indeed bigger not by much an inch or two at most but she was gaining strength nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a new-found confidence she urged them forward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was surprised at how she didn't have to use too much of her persona's abilities to defeat the shadows. A few well placed kicks here and there and each one had fallen just as the numerous ones before it. The last was in the shape of a tank but a good deal larger then some of the same kind Chie had come across before. Obviously this meant it was one of the stronger shadows roaming around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless it too fell to Chie's new might. As it disappeared however the blonde girl felt a strange feeling come over her, a split-second stretch if one were to describe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused Chie did a quick body scan and was pleasantly surprised to notice her body had grown in size and strength yet again. Her muscles had expanded by about two more inches, again not much in the long run but Chie definitely looked and felt stronger then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I actually growing...bigger?\" she wondered as the shadow waves had apparently stopped for the time being. Flexing her bicep Chie smiled as it swelled to a height just a bit bigger then it previously was. Yup she had definitely gotten stronger over the course of her secret training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time however she did call it a day and still unbeknown to her the dark figure watch her make her leave, very pleased as well with the result. A sinister grin appeared on it's face as it knew that this training of Chie's was far from over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day came and as the persona-users walked together toward school the tallest of the group, Kanji Tatsumi, leaned in closer to his friend, Yosuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Senpai\" Yosuke continued onward but shifted his vision over toward Kanji, \"Is it me or has Chie-Senpai gotten...uh...bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? She doesn't look fat if that's what you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah not that. I mean she looks like she's working out a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke chuckled for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie always works out, or as she puts it trains, it's no surprise if she looks a bit more fit because of it. *Sigh* That girl has a stricter training schedule them some of the guys on the sports teams do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEying Souji Yosuke gave a quick apology, momentarily forgetting the gray-haired teen was on one of the teams and friends with two of the athletes who Yosuke as well knew as acquaintances. Lucky for him Souji passed off the joke with a simple understanding nod and hand wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway if you're really curious I guess I can ask her what's up.\" stated Yosuke flashing a quick thumbs up at Kanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell for lunch had just rang mere moments ago and Chie found herself packing up her things to join Yukiko. Amazingly Yukiko hadn't mentioned anything about her slight muscle growth nor had Rise or Naoto although she suspected that the ace detective obviously might already have a clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless at times during class she found it hard to concentrate on the lecture at hand and instead her mind would wander back to her new strength. It was just a hunch after all that if she trained on her own secretly against the shadows perhaps she'd get stronger but she didn't actually expect for it to work as well as it had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Chie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl blinked in surprise as she spotted Yosuke walk up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! What's up, Yosuke?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much, hey just to touch upon what I said yesterday? Have you really been working out a lot more lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit taken back Chie scrambled for a decent excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...well...yeah you know me I'm always training.\" she said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's what I told Kanji. See he thought you looked a little bigger...um in strength not fat.\" Yosuke coughed for a moment as he tried explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I don't think I'm any stronger...I mean maybe I'm but I wouldn't think too much about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah that's I thought too. Well I'll see ya after lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Yosuke disappeared out the classroom door meanwhile Chie sighed that was a bit too close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't like the fact that she was lying to her friends about her personal training but if it meant she could get stronger then she'd continue to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinue with her training...something inside her was really upping the desire to do so...</span></div></div>",

She couldn't really explain it, but something about seeing her muscles grow like that was something that she really looked forward to.  Eventually, she would have to tell her friends about her training, if they didn't find out first.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven during middle school, she was considered by her peers to be one of the strongest girls in her class.  She excelled at Physical Ed, and was a regular substitute for sporting events despite not being on any team.  Maybe it was her competitive streak that was pushing her to train more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took down shadow after shadow, noticing that her kicks were getting faster and more accurate, and as stronger and larger shadows started to appear, they were taken down more and more quickly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoo! That was quite a rush!  I'm getting really good at this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fighting a dozen or more shadows, Chie decided to take a quick break before resuming.  Sure enough, she felt the familiar warm sensation in her body that she felt the day before.  First her calves expanded a few inches becoming more and more tear-drop shaped.  Then her thighs, which were already a respectable size, began to expand.  She fought a few more shadows than the day before, so they expanded as such.  Chie couldn't help her squeal in excitement as her legs grew about six inches this time, notably stretching her shorts a little.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms and back also increased in muscle just like before.  Chie flexed and she noticed that her biceps were at least the size of an orange, maybe slightly larger and as she lifted up her jacket, sure enough, she noticed that her abs were becoming quite toned and visible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checked her watch, she could continue a little more before heading back home or she could go now and grab one of her favorite steaks.

There you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Yukiko.  Chie turned around and saw her friend and waved back.  On one hand, she was excited to meet her friend, but the minus side was that Yukiko would notice Chie's new muscle and she would have to explain it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what brings you here Yukiko?

Their portions are pretty big, are you sure you can handle it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but if I can't finish it, I can always give it to you I suppose.

I've noticed that we have been encountering stronger shadows as of late, so I felt I should try and get stronger myself....I know we probably should train together, but....I like doing this by myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well if you feel it is going to help us fight more efficiently I guess their is nothing wrong with that.  Just....don't overdo it okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure whatever, by the way, are you going to finish that?\"  Chie asked pointing at Yukiko's three-quarter finished meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  You can have it.  I guess I couldn't finish it after all.  Anyways, I have to head back to the Inn now, I'll see you tomorrow.\"  Yukiko got up, handed Chie some money for her share and headed out.  Chie finished her steak and Yukiko's food in relative silence before heading back home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe studied for about an hour before going upstairs to her room.  She looked at the time and noticed that she still had a few hours left before going to bed.  She looked around her room and noticed the dumbbells lying in her closet that she had not touched for a while.  Maybe she should train some more in the TV world?

As she looked down at her thighs and they expanded but only about an inch.  Chie deduced that fighting stronger shadows on the upper floors would cause her body to grow faster and more efficiently.  With this knowledge, she sprinted towards the staircase towards the second floor, took out a few weak shadows along the way before heading up towards the third floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyah!\" Chie yelled as she took out a single coffin-shaped shadow.  Again, her thighs increased a bit in size, but about half an inch.  Seems like if she wanted to really pick up the pace, she would have to face several medium shadows.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept on running through the halls, fighting a shadows along the way until she got to the fifth floor.  Again she felt her body grow, a little more this time and felt a surge of energy as well.  Little did she know, the mysterious figure was watching her again, waiting for the opportune moment.  Although she fought almost nonstop for 40 minutes, she felt as energetic as ever and only felt slightly tired.  Before her secret training, she remembered how the group would stop at least every three floors to rest a bit and catch their breaths before pressing forward.  Now she had pressed through five floors by herself, and she felt she could get to at least the seventh floor.  For now though, another shadow approached her and this time it was a fairly large, horse mounted one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy looks tough, well, I guess you'll be by last victim before turning in for the night.\" Chie said as she ran up to the knight, jumped and landed a roundhouse kick on the horse's head.  The shadows stumbled back a bit, but was not deterred.  It cast a spell before waiting to see what Chie was going to do.  Chie again landed another kick but again, it would not disappear.  The knight charged forwards but Chie easily dodged the thrust before landing a drop kick on the rider this time.  Chie started to worry a bit that she may have taken on a little more than she could chew this time.  She decided to call out her persona and ordered it to cast Bufula on the knight, the spell went off, and knocked the knight down.  Chie rushed up to it, and with a three kick combo, finished the shadow off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! That was a bit of a challenge...I guess I should head back and....woah.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie turned around and was about to head back when she felt the surge of energy again.  But this time, rather than a little bit and a little bit, it was a single massive surge.  Her legs, already big and quite toned, grew several inches causing her shorts to rip and tear a bit right at the seams.  Her workout top and jacket felt like it shrunk a few sizes, but of course, it was her arms thickening, her back widening and her chest piling muscle on that stretched her clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie ran back to the entrance, climbed out of the TV and back into her room.  She ran into the bathroom, closed the door and almost tore off her jacket.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jaw nearly dropped at her own reflection.  Her body had transformed from a somewhat skinny teenage girl, to that of a well-built fitness model.  Her legs and arms looked almost double their size from a few days ago, and there was a clear six-pack forming on her stomach.  After spending a few minutes admiring her new body, she reluctantly headed off to bed.  She began to dream many things.  Her being a fitness model in competition with an equally fit and toned Rise, a beach trip where the boys oogled her for her new fit body, even one with Yukiko hugging her for keeping her and the rest of the party safe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie got up the next day feeling refreshed and lively.  She wondered if she should dress her usual and show off her new legs, or should she conceal her body a bit longer for a larger surprise....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She was never one to really show off her body well at least not in the same fashion that most girls her age did of course she was a bit different in mindset then the norm majority yet looking herself over once again in the mirror after a quick morning shower Chie decided she didn\u2019t have much of a reason to hide her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell there was that and she\u2019d probably have to skip some if not most of the day shopping over at Junes for some new clothing. She\u2019d still have to get around to doing that but was thankful that a few relatives had accidentally given her a few pieces of clothing one size too big. She never had the heart to correct her family\u2019s mistakes and her mother always told her that perhaps in time she\u2019d grow into them\u2026funny how things turn out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of her mother the older woman had left early but not before awakening her heavy-sleeper of a daughter also informing her to make use of whatever was in the fridge as far as breakfast went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of Chie was thankful her mother had left as early as she had. To be quite honest she still hadn\u2019t thought up a decent excuse to explain her sudden growth spurt. Hopefully her mother would buy \u201cI\u2019ve been working out a lot and I am a growing girl\u201d but she still had her doubts\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course choosing to go out as she always did meant at school she\u2019d have some explaining to do. She hated keeping her friends in the dark about her training and perhaps now was finally the time to expose the success of her otherworld labor. Running a hand along her well developing set of abs she could only hope that they wouldn\u2019t find it insulting that she had gone behind their backs for so long\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting her home after a hearty meal Chie took to the streets. Lucky for her she had found a school top just big enough to house her larger size along with her jacket still holding together thankful there were no noticeable tears or stretching of the fabric. Yes it was more form-fitting then before but at least it wasn\u2019t completely ruined, she made another mental note that she\u2019d have to find and buy a bigger copy of her jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as her legs went a new slightly larger skirt did its job well at concealing the upper portions of her thicker thighs and new shorts. While way down below Chie was very thankful that her feet hadn\u2019t grown in size keeping her shoes feeling as they always felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through town Chie smiled and waved at the numerous people going about their seemingly normal lives. Again she found it amusing when some of her neighbors stared at her as if they were unsure if she was really the teenager they knew she didn\u2019t feel the need to correct them instead letting them think up whatever they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater Chie almost busted a gut when someone had asked her what college she was going to; did her new appearance really make her look a tad bit older? Regardless she also found it amusing when another person seemed to be a little intimidated by her after asking for the time. She told him with as kind a tone she could muster and the boy still stuttered out a thank you before rushing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever on her way she continued to ponder over how she\u2019d explain her new size to her friends\u2026the idea of buying new clothing came back to mind, a potential scapegoat to avoid her close circle of friends perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo she\u2019d have to confront them sooner or later but maybe later was better\u2026or was it finally time to let the cat out of the bag?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chie decided that it was probably best to buy some new clothes first.  She didn't want to fighting again and have her clothes rip off her, it'd be too embarrassing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Chie skipped school for the first half of the day to buy some new clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to get this quickly done and over with and be back at school by lunchtime.  She quickly went over to the girls' section and found the articles of clothing she needed.  Two pairs of shorts, a pair of track pants to match her jacket, larger underwear, and a few new shirts and tops, all a few sizes larger than what she used to buy.  After making her purchases, she found a bathroom and decided to swap her skirt for her new pants to conceal her new legs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never really thought about her growth, partially because she thought it'd be temporary, and that he bulk would disappear once the case was solved.  However, a thought started to occur. What if this growth was permanent?  How would the others react?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeh, what the hell?  Chie thought.  She didn't understand it either, so she wasn't going to think much on it.  She'll deal with it as it comes.   By the time she got back to school, it was right about noon just as she predicted and the lunch bell ran just as she ran into the school building.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Chie! There you are!  I was beginning to wonder where you were!\"  Yukiko called to her as she opened the door to the classroom.  \"And what's the pants? You've never worn those before to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that guys, I...I found out this morning that my skirt had shrunk in the wash and that my thighs have been getting a bit larger so I has to get a pair of pants.  Plus it was really cold this morning!\"  Chie said.  She thought it sounded like a stupid excuse but the others apparently did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose, you're right, it was really cold this morning.\"  Yukiko agreed.  \"And what did you mean that your thighs have gotten too thick, you haven't been eating too many steaks haven't you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it's probably her working out a little too much.\" Yosuke shrugged before Chie could answer.  \"Speaking of which, are you trying to become the next Chun-Li?  You know, larger thighs and kung-fu and all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn pure reflex, Chie punched Yosuke for making fun of her, earning him no sympathy from the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, should we gather at Junes later on this afternoon?  I think we could train a bit and try and find some more clues.\" Yukiko asked.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'm fine with that!\"  Chie said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, Souji summoned everyone to the Food Court and reviewed the new evidence before heading into the TV world again.  Rise and Teddie confirmed that there was another large shadow in one of the dungeons that they should get rid of.  After going through a few dungeons battling shadows and looking for any clues the killer may have left, Chie found the excuse she needed, they just needed to fight some really larger shadow, her body would expand, and she would feign innocence on any knowledge of why this is happening.  It wouldn't even be a complete lie as she truly didn't understand why it was happening to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, as they fought more enemies, she could already feel her clothes tighten as her body expanded in bulk and strength.  Chie had already surpassed that of a fitness-competitor and was not too far off from a bodybuilder's physique.  After this next big shadow, she wasn't sure if her clothes could handle her next expansion as she had a gut feeling she may grow right out of them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey managed to reach the upper floors of the Strip-Lounge and found a larger shadow.  They took turns with their attacks, each sword swing, kick and spell carefully placed and timed.   Just like clockwork, the battle finished and Chie felt that feeling again, but this time, much more painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArgh!\u201d  Chie yelled and almost doubled over in pain.  She felt her body was on fire...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChie! What's wrong?\u201d Yosuke shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh..ugh......\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie's body grew.... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a warm, humid afternoon in Inaba. Normally, Chie would be out training, but through a really unfortunate stream of circumstances, a bunch of rain had smoked her out of any real training. Feeling a little dejected from all the recent bad weather, Chie was simply sitting in her room, relaxing in just a tank top and shorts as she watched the TV idly, half-asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, one commercial of all things caught her eye, and snapped her out of her stupor like a hard slap to the face. It adverted sports equipment and made special care to introduce a sports bra that gave truly incredible support. In her training Chie wasn't exactly given much outside information, but she knew enough to recognize just what this bra would be helping with and how nice it would be for her. She picked up her phone and placed an order for one, as most of her sports bras had been pretty worn out by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a good five days to get there, but Chie couldn't help but be a little excited. She opened up the box, threw aside a couple seemingly irrelevant papers, and gazed upon the bra. It was made of wonderful fabric, black with a green trim. Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie stripped down immediately and tried it on. The fabric was immensely comfortable, and she could feel just how wonderfully it supported her supple breasts. It seemed a little big, but that was little to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie decided she'd wash it that night, throwing it in the washer and waiting for the next day. The next day was the perfect opportunity to try it on. She got it right out of the dryer and slipped it on, getting dressed over it and going out for the day to train and take care of her daily business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring a run she started once she was out of the house, Chie noticed her breasts felt warm. Deciding to ignore it, she went through the rest of her day as her chest stayed warm, like blood was pumping in it particularly well that day. After a long day of training and doing what she pleased, even going out to visit her dear friend Yukiko, she decided to stop by Aiya and grab some dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat down, Chie almost fell faint as she felt an aching sensation explode in her tits, racking them with a sensation as if they were exhausted from the day of being so warm. Chie gasped a little, and took all her effort o try to not touch or massage the pain away in this public place. Her stomach (still her primary focus and organ) took over though, chowing down on the food right away as the throbbing seemingly subsided. Chie rushed home after this, thanking the owner and retreating immediately to her room once home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home, Chie immediately threw off her shirt and massaged her aching breasts to get rid of the sensation. It substantially subsided, and as she was doing it, Chie began to feel as if they were a little bigger than normal. Chalking it up to good blood flow, she massaged the pain away in her boobs. They ached, still, but it wasn't agonizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell asleep with that night in just her sports bra and panties. Unbeknownst to her, her aching breasts were right back from their exhaustion, now accustomed to the special bra. Without much warning, they surged and grew, stretching the skin and filling with soft tissue. They grew fuller and rounder by the hour, seemingly trying to fill out the bra they were contained in, assaulting an unconscious Chie with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was most surprised when she woke up. She'd apparently gotten a bit wet last night, if her damp panties were any suggestion, and her breasts seemed a little more perky and pert than usual when she looked them in the mirror. But ignoring it all again, she focused on the great feeling she had. Though her chest seemed a little bigger, she justified that as the bra acting up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went about her day with a wonderful feeling in her body,a kind of energy to her as she went about her day. Her training was more rigorous that day, as she felt she could really stretch what she wanted, and she was silently thankful that for how her boobs seemed to be growing lately, this sports bra supported them nearly perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, when she got home they still  seemed to ache somewhat, so she massaged them a little. They definitely seemed bigger now, and checking in the mirror had revealed cleavage she didn't used to have. Though utterly confused, Chie simply decided to help the relax. Maybe they were in a growth spurt. Smiling at what this could mean for the rest of her body, she fell asleep, utterly exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, however, brought her first night's effects threefold. A careful eye would have seen Chie's breasts bulging bigger every minute, pushing against the fabric, filling the cups of the bra almost completely as Chie's normally moderate breasts began growing into something truly big, easily competing with any girl she knew. The assault of pleasure was just as bad on the unconscious Chie, effecting her dreams and almost putting her in a fever-like state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning was when the full weight of this was dropped on poor Chie, though. Literally. She woke up to feeling a heavier weight on her chest than usual. Screwing her eyes open, she gasped at her breasts and rapidly rose in bed, causing them to make an enticing jiggle that she would have never been capable of before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie normally wore a respectable C cup, but her breasts must have far exceeded that now, as the advertisement said the bra would hold F-Cups with no problem, and the straps were straining a little under the weight of her new, grown boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make sure she wasn't dreaming, she tried everything. She grabbed one of her other sports bras, a relatively new one, and took it to the bathroom. She stripped off her special sports bra (with a little difficulty, granted). It was almost undeniable now, Chie Satonaka had grown substantially. They were big, round, and heavy. Normally, she knew breasts like this might cause a big of sag, but thanks to her toned body and her exceptionally quality breasts, they stood pert and at attention, though not in the unnatural way fake tits do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarveling, she tries to slip on one of her old sports bras. Well, slip on wasn't the right word, she had to fight between the tight fabric and her perky tits to get it on, but she managed it. By now, any illusions of her breasts being smaller than they appear was shattered. A bra that would have fit her just fine less than a week ago now looked like her first bra would. Her meaty, full breasts positively popped out of the cups, pushing even more cleavage into view with an almost slutty window. Normally, the bra<br>\r\n would hold her breasts up, but was now held up by her tits. Even the sides couldn't escape as cleavage spilled like a small river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs strange as it was, Chie marveled at it. It was... actually pretty sexy. She groped herself and found that having big breasts could feel REALLY good. This was a crazy, crazy growth spurt. She looked worriedly at her new bra. If she kept growing like this, there's no way it would support her. She had to order a bigger one. That company uses really good materials, perhaps if she can find one that would low end support her tits (which must have reached F or G cups by now) she had to get it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ordered herself one and nearly ripped off her old bra, setting it carefully aside as she noticed her breasts might stress it enough to break. She then stared at herself, bit her lips, and nervously began to touch herself at the sight of her new tits, falling to temptation as she groped her newly enlarged breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after she realized she'd have school today that she had to make a call over a new dilemma Stay home for a while and wait for that new bra, or actually go to school for once? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She smiled as she felt over her skin, shivering a little at how soft it felt underneath her fingertips. Gone was the scarred and toughened skin that came hand in hand with her training, replaced by a soft, flawless skin that would rival Yukiko's easily. Chie still retained her slightly tanned look, but it didn't bother her now that her skin was so clear. She reached up to touch her short hair, not only did it feel much softer, it also looked a little lighter, the warm brown hair bordering more on being a honey blond colour. Chie gave a little squeak of excitement, dancing from foot to foot as she examined herself from all angles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it works, it works!\" Chie chanted, flat out ignoring how her stomach bloated out in front of her, the front of her school blouse straining a little, \"Miracle water, you are a miracle! I need to take some of you to school.\" With that she managed to squeeze four bottles into her school bag, and drank another one alongside breakfast for good luck. Chie didn't notice that her trademarked green jacket was bulging out in front of her as she began the long walk to school, or that the insides of her stomach seemed to slosh with every energetic step that she took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Souji-kun!\" Chie greeted the silver haired boy as she drew up near him at the school gates, \"What do you think, huh?\" she twirled on a foot playfully to show off her smoother skin and lighter hair, \"Do I look any different?\" Souji blinked at her a little dazedly, before looking at his friend in closer detail. The sunlight was highlighting Chie's perfect skin, and making her hair appear even lighter than before. While she was a tom-boy at heart, Chie did look stunningly pretty in the right light, Souji realised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his eyes fell to how Chie's stomach was pushing at the front of her green jacket, and he felt something stir within him. Her stomach had pushed out to look as if she were a couple moths pregnant, anyone else would have missed it, but he was drawn to it. He had to ball his hands into his pockets to stop himself from reaching out and touching it, his grey eyes continuing to rove over his friend. It was then that it hit him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".. you tried to look different because of what I said about Yukiko?\" Souji asked after a moment, watching as Chie's cheeks flushed a delicate shade of pink, and she looked away to the side, \"Chie. Yukiko's pretty and has good skin but,\" he shrugged a shoulder, \".. she's no-where near as exciting as you.\" Despite her heart swelling at the compliment, Chie couldn't help but bristle a little at the insult to her best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't say that about your girlfriend,\" Chie insisted as she stamped her her, it caused her stomach to jiggle slightly, \"Or my best friend! How can you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".. we broke up,\" Souji finished simply, cutting Chie effectively off mid-rant, \"We just wanted different things. Besides,\" he moved closer, Chie ducked a little on realising the height difference between them, \"There's more to a girl than having great skin.\" He leant down to kiss her, pushing Chie gently back against the wall, his hands ghosting over her bloated stomach. Chie squirmed a little at first, before feeling the sheer euphoria that rushed through her from those careful touches. She melted in his arms, her own curling up about his neck as he deepened the kiss between them. </span></div></div>",

She reached down to touch the bulge, recoiling in horror on realising that it was soft flesh underneath. Her flesh! Yukiko felt faint as her stomach billowed out bigger and fatter, the material beginning to pull as the fat filled the fabric out. Her behind grew underneath her, her legs thickened, and her arms began to plump out. Yukiko gasped as she looked down at her steadily fattening body, her dark eyes wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to take only moments before Yukiko's entire body filled out every inch of the once too big kimono, and it was even a little tight at the waist. Yukiko whimpered as she gazed down at her enormously fat body, her chubby cheeks stained with her frighted tears. Her massive stomach pressed against the fabric, heavy breasts sat down on the top roll of it. Her legs were thick and heavy, and brushed tightly against one another even when she was sat down. Her arms were tight in the sleeves of the beautiful kimono, and her behind stuck out so far, it felt as if she were sat on something.

It seems to be a dead heat between Hope and Emptiness.  We shall see what humanity craves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ageless deity sighed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this lull in the action's lasted for almost a month!  Since they saved that small, androgynous thing, nobody's even entered my world.  How trite...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention was drawn to the girls, who were just leaving the hot springs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy the hot springs, Nanako-chan?\" Naoto asked the young girl in their care for the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh!

As Izanami watched this exchange, her eyes lingered on Yukiko, the tallest of the girls.  An idea came to her, and a grin came to her face that, if Izanami could be quantified by human concepts of morality, could be construed as evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's... shake things up a bit,\" Izanami said with a dark chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---***---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater the night, the boys of the Investigation Team suffered another inglorious defeat.  After they, too, had learned of Yukiko's scheduling faux pax, Yosuke hatched a plan to surprise the girls while they slept.  Unfortunately, they got the room number wrong, and walked in on their aged teacher Miss Kashiwagi, and their extremely unpleasant and corpulent classmate Hanako.  After the most traumatic five minutes of Souji's life, the boys found themselves out in the hallway once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I propose,\" Souji said with finality, \"that we never speak of this again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure has been a lot of stuff the past two days that we're not supposed to speak of again,\" Yosuke sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder whose fault that is, Yosuke-senpai?\" Kanji grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that scoring?\" Teddie asked piteously.  \"Because if it was, I didn't like it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Yosuke could once again correct his friend's misperception of \"scoring,\" their conversation was interrupted by a loud boom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell was that?!\" Kanji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It came from the girls' room!\" Souji said, gesturing towards one of the doors on the other end of the hall.  \"Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys ran towards the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... you knew where the girls' room was this whole time?!\" Yosuke asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not important now!\" Souji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the boys reached the door...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yukiko still didn't understand why Chie and Rise grew and it made even less sense that they were both bigger than her.

Her clothes strained to keep the detective's muscles concealed but even with the clothes, anyone could see the huge muscles Naoto now had. One thing the others noticed about their friend, however, were that the size of her breasts were huge even compared to their enlarged breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stopped growing, Naoto flexed her arms and stared at her massive breasts, a deep red blush appearing on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...

Naoto watched with horror in her eyes as her pecs and breasts ballooned, ripping apart what was left of her jacket and revealing her naked and muscular upper body to her two friends. Her embarrassment only increased as her legs almost tripled in length but grew many times bigger in width. Every second that passed, the female detective's muscles bulged and grew several inches bigger. Naoto did her best to cover her naked body with her massive arms but it was becoming harder the bigger her body got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't look at me,\" Naoto whispered with a bright red blush while her gigantic forearm pressed up against her much more massive breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto fell to her knees when her growth finally stopped, leaving her with muscles and breasts twice as large as Chie's or Yukiko's.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fortunately, luck was on the their side. Naoto's place wasn't far from where they were, and using the alleyways and side paths, the girls were somehow able to get across unnoticed by anyone on the streets. Once they reached Naoto's house, Chie and Yukiko managed to help Naoto get inside the front door without causing too much structural damage to the door frame. Afterwards, Chie and Yukiko folowed the massive detective inside her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, her grandfather was currently away on a trip and left Naoto alone for a few days, giving the three girls complete privacy. Chie and Yukiko left Naoto inside the living room since it was the largest room in the house, able to let Naoto fit in somewhat comfortably without destroying more of the house, while they looked for something to let the detective wear. Seeing there was no clothes in the home able to fit the detective, Chie kept searching for something while Yukiko excusing herself and called Rise on her cell and asked her to come over to Naoto's with large clothes for the three girls (while Yukiko's and Chie's clothes were still on, they were kinda tight and had to stretch to fit).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her call with the idol,  Yukiko returned to the living room and found Naoto and Chie talking to each other, a shower curtain wrapped around the detective's new body like a towel. Although it wasn't great, it still managed to cover her body better than her tattered clothes. As Yukiko went over to them and sat down, she noticed that Naoto, while sitting down on her knees as she did not want to break any furniture, was still taller than the two girls. After sitting down with Chie, the detective started to speak up, her voice still a little shaky over the events of her growth spurt,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you were gone, Chie told me about what you found yesterday and what happened today. After thinking it over a bit, while I don't have any concrete facts or evidence, I have made some theories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, give it to us then.\" Yukiko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. My first theory is that after consuming this \"Muscle Drink\", besides you growing as the drink was supposedly made for, it seems like another effect on the drink has taken effect in your body. I call it a \"strength aura\", a close range aura around your body that makes people grow in strength and size once they have crossed this aura at least once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, but how come the people I passed by on the street when me and Chie were trying to find you weren't affected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That leads me to my second theory. While I don't know the exact mechanics of how this \"strength aura\" works, my belief is that a restriction of the aura on who it works on is that the person who's been touched by the aura has had some sort of connection or experience with the TV world. It would make the most sense considering how you found it there and it affected me and Chie, who you know have been to the TV world prior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. However, why did you all grow bigger than me? And why are you so much bigger than Chie?\" Yukiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I wanna know that too!\" Chie grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your first question, I don't really have an answer to it. Like I said earlier, I have no facts or evidence supporting any of my claims. However, the thing is that we don't know for sure whether or not your body is done growing, just like the fact that we don't know whether or not the people affected by your \"strength aura\" will grow later on as well.\" the detective said sadly, as while the strength felt good, the thought of becoming bigger and standing out even more than before did not appeal to her, \"As for your second question, this relates to my third and final theory. I believe that as the aura makes a person grow, it becomes stronger and will make the next person who touches it grow even bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it.\" Yukiko said, still a bit confused over the day's events and the explaination of the powers of her \"strength aura\", \"Well, what should we do now? How can we get you guys back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, I don't want to be normal. I like this size...\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie, we do not understand how else this will affect us, so it is for the best that we find to find a solution.\" the detective replied, \"Now, the only idea that has occurred to me is that we all go to where Yukiko found this \"Muscle Drink\" and look or any clues or solutions to our current size. In fact, since time is of the essence, I recommend that we proceed with this plan of action immed-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective was cut off by a voice she and the others knew all too well, coming from outside the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise Kujikawa was worried sick. After receiving a call during work from Yukiko, she was asked to bring large pairs of clothes over to Naoto's place since something had happened. However, any attempt of getting info about the situation during the call wasn't answered since Yukiko didn't think explaining it over the phone would be good enough and that she would have to come over to see for herself. However, she was reassured by Yukiko telling her that everyone was fine and that nothing serious had happened. Right after the call, Rise had closed up shop and headed to Junes to buy big-sized clothes since she didn't have anything big in her closet. Now, Rise was walking towards the front door of Naoto's place, a big bag of clothes that she bought in her hands. She may have gone a bit overboard on how many she bought but she couldn't help it, she was worried about her friends. Her mind kept on thinking about the worst - case scenarios of what could have happened to them, and she had to keep reassuring herself on Yukiko's words that they were OK. After reaching the front door, Rise was about to knock until she noticed that the door was unlocked. Looking more closely, it looked as though the lock was actually broken as the door frame had been slightly warped, as if a big person tried to get inside. Did someone break into Naoto's house and cause a fight?, Rise thought. No, she thought, calm down, calm down, they're fine. Rise opened the door quietly and walked inside the house, bag in hand. As she went down the hallway, she heard a voice coming from further down and started heading towards it. Everyone must be over there, she thought. As she was walking towards them, she yelled out,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie, Yukiko, Naoto, are you all there? Sorry for barging in, but your front door was open! Are you guys alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol walked into the room as Yukiko shouted, \"Rise, wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" the idol responded, stopping in her tracks as she looked at her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe it! Her friends had become so big! What happened to them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" the idol said, \"What did I miss!? How did you all become so buff!? Yukiko, Chie, you two are like bodybuilders, and Naoto, you've become an amazon! Not only that, but did your assets get bigger too!? Man, I'm so jealous of you guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh.. Thanks for the compliments, Rise.\" Chie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls were all thinking the same thing. Although they liked their friend, if Rise got too close to Yukiko, she would definitely grow bigger than Naoto, and considering how big Naoto was, it would be BIG. That wasn't the problem though. The main reason why they didn't want that was because they weren't sure if Rise could fit inside the room if she grew! Maybe if I explain the situation, Rise won't come near and we'll be OK, Yukiko thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Rise. Just sit down and we 'll explain everything to you. Just make sure you don't come near me, alri-\" the black-haired girl said, her words cut off by a pair of arms wrapping themselves on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise had gone in for an unexpected hug while Yukiko was talking. Oh no, she thought, it's too late!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so glad you guys are alright. I was worried sick about what had happened from your call.\" Rise said, releasing her hug on Yukiko, \"I thought you guys got hurt, so I rushed over from work, but it looks like you guys are way more than OK! I'm so relieved and happy for you all, but you gotta fill me in! You'd you all get so buff, and I know that it isn't from working out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Chie replied, backing up with the others and giving some space for what was about to happen, \"I think you're about to find out, Rise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Chie? How come you guys are backing up?\" Rise said before an odd sensation came over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko's aura started to take effect on the idol's body. The aura started to fill her body with power as her muscles were about to start their growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, this feels... great! What's happening now?\" she said, right as her body commenced growing.</span></div></div>",

Whatever clothing she had on was effectively ripped to shreds as her inhuman growth shot her to new heights. Her friends already near the exit could literally see pound after pound of muscle added to the idol's growing form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo them it was almost as if Rise was a balloon with an air tanker stuck on full release as her body grew larger, arms and legs alone already swollen as massive as the entirety of Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow...more...more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol yelled her desire an easy one, she simply wanted to keep on growing and so she did. Yelling out once more as her back, shoulders, and traps pushed out higher and further forcing the redhead to fall to her knees. However she would make zero contact with the floor beneath her thanks to her swelling breasts, her chest much like the rest of her going through quite a rapid growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were so firm, so strong, so big! What a wondrous feeling and the realization that she had at last surpass Naoto in breast size made the idol ecstatic, crying out in pleasure her body reacted with even greater growth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it grow...make me huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise in complete love as her room-filling body at this point was putting on hundreds of pounds of power moment after moment. Thankfully her friends had already made their way outside there was simply no way to stop Rise now so all they could do was wait for the idol's growth to come to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This room is too small. It can't contain me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise pointed out as she felt her enormous traps brush up against the ceiling. One mighty flex later she willed her wide iron-like back to smash right on through into the second floor but the idol wasn't done with a double flex of her titanic biceps Rise demolished her way further into the next floor of Naoto's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much power...Naoto-kun your home is too small for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise ignored the sight of her still normal yet completely flushed face nearly sinking into the field of muscle as her chest and traps grew further. It wasn't long until she felt the incredible width of her muscular girth take up the entirety of the second floor, crushing demolishing all in her body's path as her muscles still grew larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yelled as the pistons of power she had for arms now easily punched right through the sides of the Shirogane manor, her gigantic thighs doing the same to the ground floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I Rise Kujikawa am the biggest idol ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last boast of confidence born from the tons of muscular power she now possessed Rise literally flexed her way right out of Naoto's unfortunate home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dust cleared up the idol's friends could only stare up in awe, even Naoto herself was stunned silent. The realization that her dear friend was now twice as big as her home not to mention as big in width still hadn't registered in her usually sharp and crystal clear mind. Much like with her friends all she could was stare upward at the monstrously muscular idol.</span></div></div>",

Why did it make her a berry?

Her butt felt softer when she sat down was she putting on weight? Lunchtime soon came around, nothing too odd but Yukiko noticed her sweater was a bit more forward, Yukiko poked the sweater to make sure it was just the wind, it wasn't.

The gum she swallowed was still in her system! Her softer butt, her bigger bosom! All because of the gum! Yukiko felt a strain from her bra, before it snapped falling off, Yukiko looked back in shock but realized she needed to hurry home, so she put her free arm over her breasts as she ran. Her panties tore as well, her face was beat red at this point as she made it home. \"Oh god this gum, what's it doing to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko threw her clothes off looking at her bigger breasts, slight blue spots on them, she turned around, indeed a bit of blue on her breasts, Yukiko was in trouble, she couldn't stop the growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko's situation is growing more dire along with her body, but what happens next to her body?</span></div></div>",

It was somewhat fortunate that the rush of guests from the summer had long decided to go home, and the few that were still there, were quite understanding about the situation. A man had been called out from the local repairs company, a shy person who kept his head ducked down whenever anyone would speak to him, and worked steadily throughout the day to get the exterior fixed before another storm had the chance to hit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was starting to get late into the evening, and Yukiko's eyes were starting to feel gritty. She sighed, raising a hand to rub at one of her dark eyes, looking down blearily at the pile of homework that she had just finished. It was difficult, balancing top grades while helping her mother run the inn, but it was quite simply something that was expected of her. She had helped serve tea after getting in from school, and had then retired to a side room to finish off her homework. A glance to the clock up on the wall told her it was just past nine, and as she stood up to brush down the knees of her kimono, she heard the door slide open to her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to take so long,\" Yukiko began to say, only for her eyes to widen on seeing the repair man stood there awkwardly, \"Oh my! Is there something I can help you with?\" The man looked her up and down, almost anxiously, before shaking his head, and holding his tool bag tighter in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's finished,\" he finally spoke, his voice low and almost otherworldly, \"Your mother suggested that you try it out first.\" Yukiko blinked a little, touching a hand to her chest as she gazed through the open door almost longingly. She really had missed just soaking and relaxing in the hot springs, and her neck was starting to hurt from where she had been so focused down on her work. She gave a little determined nod to herself, a shy smile creeping across her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Thank you for-,\" she cut herself off in surprise on seeing that the man had gone without a word, leaving her talking to an empty doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn reaching the changing room, Yukiko stepped out of her kimono, hanging it up neatly on the peg provided. She wrapped the towel tightly about her slender frame, holding it in place at the fold before tucking it in more firmly; whilst there was no-one else in the hot springs at that time of night, she didn't want to risk flashing herself to anyone who might happen to be around. Her bare feet padded onto the wooden decking, the water looking warm and inviting, with spirals of steam coming up off the surface of the water. Yukiko smiled, her toes curling up a little in anticipation, before sitting down on the edge of the deck, and slipping slowly into the water. </span></div></div>",

It was barely moments later that Yukiko felt a wave of fatigue rush over her, and reluctantly climbed out of the water to dry herself. She reasoned that the heat had simply relaxed her, and tightening her bathrobe about her tiny waist, climbed the stairs up to her room; part of a wing that was closed off to the rest of the inn. She could barely remember brushing her hair and putting it back into a ponytail for the night, before her cheek hit the pillow, and she fell into a deep sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning came with a rush of sunlight and the persistent beeping of her alarm clock. Yukiko sighed as she sat up, hitting the off button on the clock as she yawned politely behind her hand, despite being entirely alone in her room. She climbed up out of her bed, and moved to where she had set out her school uniform neatly the day before. Her underwear fit a little more snugly than she was used to, Yukiko gave a puzzled frown, before reaching for her tights with a shake of her head. It was most likely an older set she had forgotten to throw out, she reasoned, trying to ignore the fact that even her tights felt a little smaller than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skirt was another struggle, Yukiko grimaced as she forced it to do up about her waist, if she hadn't worn those same clothes the day before, she could have sworn they had shrunk in the wash. She held her breath in as she did up the button at the side, before slowly letting it out again. The waistband was tight, but it held. Just. Vowing to start dieting, Yukiko pulled her blouse on, starting to do up the buttons. The first couple slipped in easily, the ones about her waist were a struggle, and the ones at her chest were straining at the material. She looked down at herself in surprise, hardly daring to breathe should the buttons pop open again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".. silly me,\" she murmured eventually, \"I really should cut back on the ramen.\" With that she pulled on the red jacket she wore for school, grabbing her bag as she left the room. </span></div></div>",

She passed through the kitchen to pick up the lunch the staff had made for her, nodding her head deeply in gratitude, before heading back out into the hallway to pick up her red umbrella from the stand. It was almost eerily peaceful, outside in the rain. All of the usual hustle and bustle was quiet under the sound of the water, and from her vantage point, Yukiko could see the surrounding countryside spread out for miles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved the rain. Other girls complained about how it made them feel cold, and wet, and how it made everything look so dull, but Yukiko always thought there was something special about the rain, something relaxing. She smiled to herself as she walked down the driveway to follow the winding road away from the Inn towards the bus stop, twirling her umbrella a little as she walked. Yukiko was so lost in her own thoughts, she didn't hear the car coming up the driveway, and cried out in surprise as it rushed through a large puddle in the road, sending water splashing up on her..</span></div></div>",

I don't have time to go back and change,\" she murmured herself, trying not to feel too angry at the driver; she hadn't been paying attention, after all, \"I have a spare jacket in my shoe locker,\" she remembered suddenly, she had accidentally left it in there one day after school, and had never quite gotten around to picking it up. Feeling a little happier about the situation, Yukiko began walking again, not allowing herself to slip back into a daydream should any more cars start to meander up the driveway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach ached a little as she walked, as if she had eaten too much despite skipping breakfast. Yukiko rubbed at the side of it absently, putting it down to hunger pangs. Her stomach felt almost heavy after a couple of minutes, like how it felt after trying and failing to keep up with Chie whenever they went to Aiya to try and win the 'Rainy Day Challenge'. It was a different kind of fullness, not with food, but with something that seemed to <i>slosh</i> inside of her with every step that she took. Puzzled, Yukiko looked down at herself, and gasped at how much her stomach was sticking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What..?\" she ran her hands over it, picking it up a little and dropping it again, it jiggled defiantly before coming still again, \"What's going on?!\" Her perfectly flat, and even a little concave, stomach had swelled out into a generous sized pot belly that stuck out a good couple of inches from her slender frame. The buttons of her red jacket were straining against the fleshy bulk rising behind them, and as a button finally gave way and pinged off, Yukiko realised with dawning horror hat her stomach was very slowly getting bigger before her eyes. Another button popped open, they all followed suit one by one, until only the two underneath her breasts were keeping closed.  Her belly bounced a little with it's sudden freedom, now straining at the buttons of her blouse as it continued to grow. </span></div></div>",

I can\u2019t tell you how many would be so envious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo rather differing statements obviously coming from two very differing women, Naoto Shirogane the former and Yumi Ozawa the latter, normally Yumi didn\u2019t hang with either Rise or Naoto but this time was a rather sudden exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise had been able to find Naoto rather easily though it took a bit of explaining since as she had stated the blue-haired girl wasn\u2019t exactly ideal in the help that Rise required but tagged along out of pure friendship with the redhead. Yumi on the other hand\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell the one-time pop idol couldn\u2019t seem to find anyone else free, or rather Chie and Yukiko were busy with their own individual needs and of course she didn\u2019t feel like asking any of the guys\u2026especially Kanji no need to add fuel to that fire\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she remembered how Ozawa was on friendly terms with Souji (there was a rumor the two of them had gone out together once or twice before she came to Inaba\u2026) and to be honest she had just a bit of respect for an aspiring actress, reminded her of when she was first starting out, although she had heard through the grapevine that the raven-haired woman had suddenly put that part of her life on pause. Rise was naturally curious but decided against prying for that information, at least for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case she bumped into Yumi after class the two hitting it off rather well and the rest was history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough I\u2019m not sure why people still refer to you as a prince, Shirogane-kun?\u201d Yumi asked questioning the younger shorter girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s simply a nickname I pay no real attention to it. It doesn\u2019t really bother me in the slightest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because even though you\u2019re more accepting of your feminine side you still dress like you did when you first arrived, Naoto-kun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead said in pure teasing fashion Naoto flashing her something of a slight glare although to Yumi it seemed that she was really okay with Rise\u2019s humor. It didn\u2019t take long for her figure out that the two of them were rather close with one another. Funny she always figured that they\u2019d end up as heated rivals but guess this was one blue-red pair that did in fact see eye-to-eye with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case the three ladies continued to chat away while seemingly hitting many of the clothing stores Inaba had to offer, which wasn\u2019t really much actually. Unfortunately as time passed it seemed that Rise was getting no where fast even with the help from both Naoto and Yumi. There just didn\u2019t seem to be a dress made specifically \u201cfor her\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a short break from their searching the trio found themselves at Junes\u2019 food court. Each with a different drink in hand, Rise a milkshake, Naoto a simple bottle of water, and Yumi a cold soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were starting to run out of options and Rise was almost considering asking Kanji for one hell of a favor\u2026that said she just knew there had to be something out there.</span></div></div>",

So what was the meaning behind this and who's idea was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I can help with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was unsurprisingly that of the detective prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was told it was the brainchild of Hanako-Sempai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment the others were stunned before the idea of the big girl being behind such a contest made obvious sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know this how, Naoto-kun?\" asked Yosuke curious where the blue-haired girl got her info.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My source\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave the girl stepped aside allowing for another individual to appear before the others. That individual was...Yumi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone.\" she said greeting the others with a slightly embarrassed wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead Ozawa-Sempai.\" Naoto instructed after the group of friends had welcomed the raven-haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi nodded as she explained how she overheard Hanako speaking with Kashiwagi. She couldn't quite make out what they were saying, keeping her distance so she wouldn't get caught eavesdropping, but the instructor had mentioned something about how she'd see to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the time Yumi wasn't sure what \"<i>it</i>\" was so she decided to pass along the information to someone she figured could help, that being Naoto. The detective scooped around and that flier in Rise's hand was the biggest if not the most obvious clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...this whole thing is made because she's pissed off that Naoto won the last one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty blunt but Kanji did have a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like it.\" said Yosuke agreeing with his younger friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems pretty extreme to me.\" added in Chie wondering if winning really meant that much for Hanako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's not fair!\" exclaimed Rise grabbing everyone's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She knows there won't be many entries never mind that some wouldn't want to enter out of fear of being labeled \"fat\" so with no competition or Naoto-kun entering she can just cruse to victory.

As stated earlier Rise didn't even have to move from her location since \"Her Senpei\" (Souji) would always rush over to protect her in case she came under fire. Obviously she loved that the gray haired youth watched over her but eventually all that grateful protection was beginning to have a toll on Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise wasn't a big sports fan, or rather while she didn't take part in any sport activities she still came to games belonging to the teams of the school, and politely refused taking Yumi's place in the Drama club when the raven haired girl and Souji asked her (the details of Yumi's departure were apparently personal to the girl so Rise didn't pursue any further...) so that left the former pop idol with a lot of time on her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime that she would use to tag along with Chie, and Yukiko at times, to get a bite to eat. Of course Chie burned through the calories at an alarming rate so she never seem to gain even so much as half a pound but not so for Rise who had a much less active lifestyle then the blonde tomboy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with all that said Rise found herself at the end of her small break shrugging at the weight she had put on. Truthfully it wasn't much 5 maybe 10 pounds at most, and if there was one tiny positive it had puffed up her figure a tad it wasn't much but she was a bit more curvier then she had previously been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo maybe it wasn't a complete disaster Rise thought amusingly but she still knew she had do something about this before it could perhaps get out of control. Rise obviously didn't mind being a bit thicker but being a blubber ball was definitely out of the question.</span></div></div>",

I'm a big fan, you were my inspiration when I was in Drama club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...thanks.\" Rise said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you two out here on a date?\" Yumi asked, Rise blushed red but Souji said the two were just friends and the words seemed to take physical form and hit the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well it's a shame because then the new lunch Special would be perfect for you two. It's called The Lunch for Lovers. I haven't tried it yet but everyone whose eaten is say's it's simply super-humanly good.\" Yumi said as Souji looked at the price, compared to other meals it was cheap but contained more he wanted, and more then Nanako's small stomach could handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it, I don't want to burden your wallet senpai.\" Rise said, even though Souji was rich thanks to their regular trips to the TV World.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji nodded, he ordered a cheeseburger for him and Nanako and the Lunch for Lovers. Yumi nodded and rung up their amount and got them their orders as soon as she could. \"Well time for my lunch break too. Mind if I sit with you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was too busy looking at her tray to notice, a thick sandwich containing ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato, 5 slices of each! Next to that was a small bowl of fresh ramen,  and to the other side was a bag of chips. Souji said it was okay and asked Rise, Jury was still out as she worried about eating the whole thing. Yumi came from behind with a tray carrying the same lunch as the pop idol, leaving the money for it by the Register for the person to take her shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now group of four sat down. Rise sighed as she undid the sandwich, she knew she had to eat it to not waste it. She took a bite, is it really tasty beyond belief? Is there a reason why it's designed for Lovers?</span></div></div>",

Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was calling to her friends who were standing behind her. \"Geez Rise, way to let yourself go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah pig, can't believe this is what you are deep down.\" Yosuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone began to walk off and even Souji shook his head before walking away. \"S-SENPAI! DON'T LEAVE ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large blubbery Rise cried only becoming bigger and bigger, Rise woke up from the dream panting. \"It was...just a dream...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise slowly began to nod off, not hearing the rain begin. There was no rain scheduled for tonight, but even the weathermen aren't perfect. Slowly Rise heard the sounds of munching and eating and opened her eye before the other followed. \"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the midnight channel there was a clear image, a massive red haired pigtailed girl in a Yasogami high uniform eating mass amounts of food with a smile on her face, Rise rubbed her eyes for a good two seconds before the image was gone. \"Was that...my shadow? No it couldn't have been, everyone beat my Shadow. Plus that was a HUGE person, her breasts were even bigger then my head, and she was as wide as if five of me stood side by side. No way could it be me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise sat up on her bed thinking. \"What if it was though? I have been eating a bit more lately, could my Shadow be saying something? I'm so confused. Could it be...I want to gain weight? I've been on a strict diet for so long, maybe I want some freedom with my food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise debated on if she was dreaming the whole thing or that it was true and what it meant. Rise had two options, one was believe it was all a dream and simply ignores it. Two is try and see if maybe she does in fact want to binge on food and try eating more to see why her Shadow looked happy.</span></div></div>",

Listening to the rainfall while staring at the ceiling above she ultimately came to a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was on hiatus, had put on a few pounds, and figured that the cruelty shown by her friends in her dream would not mirror reality Souji and the others were her friends after all no way would they abandon her just for becoming \"pleasantly plump\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was that and the quick vision of her shadow seemed strange to her. Despite the clear image it didn't say anything unlike the previous time instead it smiled and seemingly disappeared harmlessly. It puzzled Rise a bit, was the shadow simply trying to relay a message without resorting to the cruel intent from before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naoto had explained, shadows worked off a human's inner desires but took them to an extreme degree so was it trying to tell her that somewhere inside her she wanted to gain and in the process would be happier?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess it wouldn't hurt she thought with a semi-smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrew dieting and eating constant low-fat food, she'd break free and binge on whatever she wanted. No need to restrain herself now. Plus if her recent gain had meant anything she would put on the poundage in all the right places and she giggled imagining that Souji would really enjoy embracing a plumper curvier Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning like a cunning cat Rise went back to bed. In her mind Risette was about to get BIGGER then she ever was before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning came and Rise was actually surprised no one had phoned her about the midnight channel, Yosuke and Naoto were usually the first ones on the draw but this time nothing. Again she found her shadow's appearance strange had her friends all missed it somehow or was it just contacting her personally?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo clear answer came to mind so shrugging it aside as she changed from her night attire into her usual student clothing, of course it was a bit tighter then usual. Rise then went to get herself some breakfast. No more restrains she reminded herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything else Rise was a woman of her word. After scarfing down a plate filled with eggs, several pieces of buttered toast, strips of bacon, and two sausage patties Rise said goodbye to her amused grandmother. The elderly woman had never seen her granddaughter take in so much food at one time but figured she was a growing girl after all and it would help shape her more into that of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise exited her home/family shop poking away at her slightly bigger belly. She giggled at the sensation of how soft it was and how when done digesting it would puff up her body shape. Eying the local General Store Rise remembered the delicious candy the neighborhood children often bought that was sold there. She smiled just before entering the shop...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise chomped away at the piece of chocolate candy, as she finished she tossed the wrapper into a nearby trash can. Placing a hand on her belly Rise realized it had shrunk a bit her now tighter attire pretty much confirmed this. She estimated her morning feast alone added another five to ten pounds more on her. Given her attire it would be hard to make out, although she'd have to be a bit more careful with her skirt, and with a less puffy tummy no one should question her about her sudden gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise preferred to keep it that way for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No need to tell anyone anything right now.' she thought just as the school bell rang.</span></div></div>",

She placed it all down, inside the box was some of her home made tofu, a large rectangular portion of rice with some pieces of fried pork inside, a smaller yet still large side of sushi. Inside her school bag was another bag, a paper one, with a fresh sandwich inside. \"Time to dig in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate the sandwich along with some of the fried pork, taking in two different types of meat with this, she then ate some rice along with the sushi. She giggled as she did so. \"Man, I can't believe how free I'm feeling, I can't remember the last time I ever ate this much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise stuck a sushi in her sandwich and tried eating it like that, she laughed almost choking as she devoured the weird combination. \"Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise wondered what her belly was like now, she undid her bottom portion of her school uniform and saw her belly was resting on her skirt. Poking it she laughed. \"Feels like a pillow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise had a smile on her face as she continued on, buttoning back her attire as she finished her lunch. \"THAAAAAT was one good lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was feeling extra perky now, perhaps she found a bit of enjoyment in her new weight, later in her class Rise started nodding off, bored with the teacher's English lecture. Rise had a dream similar to that of what she saw her Shadow doing, Rise was surrounded by aromatic and delicious food and she ate it all quite greedily and contently. \"Miss Kujikawa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise woke up. \"I know you young ladies like to dream about boys but please don't do it during my lecture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...wasn't dreaming about guys though.\" Rise said, or so she thought, perhaps it was hidden deep away in her subconsious but the first meal before her in the dream was something Souji made for lunch and shared with her one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm that food looked so tasty.\" Rise said, licking her lips and some hunger growing from all the talk of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was in agreement, Rise wanted food as soon as class ended. Rise pondered where she would go today after school. A Beef Bowl sounded good to Rise. Oh but Junes has some tasty grilled steak. Decisions Decisions.</span></div></div>",

She finished it quickly however hoping it wouldn't hinder her appetite. Tossing the wrapper away Rise took the extra precaution of shutting off her cellphone. No interruptions she thought plus no one had brought up her shadow so she figured she was in the clear anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise arrived soon enough and smiled as she entered the restaurant.

I never would have had such a simple pleasure before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise downed the rice, finishing the large bowl and then finishing up the tofu, sitting back she sighed contently as she saw that her belly was becoming round, she poked at it and the tip of her finger went in and giggled. \"Not at the jiggly size yet?

Several being her own fellow classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought of it as mildly odd but business was business so she decided against bringing up with her grandma. At the same time as this boom in customers Rise's own weight was also climbing upwards, the girl had put on another five maybe eight pounds something she had only semi-noticed due to the happiness at her improved cooking and the surge of customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it appeared that the rush had subsided for a moment or two the break didn't last long as she heard someone enter the shop she fully expected it to be another girl and sure enough it was but not any ordinary girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Labrys-chan!\" she cried out in glee after realizing the teal-haired robot-girl had been the one to walk in.

Cotton candy was what she thought it was, she devoured all the 'Cotton Candy' leaving the springs and frame of the thing, Rise's ass wouldn't have fit in that thing anyway at this point, hell even her boobs would have been pushing it, and her belly was out of the question for a queen sized bed. 450 pounds, almost four times what Rise used to weigh, nothing was left to fit her she walked around nude devouring table legs and any other thing that was slightly edible. \"Belly, feels good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her soft stomach and down it's rolls as another slight burp passed her plump lips, her face now forming a fifth chin she sighed with delight having finished her second meal of the evening, a thud as she sat down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it over? Something was stirring with Rise, was it her waking up? Or another hunger attack on it's way?  </span></div></div>",

Something was happening to the former pop idol, something truly otherworldly that allowed her to seemingly devour anything edible. Even if that something wasn\u2019t exactly a portion of actual food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting herself up with a slight huff Rise, still blissfully unaware of her surreal binging, continued to roam the house greedily eating anything she could get her plumped up arms around\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door shook and rattled up a storm as if something was trying to force its way out. Finally the structure gave up on the fight as it was forcefully removed off its hinges and a moment later was being chomped on by Rise! The beyond bloated girl in her trance was confusing it for hard chocolate. Bit by bitten bit the door was devoured in about a minute or two\u2019s time. Afterward while she struggled for a short while Rise exited her home, leaving quite the imprint where her front door used to greet people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrior to literally eating her way out of her own home Rise\u2019s latest hunger attack had puffed her up even more now around 525 but still was not satisfied. Normally if she were awake now would be a sheer freak out moment but Rise wasn\u2019t aware of a thing. She was still in a powerful sleep walk and simply felt the need to continue feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to her side she spotted a nearby mailbox what followed was obvious she latched onto it with her huge arms ripped it completely off the ground, strange how as her hunger and body grew so did her natural strength, and started munching and savoring the metallic object and the numerous letter that would never reach their intended destination now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise burped softly after she was done, the mailbox adding ten pounds to her, and wasn\u2019t surprised at all when she began to take several steps forward. Despite the massive size she had reached the muscles in her legs still operated relatively well for the most part allowing her to stomp forward without any real difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally what WAS going on with Rise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case Rise then spotted something that made her drool with happiness. In her mind it was an immense cake filled with vanilla coating and dark chocolate on to top, in reality however it was the neighbor\u2019s heavy-duty truck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo way it wasn\u2019t possible was it, Rise wasn\u2019t about to eat an entire pickup truck was she?!</span></div></div>",

Her physical strength out classed Kanji's, her mouth opened wider then a boa. She had devoured half the pickup in a minute and was now crushing the second half between her teeth enjoying it and not even being hurt or feeling the glass. \"Tasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was quite and soft as she rubbed her massive stomach, bloating a good 50 pounds from the first half and as the second half came down. another 45 pounds as her tummy slowly touched the ground, she sat down with a small burp which she covered her mouth and giggled. \"Scuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't done though as she got up and her stomach demanded more, in her dreams she could smell aromas all around! The town was like a smorgasbord of food! A testament to her hunger, the General Store looked delicious. She walked over, and licked her lips. Even with her new strength Rise found lifting the store hard, until she began digesting the truck, then her strength grew and she uprooted the Twinkie looking store and began eating the entire store! \"Mmmmm so...good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth fitting around Rise plunged the store down her gullet putting on a good 200 pounds! The now 800-850 some pound Rise sat down, in her dream she was in a blissful field of flowers, when she sighed. \"This is the life, I don't care about my weight anymore, long as I get to enjoy food like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise wasn't done yet, no way. This hunger was just too much, Rise was only growing more hungry by the second. What plan did Rise have for this town? Just how much will Rise eat?

Just what was it that was transforming the pop idol into an eating machine?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fully recovered from downing an entire building, quite an impressive feat to be honest, Rise lifted herself up and was ready to hit the town once more\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Munch Munch*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise smiled gleefully as her weight peaked at around 975 (twenty-five away from half-a-ton) after stuffing down another parked car into her bloated stomach drooped on the floor and two feet in front of her. Of course lifting it was far too simple a task as her strength had increased yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began popping another automobile into her greedy maw, for there was a bit of a method to this madness for up at top the hill stood her school, Yasogami High, but in Rise\u2019s \u201cheighten\u201d mind it was actually an economy-sized gingerbread house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweets decorating it all over Rise nearly drooled up a flood imagining how good it much taste, nothing was going to stop her and lucky for her there was nothing in the way other then more \u201ccakes\u201d sitting peacefully along the path leading to the \u201ctasty house\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it went without saying that Rise began eating away at car after car in her way to the academic building. However while she still very much wrapped up in her dream world something occurred to her after finishing off the four \u201ccake\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had noticeably grown a bit taller, she wasn\u2019t exactly tall to begin to with but now she was close to six feet or had she already passed it? Eh it ultimately didn\u2019t matter much to her if anything she thought it was actually cool to be getting bigger in so many ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 1200 pounds her mighty tree trunk sized legs pounded hard into the pavement as Rise continued up the hill, not at all exhausted from the constant eating and hiking. She smiled for she was halfway there\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn\u2019t for it being the dead of night and if one hadn\u2019t already ran away screaming their lungs off said person would have noticed an immense shadow descend upon the iron (or candy-cane in one idol\u2019s mind) gate just outside and leading to Yasogami High.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat shadow belonged to a perfectly walking one-ton blob of a woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a body size that spanned an entire street and then some along with pushing near seven feet in height Rise was truly a sight to see and watch as she stomped closer to her ultimate destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing little effort on her part she bended her car-sized legs leaned in forward and began plucking away at the gate slurping it up as if it were spaghetti. Seventy-five pounds added and taking less then a minute Rise was now ready for the main course (at least of this hunger strike).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer huge fatty feet leaving Bigfoot-like imprints on the pavement below as she took the steps needed before at last reaching the building Rise licked her lips in anticipation. The girl was hungry very hungry and it didn\u2019t matter that she was turning into a monster from some cheap B horror movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you like this my dear belly.\u201d She stated a moment she began her biggest, up to now, feast...</span></div></div>",

She almost looked like a hill, almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was no expert on such things Yosuke explained how what was left of the evening sky would conceal Rise for now but they had less then an hour before daybreak came around. Once it did all in Inaba however would be able to see the former pop idol turned monstrous blob!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they discovered her Rise would be treated like a monster. Neither he nor Yosuke would allow that happen but what could they do in the short amount of time? Or course Rise was probably feeling vulnerable and no doubt terrified especially if she had no recollection of how she had grown so massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking out of the Dojima home as best he could, good thing his uncle was a heavy-sleeper along with dear sweet Nanako not hearing a thing, Souji explained to Yosuke that he would confront and comfort Rise in the mean time Yosuke would round up the others and see if there was a way to either trim down Rise or prevent everyone in the small town from noticing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke wasn\u2019t exactly sure what they could do about that last part or how Rise got so enormous but he agreed to the plan of action nonetheless\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes till sunrise and while he was in good shape for someone his age Souji still took a moment to catch his breath after practically marathon running from one side of town to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building-spanning Rise was just up ahead it seemed to him that she hadn\u2019t moved an inch since he, and Yosuke, had discovered her in all her tremendous glory. On that note Rise wasn\u2019t completely in the nude, by some miracle small traces of what was left of her nightgown had covered her fatten nipples just a tad, her womanhood luckily concealed by her field of a belly, her whale of a butt however was exposed for all to see!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally one would have most likely fainted from such a sight but Souji fought hard remembering Rise needed him now more then ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy how did this happen?

It was her beloved senpai!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSenpai\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she watched him wave his arms at her almost in an alerting fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending her knees as best she could she titled just a bit forward far enough for her huge arm to stretch out she instructed the tiny youth to hop aboard. Souji wasted no time doing as told. Her love now gently in her possession Rise brought him in closer to her fat surrounded face numerous chins jiggling with content as she smiled at her tiny crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSenpai I\u2019m so glad to see you\u2026I um\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise struggled for a moment, her plumped cheeks burning red with heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026grew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled in self-pity obviously there was nothing funny about this or about what had happen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji understood however instructing her to pull him in closer. She did so and while he was practically the size of a bug compared to her the high-schooler was still able to plant a brief peck on her surprised lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was stunned to say the least but still listened in to what he had say explaining how she didn\u2019t have to be scared, how everyone in their group of friends would help her out as best they could, and most of all how he still cared for her even if she was the size of a building. To him she wasn\u2019t a monster or a freak she was still his Rise-chan\u2026there was just a lot more of her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say she was touched would be an understatement. Rise once again began to sob away but this time explained that they were tears of joy not fear the boy she loved so much was willing to stay by her side despite what had occurred to her. She felt relived, revived, and so content. Rise adorably cheered with a quick squeal before accidentally plowing Souji into her sea of cleavage, who knew if the boy at the moment was scared or actually enjoying himself.</span></div></div>",

He was going to grab her enough food to last her, and told her to make a story up if Dojima and Nanako wake up. Rise sniffed and nodded as the two kissed and Souji walked out. Rise looked at her belly. \"Yeah? You're going to have to be patient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise then fondled her now super large breasts. \"Geez. my boobs put together must weigh as much as Naoto now. They're so big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise sighed and got up from the chair, she thought it was old because it creaked the entire time she sat on it, and laid on the couch. Her large side sunk into the couch as Rise sighed out of boredom this time and felt her stomach grumbled louder. \"Urrrrrhhhhh Stop it stomach...that hurts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise's stomach only growled back louder. \"OOOHHHHHH Senpai please HURRY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise held the large growling object.</span></div></div>",

A stomach however that still demanded more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo moving as silently as she could given her size no pardon the pun small feat Rise waddled over toward the main room and it didn\u2019t take long for the ridiculously sized girl to begin eating away at the couch she had once sat on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of her hated what she was becoming again yet another part told her that it was all she could do to control her unworldly hunger.

A huge blob of a monster straight out of one of those giant lizard movies was attacking if not munching away at their defenseless town!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyotaro Dojima had already left after being awakened by a phone call explaining the situation of the mighty unstoppable beast.

Her long locks of gray hair along with the bottom end of her dress flowed into the wind as the gentle breeze caught a hold of them. The woman at least for the time being was giving her back to them but that wouldn\u2019t last too long however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while has it not children of man as well as to you my dear little special shadow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat voice that specific vocal tone nevermind the attire the individual was wearing\u2026no it was impossible it couldn\u2019t be\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIzanami\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning over the formerly defeated goddess smiled just a tad at the young detective who had called out her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWah, I thought we defeated her!\u201d Teddie stated nearly hiding behind his human friends. The bear still wasn\u2019t as brave as he hoped he could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fallen goddess after being questioned by Souji went to explain how being a god meant she was practically immune to death in the sense that the two of them knew it as. Stating with subtle humor that if anyone were able to kill her kind then they wouldn\u2019t be as honored and worshipped as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet defeat had cost her a great deal of her power that would take an untold amount of time to fully return. The strength she possessed when she confronted the group of Persona users the last time around was far beyond her current statistic. Of course she wasn\u2019t exactly in a fighting mood at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went on stating that she used the connection she had with the beings of the world they were in to silently contact Teddie and lure him here knowing full well at least one of the bear\u2019s friends would join him. To be quite honest she wasn\u2019t too surprised when it turned out to be Souji and Naoto the two were perhaps the most brilliant outside Yukiko, and obviously were looking for answers of the current situation in their world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes she quite well of what was occurring back in their side. How their close personal friend (and potential love interest to the gray-haired boy) had somehow morphed from her previous average size figure to that of a terrorizing walking human blob!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you know what\u2019s caused the change?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess nodded to the question presented to her by the young detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is the work of her shadow. Like you young one\u2026\u201d she motioned toward Teddie, \u201cit seems it has evolved in a sense Kujikawa\u2019s feelings personal desires have triggered a growth in its abilities and power. It is my assumption that it was somehow able to form a bond with Kujikawa without her being aware of such a thing occurring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzanami slowed herself down for a moment before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause of that her shadow is able to manipulate her movements, her thoughts, her actions\u2026her very form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat explains the enormous size she has now taken. It would be impossible otherwise.\u201d Stated Naoto, doing her best to take in every detail that had been said so far\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are correct Shirogane-chan. It is in fact due to her shadow\u2019s influence that her body size is able to expand to the state it has reached this is because the shadow is using her as a generator of sorts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching the confused looks on their faces the goddesses decided to explain in simpler terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn short the larger Kujikawa becomes the more powerful her shadow becomes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer size is converted into power\u2026yes is it as you say just as a generator runs to keep a home in operational form Rise-san is fueling her shadow with a constant stream of\u2026power?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d the goddess nodding swiftly, \u201cso long as Kujikawa-chan continues to gorge herself on anything she finds eatable the power of her shadow will continue to increase as it is you can\u2019t not hope to defeat it instead you must cut off its power supply.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji argued how could they accomplish that without harming Rise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat my dear child is simple I\u2019m not asking you to kill the poor woman no instead she must be simply be stopped in some fashion that breaks the bond the two of them share.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto suggested that it would take such an move was mostly likely beyond any of them, even Souji who of course didn\u2019t feel at all comfortable striking down Rise. Izanami retorted that the boy would be unable to confront Rise due to him being needed in the front-line against her shadow so instead she proposed a different idea\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would mirror the talents of Rise\u2019s shadow and grant one of the close group of friends the power to face off against the massive redhead that individual would keep her busy perhaps subdue her as well while everyone else would confront and defeated her newly-powered shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen asked why she didn\u2019t just battle the dark spirit herself she explained that the shadow was constantly gaining strength due to the link it shared with Rise and she only had so much power within her if the fight went on for too long even someone like her would fall in defeat so this was the best she could do at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost ironic in that she was willingly helping out the same group of youths that had handed her a brutal defeat not too long ago but desperation usually brought forth measures that were surprisingly for lack of a better word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stated that she should return with the trio to the entrance where they would bring over their remaining friends, her weaken state made it so she couldn\u2019t leave the TV world even if she wanted to, afterwards they could decide among themselves who would be chosen to take on their monstrous friend...</span></div></div>",

Kanji was omitted due his great physical strength being needed against the ever-powering shadow (that and he\u2019d fall into a blood-loss induced coma if he had to take on a titanic Rise on his own).

Take your pick child of Man.\" Chie growled as she downed the whole bag of chips, followed by another, and another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides...it is not like I do not suffer either...\" Izanami said in thought, as Chie gained a small paunch so did the goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie started devouring whole containers of food. \"Whoa...is this what Rise-chan is going through?

A Chubbier Chie walked around and started eating other foods, cereal, candy, peanut butter, little snack cakes, all kinds of things. Chie had give up her inhibitions and was pigging out like no tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie, and Izanami, was gaining weight rapidly. The question was would it be fast enough? </span></div></div>",

If she wasn\u2019t so concerned with eating anything in sight Chie would have congratulated herself on having such large boobs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case she continued to gorge and swell outward at a much faster pace thanks to Izanami\u2019s help, unaware that the sliver-haired goddess was growing equally alongside her, determined to devour everything within the store in doing so she wouldn\u2019t be Rise\u2019s equal but at least she\u2019d be on her way\u2026</span></div></div>",

Delicious! Her thoughts were all about how good it was. Becoming an Omnivore in every sense of the word Chie decided to eat the entire remains of Junes sans what kept the Electronics standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems she's lost a bit of control as well, the sensation is so new to her, it's a bit of a shock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie walked out and like heavy machinery dug her jaw into the ground and ate the pavement! She swallowed the roads and began waddling down eating homes Rise deemed too small! Chie was always the strongest of the females, so ripping a home out and devouring it was easier for her then the pop idol. As she swallowed them home she regained control. \"Izanami, when this is over...what happens to me and Rise's bodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The task at hand comes first, the more time you waste the larger your friend grows and the more likely she'll grow to a point that she'll consume entire land masses.\" Chie sighed worringly and went on the devour home after home, picking up pace and eventually all of Inaba sans the homes of her closest friends was eaten! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, to follow Rise-chan's path!\" Chie, now more then 3x as tall waddled following the large footprints left by Rise, when she arrived at the next town Rise terrorized she uprooted the ground, bridges and all and  forced it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out Rise-chan...I'M COMING FOR YOU!\"</span></div></div>",

She thanked him for that afterwards the younger boy muttered something under his breath trying to fight back the potential embarrassment he was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes Kanji was right all she, along with the rest of her friends, could do was trust in Chie\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she wasn\u2019t in such a hurry perhaps Chie would have considered herself a bottom-feeder, devouring what ever was left behind by Rise the redhead\u2019s titanic destruction seemingly spreading all across Japan. She had always wanted to get out of Inaba and see the sights and sounds of her home country (the school-trip excluded) but this certainly wasn\u2019t the way she had expected her trip to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer immense legs pounding hard into the ground, a combination of the tons of fat stored within the twin pillars and surprisingly the bit of muscle still buried beneath so much girth. Chie figured that not only was the otherworldly power helping her move despite her size but her previously fit-frame was also helping the gigantic tomboy stay mobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down Chie eventually picked more of Rise\u2019s scraps, looking pass her tremendous gut and field of flesh that consisted of her breasts (one thing that she was secretly proud of...lets see anyone call her small now), she burped a bit still surprised at how massive she had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCities were quickly looking more like toys to her, her hunger still strong but amazingly starting to reach a calming point. She noted that she was still very much filled with an inhuman hunger but it was at last starting to slow down, perhaps it was a hint that she was reaching or had reached Rise\u2019s size?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t sure and didn\u2019t feel like pestering Izanami about it all Chie knew was that she felt enormous and even then perhaps that was a HUGE understatement. She took a moment to pause after crossing over a hill, munching away at a handful trees in the process, when she spotted something out in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA truly massive towering figure stood rather ominous over a field not too far from her position. Amazingly even at her size and height she couldn\u2019t quite make out what it was doing but she did have a pretty good idea of what \u201cit\u201d was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise! It had to be her nothing on the planet was that big, present company excluded obviously, giving her dome-sized belly a hearty slap Chie steeled herself for she had at last found her friend-turn-monster now it was time to set her straight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing forward the ground quaking and cracking as Chie began sprinting over in the direction toward Rise. Maybe she could sneak attack and end things in the span of a few seconds\u2026but that plan was quickly tossed out as she neared the colossal redhead and colossal was just an easy way of describing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was enormous with enough girth to potentially crush a city if she wanted to just as Rise at one point but unfortunately just as the sliver-haired goddess had warned too much time had passed between Chie\u2019s growth and Rise\u2019s continuous growth that now the blonde girl had indeed rivaled the pop idol\u2019s form\u2026problem was it was her old size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new Rise was simply beyond words roughly anywhere between three to five times larger then Chie the tomboy couldn\u2019t even put numbers to how insane the redhead\u2019s weight must total at, a singular leg was wider thicker then her entire body a good estimate at how over-matched she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevermind that despite the height she had gained Chie barely scratched over the pop idol\u2019s kneecap, putting her at a stunning disadvantage not only in weight but Rise was easily three if not four times larger then her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that it came as no surprise to Chie that Rise didn\u2019t even feel her coming the list of things she could feel was most likely a pretty short one. Hell she even began to wonder if Rise could even see pass her sky-eclipsing belly and set of breasts that could no doubt house a few cities in there\u2026oh who was she kidding even her own body ran the risk of sinking deep into the redhead\u2019s cleavage\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying her best to control her emotions and not dive into a panic Chie racked her brain for any options useful towards handling the new situation.</span></div></div>",

This is it Izanami-Sama does she know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe will soon. The process is nearly complete. I will leave everything in her hands, I trust in her and in the other children.

The Goddess was no longer on the other side so trying to contact her was pointless and yet Chie still understood the gist of it. A sole tear ran down her eyes as she truly came to terms with what had just occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing this she did the only thing she could do\u2026and that was let go let it all go and take in the noble sacrifice\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn angst-filled roar escaped her soft lips the feeling of combining with Izanami\u2019s very essence was a near-sensory overload yet she endured she had to for the goddess, for her friends, for Rise, and for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise grunted in pain as she tossed aside Chie due to her overwhelming transformation. The redhead had no clear idea what was occurring but was soon to find out\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the?\u201d she complained her vision still recovering from partial blinding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she started at the figure however a gasp of near terror left her tender lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone was the formerly rotund -like state of being instead now she had taken a more hour-glass shape. Her curves so shapely and beautiful, the tons of blubber from before reshaping and forging her into more of a woman then she could have ever hoped for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost felt like as if she were a top-rank model except for the immense muffin-top that now shaped her belly and surprised her when her hand stroked her now slightly longer hair (about shoulder-length give or take an inch).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last feeling going through her was the sensation of her strength she felt stronger far stronger then she had ever felt in the past, even before the stunning transformation. It was a feeling that made her believe she had the power to move mountains. Her muscles buried underneath her new girth yet unhindered and actually supporting rather easily her enormous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had to label herself in any way she supposed it would be something of a gigantic fat amazon of a woman that towered a few heads taller then the already massive redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d questioned Rise her voice nearly cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few moments ago\u201d she paused rather stunned at how her usual voice had deepen somewhat giving her a more mature vocal tone. She smiled at the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose before I was merely your friend Chie.

Of course this method while quicker was also proving to be a tad bit more painful then the goddess perhaps had envisioned it to be on the brilliant teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing her best with what little time she had Naoto forced her feet to part with her boots sparing her toes the pain of outgrowing the footwear. Gasping again however reminded her that she needed to remove the binds around her chest, her ballooning breasts were really starting to become a problem due to their already ample size and the sudden growth was only making them bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bit of yell she forcefully ripped the tape right off her body tossing it aside along with her jacket the less restrictive clothing she had on the better. Her body already bloating up several times her normal weight and obviously wasn\u2019t about to stop any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto could feel the fabric of her pants start to give as her thighs inflated and begin to shorten the gap between them of course the wedgie born from her panties being engulfed by her expanding ass was helping matters either, she didn\u2019t even have to feel around to know that she was beginning to form a shelf back there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpwards her shirt had come undone as her now massive breasts fought to escape the confines of her bra while her near beachball of a gut had in poured outward and was now easily visible, her newly made fat rolls jiggling as the transformation continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto could feel a second, or was it third, chin come on while even her arms were starting to dip over in blubber. Waddling around as best she could she at last realize that not only was she getting fatter by the second but was getting taller as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure what to think of the method used to make her grow but knew enough that she couldn\u2019t stop it now and best to simply ride it out.

If anyone were to passing by the store at the moment they would no doubt come to notice the mounds of flesh pushing up against the glass windows and effortlessly moving onto the lower levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the strain her massive blob of a body was still in full-effect. Her now tiny face flushed with heat as her rolls of fat pounded away at the sturdy, but beginning to give, walls of business complex.

She had literally buried a portion of her hometown with countless tons of herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps allowing Chie to do this would have been a better plan...no she shook away her doubts she had willingly volunteered and knew the course of action in stopping Rise would be drastic to say the least so like it or not it was the job of the detective blob to stop Rise's shadow-powering binge. Afterwards she could worry about how she and the redhead were going to regain their former slim selves...if they could at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto grunted for a moment as she struggled to find her footing underneath her enormous bulk after several attempts she at last found herself lifted off the ground, a near literal mountain of flab, the cool brisk air helping in cooling down her body temperature right away she figured moving gracefully at this size was practically out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo taking one simple step forward, the earth beneath her quaking and crackling at the tremendous weight coming down upon it, she soon took another then another and soon the blue-haired behemoth began to make her way out of the remains of Inaba.

The monstrous redhead had left behind a trail of her destruction so all the detective blob had to do was follow the aftermath from her eating assaults.

Izanami had stated that she needed to serve the bond between them if the others were going to have any chance at defeating the redhead's shadow who was no doubt growing stronger in power by the passing second. The more destruction Rise unwillingly caused the more power she was literally feeding into her shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of that Naoto knew that the moment she actually met up with gigantic pop idol she needed to stop her then and there. She continued forward tremendous footstep after tremendous footstep hoping that Rise's hunger would at least allow her to break and stay put in one position long enough for her to get there. After all her mobility was rather hindered at the moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, even though it was tough to make out due to so much of herself around her partially submerged face, Naoto laid eyes on a figure out in the horizon that struck out like a sore thumb. It was Rise! Finally she had caught up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared that just as she had hoped Rise was indeed taking a moment to indulge herself on some of the open empty countryside, while Japan wasn't the biggest nation in the world at least the two enormous giantess had found themselves away from civilization for the moment. Without having to worry about any possible casualties this potentially the best spot to stop Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully approaching Naoto paused for a moment as she noticed a quick pause in the redhead's endless eating, perhaps she had been surprised as to why the ground around her was moving even though she was stationary, with one last gulp Rise turned over in the opposite direction, her folds of flab flowing in the wind as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at the equally enormous blue-haired girl for a moment before squealing out loud in surprise and happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-kun! Wow...you're huge!\" she said in her usual gleeful tone. Naoto however considered that the understatement of the century. Was Rise truly so unaware of what she was doing or what she had become due to her shadow's control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She isn't in control of her sense of reality you must snap her out of the daze set forth by her shadow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto didn't have to be told twice hoping to avoid any sort of conflict she immediately attempted to reason with Rise, explain that she was being used by her shadow as a means of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Naoto-kun? My shadow isn't around anymore we defeated it long ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurses, yet with her resolve still strong Naoto attempted once more to make Rise understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly Naoto-kun, don't you see we have nothing but delicious food around. We're not out in the middle of nowhere...although\" she paused glancing over herself and Naoto's own massiveness, \"it does seem that we've gained a few pounds here and there.\" Rise stated as she happily slapped her dome of a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now why don't you calm down and join me in the feast. Please.\" the redhead pleaded shooting the most adorable puppy-like face she could at Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit Naoto stood her ground determined to not give into the shadow's wily ways, it was obvious that the dark being was influencing the redhead's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Rise-chan, but this is no wonderland this is reality our reality and you must break free from the hold placed upon by your other self. Do you not understand that she is simply using you, if you devour Japan she will become tremendously powerful! If you feast on the entire planet she will be unstoppable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side the pop idol's shadow was becoming increasing aggravated with the detective blob's continuous attempts at tearing Rise away from her and it showed as Rise's own jolly mood began to turn sour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-kun, seriously the joke's not funny anymore. Look I like and respect you but humor isn't your thing and you should just stop right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it, Naoto-kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective instinctively paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stop it and let me be happy, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she could spot the tears in the redhead's eyes she refused to break on her stance, it was for the better and Rise if she was of sound mind would completely understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can't do that. I simply want to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you just can't leave well enough alone can you, Naoto-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat voice Naoto instantly recognized it as the vocal tone of Rise's shadow. She was speaking through Rise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release her!\" argued the blue-haired behemoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think not instead you're going to become our newest play thing after Rise puts you in your proper place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time she had hoped she could've avoided this but it seem that there was no choice in the matter she'd have to fight off and win against one of her closest friends.</span></div></div>",

All she had gotten was the message that everyone was cool with fattening themselves up but why, was it because she had put on some pudge, were they doing it to make her feel better, or just simply just because?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t have an answer much less who was the mastermind behind that same idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo once again she figured now was as best a time as any to ask away and receive the answers she was still seeking.</span></div></div>",

She recently got a job at the Junes food court, where we met with her. She introduced herself as a friend of Sempai's, said he joined the Drama club too which he confirmed, and overheard us talking about your situation.\" Continued Naoto from her explination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaand WHY were you talking about me putting on some weight?\" Rise asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...miiiiight have brought it up.\" Chie chuckled sheepishly and shrinking once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, she told us it would be a good idea for us, your friends to gain weight so you wouldn't feel bad about yourself if you saw it as a bad thing.\" Yukiko added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise chuckled. \"Girls...you're all such good friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was TRYING to gain weight for the past couple days, and you should have said something sooner!

A 250 pound girl with chubby cheeks, a double chin, a gut forcing her shirt to ride up, a cup size larger pair of breasts and chicken legs became nice plump legs. \"Yumi-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my name. It's a pleasure to meet and talk to you in person Rise-chan, when I was in drama club you were one of my inspirations.\" The girl gave a pure smile, Rise could tell Yumi was happy, even despite the apparent gain she put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five sat down with an after school meal, a large once taking up the entire table with steaks, burgers, hot dogs and fries, onion rings, chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks as sides. They started their discussion as they were eating. \"So Yumi chan why did you recommend the girls gained with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as someone who wanted to be an actor I knew being in shape meant a lot, and looking good did too, I suggested it mostly to Yuki and Naoto-kun because Yuki is rather popular around school, and Naoto won that contest during the cultural festival. So I thought if some of the more popular girls in school gained together it wouldn't be such a bad thing.\" Yumi said finishing a hot dog with fries in the bun like nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agreed to it because Yukiko said I could eat more meat, and well, I couldn't say no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation continued until Rise asked Yumi if she would join their group. \"OF COURSE! I'd love to have a group to hang out with. To be honest I started gaining out of boredom from being alone, and by the time I reached 150 pounds I began to love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're all in agreement? Our Girl Gainer Group is a Go?\" Chie said thinking her alliteration was great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll sit on the name for now Chie-sempai, but yes.

It really is taking him a while to get here.\" Hearing her impatient groan Yu decided his break was over and he continued his trek upwards, as he now was heading up the wrinkles between her toes, but thanks to having stopped only at three inches that climb wouldn't take too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat came next is what would be troublesome, and almost completely 90\u00b0 climb upwards from Rise's ankle towards her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ascent was relatively easy as he was able to make it midway up his giant friend's shins with ease, he had realized Rise has shaved her legs recently but luckily for him at his size he could still grab onto the peach fuzz left behind that would've been almost impossible to notice at normal size, and proceeded well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough once he reached the second half of his climb Rise was starting to get physically and noticeably impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He- he isn't standing me up is he? No, he's coming, just a little longer!

Rise flattered argue she was the host not an entry and was told it would be a real ratings-grabber not to mention the audience would love it. So with a shrug she agreed and disappeared behind the curtain. Rise then returning dressed in her usual yellow swimsuit <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay looks like your host Risette is getting in on the action. However I must remind the judges that I am not part of the competition so as surprising as this may sound don't go crowning me the winner, okay. I'm just here to kick things into high gear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheering as Rise showed off her seemingly flawless body in the tight curve-showcasing swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the ones in charge chimed in over her headset once again. This time asking the idol if she could do a few poses here and there. Rise was a little confused she thought she was until it was pointed that they wanted her to flex her muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rather odd request but it was dream and logic often went out the door so Rise really didn't question it. Not even stopping to think over the fact that she really didn't have any noticeable muscles to flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut whatever as it was said in the business, the show must go on! So Rise did as told attempting some rather simple poses by flexing. Meanwhile her necklace continued to shine Rise in such deep slumber didn't even begin to feel the changes starting to occur to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I even doing this right?\" The idol wondered as she posed away unsure if she wasn't making a fool out of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd however seem to ease her mind as they cheered her on, some even commenting on how solid her muscles were. Rise a little surprised took notice of her now slightly bigger biceps and thighs not to mention the outline of a small pack of abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was looking good, she was looking fit, and again she didn't question things instead just rolling with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want more? Because I can totally go for more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered in response and Rise was happy to oblige, already in the process of striking her next pose.</span></div></div>",

While doing so, she did notice that her muscles and curves were slowly becoming more and more defined and pronounced, but she wasn't too keen on diving into it and went with the flow, especially considering that most people don't think too much about strange things like that in dreams. Fortunately, Rise was not the type to shy away from her appearance unlike a certain someone she knew. In fact, she enjoyed her current scenario, the audience cheering out for her as her body kept on getting stronger! Not to mention her body felt amazing (courtesy of the necklace making the whole process pleasurable and as painless as possible as she kept growing)! Back in the real world, the necklace was also using it's power on the real Rise, her underwear growing tighter as her body kept strengthening and enhancing itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as unfortunate as it was, she remembered that she was only hosting and was only on stage to \"hype up\" the competition, which by now was probably already past the point of being sufficiently \"hyped\". With that in mind, she figured that she should stop hogging the spotlight and return to her hosting duties, although she kinda wished she was a participant so she would have been able to compete on stage. Finishing her last pose, the once-slim idol now had a amateur athlete's build, complete with a newly developed six-pack and noticeable biceps. Her bust had gone up a couple cup sizes as well, which was a plus for the idol. However, while she wasn't skinny anymore, all her muscle was lean, so she still didn't take up that much space, just like her normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, everyone, time to start the swimsuit event!

So cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise took a few moments to marvel at her new size until it hit on how odd it was to wake up much stronger then she fell asleep.

All she could confirm was that this was not the same reality as the one she lived in yesterday. However, understanding that, Rise felt like she needed to first get a sense of this reality worked so that she might find a way to return to her reality. In order to do that, the idol figured that she needed to act like she was the true Rise who lived here and get info about her in this world. Man, seems like being near Naoto-sempai has it's benefits!, she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great! Glad that you've gotten used to it. Unfortunately, my free time ends now so I gotta end back to work, but maybe we can get everyone together soon and do something while you're free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... yeah! That sounds great!

The one common ground was that once again she in a competition of sorts. The night before she was put in the position of host to a idol competition this time she was host to one of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bodybuilding\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was looking over the notes and photos of the competitors and some of these girls were jacked. They weren't absurdly huge but still had a solid mixture of strength and curves. Oddly they all looked as if they could still pass off as idols, strong powerful ones but still idols nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBodybuilder-idols, that was a new one on her. Yet being in a dream Rise didn't question it instead rolling with things seeing as it was almost time for the presentation to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce given the cue Rise didn't waste any time welcoming everyone to the show not to mention hyping up the girls that would be competing against one another. After introducing the judge panel Rise spoke for a little while longer before exiting the curtain to the backstage area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackstage as she watched a monitor broadcast Rise couldn't shake the feeling that there was something else she should be doing but she was absorbed into her dream the idol found it hard to remember what it was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she told over her headset that much like in her previous dream Rise was requested on stage. Apparently management wanted her to do a bit of weight lifting herself to set the mood for what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise admittedly wasn't sure how much she could actually do but she was willing to give it her all since she was the host after all.</span></div></div>",

Still not sure why the host would be given a job such as this but eager to get the crowd ready, the idol spoke out to the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK folks, the competitors are getting ready as we speak, so while we're awaiting their debut, it's time for the pre-show starting Risette!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered as Rise grabbed some light weights to start it off easy. Surprisingly, it seemed like was too easy of a start as after a couple of reps, she couldn't feel them anymore. Quickly, she switched to heavier ones as she soon found those to be too light for her soon after. As the cycle keep continuing, Rise sometimes wondered if she was doing it right, only to be reassured and reinvigorated by the cheering onlookers. Not only that, but as she kept lifting, her body was growing accordingly. Her lithe fitness form was starting to gain more mass as the necklace keep feeding the idol power while her dream self was lifting. Rep after rep, Rise could feel the pleasure the necklace gave her, the cheer of the crowd only serving to amplify the effect. After Rise finished lifting the heaviest weight available to her and set it down, she gave a nice double bicep flex, showing off her amazing gains to the crowd, and amazing it was! In the short amount of time she had been up there, Rise had gone from looking like a toned athlete to a full - blown bodybuilder herself! The only difference being that instead of losing her curves like many do once their body reaches the same level of strength, hers was only enhanced! Her breasts had now become 2x as big as Naoto's own pair, and even her rear had gotten rounder, showing off her bikini bottom quite nicely. After finishing her flex, the idol had become aware of how much bigger she had gotten, taking a moment to feel how firm and strong she was before realizing that she should focus on being the host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure that the competitors were ready by now, the idol was about to announce them on stage when she looked into the crowd. Sure, they looked excited, but not as excited as they could have been for this moment. As an idol, Rise always gave her all in a performance to make sure her fans were happy and Rise felt like she could definitely put more effort into hyping the crowd. Rise knew that she was allowed to get objects on stage, so part of her thought that she should really end the pre-show with a bang by lifting something huge! However, the other part of her thought that she should end it now and get the real show going. Rise wasn't sure which way she should choose though. Wait a minute, she thought, why don't I get the audience's answer? Adjusting the headset on her head, the idol spoke into the mic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, everybody! I hope you've enjoyed yourselves thus far. I'm sure our competitors are waiting to debut themselves! However, I feel as though I shouldn't leave before getting you as hyped as possible, so I will ask you all! Should the competitors be brought out now, or would you want your host to give this pre-show a GRAND ending?\"</span></div></div>",

She was starting to wish those weights hadn't been so easy to begin and maybe she had gotten in over her head with this new challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could still hear the crowd firmly in her corner cheering her on. Trying to use as motivation Rise put even more effort into lifting the compact car. Her biceps and thighs bugling to nearly a foot in width, her back spreading out like a set of wings, while her ab count soared higher, her breasts and butt soon joining in as well not wanting to be lift behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I CAN do this!\" Rise roared her face flushed to match her hair as her body had grown to the point where she had finally found the strength to lift the vehicle and fully press it over her head and growing traps!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience cheering uncontrollably as the idol felt her new \"weight\" in place it was starting to become lighter but Rise knew it was best not to fool around even if a part of her in the inside was freaking out over her lifting a damn car!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...is...nothing to...Risette!\" She yelled trying to get into the moment and without much thought despite her body language saying otherwise. Still she wanted to go big as a closure and this was just about as big as it could get...or so she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the idol was caught off guard as the car practically morphed into something new entirely, something far heavier...far far heavier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a freaking tank?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer enormous body completely covered in the military vehicle's shadow as Rise for a moment panicked at the realization of what was now her next challenge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooph! How am I suppose to lift a tank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd gasping as they caught sight of the twisted pained expression on the idol's still untouched face, her muscles bulging further yet Rise feared it wasn't going to be enough her body was going to give up the fight to this beast of a machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stage floor beneath her splintering as some of the audience attempted to cheer on doing what they could to still support her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's impossible...it's too much...\" Rise muttered face full of pain as her muscles were straining doing what they could to keep her from being crushed to dust by of all things, a tank.</span></div></div>",

The idol resumed speaking again, her body shaking a bit as she kept the power at bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just not fair that you don't have enough room to show yourself in your entirety, Contestant Chie. Isn't that right, folks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience yelled out, agreeing with the host's words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I think we need this building to go, to be honest. Now sure, you could do it easily yourself, seeing as how big you are, but I believe that as host, I should be the one doing this type of work, don't you agree, audience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the audience roared in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. Now before this happens, I'm gonna need the crowd and the other competitors besides Miss Satonaka to retreat to a safer distance outside the building. If you could please start now, it would help get the show going once more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone complied with the host's commands, her watching as everyone left the building besides her and Chie, her bodies big enough to withstand what would soon be the crumbled remains of the building. As they filed out, Rise was having trouble keeping her body in check. Try as she might, while the idol could contain most of the power inside her body, some kept leaking and slowly making her body bigger and bigger. Even while she was speaking, her height was growing inch by inch, her shoulders becoming slightly more broader, her breasts and butt becoming rounder and fuller, more space being enveloped by her already colossal form. Besides that, power still kept welling up inside her body, ready to burst and Rise wanted to let it out quite badly. Still, she had to endure the temptation until everyone had safely exited. After 5 more minutes of waiting, Rise couldn't hold it any longer. \"Time to see who's really the biggest there is.\" The idol muttered quietly as she welcomed the necklace's power buildup into her body.</span></div></div>",

Her biceps went from car-sized to tank-sized in a matter of seconds. Her field of view was starting to get smaller as her colossal breasts kept growing, pushing against the unrelenting top as more and more of her cleavage spilled out of the expanding swimsuit.  The Rise moaned quietly as more and more mass kept piling atop her ever-expanding frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger...\" Rise thought to herself as her body continued to fill up the room. While the growth this time around did hurt a bit as it was the fastest growth she had experienced thus far, the pleasure she gained from it was more than enough to endure it. Within a few moments however, the idol's height had made her hit the ceiling, her body already causing pieces of it to fall down. Getting an idea, the growing idol asked the still bigger Chie to move back a bit as she would make an opening for the contestant to showcase her full size. Moving towards the center of the room, Rise gathered herself as best as she could and performed a crab flex, flexing all her muscles to their limit as a surplus of power flooded into her in response. to her flex. The audience from the outside of the building saw it as if a bomb went off inside. Most of the building's structure had collapsed as the idol grew through it, her titanic body at least twice as big as before she started the flex. Bits of debris rained down upon Rise and bounced harmlessly off of her as the audience applauded and cheered at the spectacle they had just witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rise felt like she was on top of the world (which at her size was not that much of a joke), not only was she still feeling the pleasant after-effects of the growth, but that flex had left her feeling empowered. \"Too bad the growth stopped,\" she thought to herself, \"although I wonder how I measure up to Chie now?\" To answer her question, Rise felt a small quake at her feet as the Chariot attempted to stand, having been on her back until now. As Chie finally got to her full size, Rise compared their sizes. She couldn't believe it! While Rise had big breasts whereas Chie had her big pecs, they were identical in size and muscle mass otherwise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for clearing up space for me, Rise!\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no problem! I take it upon myself as host to help the contestants!\" Rise said, a hint of disappointment in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honestly, Rise had planned to surpass her friend and show  everyone who was truly the biggest around, but her growth had stopped short of doing so, leaving them the same. While Rise was a bit sad about that, at the very least the size cap had been filled. Until Rise felt something inside her again. \"Another growth?\" she happily thought to herself. However, Rise knew it was going to be different. The power she felt coming felt WAY bigger than what she just experienced, almost as if her earlier growth was a warm-up. \"Oh, this is gonna be huge! Get ready for a show, everyone!\" Rise thought before the necklace's true power overwhelmed her body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The idol biting down softly on her bottom lip as her chest along with other part of her grew higher and wider!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny in portion to the rest of her Rise's feet were now far too large and wide for streets of Inaba, again if she were back home, with even the smallest of her toes many times larger then your average individual. Just above her calves were now wider then Yasogami High doubled over, her gigantic thighs were suburbs in size while her plumped yet iron-hard backside could without question bury a quarter of Inaba! The thought was rather amusing to idol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer upper body not to be outdone was just as equally monstrous if not more so. Rise's abs now thick armor rather then mere flesh, each so powerful she wondered if her mid-section was as indestructible as the rest of her appeared to be. Her pectorals had shaped up nicely budging out proportionally yet it was her breasts that had continued to take a stellar hit, each easily rivaling Junes in size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her sides the idol's arms rippled with power, even without so much as a flex each rose high into the clear sky far above her head, while her monolithic back had grown further to the point where she was more mountain then human, Rise chuckling at the mental image of literally carrying all of Inaba on her back with room to spare, she was that far and wide in muscular girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly her height was nothing short of stunning as well her full size reaching high into the sky above. Chie nothing but a foot note by comparison and not to mention once again if she were at home Rise would have already eclipsed the town.

Rise flexed her back, letting Teddie see the idol's back surged with new rippling muscles.

Just moments ago, she had put on a gift that her friend Teddie had found of her, one that had caused her to grow into this musclebound hulk. Now, she had her face in her huge breasts as her legs and right arm continued to grow much faster than the rest of her. She didn't want this to happen right now, not here where there was numerous things that were around her that she could destroy unintentionally with her ever-expanding bulk. She wanted to stop herself from growing larger but at the same time, a small piece of her wanted it to continue, for her to grow even faster than she already was. That aside, Rise needed to try and minimize the damage her growing frame was causing. She needed to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her left arm which was still more proportional to her torso, Rise pushed herself out of her expanding cleavage and managed to get herself to a kneeling position. Unfortunately, that was all she could currently do in her current state since her torso couldn't hold up her boobs and right arm by itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crud! I still need to stand up so I can get a better view of my surroundings!\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, another wave of growth washed over her as her torso and shoulders began to broaden and expand, her abs shifting from a 6-pack to 8-pack as her shoulders kept getting wider, surpassing the length of a swimming pool in seconds.Once the pace of her growth started to slow down a bit and match the rest of her body, Rise found that she could hold the weight of her body and began standing up. At her full height, Rise could see (although it was quite hard given that her humongous cleavage was in her way) that she was more than 2x the height of the store her arms had smashed into earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rise could even react to her new developments, she looked at her left arm, quite smaller compared to her right, began to grow at a faster pace, much like how her torso and shoulders had done so previously. Like before, her left arm kept growing at the increased pace until it matched her right arm before slowing down and matching the  pace of the growth that her entire body was experiencing. While somewhat happy that she now had some sort of semblance to a human physique rather than a freak of nature with disproportional limbs, her body still was not stopping it's growth. With every breath she took, she could feel her muscles expanding as her heart continued to pump more blood into her frame. While quite painful, it also give her much pleasure which she couldn't understand. The same part of her that wished to grow also wished to revel in this power and flex it. Rise wasn't sure how much of this she could honestly take.</span></div></div>",

Her still untouched face burning a shade equal to her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over, or at least for now it was over was what the idol thought as her head rested on the iron pillow that was her gigantic traps. Not that she minded nor cared at the moment all that mattered was that she wasn't growing any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could vaguely feel her arms resting at her sides even in their relaxed state they pulsed with power so much so that when a hand of hers went to rest at top of a nearby building she began to bust it apart from the accidental pressure applied on the poor structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis minor feat of strength was enough to snap the idol's attention back to reality immediately stopping herself from unintentionally destroying more property around her. In doing so and mostly because she wasn't used to her tremendous new bulk the idol nearly fell onto wider stronger backside!

She blushed at how firm, full, and powerful her chest had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least there's one positive to consider.\"  Rise slightly chuckled trying to find humor in anything that could ease the ordeal of having grown into a muscular giantess. The idea of stuffing all of her friends into her sea of cleavage amused her further but only for a moment as she knew that she had to do something about her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould she find Teddie even at her size without destroying everything in her way or would her friends spot her by just looking out the window as Rise realized that there was no way she'd keep from drawing attention to herself with how gigantic she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they even make idol costumes this big?\" Rise wondered with a nervous chuckle, amusing herself one last time.</span></div></div>",

Silly me I forgot you were still here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind me, Rise-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave you a kiss earlier but don't push it.\" Rise stated with a glare effectively cooling down the blonde's emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway glad you like the gift, Rise-chan, although I'm not sure what made you grow so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear wasn't the brightest tool in the shed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do..thank you.\" Rise said with a smile as she eyed the jewelry around her now thicker neck.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After dealing with the extremely excited Teddie, Rise arranged for her other three female friends to meet her at Shichiri Beach, telling them she had something special to show them. Chie and her best friend Yukiko brought along their swimsuits but Naoto, being too embarrassed to show off her amazingly busty as well as curvy body, didn't bring one along. They each arrived at the beach on their scooters and looked around the beach for the idol's bright red hair or her scooter but they didn't see either. All they saw was many massive weights that weren't there the last time the girls were at the beach. Naoto's sharp eye, however, saw past the weights and focused on something her eyes caught in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kujikawa-san is swimming in the ocean,\" Naoto pointed out while positioning her cap so the sunlight didn't get in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Chie and Yukiko, having already put on their swimsuits, looked in the direction the detective pointed. In the distance, they saw the bright red hair their idol friend was known for having. Something about the body where the red hair came from, however, didn't seem right to the three young women. Of the four, Rise was the model so her body had to be in the best shape it can possibly be while remaining curvy and thin. The body the three young women saw in the ocean had arms as big as those male bodybuilders in America, who took steroids and kept a very strict diet to get arms that massive. The mass of muscle soon reached the beach and all three girls gasped when Rise, in a very tiny orange bikini, stood up and walked out of the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, their idol friend had obtained the body of a muscular goddess! They watched in awe, Chie's jaw dropped, as Rise raised her huge muscular arms and ran her hands through her wet hair, which was no longer in pigtails and had been simply let down. Water streamed down the bulging muscles of the idol's new body, traveling along the sparkling necklace around her thick neck, down her amazingly perky watermelon-sized breasts, and then to her dense eight-pack abs. Her huge thighs and calves were like strong pillars, easily many times larger than Chie's own muscular legs. Rise had also grown so tall that she towered over the other three young women, being about 6'4 in height. Despite her muscles, height, and breasts, the idol still had a perfect hourglass figure, her waist remaining almost the same size as it was before she grew. Her muscles, breasts, let-down hair, and hourglass figure left the idol's three friends with expressions shocked by the overwhelming beauty in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-chan! Is that you!?\" Yukiko gasped with her hands over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie rubbed her eyes. \"I can't believe it,\" she said opening her eyes to see the massive Rise Kujikawa again. She looked to the shocked Yukiko and Naoto at her side. \"You guys are seeing this too, right? I'm not the only one who sees our friend with huge muscles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see it, Satonaka-san,\" Naoto said not taking her eyes off her friend. She tried her best to remain calm despite the overwhelming beauty of the muscular goddess her friend had become. \"Kujikawa-san has muscles bigger than most males while keeping her female figure. It is a very surprising sight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rise smiled when she saw the shocked expressions on her friend's face and flexed her biceps to surprise them even more. They gasped once again when Rise's arms swelled to almost twice their size. Her veins popped out of her biceps and forearms, pulsating while the idol flexed her arms even harder. She then swung her arms behind her back and puffed out her chest, showing off her giant breasts along with her bulging lats, eight-pack abs, and arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you guys like the new Rise Kujikawa?\" Rise said grinning while spun around, flexing her impressive back muscles and making the three young women gasp again. Spinning back around, Rise lifted one arm and flexed her bicep as she continued. \"You can touch them if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Yukiko and Chie ran over to their friend and immediately placed their hands on her impressive muscles. Chie rubbed her hands against Rise's bicep, feeling the densely packed muscles as well as her pulsating veins. Yukiko, meanwhile, leaned down and felt up the idol's diamond-hard abs, making sure she didn't accidentally touch her friend's massive breasts while she felt the deep lines between Rise's abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen both of the girl's had their hands on Rise's biceps, the idol smiled and flexed her arms, making the two girl let out a tiny cry when the idol's biceps suddenly swelled to almost twice their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Rise-chan,\" Yukiko said taking a closer look at her friend's biceps, both of which were far larger than her own head. She pressed her hand against Rise's bulging bicep and seeing how big the idol's bicep was compared to Yukiko's own hand. \"Your bicep feels as hard as steel. How much can you lift now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise grinned when she heard Yukiko's question. In response, the idol grabbed both Chie and Yukiko and lifted the best friends easily above her own head. The two best friends let out an excited scream as Rise continued to lift them both with no effort at all, later on using only one hand to lift the two young women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't mind me interrupting, Kujikawa-san,\" Naoto said, blushing bright red at the sight of Chie and Yukiko enjoying being lifted by the huge Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise gave Naoto a devious smile. \"I don't mind, Naoto-kun,\" she said placing both of her friends back on the sand. Rise lifted one of her huge arms to point at Naoto's clothes. \"But we're at a beach. Shouldn't you be wearing a swimsuit like us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto blushed even redder. \"N-never mind my clothes!\" she quickly replied. \"I want to know what happened to you, Kujikawa-san. Why are you so big now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise continued to smile as she lifted the sparkling necklace around her thick muscular neck. \"Teddie found this necklace in the TV world and gave it to me as a present. When I put it on, my muscles suddenly grew this big,\" she explained while doing a double bicep pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! You just put this necklace and got muscles bigger than any guy's!?\" Chie said pointing at the necklace around Rise muscular neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Rise answered. \"I just put on the necklace and then boom! Super massive muscles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise flexed every one of her muscles again, causing Chie to reply quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I put it on?\" Chie asked.</span></div></div>",

She didn't know what would happen if she removed it, seeing as how her sudden muscle growth only happened when she put on the necklace. The idol wanted to keep her new muscles and strength but then again... Chie is her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you can wear it,\" Rise sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was practically jumping up and down like a little kid while Rise lifted the necklace off her thick muscular neck. To her surprise, however, Rise's muscles didn't suddenly disappear. In fact, nothing happened to the idol's new strength or muscles. She remained being the same muscular goddess she was before. Knowing that she could keep her muscles made the idol smile while she watched her blonde friend throw the necklace over her head and onto her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long is this going to take?\" Chie said feeling the necklace drop down to rest between her tiny cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise lifted her massive arm to scratch her head. \"I don't know,\" she told her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it takes a while to start working, Chie,\" Yukiko said taking a closer look at the necklace hanging around her friend's neck. \"You can't expect to suddenly-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko was interrupted when her best friend's breasts suddenly inflated, going from an A-cup straight to P-cup breasts. Yukiko, having had faceful of Chie's new breasts, fell on her bottom while her best friend started to grow right in front of the girl's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's starting!\" Chie yelled excited, feeling every muscle of her body stretch and bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie wrapped her arms around her massive breasts and started to moan suggestively as pleasure radiated throughout every inch of her growing body. Rise, Yukiko, and Naoto each watched intently as Chie's legs begun to thicken with even more muscle. Chie already had muscular legs before but now, her thighs were becoming pillars of pure muscle with her calves being almost as impressive. Chie's swimsuit shrunk as the blonde's legs grew thicker and thicker while her upper body started to catch up. Chie squeezed her giant breasts even tighter together as her arms inflated to the same bowling-ball size arms that Rise had. After growing arms as impressive as Rise's, Chie then flexed them, making her biceps and forearms bulge even bigger, while her back rippled with powerful muscle. Her neck thickened while her faint six-pack abs quickly turned into a visible as well as extremely dense eight pack abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the growth stopped, leaving Chie with almost the same muscular goddess-like body as her friend Rise's. In fact, compared to Rise, Chie was a tiny bit bigger than the idol. She stood two inches taller while her muscles were only an inch wider. Nobody but the sharp-eyed Naoto could see the difference between the two muscle goddesses on the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me! I'm so ripped!\" Chie yelled flexing her muscles and watching how much her muscles bulged and veins popped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look amazing, Chie!\" Yukiko said getting to her feet and feeling her best friend's massive biceps. \"Wow, I wonder how strong you are now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie looked down at her best friend and a thought popped into her head. Meanwhile, Rise took a look at the lonely Naoto, still wearing her normal clothes despite being at the beach. Almost the same thought Chie had popped into the idol's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two muscular goddesses looked at each other and the first one to speak was...</span></div></div>",

Chie simply shrugged an understanding smile on her lips as she handed over the jewelry piece, after all she had a similar thought of Yukiko...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it, Rise-chan.\" Chie added, encouraging her redheaded friend. Rise thanked her as she made her over toward the direction of the detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was eclipsed in the shadow of her much larger and stronger friend Naoto stared upward at the bulked up idol who had the necklace wrapped around her fingers.

What was it about the idol that could make her drop her serious professional outlook and showcase a nature more closer to her age. It was one of the things that Naoto didn't have an answer to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you'll look really good with the added muscle. Like really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto coughed momentarily as she looked away from the towering redhead a part of her not wanting to know what Rise was envisioning in her head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she felt the necklace wrapped around her neck! Rise had gone ahead and placed on her without her consent. Then again she already knew that the muscular idol wasn't going to take no for an answer. So in the end she should have expected something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like with her friends Naoto could already feel whatever power the necklace had begin to take hold of her and just like them she was soon going to change to a much more muscular version of herself...</span></div></div>",

The bandages wrapped around her breasts tore one by one, her well-endowed chest swelling like balloons underneath her jacket. She wrapped her arms around her growing breasts, trying to stop them from growing any bigger and ruining her shirt and jacket. Naoto, however, saw that the muscles of her arms were big enough to make her sleeves strained to keep the muscles concealed. The sound of fabric ripping made the young woman look at her legs, seeing her thick thighs bursting out of her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Naoto, you're sure growing up fast\" the muscular goddess Rise chuckled wrapping her huge arms around her growing friend. She smiled as she felt Naoto's muscles and breasts grow in between her embrace. She made her friend even more embarrassed as she pressed her own gigantic breasts against Naoto's back, which was rippling with powerful muscles and still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop, Kujikawa-san!\" Naoto cried out, watching her breasts and huge arms growing too large for Rise to wrap her equally large arms around. \"I... I feel weird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Naoto-kun,\" Chie said flexing her forty-inch biceps. \"You'll feel great when it's over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my clothes!\" Naoto yelled seeing that she was only wearing scraps of her previous garments. \"I don't want to be naked looking like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise chuckled as she felt up the detective's muscles, which were slowly stopping their growth. A minute of groping and feeling her friend's muscles, Rise spoke again once the detective stopped growing, having gained the same muscle mass as her other two friends but with a much larger bust. \"I brought a school swimsuit for you but I didn't expect you'd grow as big as me. It's going to be a little tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care!\" Naoto yelled trying to cover her naked, gigantic, and muscular body from any eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise grinned at the thought of Naoto wearing a school swimsuit many sizes too small for her muscles and bust. Excitedly, the muscular idol goddess took out the school swimsuit she brought for her friend before she grew muscles as big as her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, now that Naoto is huge too,\" Chie said. \"How about Yukiko joins us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko jumped in surprise as her best friend. \"Wait! I don't know if I want to be that muscular!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Yukiko! We can have a lot of fun if you're just big as us,\" Chie said while she removed the necklace off Naoto's neck while the detective left with a excited Rise to the changing room, despite both girls being much bigger than the doors of the small building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko thought about the increasing possibility of her growing just as big as her friends. She gained a little weight recently but if she grew muscles, her weight would double or even triple. Yukiko didn't want to grow muscles but one look at her best friend's face and at Chie's pulsating muscles made the young woman change her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me the necklace,\" Yukiko said determined to get the growing over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was practically jumping with excitement as she handed her best friend the necklace and watched her throw it over her head.

Her legs followed afterwards, growing to the same size as Chie's legs used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie...\" Yukiko whispered. \"I feel...\"</span></div></div>",

Thinking it over a moment Rise agreed and placed the wondrous piece of jewelry away in a box she had brought for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it went that the muscular idol and her now equally muscular friends enjoyed their time in the sand. Pairing up for a few games of volleyball, the idol and detective against the tomboy and her BFF, before soaking it up in the cool ocean waves, Chie and Yukiko splashing one another in humorous fashion while Rise attempted to sneak up Naoto to yet again cup a feel of the detective's now larger chest! The detective as always dropping her usual cool serious demeanor to a more embarrassed one the moment she felt the idol's fingertips come into contact with her bigger breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later Rise and Chie got into a pose-down. The blonde wanting to show off her strength with Rise being the only one to take up her offer in showing off along side her. Yukiko certainly wasn't one to show her physique and there was no way in hell Naoto would volunteer so it was down to Rise who had no problem showcasing her mighty muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two flexed away, Chie being more natural at it then Rise, Yukiko pipped in complimenting both of their bodies while Naoto silently admitted there was a certain appeal to the vastness the girls had achieved even if the detective personally felt they had grown a bit too large for her tastes but in the end the blue-haired girl smiled nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime would pass some more and while Chie and Yukiko took another dip in the ocean Naoto relaxed at top the soft sand her familiar hat tipped over her eyes as the peaceful sounds of the beach helped put her to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Rise had taken notice of the detective and smiled softly. In truth Naoto was unique to Rise in more then one way. There was just about her that had instantly caught Rise's attention, Naoto wasn't like Chie, Yukiko, or any other girl she had come across she was different but a good kind of different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol found herself blushing at the thought that perhaps she did in fact harbor something of a crush on Naoto, a feeling that Chie had casually made mention of back when Rise first wanted to make Naoto grow larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with necklace now in hand Rise made her way over to the slumbering detective, Naoto would never willingly agree to grow herself any larger and the thought of seeing the girl grow bigger stronger muscles almost made the idol shiver in glee. She had to make it happen even if she had to spend the rest of the day apologizing and making it up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPositioning herself properly the idol was practically right above the detective's sleeping form. The soft breathing, relaxing state of her muscles, and heaving breasts made Rise blush hard nearly causing her to forget what she was aiming to do.</span></div></div>",

Once again, Rise crept up to her friend and slowly took the necklace from around her neck, letting her sleep in peace. Afterwards, Rise went back to her spot with the necklace in hand. Just why wasn't it working now, she kept thinking to herself. A couple of theories came in her mind. Maybe it only worked once for people who had never used the necklace before, maybe there was an energy source that the necklace had that ran out after it was last used, maybe... After thinking it over, Rise thought about putting on the necklace again. Sure, it may not work on her like like how it didn't work on Naoto, but Rise had a feeling that maybe since she was the first one to put it on, it may have a better reaction to her than the others. If so, then maybe she had more control over the necklace and could make it work on others once again. With a new goal set in mind, Rise set the jewelry around her neck. After all, she could still tinker with it even if it didn't work on her.</span></div></div>",

Both friends were frozen for about two seconds as both of their faces kept turning brighter shades of red over what had just transpired. All the drowsiness that Naoto had before had already vanished over the event that had just transpired.

The sinkhole itself was just deep enough to cover the two amazons lying inside of it from the outside, which was slightly reassuring to the detective. However, considering that both of them were bigger than a two story house individually, the sinkhole was quite noticeable and if someone where to peek inside the hole, they would easily see the two behemoths. Luckily, nobody was around Shichiri Beach when the four girls came here, but Chie and Yukiko wold eventually come back from the ocean and notice the hole and who knew who else would come to the beach today?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the detective got up, she noticed that her vast cleavage, each breast easily double the size of a family SUV, was starting to obscure her vision, finding it hard to see anything below her. The detective used one of her bulging arms to try to push down her massive mammaries, only to be met with a huge shockwave of pleasure once she pressed them down. Immediately letting go, the detective had to bite her lip to keep her from moaning. Seems as though while her mind was returning to normal, her body's increased sensitivity, especially on her huge assets, was taking it's sweet time. No doubt this was the same for the idol as whenever she shifted in her sleep in a way that caused her own enhanced \"goods\" to move, she gave out a slight moan. Taking a seat to recover, the detective felt another wave of pleasure wash over her, although much more milder this time, as her butt touched the ground. After taking a second to calm herself, the detective thought to herself. I need to take off the necklace before anything else happens! Moving her hands towards her neck, the detective attempted to grasp her end of the accursed jewelry only to grab air instead. Surprised, Naoto looked down towards her chest to confirm that, indeed, the necklace wasn't attached to her anymore! While feeling slight relief of being free from it's charms, the detective quickly regained focus as she looked around her surroundings, trying to find out where the necklace was!</span></div></div>",

Resting upon the sleeping Rise's neck, the necklace had somehow managed to slip off the detective's and return to it's first wearer. When did that happen? Naoto thought to herself. Then again, her memory of herself when the necklace's influence was kind of hazy, although Naoto remembered all the embarrassing things she did just fine. Her face once again turning red while thinking about what happened between her and Rise, the detective shook the image out of her head as she got on her knees and moved towards the idol's upper body. Once there, Naoto moved her hands slowly towards Rise's neck, trying not to wake the sleeping colossus from her dream. It was better to take it form her while unconscious since Naoto knew that the idol may have thoughts on keeping the necklace and the body that came with it, or even trying to get bigger. While part of the detective saw the allure in keeping a body like this and a smaller, deeper part of her wanted more, she knew that it definitely was not practical and could cause harm, not to mention the attention that they would garner (she was sure Rise would see that as a benefit though). Only a couple more inches, the detective thought as her fingers were closing in on the necklace!</span></div></div>",

The idol gave a loud moan in response as the detective once again felt extremely embarrassed for accidentally groping her friend (although Rise has done that to her numerous times). However, she had to leave those feelings or the time being as she knew the trembling in her body was the necklace's doing, and judging by how strong it was, this growth spurt was gonna be bigger than what her and Rise experienced before. Already warming up in preparation for the big growth, Rise's body was slowly growing once more, adding inches upon inches of muscle and height unto her body, the idol already starting to outshine the detective's own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise! Wake up! Take off the necklace!\" The detective shouted to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels amazing... Bigger...\" the idol softy said, starting to moan a bit as her outrageous body continued to slowly pack on the pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective deduced that the necklace must have keeping the idol asleep, pushing her desires of growing in her subconscious while she was asleep and unguarded mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't rely on Rise right now. I gotta take off the necklace now before she gets too much bigger!\" Naoto thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow kneeling near the idol's midsection due to her pre-growth giving her more height in the short amount of time that it started, the detective got up quickly. Aware of how slow she seemed to move thanks to her bulky legs, Naoto suppressed her own feelings of what she was about to do. Quickly tensing her legs, Naoto leaped towards the sleeping Rise. Landing on the idol's upper body, once again colliding her breasts with the idol's now bigger ones, both girls emitting another moan. Fighting back against the waves of pleasure between the clash of their jugs, Noato thought to herself why she had ended up in this position with her friend so many times today. However, she knew that she had no time to lose and started to move one of her arms from her side, aiming to rip off the necklace from her friend's neck in hopes of stopping it.</span></div></div>",

Maybe it was under the idol's colossal body. If so, then Naoto would just wait until the idol woke up and grab it, it's not like anyone could grab it without needing to move Rise.

I thought you might have got it at the shop or something similar to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want to see the place, I could guide you there or if you want to go alone, I could give you the directions to the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, Rise thought, it would be nice to have a guide to take me there and help me find any clues about the origins of he necklace. On the other hand, maybe it's better if I go alone since I wouldn't want to waste anyone's time if the trip over there doesn't give me any leads.

Unfortunately, there wasn't very much in her closet that could accommodate for her new size. After looking through for something that would fit her, the idol settled on  wearing a large orange tube top and skirt which was just the right size for her, to the idol's pleasure. However, while the outfit fit her, it didn't cover very much of her arms, legs or abs and left a decent amount of cleavage showing, but unlike the detective, Rise didn't mind as long as she was still decent. Rise giggled at the thought of Naoto wearing something like this, knowing how strict the blue - haired girl was with keeping her appearance so professional. With that done, the idol headed over to Junes to get to the TV world. On her way over, she received some attention from the passerbys who though she looked amazing, and Rise couldn't help but smile. It looked like she wasn't the only one who liked her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at Junes, the idol headed towards the TV section of the store, noting that she didn't run into Yosuke at all. That's fine, she thought, so far only Teddie knows how big I am, but I wanna surprise everyone else at once and show them the new me when I get back. After reaching her destination, Rise was easily able to get to the TV world, and following Teddie's directions, she reached the creek where the necklace had supposedly been. I know this is where Teddie's directions lead me to, she thought, but how can I confirm this is the area? Rise started to look around the creek and the path she was following for any indication that this was the place when she found what appeared to be a small hole in the ground, scratched open by what appeared to be claws. This is it!, she thought, this must be where Teddie dug the necklace up from! Armed with the knowledge that this area was indeed where the necklace had been recovered, Rise prepared to search for clues.

The only reason she was doing it was because she thought if she collected all the \"pieces\" and awakened them like the necklace had said, she might be able to get another growth spurt out of it. By the time the necklace had stopped giving directions, Rise was standing in a middle of a small, circular field near the base of the creek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, is this the place, necklace?\" Rise asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative.

After going down a bunch of steps, Rise finally made it to the end of the staircase. From there, Rise saw what looked like a room in an ancient temple. There was moss growing from slits in the floor. On the walls, there were what appeared to be hieroglyphics which Rise could not read. However, the room itself was quite small and very bare, which Rise found a bit strange since she expected a bigger place considering how deep underground it was. the only things in the room being three pillars. Rise came closer to the three pillars and saw that two of them where holding one bracelet each while the third pillar was bare, which a space inside looking as though it could hold Rise's necklace. This must be where the necklace was originally, she thought, but how did the necklace get outside? Deciding to look over the matter later, Rise grabbed the pair of bracelets from the two pillars and held them in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bracelets collected. Rise, please put the bracelets on and awaken them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, sure...\" Rise said, before looking around her, the atmosphere of the room unnerving her, \"but first, I'll go outside. This place creeps me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking the staircase back out to the plain near the creek and watching the staircase seal itself again, Rise went back to the matter at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise, please put the bracelets on and awaken them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's do it, then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise attached the pair of bracelets to each of her hands and waited for instructions from the bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beginning awakening process...\" the bracelet responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rise began to feel her muscles twitch, similar to when she put the necklace on for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to grow again!\" Rise said, a bit of glee evident in her voice.</span></div></div>",

Instead all she had on her mind was the thought of more, more power, more strength, more muscles...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...More!\" Rise allowed a soft moan to exit her lips clearly demanding that the odd items further pump up her still growing form...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back home in Inaba two figures ran through it's streets their destination the Junes mega-store.

Kirijo wanted the possible \"artifacts\" to be found ASAP so had requested the assistance from the Inaba native detective.

Instead she was in fact still growing and not just in muscularity but in height as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back end of her top beginning to rip apart at the seam as her stellar back and shoulder muscles grew larger and wider, her breasts ballooning further the front end of her top already ripped wide open and only by luck was her bra holding on. Rise felt the need to let out another moan as the rest of her body continued to surge in size but instead held in her sensual outcry as she truly began to worry just to what lengths this amazing growth was going to take her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concern starting to rise further as her body began to put on hundreds of pounds of pure muscle a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too much!\" she called out in worry as her still normal-sized head sank into the pit created from her enormous breasts and raising traps. While her arms and legs not to be outdone were already on their way to being measure by feet rather then inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My body...\" the idol was now whimpering as her swelling form grew larger and larger, it outright felt as if she was going to explode right then and there as her body went through one last push until at last she ended off several feet taller then her grandmother's place and nearly just as wide!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now house-sized idol exhausted from her tremendous change her still normal still beautiful face flushed from the heat of her muscles in her body expanding into inhuman portions  She stood there a stunning sight of feminine muscle for short time gathering herself and her thoughts on her new titanic form.</span></div></div>",

I can just shrink myself back to normal, she thought. Then again, Rise also thought of the opposite, making herself grow even bigger. While it was true that she was already quite big, Rise wanted to test how far she could go with the jewelry, since she could change back afterwards.

After all now that she could control her size at will going from idol to goddess was something she should be able to do at anytime so why rush things, at least for now anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't change the fact that the sensation she felt as her muscles shrank back down to a more manageable size wasn't disappointing. All that power and strength fading away, now smaller then the point where her first growth had peaked at Rise quickly decided that she didn't want all of her new muscles to disappear so the idol cut herself off a little earlier then what would have been her original standard size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she wasn't as big as a house she was now more athlete then idol with a noticeable pump all over, her arms and legs notably thicker, her shoulders just a bit boarder, breasts fuller, and the outline of a solid set of abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise smiled as she ran a hand through her bare mid-section. Her muscles weren't blown up to the insane degree they were before but it still felt good to feel as strong as she did now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to enjoy this. But first I need to get home.\" Rise muttered to herself as she set out on her journey back to her grandmother's...when suddenly a thought occurred to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having grown as big as a building the only pieces of clothing that had somehow survived such a drastic change were her bra and panties! Her face flushed red at the realization that she couldn't just walk home in her underwear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot! If only I had something to cover up with before heading home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative, Rise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? Had the jewelry just spoken to her again? What were they/was it going on about now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol soon got her answer as before her very eyes a copy of her previous shattered clothing formed and wrapped around her, fully clothing the young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you can do that?\" she asked honestly surprised at what had just occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct Rise.

The way it works is that I've chosen to protect Inaba so in a way I am Inaba. If something feels off then I'm going to feel it. That surge from earlier there's no way I was ignore it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what it was? Mitsuru-san wasn't exactly sure and Fuuka-san said it may take some time to pin-point, what ever that meant.\" Labrys asked hoping Marie could provide some kind of answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What it was exactly I'm not too sure but I know it's not of this world...dammit if it comes to that I may have to go to <i>them</i> for help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last part didn't escape the detective's keen hearing, who exactly was she talking about that made Marie curse at the idea of possibly heading to for support?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what exactly does someone like Kirijo want with something like that?\" Marie asked suddenly changing the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno. I wasn't told nor was Naoto-kun. My job's just to accompany her and retrieve what Mitsuru-san asked of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLabrys explained in honest fashion only to get a slight scoff from raven-haired cap-wearing girl. Looking over in Naoto's direction the robotic girl wondered if she had said something wrong. The detective reassuring her that she hadn't and that like her Marie was still getting used to being among others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's rather blunt with her words and wears her emotions on her sleeves but if she cares you will know it. So do not let any sort of harsh attitude worry you, Labrys-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLabrys understood with a nod as she flashed a quick smile just before Marie called out to her and Naoto about how she was going to leave them behind if they didn't hurry up! The robo girl was beginning to understand what the detective meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere over in the electronics section out of a random television screen Rise popped her head out in adorable fashion as she scoped the area out for anyone that may be nearby. The coast appeared to be clear, all she had to do was get out, exit the store, and head home. Sounded easy enough, right?</span></div></div>",

She didn't want to leave them lying on the floor of the TV world, so she decided to take them back with her. Once her entire body was out of the TV, Rise started to walk out of the electronics section, leaving just as Labrys, Naoto and Marie walked in the section. Switching over to the TV world, the three girls headed towards the area where the power had recently spiked, taking them to the small field beside the base of the creek. Once there, the girls found no sign of the artifacts, but it was clear that something had happened here based on the small area damage the place had suffered recently. However, during the detective\u2019s inspection for the artifacts or for any clues leading to it, she noticed that Marie\u2019s face showed a faint sign of surprise, as though she couldn't believe she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the trees surrounding the field have either been crushed or knocked over,\" the detective observed, \"and there are some cracks formed on the floor of the field, as though something heavy had just weighed down on it. This must be related to the ability of the artifacts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. However, I would like to ask you both something,\" Marie said, \"what exactly do you know about these artifacts that you're after?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Based on the data given to us by Mitsuru-san and the Kirito Group,\" Labrys replied, \"we know that the artifacts were made in a set of three, with only one of them being in control of the other two. In addition, we know that one of the main abilities of these artifacts grants the user tremendous power at their beckoning, which based on the amount of power outputted by the artifacts, can be tracked. In this case, we were able to identify the artifacts because there was a power spike, meaning that the user of the artifacts must have been using the artifacts to obtain a large amount of power quickly. However, it becomes harder to detect if the opposite scenario occurs, that being the user of the artifacts using them to obtain power at a slow pace. Additionally, range also becomes a variable in the signal so that if we are outside the range of the artifacts\u2019 signal, we are unable to find locate them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that\u2019s all the info you have been given.\" Marie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said the detective, \u201cbut it looks like as though you are withholding information from us. In particular, something about where we stand currently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWithholding!? Why the hell would I ever do such a thing? I came with you because I wanted to protect Inaba too, you know! There are things there that I cherish too, just like you and the others!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that is the case, Marie, then you must let us know the truth behind what you haven\u2019t told us. Any info, whether big or small, about these artifacts is crucial to helping us contain them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-haired girl didn't say anything for a while before responding,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I was withholding the info, you know? I was about to tell you what I knew, but making that accusation now made me feel bad. I\u2019m not in the mood to talk about it now, but meet me back here tomorrow afternoon and I\u2019ll tell you all I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand. I am sorry for making a false accusation towards you so suddenly. We will be here tomorrow afternoon then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the three girls went their separate ways. However, while moving back to the entrance of the TV world she came from, Naoto was deep in thought. She knew that if she had not made the accusation, Marie would have keep stalling and keeping the info away from them. While the detective did truly believe that she really did want to protect the city and that eventually she would have talked, the only way to get the info out of her fast was to make the accusation to her directly, even if it did hurt the girl\u2019s feelings a bit. The detective could only guess as to what secrets would be revealed tomorrow afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at home, Rise was in her room, standing in front of a full length mirror in her bra and panties. After she came home, she disposed of the torn clothes properly and quickly went to her room, locking her door so her grandmother couldn't come in without letting her know first. Although she could ask the jewellery to make some clothes for her bigger sizes, she decided that she could just wear a small amount of clothing and replace it instead if it broke. In any case, this also gave Rise the added benefit of watching her growth unfold on her bare skin, something she quite liked. She looked at her current body size. She had the build of an athlete currently, which she found was fine to go outside as, but in the comfort of her own home, she could grow bigger. Activating the jewellery's size increase function with her mind by concentrating, Rise watched as her muscles slowly began to add inches and inches of beef to her expanding frame, while her breasts started to grow as well, putting strain on her bra which the idol didn't mind currently. She was taking the growth slow right now, since she didn't want to grow to a point where she couldn't fit her room as well as the fact that she wanted to see it unfold at this pace. Rise felt amazing with each pump the jewellery gave her body. While it was growing, Rise decided to start doing poses that professional body-builders did, her size starting to cross over into that threshold. While she was doing poses, Rise remembered something she was going to ask the necklace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey necklace, what other features do you come with? I already know about the size increase, size decrease and the clothing ability, but what else is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An additional option is the ability to change the current appearance of the main artifact and the amplifiers to another form, also known as \"Form Change\". Our base forms are the necklace and bracelets, but you can tell us what form you would like us to take. However, it is recommended that the form you give is something that you can attach to your body in order to be able to make full use of us like you are currently, such as an accessory for example.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really convenient!\" Rise said, \"I could change you into something more suited for this time then! However, I think I'll hold off on it for now. Is there anything else you can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another available option is the other function of size increase and size decrease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other function?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative. \u201dSize Increase\" and \"Size Decrease\" can not only affect your own body, but can be commanded to affect the bodies of those in your vicinity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!? I can grow other people around me too!\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative. However due to a problem in the system from excessive time on shut-down mode, this option is only available for usage on the female gender. This error shall be fixed in due time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ok, but that's still amazing!\" Rise said, \"You are the coolest necklace ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compliment acknowledged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow!, Rise thought, I could even let my friends join the fun! Rise imagined seeing her friends grow to the size of bodybuilders, maybe even bigger! Just the thought of seeing Naoto in that form made Rise blush. I have to try that out tomorrow!, Rise thought before stopping herself. Should she reveal the jewellery and its powers to her friends now? While there were pros and cons in revealing the truth now or later, Rise decided to keep it her secret for now. I mean, eventually I will tell them, Rise thought, but I want to have a little fun with the jewellery first before doing that. For now, it\u2019ll be my secret superpower! The idol was overjoyed with the prospect, her joyous emotions starting to make her growth speed increase. The idols emotions combined with the pleasure the growth gave her started to overload her sensors a bit. Rise felt like she was in heaven, with both her growth and emotions in sync. Every flex she did continued to grow as her muscles, breasts and height keep increasing. However, a hit to her noggin brought her back to her senses. Rise looked around for the cause of the hit only to realize that her head hit the ceiling due to her growth making her fill up a good chunk of her room. The slightest movements on her body would make her floor creak and her muscles flex. Although Rise did enjoy the size, she knew she needed to shrink down. As she shrunk her muscles yet again, Rise was a little disappointed. If only I didn't need to hold back when I grew, she thought. Wait! She didn\u2019t need to! I could go find a place in the TV world to grow!, she thought, that way I wouldn't hurt anything and I could grow to my heart\u2019s content! However, she could also go to bed and sleep since tomorrow, she planned on testing the \u201cSize Increase\u201d ability on her friends.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The idol knew that Chie usually spent the mornings of the days that she was free at the gym as part of a stricter exercise routine the girl had put upon herself recently to build muscle faster. After going to the locker room inside to change into some workout clothes made by the artifacts and changing her size to that of an amateur body-builder so that the idol could blend in to the crowd and not be noticed too easily by Chie if she was seen, the idol went to look for her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick look, Rise found Chie in a more isolated part of the gym doing a quick warm-up on her body before she hit the weights. From Rise's hiding spot, the idol had a clear view of the blonde while being hidden pretty well. This is perfect, she thought, since her workout today is about her gaining mass, it looks like she's going to start by lifting dumbbells. I'll start the growth when she starts doing reps. As the idol waited for the girl to finish stretching, another thought came to her. By making her body grow out of the blue, won't she get suspicious of how it happened?, she thought, In Chie's case, I don't think that she'll care too much about how she gained muscles as long as she got them. Who knows, she might even pin her growth on her workouts paying off. However, Yukiko and definitely Naoto will get really suspicious about their growths, so I'll have to make it look like they grew because of something. For now though, the idol started to focus again just as Chie had done her stretches and went for the dumbbells. Alright, it's time!, the idol thought to herself.</span></div></div>",

From her location it was bit difficult to make out but it definitely appeared that her friend had packed on a bit of muscle in just the short time she had working that one weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol didn't think much of it as the blonde for whatever reason decided to push her further adding just a bit more weight to the bar. Rise was no expert but possibly a quarter more to make it surpass a hundred. Her friend really was pushing herself she thought, good thing she was here to provide a little support, so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back to her lift Chie remained oblivious to Rise's tampering as each time she lifted the muscles in her biceps and thighs seemed to expand inch by inch. The idol watched with anticipation as Chie's muscles began to take on a better firmer shape, her biceps now noticeable even while being concealed in her familiar green jacket. Her legs now growing thicker with added power as she completed each successful lift, which was becoming more and more easier as time went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow what is it with me today? Feels like I got an endless amount of energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde muttered to herself as she once again placed the weight aside, taking a moment to gather herself. Usually after such a workout she'd be feeling the effects of having reached her personal limit but today was different. She felt good, she felt great actually as if she wasn't entirely done yet and for the life of her she couldn't explain why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise smiled as Chie gave her arms a slight flex and her biceps swelled to sizes much larger then usual. She almost expected the blonde to freak out yet after the initial shock she noticed that Chie actually seemed to be excited and overjoyed with how strong her arms were now, same with her legs after she took a look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie seemed to mutter something or other that she couldn't quite catch. Naoto could have read those lips but not her, in any case she ignored it instead content with the fact that Chie as expected was taking her muscle growth rather well. Even if it was a slightly faster pace then Rise had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well if sempai is enjoying her muscles doesn't matter how fast she's growing.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After talking one last look at Chie's growth, her body looking as though it could belong to a professional athlete, the idol left her hiding spot and exited the gym, eager to find the next person she would target, Yukiko. Chie, meanwhile, was switching to heavier weights. The ones she had been using recently had started getting lighter a lot quicker than usual, so she hoped that the heavyweight equipment would prove a challenge to herself. As Chie began to do reps with the barbell, her muscles started to slowly grow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rise was going over to the Amagi Inn where she assumed Yukiko would be, her mind was thinking about the extra kick she added to Chie's growth in the gym. Before leaving, she used the power of the jewellery to put a timed growth on her that would last for about an hour or so, causing her to grow slower than she did when Rise was the one who was making her grow directly. In exchange, during this \"auto-pilot\" mode of growth, any big strain put on the muscles would make them grow faster. In this case, Rise did this since Chie was still in the middle of her workout at the gym and she couldn't wait to see how big Chie would get because of this temporary boost the idol gave her. Maybe after I'm done with Yukiko, I'll find Chie and see how much bigger she got before going to find Naoto. Well, for now, I should focus on Yukiko. With her goals set, Rise headed off to the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Rise got to the hot springs inn, she shrunk down into a size that resembled her normal one and changed to some casual clothes in women's wash-room. Afterwards, Rise looked around the inn until she found Yukiko, heading into the direction of the hot springs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Yukiko!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hello, Rise-chan!\" she replied, \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was in the neighbourhood and decided to drop by see how you were doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's very kind of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no big deal, we're friends after all!\" the idol replied, \"By the way, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, today I'm not working at the inn and the hot springs are usually pretty empty around this time, I thought I'd go relax for a bit, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds pretty relaxing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, would you like to join me, Rise-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to, but I can't stay for too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe next time then, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, and we should bring the other girls, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Alright then, see you at school tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Yukiko turned around and resumed walking towards the hot springs. Waiting until she was a safe distance away, Rise started to follow Yukiko. This is the perfect chance!, she thought, I can make her bigger when she relaxes in the hot springs! That way, she might pin the growth on the hot springs water reacting to her body! Waiting until Yukiko changed out of her clothes and went inside the girls bath, Rise took a quick look around the area. It seemed as though Yukiko was right, since besides the girl herself, no other women were using the facility. This was for the best since Yukiko probably would not want attention from others as she grew. Activating the jewellery and raising the rate of growth higher than what she gave Chie, (Rise thought it would be fair since while Chie didn't get a big growth at first, her growth lasted for a long time and her workout would also help make her bigger whereas Yukiko wouldn't get a boost since she wasn't straining her muscles enough for it to work much at all), Rise started to direct the artifact's power into the black-haired girl's body. </span></div></div>",

Her lower was completely hidden away from her viewpoint but she assumed that if Yukiko's swelling back muscles were any indication then what she couldn't see was growing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl's back and shoulders grew wider, Rise wondered just when was the point where Yukiko would realize that she was growing larger? She knew the springs were relaxing but were they that relaxing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHold on, suddenly she picked on a faint sound coming the growing girl was Rise getting her answer or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff...haha\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if she were on set Rise looked away to her side with a narrow-eyed expression. She almost couldn't believe it but then this was Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only Yukiko-sempai could subconsciously laugh as her body grows bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again maybe it was the relaxing setting around her that trigger her laughing fit, a part of her actually hoping that was the case. With a sigh Rise rubbed the back of her head deciding to refocus on Yukiko's growth instead it was better for her mental health anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case as she stretched her arms out there was a rather notable pump now in Yukiko's arms. Her biceps apparently set on rivaling her head in size. The rest of what Rise could see wasn't too far behind as her back and shoulders had definitely grown a good deal larger and the girl was getting a strong looking set of traps on her. At the pace she was going it wouldn't be too long before she'd feel her head resting on a new amount of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a good and steady growth, the idol thought, anticipating the moment when Yukiko would emerge from a water as a \"bodybuilding priestess\", so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again even with the higher speed of growth Yukiko's body still seemed to be taking it's time growing into her new stronger shape and while she was looking forward to it there was an intrigue on how Chie's growth was coming along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I know Chie-sempai she might be crazy-huge by now.\" Rise thought out loud as her vision drifted back toward Yukiko's still steady growing form.</span></div></div>",

Hmm, she thought, I shouldn't leave her growth like this, she'll be much smaller compared to the others. I guess I'll put the same boost on her like I did to Chie-sempai! Channeling the jewellery, the idol left the boost inside the Priestess's body, making it 2 hours long as opposed to the 1 hour she gave to Chie. Even though Yukiko was around the same size as Chie before Rise left her at the gym and gave her the boost, the reason why Yukiko should get double the duration was because Yukiko was not straining her muscles by working out like Chie was and therefore not gaining the extra muscle from the boost. Now that Yukiko's boost was longer, the idol thought that if Yukiko didn't do anything to push her new muscles for the next two hours, then the small growth the boost provided by default would allow her to reach a size that would be hopefully somewhere around Chie's current size, whatever that may be. As Rise walked out of the springs, Yukiko's laughing fit began to end as she started to take in her surroundings and notice her new muscles which were still slowly growing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the inn, Rise stopped and thought to herself where Chie would be at this time. Her concentration was broken, however, by her stomach. I guess I lost track of time, she thought. Looking at her phone for the time, Rise noticed that it was around lunchtime. Wait a minute, she thought, I know where she is! Heading towards the Central Shopping District, Rise found the place she was looking for. Souzai Daigaku, the best restaurant around to buy meat, Chie's favourite food. Sure enough, Rise did see a large and feminine figure ordering something from the restaurant. As the figure turned around, Rise noticed that it was indeed Chie, but compared to the size Rise had seen at the gym, this Chie was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even though some of the guys were jacked beyond belief Rise had turn down the job. In hindsight she wasn't sure if that said anything about her especially now that she enjoyed seeing her own body grow far beyond that and was evening pumping up her own friends for her enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms bigger then many a man's, legs thick as trunks. Back,shoulders, and traps large and wide enough forcing the blonde to wear her familiar jacket around her waist, even if it too had grown appropriately in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise had to admit and really wasn't surprised that Chie wore all that new muscle well. Kanji was the naturally strongest among them Chie was the one who did everything to stay in peak shape even pushing herself further as Rise saw first hand earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said a part of her was mildly disappointed that the blonde hadn't reached a even higher size.

Yeah...\" the idol said, tried to imagine how that conversation would work, considering what she had done to Yukiko earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Something wrong, Rise?\" the blonde asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, it's nothing, Thanks for asking.\" Rise said, \"I think I'm going to head off now. I gotta go find Naoto. You wouldn't happen to know where she is right now, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah sorry, I don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries. I'll find her eventually. It was nice chatting with you. See you tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise started to walk away from the restaurant, determined to find the detective. She checked the police department for any sign of her, but had no luck. Then, she went over to her house, but her grandfather had answered and told her that Naoto had gone out, not specifying where. After looking around the school and at Junes to no avail, Rise was at a loss. Where is Naoto?, she thought. Meanwhile, the detective was in the TV world, heading towards the field by the creek where Marie had said that she would reveal all she knew about the artifacts. I need to know what exactly we are trying to find and the consequences it could pose if it was left in wrong hands, Naoto thought. The info that Marie reveals could be pivotal in determining how much of a threat these artifacts truly are. Setting her goals, Naoto quickened her pace towards her destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the real world, Rise had decided to give up. Walking down the streets of Inaba to get back home, Rise turned a corner... and hit what felt like a brick wall. Falling on her rear, the idol eyes were down and could not see who she bumped into. However, the person decided to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright!? Huh? Rise, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecognizing the voice to be Yukiko's, the idol stood up and looked at her friend's new size.</span></div></div>",

Amagi had indeed become a bodybuilding priestess, muscles bulging underneath that kimono of hers apparently like Chie, and Rise herself, Yukiko too needed a change of wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol wasn't lying though when she said that her friend wore her new muscles well, that kimono must been several sizes large but on Yukiko's new frame it was a nice snug fit and doing a good job of showing off her new sizable curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Rise-chan, and I'm happy to hear you aren't frighten by these new muscles of mine. I honestly have no idea how I gained them in first place and was quite surprised to see my body change so drastically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you kidding, Sempai? Like I said I think you look great and it looks like those new muscles of yours definitely worked some magic on your already nice curves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol stated with a teasing wink causing the larger girl to blush somewhat at what she took as a compliment, afterwards thanking Rise once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway as I was saying I haven't a clue how I gain such much muscle mass so I was looking for Chie. She's the fitness expert between us all and I'm sure she could help out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise nodded urging Yukiko on to go meet up with Chie, the raven-haired girl obvious unaware that her best friend had pumped up a great deal as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's over at Souzai Daigaku. If you're lucky you may be able to catch up to her.\" Rise pointed out with an innocent-looking smile, honestly she wished she could see the two meet up and see the reactions but she had other things on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do just that thank you, Rise-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol waving away as Yukiko made her leave in hopes of meeting up with Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime, Sempai!\" Rise yelled out waiting for her now larger friend to fade into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...looks like I was right earlier. I'm really going to have to push things if I want Naoto-kun to far outclass our Sempai.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Moments away from her destination, Naoto continued to move along the edge of the creek towards the field that had been set for their meeting place. The detective was trying to keep an open mind so she could thoroughly analyse the info that she was about to hear from Marie and understand what these artifacts truly were, as well as why the Mitsuru and the Kirito Group would want such a thing. Finally reaching the field, Naoto saw Labrys already there, waiting for her and Marie to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Naoto-kun. Was Marie accompanying you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Labrys-san, and unfortunately, she was not. It seems as though the one who called us here is running late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the robot could respond, there was a loud shaking coming from the ground. The earth from middle of the field began to shimmer and slowly disappear, revealing a staircase behind it, with Marie climbing up from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two, come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective noted that Marie had become more serious over the situation than before. I don't like where this is going, she thought. Going down the staircase, the three girls eventually found themselves in a small room, almost like one from an ancient temple. Marie beckoned them to come to the middle of the room where she would explain herself. As they walked over, Naoto noted that there were what appeared to be three different pillars around the room, each holding an empty slot for something. Finally stopped in the middle of the room, the black haired girl began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the room where the artifacts where meant to be sealed in. I know this because of the memories from Izanami from when I was one with her. As you know, the world of the Midnight Channel or as you guys call it, the TV world, reflects the collective human heart and is a place where Shadows, a being made from humans which carry their darkest desires, are the main denizens. However, what you probably don't know is that this world has been here for ages, changing shapes and names as time and technology has. Before TVs, mirrors were the most suitable way for a human to enter the world and this world wasn't called the Midnight Channel. Having said that, many shadows have been born here from humans in all different ages. However, there was one odd case in which a particularly unstable human with a immeasurable lust for power had not made a Shadow from their desires in this world, but a physical object instead. This object was a necklace, which you know as one of the artifacts. Like you said earlier, the primary ability necklace will give it's wearer power, but the form in which the power comes varies with the wearer. Anticipating that there could be bloodshed for an object such as this, Izanami decided to take the majority of power from the necklace and split it between two bracelets and initially sealed all three artifacts here. However, after some time, Izanami decided to entrust only the necklace to a being who served her and was ordered to move it away from this room, since if someone where to access this room somehow, all three objects would be there for that person to take and unlock the full power of the necklace. As time went on though, that servant ended up dying from a malevolent Shadow and the necklace's whereabouts became unknown. Now it seems as though someone found the necklace and was able to access this place and take the bracelets, unlocking it's true power. I noticed this yesterday when I felt the surge of power from all three artifacts and ended up joining you two to search for the new owner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is quite a lot to take in at once.\" the detective said, pausing a bit before resuming, \"Well, from what you've told me, I understand that this necklace is powerful, but is there something else you haven't told us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, there is.\" Marie said, \"Like I said before, this necklace was made from an unstable human being, so the necklace can have malfunctions at times which can affect the wearer as well as others who have been affected by the necklace's abilities. These malfunctions usually lead to giving the wearer and/or the people who have been affected by the necklace more power than they wanted without being able to stop the flow, although I believe there have been other malfunctions of the necklace although I can't seem to remember what they were. Additionally, I cannot say this is true since none of the past wearers of he necklace have ever described anything of the sort when using it, but my theory is that these malfunctions are really the will of the Shadow from that unstable human who may reside inside the necklace. It is just a theory, however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems as though these artifacts are indeed a dangerous threat then.\" Labrys said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" Naoto said, \"This info only confirms the threat that these artifacts give. Marie, thank you for giving us this info. This really has helped us with our investigation on the artifacts. We will find the wearer eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" Marie said, \"I'm just glad that I can finally get that off my chest and take some of the burden off. If you guys find any more leads unto the whereabouts of the artifacts, let me know.\"</span></div></div>",

What the hell could she possibly want with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto had no answer instead she and Marie looked toward Labrys for any possible answers. The robot-girl looked at them both before confess all that she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Originally I wasn't sure nor was I told. However after we had our chat yesterday I got in touch Fuuka-san and was told Mitsuru-san wanted them for simple research and safe keeping. After the incident with Sho-kun, Mitsuru-san's been keeping a close watch on the TV world when the surge came well...as Junpei-kun would oddly put it, red flags were thrown...or something like that. Anyway I'm guessing she didn't want any kind of repeat of the P-1 Grand Prix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLabrys' words made the detective ponder for moment her mind working at it's usual quick pace as she went over what the iron maiden and Marie had both stated. Was there a connection there possibly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minazuki...\" she muttered, catching the attention of the others, she knew for a fact there had been no word as to what had happened to him these past couple of months. It was almost as if he had fallen completely off the grid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think Sho-kun could have taken them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Labrys-san I do not. I am less concerned with him and more on the one that was using him. Marie is it possible that the shadow who killed the one that Izanami entrusted the necklace to was perhaps either working for or Hi-no-Kagutsuchi himself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat name brought out wide-eyed looks from both Marie and Labrys, especially Labrys who looked briefly away with disdain. That literal monster had used them all more so her then anyone else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying that thing...that monster is still alive?!\" Labrys yelled out clearly losing her previous composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No don't be stupid! That's impossible! Unlike like me once you stopped him, you stopped him cold. End of story. But you may be right Naoto-kun that the shadow who killed the servant could have been working under Kagutsuchi just as a way to screw with me...well past me anyway, dammit you know what I mean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly flustered Marie puffed out her cheeks as she wrapped her arms around herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then the malfunctions may have come from Kagutsuchi's doing and not the original creator as previously believed. Perhaps hoping whomever would find the necklace would prove and grow strong enough to become his vessel but with it lost to time he was forced to go another route, specifically the one involving Minazuki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective stated, her chin cupped as she dove further into her thoughts trying to put every missing piece of information together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think a part of that beast is still inside the jewelry?\" Labrys questioned having calmed down from her previous outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Dammit weren't you listening! When you killed him that was it every last part that existed faded away. There is no coming back from that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie explained flustered as ever, \"However he may have tampered and defiled the necklace and through it the rest of the artifacts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the shadow that performed the assassination may have housed itself within the necklace awaiting for it to be discovered by an oblivious individual.\" Naoto mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possible yeah...dammit I thought we done with him when you ran him through the axe, Labrys, but I guess the past always comes back to haunt you in some way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective and Labrys agreed with Marie's statement and now with a somewhat better understanding of what was occurring it was time to regroup and seek out the one who had taken the artifacts into their possession...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside of the TV world and back in Inaba the three ladies decided to head in entirely different directions. Naoto looking to do a bit of detective work on her own, while Marie simply walked off repeating what she had said earlier about any leads being shared with her, lastly Labrys would take time to make her report she had to let Mitsuru know that this was becoming far bigger then the redheaded woman had originally anticipated.</span></div></div>",

Her initial tests of the \"Size Increase\" abilities had been a success since she managed to control it pretty well and both Chie and Yukiko seemed to like their muscles without asking too many questions. However, she knew the detective would not do the dame thing due to her personality. Unless the idol could think of a way to put the blame of Naoto's soon-to-be growing muscles on something or someone else, she would probably have to come clean about the necklace. It's not to say that Rise was never planning on telling her friends, but she wanted her necklace's power to be her little secret a bit longer. Well, I'll make the decision tomorrow, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the time, the idol found that she still had a few hours to kill before she would normally go to bed. Sure, she could sleep early for tomorrow since like today, there were BIG events planned. While that was one option, Rise also thought about using her own personal TV to head over to the TV world and making herself bigger since she didn't do it the previous night. While she could still wait until later, Rise had a feeling that if she didn't try it out now, she wouldn't be able to do it so easily for a while.

The mere thought of envisioning the blue-haired detective go from her usual small size to a hulking amazon nearly made the idol squeal as if she were one of her numerous teenage fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite embarrassing when she stopped and thought of it but Rise couldn't deny there was just something about Naoto that had captured her interest since she had first met the detective. Slapping her cheeks Rise ultimately decided to head to bed early so she could get a fresh start in tracking down Naoto tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to make you SO big, Naoto-kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that statement in mind Rise went to bed eager to see the outcome of Naoto's growth the next day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day as Rise prepared to make her early leave she thought back to the dream from the night before. Once again it had been muscle-fueled, clearly her subconscious was obsessed with the idea, this one however was notably different from the dream from the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this Rise wasn't at school instead she was at the usual meeting place she and her friends used over at Junes. She wasn't alone either Naoto was sitting directly opposite of her and the two were seemingly enjoying a pleasant conversation. Being a dream she couldn't exactly recall what they were talking about but Rise vaguely remembered laughing, smiling, and generally enjoying herself. As was Naoto to the idol's surprise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen things shifted when she for whatever reason reached for her necklace...afterwards she overheard Naoto mutter about how odd it was that her clothing felt tighter then usual, Rise joking that maybe she was still a growing girl. Oh how right she was when the detective's body practically exploded right out of her usual formal clothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigger, larger, wider, thicker, the blue-haired girl grew her arms and legs growing to enormous portions while back seemingly stretched outward wider then the table they were sharing. A painful expression on Naoto's face as her body's enormity began to overtake more of her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic-stricken Rise tried to pause or end the growth except the jewelry wasn't responding instead only fueling the further growth of the detective, who was resembling more a hot-air balloon of pure muscle then a teenage girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing she remembered was Naoto crying out to Rise that it was far too much for her to bare and things only got worse when the floorboards beneath the growing girl started to crack and break away due to the hundreds of pounds of weight pressing down on them...eventually giving way causing the detective to fall straight through the open floor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise screaming out the detective's name as she reached out in a desperate attempt to catch any part of her ballooning friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol would never know the outcome as she awoke with a shock realizing she had in fact screamed out Naoto's name, her forehead drenched in sweat her breathing erratic as she took several minutes to gather herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankful that her grandmother must not have heard her Rise exhaled her nerves still rattled as hell. What was that dream about, was it a warning that she should have practiced up on her new powers? Should she just find and straight up tell Naoto the truth right away, or should she increase her own size along with Naoto to reduce the chance of such an unstable growth? Another thought also came to mind, was it her own personal feelings of the detective that had triggered such a change?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated and still mentally tired Rise cried out throwing her arms into the air! Whatever it meant one thing was for sure she had to find Naoto no ands, ifs, or buts! What happens afterwards well she'd cross that bridge when she got to it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now she simply had to find Naoto Shirogane, and with that thought now fully-dressed she exited her home and stepped into the outside world.</span></div></div>",

Every once in a while having to take a moment to fix her attire, her sleeves or skirt riding up on occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she dismissed it as a mistake from the wash or lackluster job at ironing either way she sat through her classes seemingly unaware that the muscles in her body for whatever reason were growing stronger by the hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring lunch she met up and chatted as she always did with her circle of friends. No one seemed to notice or bring up the changes that were slowly occurring to the idol so lunch proceeded as usual, or least she thought so but one pair of eyes wasn't deceived...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater as the school bell rang to signal the end of the day Rise lifted herself up off her chair once again tugging at her clothing to stay in proper place.

Instead of shock she smiled slightly being an idol meant she do her best to stay in \"presentable\" shape so Rise had done what she could to stay in shape she just didn't expect that much of a noticeable difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took in the sight of her new biceps she again ignored the tingling coming from the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Rise exited the building preparing to make her way home.</span></div></div>",

For some reason, Rise noticed that she was getting close to having done over a hundred push-ups and yet, she remembers clearly only being able to do about ten last week during class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise jumped back up onto her feet and took a look at her arms. She noticed that her biceps were about one to two inches bigger than they were before. She could also clearly see the tone and definition of her arm's muscles as well. \"Wow, I guess I've been getting quite a work-out in the TV world,\" Rise figured, not realizing that her necklace was the reason behind her new muscles and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then laid on her back and started doing sit-ups. While doing sit-ups, Rise's once flat stomach started to change. A faint six-pack abs were beginning to appear on the idol's body. Rise then started doing jumping exercises, causing her legs to thicken and her glutes to tighten. The idol continued doing different exercises until an hour later, she had the body of a fitness model. Rise rubbed the muscles of her thighs, feeling the strength and thickness they now had. Her hands moved up to touch her faint six-pack abs. She continued feeling up her muscles, a bright red blush appearing on her face...</span></div></div>",

Checking the time to make sure it still wasn't too late, she was surprised to find that it was already close to midnight! Rise knew that she should go to bed, but she just wasn't feeling tired! Since she couldn't sleep, she continued to keep trying to tire herself. Her first thought was to continue the various exercises she had just recently done in her room. However, Rise decided that she needed something heavier than that to tire herself out, considering the fact that those exercises didn't even make her sweat. Maybe using some equipment would help?, she thought to herself. She did have some small weights in her room that she used every once in a while to keep herself fit. However, before she could even bring them out, her TV turned itself on as the Midnight Channel played on the screen. Rise watched as her TV displayed a panoramic view of what appeared to be some sort of gym, filled with various types of equipment, even some bizarre workout machines that Rise had never seen before. Looking at it from her TV screen, Rise thought that it would probably be much easier to tire herself out if she went into the TV world and used the equipment in the gym than the ones from her home. However, while the TV world had been changed for the better once the fog was lifted after Izanami was defeated, Rise still wasn't too comfortable about this had conveniently popped up to her. From her previous experiences in the TV world, things were definitely not what they seem there. Nevertheless, Rise needed to make her choice. </span></div></div>",

Is my shadow somehow trying to come back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood questions but for the moment she placed them aside, it was something to better investigate tomorrow and perhaps with her friends. Going in now on her own certainly wasn't the better option. With that decided Rise ignored the vision from the TV and instead brought out the beginning set of weights she had place away in her closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't many and only ranging around ten to fifteenth pounds something none to difficult even before her body started to bulk up so with a pair in hand Rise started to curl the weights working out her biceps later she move on to her legs, which were definitely becoming more shapely as the day had gone on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe workout went without fail, admittedly she didn't know much and felt it was already too late to bother Chie over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she placed the weights to one side Rise certainly felt a new pump in her body.

She wasn't too worried of her appearance right now since there wasn't many people out currently and nobody close to her would see her. Rise kept a steady pace as she continued to run, block after block. After a few minutes, Rise still didn't feel any fatigue, so she decided to slowly increase her speed. After about half an hour of running at her own pace (which was by now a full on sprint at this point), Rise decided to stop for a minute, not because of fatigue, but to think of a new way to tire herself out. Obviously, running wasn't doing anything to her energy, which was still the same as before. However, unbeknownst to the idol, the sprint did increase her muscle mass by quite a bit, covered over by her  Man, if only I had access to that gym I saw in the TV world, she thought, but there's no way I'm going there, at least not alone. It was at this point that Rise realized that she was leaning on the wall of the local gym. This is perfect!, Rise thought as she entered through the double doors of the gym's entrance. Sure, it wasn't as big or as high tech as the gym she saw in the TV world, but the heavyweight equipment here was sure to make her tired if she tried to workout her for a little while. Plus, because of how late it was, there was barely anyone around so she didn't need to wait to use any machines. It was like she had the gym to herself! Rise immediately set to work, using the various machines and weights in an attempt to tire herself out. Whenever something felt light to her, the idol would switch to something heavier, her muscles feeding off of the added strain. Her clothes were starting to go from loose to form-fitting but Rise was too into the exercise to feel anything. While the main point of her going to the gym was to make her tired, Rise had to admit she did enjoy the rush that came from pushing her body more and more, still not noticing the changes that her body was going through due to the necklace's power. Without rest, the ever-growing idol continued to exercise until..</span></div></div>",

She was struck speechless at the sight of her eight-pack abs, pillar-like legs, and a skin-tight night shirt hugging against her massive pecs and back. The idol had trouble removing the shirt but the moment she did, she got a better look at her new bulging pecs and abs. Rise got in front of her mirror in order to see her back, amazing her even more when the idol saw her own wide and ripped backside. She placed her hands on her butt, her panties having become a thong thanks to her unbelievably tight yet large glutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are my boobs bigger too?\" Rise wondered looking at her chest in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise held up her breasts in both hands and despite the size of her pecs, figured out that her breasts were definitely much bigger than they were before. She took take a handful and watched as the flesh of her breasts spilled out from between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise's eyes then fell on the necklace hanging around her muscular neck. Her still slender fingers tapped against the glinting necklace, a thought coming to the massive young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid this necklace have something to do with the fact that Rise was now a muscular goddess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought, however, moved aside the moment she saw her school uniform hanging from on the handle of her closet. She had to leave for school soon but with a body belonging to a bodybuilder, Rise wasn't sure she could fit in the uniform that was fitted for her once-slender yet curvy body. It would be a very tight fit even if she ripped the sleeves a bit for her massive arms. There was a chance her uniform could rip to pieces while she was in school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, with such huge muscles, why should Rise go to school? She would attract too much attention, more so since the once tiny idol suddenly turned into a bulging mass of veiny muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise thought about what she should do.

Luckily the idol didn't take the detective's words in a negative manner instead she jokingly agreed while still puzzled as to what had happened her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How odd you were perfectly normal yesterday when we all met at Junes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh were you checking me out, Naoto-kun?\" Rise stated with a sly teasing expression, a part of her ignoring the blush on her cheeks as Naoto backed up momentarily the blue-haired girl's own face lighting up in a stern yet still embarrassed fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...certainly was not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective argued back hating herself for that slight pause and her betraying blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These eyes of mine are trained to take in anything out of the ordinary that is why I noticed the change in your physical size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit the detective tried to sound as professional as she could and in a way Rise respected that. Despite her teasing she knew the girl wasn't like that. Doing what she did just to get Rise to show off her abs was proof of that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I believe you, Naoto-kun. Besides I was just teasing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh escaped the other girl's lips as she readjusted her hat glad to put this all behind her as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case tell me, Kujikawa-san where did you get that necklace? I don't recall anyone asking of it's origin earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise going to explain how she had received it from Teddie as a gift. She added that he had found it in his world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. It appears that I will have to speak with Teddie now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come with?\" Rise asked as she attempted to re-button her shirt. It was a modest request even if Rise couldn't quite explain why she had blushed when the detective ultimately agreed to have her come along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Thanks, Naoto-kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol cheered when suddenly her shirt came undone again causing her to squeal. Not only that but she could feel her sleeves, skirt, and leggings tightening around her growing muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Naoto-kun I...I think I'm getting bigger and faster...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective turning over to get a better understanding and suddenly gasping as Rise was indeed growing stronger at a slight faster rate! She wasn't exploding right out of her attire but her biceps and thighs were starting to put a greater amount of strain on the clothing she had on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-san hold on let me at least help you get your jacket off.\"</span></div></div>",

She felt a little different but she sure didn't look it. She turned back around and went to pick up the bottle again her shirt felt slightly tighter. She turned and looked at herself in the mirror again and sure enough it looked like she had put on a little muscle in fact she was looking good! She admired herself in the mirror she looked as she had new curvy legs and a bit more of a chest as well as some visible lines showing some abs just like her pictures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise felt more excited as she looked at herself in the mirror and began to feel even more flushed. She began growing even more her new boobs stretched out her top as the grew from a C to a DD and she could see her body going beyond a regular fitness model to that of a bodybuilders physique. Her top pulled up a bit to show her new six pack peaking through. Rise could feel her sleeves strain against her new powerhouse arms and her jacket creaked as her back widened out with new muscles she had never used before. Rise's thigh highs stretched around her tremendous thighs which gave her a look like Chun-li from Street Fighter. As she felt herself grow she felt like she could take on anyone by herself she would no longer have to sit back and watch she could be useful herself. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe was worried at first but as she looked at herself she thought \"I don't look to bad with a bit of muscle on me!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Downing another handful of he supplements, Rise continued to enjoy the sweet taste of candy on her tastebuds as the pills went down her throat. After finishing the last of the supplements in her palm, warmth began to spread all across her body as Rise began to grow. Her biceps kept getting wider, surpassing the size of footballs with every inch, reaching the size of soccer balls! Her abs which had already starting showing signs of a six pack from the last growth were now getting more ripped and defined with every breath she took. Her shoulders kept widening to accommodate for the growing bulk on her upper body. However, her lower body was no joke either. Her legs were almost like tree trunks at this point, making her look very sturdy. Her calves were now bulging now from her, their shape resembling powerful tear=drops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout it all, Rise continued to watch herself grow through the mirror, amazing at how far she was going and how strong she was becoming. While the growth was painful, her skin having to forcibly stretch itself taught to cover the new bulk she was gaining, that was greatly over masked by the immense pleasure that she felt inside due to the supplements, giving her a sense of ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the warmth inside her subsided as Rise took a final look at her current body. She was huge! Already way past the fitness form that those doctored images gave her, Rise had a build that was equal to male bodybuilders! However, unlike most female bodybuilders who sacrificed their curves for bigger muscles, the supplements not only allowed Rise to keep hers but somehow enhance it to epic proportions! While minimal fat was retained all over her body to keep it from becoming extremely veiny, the majority of Rise's fat was put on her curves, the idol now sporting F cup breasts atop her large pecs, pushing them out even further! Her rear as well, while not to the extent that her breasts got, was also enhanced, giving her a rounder and bubblier butt. Not only that, since her waist managed to grow the least in width, it gave the idol an hourglass figure that some only dreamed of. All in all, Rise was extremely happy with the results. Not only did she feel strong with her powerhouse muscles, she also felt even sexier with her enlarged assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise decided to do some poses with her new body, her flexes making her muscles pump up further and make her look even bigger than she already was! However, in the middle of doing a double bicep flex, Rise's sleeves ripped apart. It was then when the amazon took a good look at her clothes and realized that they were barely hanging on as is and looked extremely tight on her body, although Rise didn't feel as constricted as the clothes made her look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops!\" Rise said, blushing at her appearance, \"Looks like I should change out of these, shouldn't I? There are probably some clothes I can put on somewhere around here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking around for a little while, Rise found a pair of orange workout clothes that consisted of a sleeveless top that showing off her arms and a good amount of cleavage and shorts that showed off her legs. As Rise attempted to take off her tight clothes to switch into the workout clothes, her hand grazed against her giant breasts whilst taking off her old top, sending a rack of pleasure to her. It seems as though her curves had become more sensitive when growing. While Rise didn't mind the feeling of pleasure she received from the moment, she did hope that the sensitivity would go away soon. After managing to put on the workout clothes, Rise noted that they seemed to be extremely stretchy as they managed to stretch a lot to fit Rise and still remain extremely comfy, albeit still look skintight on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing a couple of warm up stretches, Rise decided that she wanted to test her new body by giving herself a good workout! While she already had a body that could easily take on most weights, this gym seemed to carry some lefty weights that Rise felt she could get a good challenge from, and that was only in the general workout area of this strange pink gym! The place was huge, probably even bigger than Junes! Who knew what things this gym had for her to find if she explored! However, Rise's eyes came to glance on the bottle of supplements that were the table near where Rise had put her torn up clothes. Should she take some more? Sure, they might trigger another growth spurt and maybe help her grow even further when she's working out, but part of Rise also wanted to start now.</span></div></div>",

With that in mind, Rise downed the rest of the pills in the bottle without giving it a second thought.

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Initially having some doubts about what she just did, Rise had no choice but to ride it out as her body kept piling on mass, surpassing human limits. It felt like her veins were on fire, but the pleasure she received made up for it all. Letting out a moan before biting her lip, Rise closed her eyes as she continued to grow. Finally, after about half an hour, Rise opened her eyes once more, only to find her vision slightly obscured by her enlarged chest. Rise was truly massive now, having doubled in size from her peak bodybuilder form not too long ago! Honestly, part of her thought that she would have gotten much bigger than this and that didn't sound too bad to her, but it was probably for the best, she thought to herself. She was already impairing her vision with her impressive bust and it was starting to get a little tricky to maneuver with all her mass. Still, looking at herself in the mirror, with her muscles glistening with sweat from her most recent growth spurt, she couldn't help but admire her powerful form and try to pull off a crab flex. Rise flexed with all her might, watching her reflection as her muscles nearly doubled in size, even her breasts looked bigger from her pumped pecs pushing them outwards, becoming almost as big as fridges! Throughout this all, Rise felt happy. Not only was she more than ready for the photoshoot (although explaining how she got so big would be tricky), but she felt invincible. There was no threat that could harm her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut don't you want to be bigger, a voice in her head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIP! The sound tore through all Rise's thoughts just then as she realized her orange workout top had been taken over the limit, splitting right down the middle and turning into a vest. Slightly embarrassed that it was the second time today she broke down her clothes with her body, Rise got out of her flex and saw a locker room on her left where there used to be nothing. Looking around her, it seemed like the gym had restructured itself to support her new body as the doorframes were now big enough for her to enter through, the size of the rooms themselves were raised (especially the ceiling) and more weights seemed to have been added, with many of them looking like they may put up a challenge for her. Heading into the locker room, Rise looked around for anything else to wear, only to find one thing: an orange and yellow bikini. \"Well, at least this place knows my favorite color.\" After a lot of stretching, Rise somehow managed to put on the bikini, noting that even after all that stretching out, the bikini didn't seem to look small or skintight on her, even fit comfortably. Somehow, Rise knew that this probably was able to keep her decent no matter how big she was, at least for the most part. While it fit well on her, it was still a bikini after all and still showed off the rest of her, including a vast amount of cleavage from the keyhole in the bikini's center. Stepping out of the locker room, Rise looked at the mirror wall again and saw what she looked like in her new attire. Feeling sexy with how big her curves had gotten alongside her muscles, Rise grabbed her phone from her pile of personal belongings she had put down near her and decided to do a little photo shoot of her own. After taking a few shots of herself flexing with one arm and doing any model poses she could manage with her bulk, Rise put her phone back down with her stuff and decided to explore a bit before leaving the TV world. Seeing a room off to her right, Rise went inside to find an even bigger room filled with even bigger weights! Heck, there were even things that weren't conventional weights here! Tanks, train cars, and at the end of the room... was that a plane?! Rise was strong, sure, but she wasn't that strong! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of a gym is this?\" Rise thought to herself. \"There's no way someone can lift all this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Rise reminded herself of how big she was and how if she had more of those supplements, maybe she could lift those and even beyond...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a nice thought, but I don't want to be that big!\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you sure?, the voice in her head said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting that thought of her head, Rise decided it was time to leave. Stepping back into the main room, Rise went to grab her stuff when she started to feel weird. At first, Rise thought it was another growth spurt and braced for it, but after realizing that her body wasn't shaking like it normally did before it grew, another feeling started to envelop her. It was like someone had injected a mixture of sugar, caffeine and adrenaline into her bloodstream. Rise felt her exhaustion slip away as her mind became more alert and her body felt like it was tingling all over. Rise felt like she had to move around and do something, she couldn't sit still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! This is nice, but it's way too much! I need to burn off all this energy!\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the rack of weights near her, Rise grabbed a couple dumbbells and started to fit them with each hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I'll get way bigger than this, I'll just do it until I've gotten rid of all this excess energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it felt fairly heavy in her arms as she lifted them, deriving pleasure from each successful rep as her arms continued to push back against the weight, soon gaining pound after pound of muscle, unbeknownst to Rise. However, once Rise couldn't feel the dumbbells anymore, she frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did this get so light? I'm not gonna lose any energy with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding more weight to the dumbells, Rise continued to curl them until the maximum weight was on both of them. Soon after, she put both on one arm and continued to lift, switching arms until even that felt like nothing to her expanding frame. Rise dropped them to the ground, smashing loudly on the floor as she picked up the heavier weights next to them. It wasn't just her arms expanding either, her legs were starting to surpass the width of the biggest trees in the world, her abs, once a defined 6 pack, was now a ripped 8 pack. Somehow, even her breasts were growing, soon reaching the size of small cars. Rise didn't notice, however, lost in her routine as she continued to lift and grow further. The pressure she felt from the weights reminded her of her newfound power and strength, that she wasn't weak anymore and didn't need to be on the sidelines. Combined with the pleasure she felt from a heavy weight, it was something she never wanted to stop feeling...</span></div></div>",

It was hard to imagine the new her was a less then hundred pound weakling just a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the jacket sleeves creaked in protest she enjoyed rubbing a hand along her mighty thighs that must be a foot or two in length. She could only imagine Chie would love to have legs as strong as the ones she was currently packing. She loved her friend but couldn\u2019t help but giggle at the supposed envy the blonde girl would show if she were here at this very moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumping her arms for a moment also brought a smile to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI finally have real biceps!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sleeves on her uniform didn\u2019t seem to share her enthusiasm as the fabric tore away louder then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought it was incredible how fit she was, everyone would be surprised at how different how powerful she now looked. She definitely had to thank Chie once she got back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before that she did think back about taking more pills before leaving, mostly due to her being unsure if the effects were permanent. Last thing she needed was loosing this beautiful build body on a complete whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead however was unaware that she wasn\u2019t the only one inside the TV world and more importantly inside her self-made pink gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear/boy simply known as Teddie wandered into the building wondering what had brought forth this place to appear. There didn\u2019t seem to be any shadows about ever since that grand battle in the past so the (at the moment) bear was free to wander around his home world as he pleased. Often times just looking for anything that may be scattered about possibly left behind since the days of the shadows running amuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo in he went traveling room to room inside the strange vastly pink place. Admittedly he wasn\u2019t very bright but one thing was for sure he was willing to bet that Rise-chan was behind this in some way yet as stated before felt no darkness as he had when her Shadow had created the strip club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally found her toward the back end of the gym striking several poses a moment later she was reaching for a jar filled with pills of some sort\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRise-chan! Whoa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dark eyes nearly burst right out of their sockets after inching closer and getting a better look at the bombshell of a redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly Cow, Rise-chan, you look amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked momentarily after hearing her name being called out. Through the reflection of the mirror she spotted Teddie standing in awe by the doorway. Supplement still in hand she greet the bear with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear nearly gagged as he was hugged by Rise\u2019s now much stronger set of arms the two chatting up a storm afterwards. Rise hadn\u2019t seen Junes\u2019 mascot in a while blushing as he complimented her on her new look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo these little pills are what made you so big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise nodded popping the cap off and grabbing a few more of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment he wondered where he had seen those colorful looking objects before. Obviously Junes had some like them for sell but no something about these seem to be oddly familiar yet he couldn\u2019t quite make out the reason why\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the container to a side he felt a gasp come and go as he read the label. Of course those pills were found here!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rise was too distracted by what Teddie said and already popped another handful of the supplements down her mouth, chewed and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Teddie, did you say something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really shouldn't eat so much of that stuff! That can seriously harm your body!\u201d  Teddie cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?  Because it seems like its been helping me so far.\u201d  Rise waited for that familiar warm feeling to come but it didn't happen this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, seems like nothing happened.  See, nothing wrong happened, don't worry so much okay Teddie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess...\u201d  just make sure you don't overdo it on those okay?\u201d Teddie said blushing a bit.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.  I'll be here a while I think, I'll see you later okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddie walked away from Rise thinking that it could have been a false alarm.  Those pills were the real deal that's for sure, but taking too many at a time could cause harm to the body in the long run.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise looked back at her reflection in the mirrors and then at the workout equipment and back again.  She had the build of a fitness competitor after taking a few of the supplements.  She was not too muscular, but enough that it gave her the curves she desired.  Without really thinking, she decided to do a few stretches before trying out the workout machines.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to find a set of workout clothes that fit her and seemed to stretch with her body and got started with the bench press.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she started to workout, she could see and feel her muscles pumping larger and larger.  Every time she did a rep with the bench press, her pecs and breasts pushed out further, but seemed to get bigger each time.  The same was true for the rest of her body.  The more she worked out, the bigger and more muscular she became.  It was strangely intoxicating.  After half an hour, Rise took a break and looked at her reflection again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a relatively short time span, her body had became much larger, her muscle mass tripling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! I look good! Really good!\u201d  Rise squealed excitedly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she posed and flexed, her body was hit with that same warm feeling, but this time, the heat was much more intense.   Just like last time, her muscles hardened, expanded, hardened, and expanded again.  She had a champion bodybuilder's physique before, but that was simply big, now she was getting huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was breathing faster and heavier as she watched in awe and ecstasy as her muscles kept expanding.  Her calves, already tear-dropped shaped, bulged and bulged.  Her thighs were expanding to the size of tree trunks, her abs became much more defined and ripped.  Her biceps were growing to the size of soccer balls and her breasts were inflating themselves to the size of beach balls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoulders grew wider and wider to accommodate her new bulk.   Rise felt so alive and so powerful, like no shadow can stop a single kick or punch from her.  While the growth felt wonderful, it was also very painful.  Her skin was on fire and was stretching and stretching to cover all the inflating muscles.  It was hard for her to stand upright and focus even though she wanted to see her body grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more minutes, the growth seemed to stop for a bit.  Rise looked up and gazed at her reflection again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2014oh my.....God!.....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was at a loss for words.  Her body, powerful before, now looked tiny compared to her one.  Her body had packed on what seemed like 300 pounds to a 200 pound one, giving her a solid-steel body packing almost 500 pounds!  She seemed an inch or so taller, but her shoulders she was shocked to see was just as wide as she was tall.  Her pectorals jutted at least two and a half feet from her ribcage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery muscle on her body had been pumped and inflated to enormous proportions.  They were huge and bulky, but still feminine.  Rise noticed that her waist had stayed roughly the same size while her legs and back exploded with muscle and raw power.  It gave her a very exaggerated hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise once again hit poses and flexed, making her body a little larger.  She pumped each muscle group as much as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is.....amazing!  This is what these pills can do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was considering going back to show Teddie her even bigger body when she felt the same burning sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!  I can feel it!  Am I going to get bigger?\u201d  Rise asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise's body began to....</span></div></div>",

She could feel her body growing again, this time even larger and bulkier than ever before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...ugh....\"  Rise huffed.  The growth was painful, her ever expanding muscles was fighting for room to grow. To be as big as they could possibly be.  Rise didn't know if she wanted to keep growing, or stop.  Either way, it looked like she couldn't control the growth, so it was going to be the former.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body had grown as wide as it was tall, and she was only growing wider to accommodate the massive girth she was piling on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs, thicker than large tires, thickened and hardened, forcing her legs apart.  Her biceps and forearms kept piling on muscle until they were the size of small cars.  Her pectorals pushed further out, they were just so engorged with muscle and girth that they almost blocked her view.  They kept growing until they were the size of the largest beanbag chairs.  Her shoulders kept widening and widening, her lats so spread out, it looked like that one could land a jet on her back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise on one hand, felt she had enough.  She was already the biggest girl, or biggest and most muscular person for that matter on the planet right now, and there really wasn't a need to grow any larger.  But on the other hand, this feeling of power pumped into her body was just too intoxicating.  It felt so.......good....so good to be so strong and powerful.  She would never have to stay in the back, now she was her own one girl army!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth continued for several more minutes, her body continued to pump up, adding several more pounds of muscle each second.  Her body continued to expand, harden, expand and harden again.  The cycle continued for what seemed like hours.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the process finally slowed, then stopped.  When Rise looked up, she could only see through a v-shape opening between her enormous, out of this world pectoral muscles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! This feels awesome! I gotta try this body out!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Rise headed to....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rise decided that before showing off her new physique to her friends, she wanted to know how far she could push her body at her current level of muscle mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Rise decided that she should go to the Marukyu Striptease to try out her new body. Rise walked out of the gym, breaking any doors or walls that she couldn't fit through. After all, this was the TV world so she wasn't causing any damage to the real world. After she got out of the gym, she walked to the Striptease, her every step causing the ground to slightly shake around her. Once she got to the Striptease, she noticed that her muscles seemed bigger than when she was at the gym due to her every step adding a little more muscle to her frame. She also noticed that the Striptease had changed a little. The entire building seemed bigger than she remembered and the doors allowed her to get through easily without her having to break them down. Although Rise had pondered over the fact for a bit, she decided that maybe it was always like this and she was thinking of another place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the strip club dungeon, Rise headed towards the stage her friends once fought her Shadow. Afterwards, she put the bottle of supplements down on the floor and decided that she wanted to try and lift the center stage over her head. Rise looked around the edge of the stage until she found a spot she could get a nice grip on and put her fingers in it. Using all her strength, she tried pulling the stage out of the ground. At first, it seemed hard to do but her muscles slowly grew to help her with her task. Rise found that it was starting to become easier and redoubled her efforts. The stage started to break off slowly from the floor until she had completely broken it off. Once that was done, Rise put her arms under the center of the stage so she could support the entirety of it and started to do reps with it. Her biceps started growing slightly as she accomplished each rep. For the grand finale, she used all her strength to try to crush the stage with her bare hands. Cracks formed around the stage until it finally exploded into a shower of wood chips and metal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise never felt as happy as she did now. Not only was she MORE than ready for her photo shoot in a couple of weeks, but she could also protect her friends with her new strength. However, her happiness quickly vanished when she heard a voice all too familiar. Her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you can lift, Rise? Huh, I expected more from you. Then again, you were always such a shrimp compared to the rest of your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise looked around until she saw the outline of a figure coming from behind the curtains near the front of the stage. While the outline was covered in shadow and just barely visible, two golden eyes pierced through the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my Shadow!? I thought I had already accepted you!\" Rise exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you did, but that was when you were conflicted about your true self. I was only recently awoken by a new desire you had. Can you guess what that would be, Rise, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise felt the colour drain from her face as she remembered the lingering feeling of wanting to grow bigger after her last growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise, there's no need to worry. I'm not here to hurt you, unless you don't want to cooperate. As long as you accept me, I'm here to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you show yourself first, monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, such hurtful words, but if you insist...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curtains were pulled back as Shadow Rise stepped into the limelight. Rise went pale as she noticed the change that had occurred to her Shadow. Although it was still wearing the same bikini as when Rise had first seen her, the Shadow was now...</span></div></div>",

Rise could gasp out loud her own enormous muscularity trembling for as massive as she was her shadow was gigantic! Easily twice the size of the muscle-bloated idol!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shadow covering her in shadow a proud arrogant laugh leaving the lips of the shadow as she took notice of Rise's notable fear. Suddenly to the idol it all made sense as to why the building was much larger then before, it wasn't that she had remembered wrong it was actually the doing of her shadow. The Striptease itself grew to better accommodate her new gigantic form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can sense and see your fear, Rise, are you scared?\" The shadow asked interrupting the idol's racing thoughts as she flex one of her tremendous biceps the peak of the muscle surging high into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you fear me? Fear what I've become?\" she asked again. This time flexing the opposite bicep it too enlarging in muscular girth. The shadow laughed once more as she went through the motion of a full figure flex her incredible size bloating ever bigger, her red twin-tailed haired head nearly swallowed in muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise didn't know what to think several minutes ago she was in heaven over how powerful she had become and was ready to show her friends and the world the new her not to mention she had long accepted her shadow so the idea of her ever returning wasn't even a thought in her mind...but here was her shadow standing right in front of her making her look \"small\" by comparison not to mention she had willing brought her back by her new possibly selfish desire to grow stronger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me Rise has your fear been replaced with awe? Do you see what I am, what you could become? I know you Rise I know how you enjoyed having so much power how you longed for more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise to her credit stood her ground silent and defiant simply gritting her teeth as she leered back at her eclipsing shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admit it Rise you want this and so much more!\" Her shadow paused as she went through another ground-shaking flex. \"You want to become the biggest, strongest, most powerful idol in history!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow cried out in pleasure as she did flex after flex her monstrous muscles growing ever larger that Rise almost wondered if she'd explode or if there was even a limit to her body size?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Rise?\" The shadow asked as she surged higher in size, confident that Rise would agree to such lengths of power.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Rise watched her Shadow\u2019s muscles continue to grow bit by bit after each flex, her mind was facing an entirely different situation. Her urge to grow bigger was steadily taking over her. All Rise could think about was growing bigger, bigger than her Shadow, bigger than the Striptease, bigger than the TV world, just bigger! If she was bigger, she would never have to sit and watch as others fought for her. If she was bigger, she could strike fear into the hearts of her enemies, just like her Shadow was doing to her. If she was bigger, she\u2019d be the one protecting her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends. They were the ones who stood up for her. They were the ones who protected her. They were the ones who had accepted her. But what would happen to them if I grew bigger, she thought. Rise imagined herself accidentally stepping on them with her growing bulk. No!, she thought. If she were to ever hurt anyone she loved, she would never forgive herself. All Rise wanted was enough muscle for the photoshoot and to protect her friends. She knew her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off her previous fear, Rise exclaimed, \u201cHey, muscles-for-brains! Do you really think I\u2019d want to be that big? I\u2019ll never accept your offer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s such a shame, I was so sure you\u2019d accept. I guess we\u2019re going to have to do this the hard way then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise\u2019s shadow started to walk towards Rise, her massive arms outstretched as if to grab her. Rise\u2019s fear started to creep back inside her. What was she going to do? She definitely didn't want to be grabbed by her Shadow. She looked around until she saw the bottle of supplements. I need to grow bigger than my shadow if I'm going to beat her, she thought. Rise just hoped that she would be able to shrink into a smaller size with her friends\u2019 help afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise started to move as fast as she could to the bottle. Thankfully, being smaller than her shadow allowed her to have much more mobility than her. When she reached the bottle, she rose the bottle up to her face and was about to eat one before she noticed that, one, the bottle was already open and, two, as her eyes glanced over to her Shadow\u2019s face, Rise saw a smile forming. Realizing what her Shadow did, she threw the bottle on the floor, the supplements going all over the place. It was too late, however, as she heard the sound of her throat swallowing a single supplement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste of stale candy appeared in her mouth while Rise doubled over in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it seems like it\u2019s not all looks and muscles you have, Rise. Too bad you were a second too late to realize it. While you were destroying that stage, I\u2019d managed to add a little pick-me-up to those supplements of yours. It was my fail-safe in case you didn't accept my offer. Now I have control over your muscles, and why don\u2019t we test out how far we can go with this, hmm? Now, this might sting a little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise felt a heat, no, it felt like an inferno covering her entire body. It felt like she was being burnt alive. Her muscles started to become active, growing bigger, slowly but surely. After managing to stand up, Rise noticed that she was catching up to her Shadow in muscle mass. Now\u2019s my chance, she thought. Once I grow bigger than her, I\u2019ll try to overpower her and defeat her so her control over me will be gone, then I\u2019ll find a way to get smaller. Rise slowly started to more towards her shadow, her every step causing excruciating pain. It felt like she was walking on hot coals. Once she got close enough to her Shadow, she noticed that she was now the larger of the two. Through the pain, Rise managed to pull her right arm back and curl it into a fist. She put all her power into it and swung it at her Shadow\u2019s head.</span></div></div>",

Visible veins running all across her tremendous form as she tried to move even so much as a finger yet no matter how much effort, her face flushed with heat as she grunted and groaned, she just could not move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that really your plan? Come now, Rise, this is why we leave planning to Sempai and Naoto-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow taunted her with heavy arrogance which only angered the muscle idol more, wishing she could smash that smug smile off her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just told you, thanks to one single pill you took I have control over your muscles, over your body. Do you get it now.\" The shadow taunted once more running a hand across Rise's frozen fist, \"You can't lay a finger on me hahaha unless I wanted you to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shadow smiled much to her chagrin. She had played her like a fool and Rise's only hope was if she could somehow find the strength the power to break free from the paralysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear Rise this could have been so easy. Now comes the hard way you see you and I both know you want power. You can not deny this, my reawakening is all the proof you need, so I'm going to force you into that power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Rise wondered what she was getting at, then it came to her as she watched her shadow gather several of the fallen scattered about supplements!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to feed these to you and after doing so you're going to become a monstrous muscular idol! You'll have all the power you want perhaps you'll even crave more.

Although she could easily break out of any physical barrier with her body, she needed willpower to break down her shadow's magic, and with her thoughts scattered as they were right now, that was not going to happen. Still, Rise continued to struggle against her own body in an effort to move as her Shadow finished collecting the last of the pills from the floor. Moving over to the behemoth pop idol, Shadow Rise used her magic to force Rise's mouth open and was about to pour down the pills when she decided to say one last thing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, maybe you think I'm being too harsh. Even though I said I would take over your body if you couldn't handle the power, I'm still a part of you. Even though you keep denying it, I know you enjoy being bigger.

Rise said, unable to move her mouth properly due to it being forced open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to test you to see if you can overcome the temptation of your desires. First, I'll boost the potency of these pills and make him much more pleasurable for you instead of painful, since I'm not as monstrous as you think I am. If you can survive the growth triggered by them without being lured by the pleasure of your true desires, I'll give you a chance to try to persuade me to making you smaller, but I'll explain that later, if you really can overcome it. However, if you do give in to your true self, I'll continue to help you and supply you with greater and greater power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sands eesy.\" (Sounds easy) the idol said defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, since you didn't have a choice to refuse anyways!\" her Shadow said mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the pills back into the bottle and tampering the bottle with her dark energy, Shadow Rise started to pour the pills into the immobile idol's open mouth.

While happy that she could move, the taste of candy was in her mouth, although it wasn't stale like before. It tasted better than the original pills had! Before long, Rise felt a powerful sensation inside her, ready to burst! Again, it didn't hurt like before but made her body feel amazing! Rise already started to struggle to focus on her goal, since already she was being enticed by the pills to let herself go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided to give you back your body, seeing as I won't be able to control it at your new size.

Suddenly things were looking or sounding so easy, her muscles beginning to swell and grow thicker by the passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bugling pecs and inflating breasts being the first to really kick start into high gear, \"Oh it just had to start with that...\" Rise muttered as her chest swell outward, the idol's hands cupping what she could of her breasts as her arms grew and stretched out to her sides same as her powerful legs, the stage area already starting to crack under the idol's increasing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another rippling pulse Rise's muscles exploded further in size, that same pulse causing quite a bit of pleasure to surge through the idol's growing form. Again she nearly felt herself give into the desire to grow so massive so powerful. Resisting was becoming tougher and tougher as her body became stronger and stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What was that?\" she wondered out loud not realizing that her head had made contact with the ceiling, her growth now truly starting to kick into high gear. Her muscles continuing to grow bigger and stronger but now on top of that her body was stretching upward while her head sank deeper into the rising traps and chest area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting so big...\" Rise muttered as the tip of her muscles colliding with the ceiling that at one point was so high above meanwhile her limbs continued to widen and expand eating up all the area to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you becoming a room-sized idol.\" The shadow snickered as it faded away mere moments before Rise's swelling form could take up the last remaining portions of the vast room the two were once in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growth not stopping Rise grunted as she felt the side of her head press hard against the ceiling, \"Forget pleasure this is starting to get really painful.\" Rise stated through gritted teeth, her face beginning to match her red locks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecalling what her shadow said about wither the building or her would be the victor Rise realized there was only one option left to her, let go of her restrain if just for a moment at least enough so she could burst her way out otherwise she was going to perish to her own enormity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit...here goes nothing...or everything I suppose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol letting go and giving into her literally powerful desires...and that was all that was needed as her massive muscular mass shot right through the ceiling moments later the rest of the striptease felt the effects of the idol's gigantic body as she grew larger into the air and to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance the shadow smiled it's eyes shining a bright proud gold no doubt pleased with the outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew full well she'd have to give in, just a little bit, to get herself out. Congratulations Rise you replaced the striptease with yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow continued to smile chuckling softly under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her growth should be coming to a close in just a bit but I am curious Rise was that moment of desperation enough to make you feel what real power is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow chuckling once more as it awaited to see if Rise had indeed lost her way.</span></div></div>",

The idol swelling in every direction along with her height shooting upward several feet only for her muscles to bulge out even further in width. The stage area disappearing into dust as the idol's power-packed legs made quick work of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too much...too fast..\" Rise stated with a sharp gasp, the muscles in her arms already growing large enough she could feel the tip of her hands pressing into the side of the building. Moments later her upper body decided to place catch up as her gigantic traps rubbed against the ceiling her own head soon following up, the room practically billed to the brim with the idol's bulging muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oomph! Too tight...gotta get out of here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol quickly got her wish as her muscles bulged and grew right out of the building, her limbs destroying the sides while her titanic breasts and stellar back not to mention butt smashed right through the front and back end of the striptease!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally out of that confining space Rise was just about to take a moment to gather herself when she felt her body seemingly react to the fact that she was now out in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all she could get out before her growth restarted yet again and this time with even more vigor then ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery part of Rise growing bigger and bigger as the idol ascended to great heights and widths. The building that once contained her now nothing but a memory as a singular foot came to surpass it easily. Her still untouched face sinking deeper into the canyon of muscle created by gigantic traps and chest. Arms large and powerful enough to use the Junes superstore and her entire school as simple weights. A back growing thick and wide enough to eclipse her whole neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh so much muscle...\" Rise muttered out her cheeks flushed as her body still continued on still growing larger, stronger, wider in every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome quite distance away Rise's shadow watched with a pleased expression as the idol took up more and more of the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that already big enough to crush Inaba beneath her feet but no reason to stop there right, Rise? After all you want to be the biggest strongest idol in existence right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow cackled as she continued to watch the behemoth of an idol grow further.</span></div></div>",

Two her work-out material while stretched far beyond what it should be capable of was still able to contain her titanic form, she figured it must be the other worldly material. Three and this was the most important the package of supplements had surprisingly survived her transformation despite them being housed secretly inside her sea of pectoral muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all that aside Rise started her journey back to the entrance\u2026she didn\u2019t get far though before her quaking footfalls ended just the doors to the work-out room she was currently in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Rise with great size came troublesome doorways. At most she had put on three possibly four inches of height, not counting how high her lats had extended from her beautiful face, but her width was something else entirely. She wasn\u2019t twice as wide as she was tall but pretty damn close to it which made her exit a bit of a hassle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is until a quick idea popped into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess to get out of here I\u2019m going to have to do like a certain American comic book character\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>RISE SMASH</b>!\u201d she yelled out amusingly as she powered her way out with a simple right hook. After exiting into the hallway she briefly surveyed the damage. Her punch had obliterated the door along with a good deal of the surrounding walls! Even more amazing she hadn\u2019t even put any real power behind her strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise smiled nonetheless but made a mental note that she\u2019d better learn to control her strength and to be real careful once she met with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case now that she was out Rise began once again to make her way back to the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls creaking and cracking as her body unintentionally rubbed up against them while her empowered footsteps caused the entire place to quake \u201cin fear\u201d as she made her out, with a few more <b>RISE SMASH</b> moments here and there. The biggest homage being when she completely smashed right out the front door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise chuckled as she overheard the once sturdy building behind her come crashing down as if it were a mere house of playing cards. So her gym was now gone in the end she still got what she wanted so it wasn\u2019t a complete loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she had to show off her new self\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way back Rise noticed, well what she could anyway, that Teddie didn\u2019t seem to be around? She hoped he wasn\u2019t in the gym when it came down. No, she was relatively certain that her tremor-creating footsteps would have alerted the bear to her presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps he left earlier and had already crossed on over back to her world? If that was the case she wondered if Ted would in fact tell the others of the new her, all the more reason to return home as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Rise soon found herself with yet another potential problem due to her pumped up dimensions. It suddenly dawned on her that it was very possible she wouldn\u2019t fit at all through the TV screen she had originally used to cross on over to this side!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously this wasn\u2019t something she could easily <i>smash</i> to get through so she ultimately decided she\u2019d have to take her chances and throw caution to the wind...</span></div></div>",

That night, she began dreaming of herself making her big comeback but this time, she was at a a swimsuit competition.  She noticed that she was not as in shape as the other idols when suddenly she began to feel that burning sensation that she felt in the TV world.  Her muscles started growing, no supplements or anything, they just started growing and as Rise got more excited about being the biggest, strongest being in the world, she willed her body to grow larger and larger.  She didn't seem to care about what others were saying or how this would affect her, only that this growth was the best feeling in the world.  But before she could find out who the winner of the competition was, her alarm clock went off and she shot up out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a bit disappointed again, but nonetheless got ready for school.  As she walked up the hill, she pondered to herself; was this really the best for her? Did she really desire to be big and strong? What would the others say?  What would Souji say if he ever found out?  Sure working out to build a little muscle and tone was fine, but was there such a thing as too much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her thoughts aside as school started.  She tried to concentrate in class but the thought of her trying the supplements and asking Chie about them was too hard to resist.  When lunchtime came around, she headed over to Chie and Yukiko's classroom to say hi to them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!  Mind if I join in for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure why not?  The more the merrier I always say!\" Chie said pulling up a seat for Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Chie!  Oh! I wanted to ask you something.  Do you think you have some time after school today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be free, why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's about our workouts and about that little item you lent me.  I had some questions about its use and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie nodded and agreed to meet up with Rise at the front gates after school.  Yukiko was a bit curious as well, but luckily had to decline because she had to help out at the inn this afternoon.  Springtime was starting and reservations were starting to rise again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last bell of the day rang out, Rise and Chie met at the front and started walking towards the Junes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't we going to the gym?  Why are we going to Junes?  Did you need to pick up something?\"  Chie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no you see....those supplement pills you gave me?  Well, i tried to use them in the TV world because I thought I might be able to speed up the results....and....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And....they worked like a charm right?  You got a little bit more muscular and more toned right?  Told you I wasn't kidding that they worked.\"  Chie said with some pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes they did, but I got way more than 'a bit muscular.'   When I started working out, my muscles began to grow and grow!  I was huge!  You wouldn't believe it! I was bigger than that Hulk character!  I had so much bulk on my body I was as wide as the hallways!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Rise? You sure you weren't having a dream?  Because I find that hard to believe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you the truth! If you don't believe me I can show you!  Where did you get these pills anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't really remember.  I was in Junes looking for some workout equipment and some guy recommended me these supplements he found on the shelves.  I took the supplement pills and my other stuff and bought it and there seemed to be nothing suspicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them arrived at Junes and asked a clerk about the supplements and where they were located at.  The clerk showed them to the vitamins and supplements section and sure enough, there were several jars of the little pills, exactly the same as the ones Rise had in her hand.  Just for the heck of it, Rise decided to buy a few more jars before heading to towards the electronics section.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like before, they made sure no one was looking and jumped inside the TV.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise found her gym, surprisingly restored as if she never destroyed it.  She didn't care about that detail but popped a handful of supplements down her mouth and started to workout.  Within a few minutes, her muscles began to grow and inflate just like last time.  She didn't grow as huge but was still was fairly bulky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see what I mean?  Well....what do you think?  Do I really look that bad or.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie wasn't sure about this, on one side, she wanted to try it herself, and on the other, she wanted to 'push' Rise a little more and see how much bigger she could get to really see if this was real or not.</span></div></div>",

Truth be told however it was a size that made the blonde a bit envious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanji for obvious reasons was the certified \"big guy\" of their group of friends but Chie always considered herself to be the strongest from the female half.

You don't think it's too much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not at all. Honest it looks good on you. Say can I borrow those for a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise smiled with a nod completely oblivious to Chie's true intentions if anything she was happy that her friend didn't see her as a freak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie said her thanks before stating that Rise go find a mirror to better look herself over. Rise being the friend she was excused herself to do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was alone with the jar in hand Chie pondered away as a few thoughts came to mind. Rise had taken around a handful and grown rather large then again she had also mentioned that previous massive size, but that wasn't possible was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it beg the question just how should she approach this, take a few so she could possibly match Rise maybe even outdo her just a bit or go full force and down the ENTIRE jar! If Rise was telling the truth this was the best way to find out plus she'd no doubt be unmatched in muscle size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was still away but she'd return soon so Chie knew she had to make a decision in the next few moments...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chie decided to play it safe and downed a handful of pills and started to work out.  To be honest, she was still skeptical of the immense size that Rise spoke about but c'mon, that was impossible right?  Nobody could pack on that much muscle even with these supplements.  Plus Chie wanted to try a little 'growth' competition and have each take a handful each time see how big the other will grow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie got to work and so did Rise.  For a while, only the grunts and clanging of weights could be heard.  Chie figured that she was better skilled at this she would grow at a faster rate than Rise.  Turns out she was correct as after another 20 minutes of workout, the two stopped to take a break and compared results.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow! Look at you Chie-chan!  You look amazing!\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, I think you're right! You don't look too bad yourself Rise-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them had grown significantly more.  As they compared themselves in the mirrors, the two had grown past bodybuilder proportions.  Rise was bigger overall than Chie of course because she had worked out beforehand, but Chie wasn't too far off.  Chie began to think that what Rise said earlier wasn't too farfetched.  She wanted to try and take this to the max.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rise-chan?  I have an idea.  How about a little competition to see who can get bigger? You have another jar of those pills right?  How about I take the rest of this far and you take one jar of yours, we both start working out for one hour and see just how big we can get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like fun!  You know....we'll both be humongous after this!  Let's just hope there is enough room for the both of us still!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise pulled out her jar and Chie readied hers.  On the count of three, the rwo girls dumped the jars down their throats and started chewing as fast as they could.  Then the two rushed to the opposite sides of the large room and started working out again.  Before long the sounds of grunts and clanging weights could be heard again.  The two were pumping up furiously and with an entire jar of supplements in their systems, (Rise having a slight edge) their bodies also were reacting to them as such.  Both felt their bodies being supercharged as they as they picked up heavier and heavier weights.  With each rep their bodies added several pounds of muscle and with each breath they took it felt that the air they took in added to their mass.  Rise and Chie only had one thing in their minds right now: to be the biggest, strongest and most muscular being possible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued to pump and grow, their muscles looked like flesh colored balloons and someone had hooked them up to several helium tanks and turned them on.  Barely ten minutes in, their growths picked up pace and their bodies, already more than triple the size of the largest bodybuilder were growing even faster.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarger and larger the two of them grew. There was nothing to hold them back.  And seeing the other grow on the other side made them want to out do the other that much more.  Whenever Rise saw Chie adding more weights she would respond in kind with more weights.   The two of them were forcing their bodies to expand like never before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like forever, an hour had past and the two of them stopped pumping iron and compared their results....</span></div></div>",

Hah she had never got this type of results from her everyday training sessions sure it kept her fit but this...this was far different. She never felt such power as she did now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk born from confidence appeared on her face, her dear head now nearly lost in the field of muscle that had been born from her hour of pumping. She chuckled mentally a few times coming to realize why Rise had become so fascinated with her own personal growth. One had to experience it before they came to truly love it and it went without saying that Chie adored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was at least three times wider then she was tall, it was hard to tell but perhaps she had added a handful of inches to her actual height, her monstrous arms having grown to a point that her jacket had been transformed into more of a green-tinted vest these beasts the size of your standard everyday car Chie almost confident she could lift the entire school if they were back home at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to be outdone her legs had thicken pumped and outright grown to the sizable equal of a pair of redwoods so engorged with muscle mass that despite being forced apart Chie could feel the sides of each powerful thigh touching one another. Of course if she could actually see them she'd be more in awe but the immense amount of pectoral muscle she had just put on made that a bit of a hassle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh who was she kidding she couldn't see anything below due to the sea of muscle mass her chest had become. Chie wasn't sure how to label it beanbag no too small car like her arms no not big enough so it was somewhere in-between. What she did know was that somehow her jacket and tee had held together although if she flexed her chest that t-shirt of hers may just snap clean off like a rubber band. No sudden flexing then she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end the blonde girl concluded that Rise was absolutely right about what she had stated earlier at her size she was no doubt as big as a damn hallway and with this much mass on her getting around was going to take some getting used to. Not that she wasn't up to the challenge Chie was relishing in how powerful she had become, a tiny voice in the back of her head allow telling her to go even bigger but was pushed aside by the joy she felt for her current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing did come to mind if she had fared this well what had become of Rise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Sempai I think we have a problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Rise's voice alright and it surprised her that the redhead could be in some sort of problem. Had the poor girl's attire given out on her after all she was lucky but what if Rise wasn't? She blushed at the thought of seeing the muscled up idol in the nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe coughed for a moment to clear her head. The two of them were the only ones here so if that was the case Rise could trust in her that she'd never tell a soul of such an incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-chan it's okay I'm sure whatever happened isn't that bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn't for the tons of muscle holding her up Chie swore that the moment she turned over and caught sight of what she had she would've fallen straight on her backside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Rise...but it wasn't the Rise she remembered...dammit it wasn't even the Rise the pop idol had mentioned before. No her old hallway-sized self was an afterthought a child even to what she had now become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in utter shock and awe Chie stared mouth agape at the titanic redhead whose form was so mind-bogglingly massive even at her own size she couldn't believe such mass was a possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was nothing short of gigantic! Practically a living wall of power! Her muscles blown up to the point where she corked the room, muscles piling up against the ceiling and side walls. It felt as if every part of the building was creaking and cracking as it struggled to contain the immeasurably-sized redhead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould Rise even take a step with those legs of hers, that could shield away Chie completely, without causing this entire place to come tumbling down on the two of them?! She now understood the worry from earlier in Rise's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...don't move Rise-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's about the only thing that Chie could say to this new development.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rise could hear Chie trying to talk to her but couldn't make out exactly what she was saying so she tried her best to move a little closer to hear her.  Unfortunately, even the slightest movement caused her muscles to contract and bulge and each tiny flex caused more cracks in the walls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't hear you! What did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise tried taking a full step which shouldn't have been hard but when you have several tons of muscles piled onto your body and was large enough to fill up a room, taking a small step was difficult indeed because of how swollen her calves and thighs were.  They were so large and inflated that they crashed into each other as she tried to bend her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise NO! Stop! Don't move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late, the building was cracking more and more and the first few pieces started to come down.  Chie tried her best to find a way out before the building collapsed but she too was very large and even her movements were enough to shake the building.  As their movements were restricted, they could only wait as the building around them fell.  After a few seconds though Rise and Chie didn't really feel anything despite the fact that their was the sound of crashing all around them and dust blowing around.  The fact remained that their muscles acted as giant meat shields padding them and shielding them from debris.  Even the largest chunks that collided with their bodies did little damage.  After a few minutes when the building had collapsed they could feel that there was a pile of debris covering them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie are you alright?\" Rise called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine, how about you?\"  a voice called out from under the rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine as well, let's try and get out of this mess before.....ugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise wanted to get out but she felt an inner pain shoot throughout her body, it felt familiar and she knew that it was her muscles starting to expand again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise? Are you okay? You sound like you're in pain.\"  Chie called and as soon as she did, she too felt the same sensation.  It was a combination of excruciating pain and pleasure at the same time.  Both of the girls' muscles, already huge and pumped, started to expand even more.  Despite the weight of the debris on top of their bodies, nothing was holding back the growth that was occurring as muscles piled on top of muscles, making bulky even bulkier and making the super strong even stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the two expanding muscle-bound girls expanded their way out of the debris and by the time the growth subsided, the two added another 50% more muscle mass on their bodies making them even larger and stronger than ever before.  Rise and Chie decided that it was best to just power their way through and just pushed aside the debris until they both made it out of the ruined gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW! Look at you Chie-chan! You're huge!  Look at your arms and chest! They must be packing like a ton each!\" Rise commented as she saw the other girl through her narrow view between her swollen pecs and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you looked at yourself?! You're a freaking muscle goddess!  I'm surprised you could still move with all that bulk on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I do sorta feel trapped a bit in my own body but yeah, now you see what I mean about those supplements?  Something in this world or both causes our bodies to grow huge.  Ugh....I'm covered in dust, why don't we find like a spring or some kind of pool so we can wash up a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah let's do that....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked a ways and found a sort of outdoor resort that had exactly that.  A massive swimming pool big enough to accommodate even their physiques. However, as they moved closer, they realized that...</span></div></div>",

Of course practically everyone was expecting the arrival of the two enormously muscled girls their footsteps alone causing the area around them to quake as if it made of jello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it but I guess Ted was right...\" muttered Yosuke as he peered out into the distance confusion running rampant in his mind as to why Chie and Rise would do this to themselves...okay Chie he could somewhat understand the girl was more athletic then some of the guys and gals on the school's sports teams of course if she had found a way to make herself stronger she was going to take it but Rise-chan? Why would she push herself to such extremes and looking out into the horizon extreme was perhaps the understatement of the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes for a moment drifted over in Yukiko's direction he could somewhat tell she was concerned and maybe just as confused as he was if not more after all while he was friends with Chie and considered her a personal friend, as they all did in their tight circle of friends, the blonde girl was Yukiko's best and eternal friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was funny in a ironic way Chie and Rise both had dangerous curves to put it mildly yet as things were unlike anyone else Yosuke just couldn't bring him to enjoy such a sight. Fate sure can be a cruel mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case Rise and Chie finally appeared to be a few steps away from their destination the two of them still pondering about what connection the supplements had with this world or their world and how was it that the moment Rise had returned home she had reverted to her original size? Neither had the answers for any questions that plagued their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you've got to be kidding me!\" exclaimed Chie in stunning shock. Since she was the \"smaller\" of the two she had slightly better vision, a part of her envied Rise's stunning size yet she was okay with her head not being as muscle surrounded as Rise's was. How the redhead could see from all that mass she'd never know...unless she reached that same size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway she refocused after Rise had called out to her wondering what she was talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its them, Yosuke, Kanji-kun, and Yukiko! For whatever reason they're up ahead and waiting for us. I wonder how they knew we were here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they felt our footsteps back home.\" Rise said with a short giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be serious, Rise-chan.\" stated Chie rolling her eyes although she couldn't keep a quick grin from flashing on her lips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie! What on earth happened to the two of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko wasted no time in darting on over towards her monstrously muscled best friend. Afterwards the raven-haired girl did her best to hug what she possibly could of Chie's powerfully bloated form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response Chie chuckled stating that she could explain things as best she could. The size difference between the two of them making Yukiko appear as if she were the size of an ant compared to Chie's mighty size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sempai why are you looking at me like that?\" asked Rise a hint of innocence in her tone even though she was sure Yosuke was no doubt having a hell of time controlling his teenage-fueled hormones. Kanji already was hell it appeared as if he was a moment or two from passing out completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...it's just that how...why did you do something like this, Rise-chan! Ted told me about those supplements and how dangerous they were in this world! But by the time I ordered for them to be recalled someone had bought the whole shipment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious to the two of them who was responsible for such a purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie says that there was no warning when they bought them though.\" piped in Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you saying that the warning label just appears in this world and disappears in ours? The hell's up with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanji had a point and all of this was starting to frustrate Yosuke to the point that he could feel a bit of a migraine coming on Wasn't there anyone that could help them sort things out?</span></div></div>",

Well, they are more like theories than anything else unless I can confirm them.  You see, back when the two worlds started merging, I think that the shadows may have attached themselves to pieces and portions of our world.  One thing, namely, those supplements.  Remember how shadows are supposed to be the embodiment of a desire?  Well, I figured that the supplements work normally in the real world, but when brought in here, they have the extra label as a manifestation of Rise and Chie-sempai's desires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that makes a little sense....\"  Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but.....that still doesn't explain why I'm this massive!  Those supplements shouldn't have been able to do that!\"  Rise pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my answer to that is we ARE in a TV world.  The laws of physics and the outside world may or may not be the same as in here.  This is why things on TV could jump further or do weird things that normally we wouldn't be able to do here.  So the 'cartoon' laws combined with Rise's desires AND the supplements are what caused you guys to grow as huge as you did. Though.....I didn't expect you're desires to be that......much.  Having that much muscle on your bodies is simply unneeded!  Yes a little is fine and healthy, but several tons of it?  I could only imagine as to how you two were able to move....:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww....it's not that bad....besides....I feel.....\"  Rise pumped her muscles up causing everyone to jump back a bit.  She flexed an enormous bicep that towered over her own massive body. \"....amazing!\" However, Naoto was right about one thing.  Rise found it very difficult to do simple tasks like walking or even turning her head.  There was so much muscle surrounding her head that it made it difficult for her to turn and when she did, all she saw was more of her own body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that may be, but I suppose since it only occurs here and there seems to be no other side effect....I don't think it's that big of a deal....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww don't be such a worry wort! I wanna get in the pool!\"  Rise said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder where Souji is?  I wanna show him my new body!  Rise thought to herself.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group decided to kick back and adjust to the two new girls, somebody or something was watching from the shadows.....</span></div></div>",

Yukiko warning her to be careful with her steps all the while riding on the muscle area near the blonde's tiny by comparison head. To be quite honest Yukiko wasn't sure if she was riding on a portion of shoulder or just the engorged mass Chie's lats had become...then again she tried not to think about it too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really you're the size of a baby elephant and the size of this place surprises you...\" Yosuke muttered under his breath with a bit of annoyance. The boy was certainly smart enough to know that he did not want to struck with one of Chie's kicks. Her punts were always dangerous and that was she was of average size as it was now he was afraid his body would instantly turn to dust!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shivered at the thought causing Kanji to ask why he'd be cold inside a resort? Yosuke merely sighed in response explaining that it was nothing to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later Rise at last got the chance to soak up some time in the resort's outdoor pool. The group of friends had split up shortly for the time being. Chie went off with Yukiko to the second pool on the other side of the building while the boys stayed else where stating that they were going to wait up for Souji and Teddie to show up. Rise's eyes nearly lid up when their \"leader's\" name was mentioned. She couldn't wait to show the boy the new her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case she allowed a moan of satisfaction to escape her tender lips as she relaxed into the pool area. Amazingly just like indoors this wonderful mass of water was somehow able to house even her grand size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah now this is the life! Wouldn't you agree Naoto-kun?\" she asked of the blunette girl who had chosen to stay with the towering redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would suppose so. That said I must still argue that allowing yourself to gain that much muscle mass was rather impulsive and reckless. I simply don't see the need for such an ungodly amount.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now much smaller girl stressed as she walked out covering herself over with a simple towel. Rise hadn't said a word about it but Naoto found it odd that she was able to find a towel big enough for her monstrous mass. After all towel nothing...it was more like a damn house carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective prince did have her suspicions about this place but for the moment pushed the thoughts aside for now she was more interested in conversing with Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't knock it till you try it.\" retorted Rise with a slight chuckle almost making the entire area shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no intention to, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Come on Naoto-kun I'm sure you'd nice with a bit more muscle on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-haired girl eyed her as if she had suddenly grown a second head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me like that. You're already pretty curvy adding just a sprinkle of muscle to that figure of yours and you'd be a love magnet for sure...not that you weren't already after all a pop idol knows when someone's sought after by her peers, men...and women alike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire pool area briefly shook as Rise laughed out loud at Naoto's sudden and very noticeable blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" *Cough* Please Rise I prefer if you refrain from speaking that way while in my presence.\" Naoto muttered the flush of emotion still clear on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh I'm sorry Naoto-kun. It is true though I think you'd look good with a little extra muscle. Not to mine or Chie-Sempai's though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would certainly hope not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-haired girl sighed for moment before she found a place she could squeeze into. It was true the pool was able to house Rise but at the same time it made it difficult for anyone else to find a spot to rest in. Speaking of the redhead Rise lost in her thoughts chuckled silently as she envisioned Naoto growing stronger and ever bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there was her own size to think about. Yes it was bit clubber some at times but she couldn't shake that little nagging thought in the back of her head that wondered what it would be like to be even bigger. She wondered was it crazy to think of an even more staggering size then she already was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Rise's shadow watched in wonder. Neither girl even aware of her nearby presence. She licked her lips with the options before her. On one hand there was Rise with her desires of continuing to grow bigger on the other there was Naoto. Going from her usual size to Rise's gigantic size would no doubt be fun to watch afterwards well who knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way the shadow was intent on pumping up someone... </span></div></div>",

It was so obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wish is my command Rise....hehe, you wanted to be the biggest idol on TV, well you're gonna get it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that thought, Shadow Rise focused her energy on the normal Rise, manipulating her desire and forcing her muscles to grow again even larger.  She still maintains her hourglass figure but her upper and lower bodies are growing even more.  Naturally Rise and the others start to notice and are shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise! You're growing!  What's happening?\"  Naoto cried as she backed away a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! I just started growing for some reason!\" Rise cried out as well.  She had to force herself to climb out of the pool but even that was getting difficult.  Yosuke and the others were watching in awe and horror at the growing idol as Shadow Rise watched from a far and continued pumping up her other self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise!  Stop this at once!  You're already huge already and don't need more muscle!\"  Yukiko tried to stop the redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not doing anything!  My body is growing on its own! Something else it seems like its controlling it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Rise's already immense body was growing larger.  Muscles piled on top of muscles causing them to bulge out in every which way possible.   As amazing as it was to watch her body seemingly grow to goddess like proportions, it was scary at the same time as the others had to back away more and more from the ever growing Rise.  In less than ten minutes, Rise had already increased her size by 50% and there was no sign of stopping.  Shadow Rise continued to force her muscles to grow ever larger, ever stronger.  The ever expanding sinew and skin was burning and painful for Rise.   Her body felt like it was on fire and her blood felt like lava.  She closed her eyes and gritted her teeth trying not to scream out.  She told herself to endure it as much as she can.  Part of her was telling her that she had to stop but there was that tiny portion of her that still wanted to get bigger, to push this to the limit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it stop PLEASE!!  I'm growing too big!\" Rise cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?  What do you want us to do?!\" Yosuke called back, not even sure Rise could hear him through all that muscle.  Her beautiful face was still visible but only just.  As her body continued to grow, her pecs and breasts continue to pump upwards almost obscuring her face.  In another few minutes Rise was approaching the size of large house and still there seemed no sign of her growth stopping.  The others continued to watch in horror as the idol became stronger and bulkier but at the same time more grotesque.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know....there is a way you can make this stop....\" said a voice.</span></div></div>",

Ah Rise-chan I really have to thank you for restoring me to glory and to repay you I'm giving you everything you wanted and so much more! You want to be big you want to be big then so be it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow cackled so disturbing pleased with her work.

Kanji confused with the sudden assault until Yosuke had pointed out the smashed in pavement curtsey of Rise's tank-powered punch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah but that's the thing my dear Kanji-kun Rise knows how this can stop but obviously she'll refuse...so to makes things easier for her to decide not only am I growing her into the largest idol ever but due to our connection I can control any part of her that I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow smiled as Rise could only watch in horror as her growing limbs began moving on their own completely against her will!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're no fun Sempai it was going to be so amusing to watch Rise here smash Kanji-kun into itty bitty pieces of confetti.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Bang*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow's boasting ended as she barely dodged the singular bullet that had cut through the air clearly aiming for her head. There was only one person that would attack in such a fashion and sure after a quick look around she spotted Naoto standing tall, properly dressed minus her usual jacket and hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective stared down the dark being with a unnerved look in her blue eyes pistol in hand and all but ready to fire another round straight at her. Unlike Kanji or even Yosuke the shadow knew she couldn't screw out with Naoto the girl was too brilliant for her to get careless. Still Rise was still growing, now having fully passed the size of a large luxurious home, thus was still her wonderful ace in the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice shot Naoto-kun but what if you hadn't missed and struck me down? Would Rise here continue to grow till she filled up this entire dimension with more of herself? You think about that while you aim for your next shot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes narrowed Naoto refused to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I hope you don't forget what I just told the boys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-kun please move!\" cried Rise tears in her eyes at what her shadow was forcing her to do to one of her closest friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly caught off guard Naoto gasped for a moment as Rise's fist was mere moments from crashing down upon her!</span></div></div>",

She could feel inside her the hidden away desire Rise possessed of possibly making herself even larger. Crafting Rise into even more of an overly muscle-bound abomination was all but a sure thing but the question was should she do so now or hold off...after all there was wondrous Naoto-kun to think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say it again, Naoto-kun, you would look good with some added muscle on you. Trust me I know a little thing about the subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathing redhead chuckled as she popped off a quick bicep flex, smiling widely it shot out further and further into the air, Rise having to take a moment to control herself from really pushing the boundaries of how far she could push just that one portion of her goddess-like frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may be so blunt, there is nothing little about what you just went ahead with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto mentioned stuttering through her words a tad, honestly Rise's happily open nature at times got to the young detective and more often then not left her in either a shocked or highly embarrassed state sometimes both. She coughed for moment to control her body temperature from showcasing the blush from before. For the last thing needed was Rise bringing down the entire place because she started laughing again at the smaller girl's emotional display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still not hearing a no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic redhead stated in her usual teasing nature causing the blue-haired girl to simply sigh in possible defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You honestly are not going to let this go, are you? Or at least not until I agree to your wild idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Naoto-kun, I'm not asking for much. You can just take a single supplement and I know you're curious about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did have a point the young detective was rather intrigue with the, at first glance, health supplements that had transformed two of her dear friends into over pumped muscled parodies of themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Note that while I disapprove of this but because of the bond of friendship we share with one another I will help myself to one of the supplements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a singular one however.\" she stressed after she overheard, and in ways felt, Rise's joyful reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Rise's shadow smiled it seemed that her decision had been made. There was still plenty of time to further pump up Rise but for now she'd focus on the detective prince captivated with the idea of watching Naoto grow to potentially match the already enormous redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that said she quietly slipped away moments before Naoto excused herself from the pool area. Inside the shadow found the supply of supplements sitting at top of a simple coffee table, the detective's clothing sitting on the nearby couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she still had some time to herself the shadow smiled in wicked fashion twirling a single finger tainting the pills to her dark desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes just have but one, Naoto-kun, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.\" she muttered to herself fading away just as the young woman entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of the shadow's tampering Naoto made her way over to the jar housing the supplements afterwards she dropped a singular tablet into her awaiting hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom an unknown location the shadow watched in silence, smiling as the gold that made up her eyes shined in anticipation of what was to come.</span></div></div>",

She remembered Seta well. He was the centerpiece of the group that made up Inaba's persona-users, he was their leader, their partner, and friend. A brave and courageous individual with apparently tremendous power due to the links he had forged with not only his closest of friends of many of the town's folk in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe admired that Souji had a strength of heart she could only hope to have one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the opposite end he too was rather surprised to see the lady android with his circle of friends! It had been some time since he, or any of them for that matter, had last seen her so her reappearance while surprising was also a welcome sight.

Although I hate to cut our chat short I think there's something you should see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed over in the direction of Rise and Chie and their monstrous muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair he had spotted the two of them even before catching sight of Labrys.

If they were home she'd no doubt be the biggest thing to walk the planet since the dinosaurs died out.

Chie-chan...is that really the two of you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly it was a tad bit difficult for Chie to make out the bear's rotund form, she couldn't imagine how it was for Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teddie?\" called out the redhead accidentally swallowing the bear in her enormous shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...what happened to you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either could answer a thought suddenly accrued to the nervous bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it was those pills wasn't it! I told you Rise-chan not to take them! They're dangerous and now Chie-chan's also so huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well they do a body good don't they.\" stated Rise with a sheepish grin on her buried away face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait hold up you know about the supplements Teddie? How?\" Chie couldn't help but go with the feeling that maybe just maybe the bear could help piece everything together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Rise-chan had them with her yesterday when I ran into her and I tried to tell her that there was a warning of taking them while in this world...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait hold up again, what warning are you talking about?

What on earth was going on here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I may be helpful in answering some of your questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly Teddie didn't seem well surprised at the newcomer.

There were so many supplements Rise only took a few and look at her now she imagined what it would take to reach that level of muscle Rise had mentioned...then again what if she took every last pill...a living mountain a goddess...her mind instantly shutting down at the concept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cheeky smiled crossed her lips, her pride and intrigue in full overdrive, screwed being the strongest of the girls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next few moments Chie found herself stuffing her face full of supplements, her cheeks nearly inflating to match those of chipmunks.

As even the simplest of steps were now adding strength to her form!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta get bigger...gotta get stronger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grunts being overshadowed by the sound of the weights being used to pump her muscles further. With each completed rep she could feel her body stretch outward pounds being added every few seconds. However even as she pressed nearly a ton, split in between her pulsing arms and legs, things were becoming too easy for her, she wanted more, needed more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breathing intensified, again unaware that even that was causing her to surge in growth, Chie slapped on more and more weight..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAAAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yelled as she continued to pump and grow as she pressed a combined five tons, it was nothing to her and she could only smile as her body began to resemble more of a flesh balloon then that of a teenage girl, a teenage girl who was becoming obsessed with the idea of being the biggest, strongest, most muscular being on the planet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarger still she grew another forty-five minutes having passed, nearing twelve tons she didn't even care that the workout bench had given out long ago. Officially on the floor now she continued to pump away as her growth truly began to shine, already several times wider then she was taller which said something considering that her height as well inched higher but not at the same speed as her muscle girth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty tons and nothing was going to hold her back, not even wondering where all the weights were appearing from. She didn't really care what Rise was doing at this moment maybe she was working out maybe she wasn't and had gone home it didn't matter to her all that mattered to her as she clenched her teeth, her still normal-sized face surrounded by a cavern of muscle, was to continued to pump away and expand herself into unsurpassed levels!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out however Rise hadn't made for home yet instead the pop idol after admiring her strong form had decided to give herself a bit of a workout. Clearly bigger then before, but not to the incredible lengths of the other day, the redhead began to wonder and worry about her friend's whereabouts. It wasn't like her to just up and wander off like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she spotted an interesting set of clues, the blonde's signature jacket and an empty jar of supplements! Both items clearly leading to a weight room in the far back of the building taking them into her hands Rise made her way on over to the doorway several thoughts running through her mind as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that where Chie was? Did she actually take all the pills? No that would be crazy didn't her friend listen to her when she told her about how massive she had become!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearing the door Rise instinctively paused when she overheard what sounded like a power-born grunt, the tone sounding eery similar to that of her friend. To her surprise attempting to open the door was meant with startling resistance it was jammed for whatever reason as if something was pushing against it doing a fantastic job of keeping it in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her new strength she was about to attempt at knocking it to one side when she heard another much louder grunt followed by an even bigger surprise in the building beginning to shake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was beginning to get a strong sense of deja-vu and the empty jar in her arms wasn't helping in settling her nerves...still she had to get in there for Chie's sake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo putting some space between her and the door she gathered herself determined to bust it down and enter the room where she suspected Chie was, especially if her thoughts were on point with what was occurring in there...</span></div></div>",

A part of Chie actually surprised Rise's breasts had grown a few inches, that was a nice side-effect she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise meanwhile showed off a nice double bicep pose, and they were indeed a nice pair of \"guns\" in Chie's mind...might even be stronger then Kanji now...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case Chie was partially convinced about Rise's tale from her experience the other day but still wished to see more.

I mean you're probably going to need it after you're done or you know you can take some to get rid of any thirst you might have right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet again the redhead agreed still completely unaware of the blonde's plan of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Chie excused herself Rise went off to get ready for her upcoming workout.

Like I'm taking crazy-huge then I come back home and I'm myself again. I don't even feel any stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto pondered on every thing she had learned from Rise for a moment until she broke out of her thoughts and requested that she borrow the supplements with her genius and connections perhaps she could find out exactly what the cause for such absurdity.</span></div></div>",

Sure, if Naoto still wanted to examine them herself, Rise could still let her borrow the supplements but why not have a little fun with it? Plus, maybe she could get Naoto to have some and grow too! Just the thought of her friend growing alongside her made Rise blush a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a better idea, Naoto. While I trust that you believe me on this, this still sounds crazy to you, doesn't it? The why don't we go to the TV world tomorrow and let me show just how strong these supplements really are?

Just... make sure you won't overdo it tomorrow, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\" replied Rise, although her true intentions were to give Naoto a big show that she wouldn't forget! She was an idol after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter settling on a time that they could both be at the TV world tomorrow, the two went their separate ways from the food court. Rise decided that her supplement supply was waning a bit so before leaving the store, she went to the pharmancy section where sure enough, the bottles of supplements were still available. Good thing Naoto didn't ask where I bought these, the idol thought as she looked at the bottles, wondering how many she should buy for tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

Changing into a set of sports wear, she had picked up as well the day before, Rise filled her bag with the supplement containers. The large bag masking just how many bottles she was taking with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't overdo it, she said...\" Rise muttered to herself with a slight chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oomph\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol grunted for a moment underestimating the weight of her bag, silently wishing she had her massive muscles back. Well she'd have to make due and hope this doesn't make her run late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for the idol that wouldn't be the case in fact Rise would be surprised that one) Naoto would be the to apologize for arriving earlier then agreed upon and two) the gym had been completely repaired! She remembered demolishing it beyond repair...yet here it was untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting how the building has been reformed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto mentioned as if reading her thoughts, Rise agreeing with a soft laugh a bead of sweat riding down the side of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something to focus on later. For now lets simply focus on the supplements and the effects it had on your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right well like I said I took the pills worked out some the boom I'm a super muscular idol!\" Rise stated as she reached into her bag and pulled out a bottle. To Naoto's surprise Rise began to down a good deal of the supplements and was just about to voice her concern when the idol mentioned that she had taken this much yesterday and would have to do the same today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense even if the detective couldn't shake the worry she had for her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay time to pump up!\" Rise said with a cheer as she started up her workout, Naoto focusing intently on Rise.</span></div></div>",

Being a performer, she was never one to start a show off small and build it up for her audience. No, the only way she liked to put on a show was from big to bigger! For her, the same idea applied here. As big as she was yesterday, Rise knew she had to step it up a notch for Naoto and her own sake. Sure, she still had way more supplements for the grand finale, but she wasn't going to start off as \"small\" as she was yesterday. With that in mind, Rise raised the intensity of her workout, her goal giving her tunnel vision as she kept on lifting and piling mass. Fortunately, her body reacted to this, making even more efficient use of the supplements she already digested as her growth speed increased. Meanwhile, Naoto was watching this unfold as the idol's body kept growing and growing. Watching her friend grow bigger and bigger, she finally understood what Rise meant when she was talking about how the supplements affected her. However, the detective still had some questions about the supplements. Who made these? Why do they only work like this in the TV world? Are there any side effects? These were only a few questions that crossed her mind. Still, maybe it was watching this unfold in front of her eyes that clouded her judgement a bit, but the detective started to blush a bit while watching Rise get bigger. Additionally, she also felt a bit of... envy? No, she thought to herself, why would I want to grow too? We still don't know if they're safe or not. The detective pushed those thoughts back as she continued to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost halfway through her workout, the idol had already reached yesterday's size, but she failed to notice, still focusing on pushing herself more and more. She could feel her muscles growing and gaining pleasure from her body's reaction to the growth, but that wasn't enough for her. More!, she thought, to herself as she changed to heavier weights, I need to push myself more than this. Her body kept responding to her wishes, her legs surpassing the width of tires, her breasts growing past beanbag chairs, her body stretching wider and taller as more mass piled on her frame.</span></div></div>",

Since her return Rise had taken great measures for her fans to become fans of the real her, not the \u201cpersona\u201d made up by her agency, for the most part she had been successful. The people seem to enjoy seeing the more honest and open-minded Risette rather then the one that would slap her name anywhere like a cooperate whore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was caught in a bit of a pickle her fans were assuming that she was as fit as she was in those shots. She recalled being furious at the doctored images and demanding that no one outside of her people see them unfortunately it was too late and the shoot had already been shown to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had stormed out that day before giving her long-running boyfriend Souji Seta a call, the boy listened in as she vented and offers as much good advice as he could ultimately stating that perhaps she should look into working out. Rise while taking it too heart unfortunately had no time to do so, ironically working as hard as she had to rebuild a new image was destroying her own body resulting in her being as thin as she was. She wasn\u2019t even sure if she was pushing over a hundred anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that\u2019s when she gave Chie a call, the two spoke for a while and the blonde decided she\u2019d help her pop idol friend in any way she could eventually giving her the special supplement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here she sat with it in her hands and truth be told she was a bit scared of trying it out on her own. There was a warning that the product was potentially strong and those with health problems should avoid using it. She knew she was physically fine yet that didn\u2019t calm her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess it was best to take up Chie\u2019s offer and share a glass together\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next school day came and went eventually reaching lunch time heading up to the roof Rise was lucky enough to catch Chie munching away at her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl gave her a friendly wave and greeting as she walked over taking a seat beside the jacket-wearing tomboy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie asked how things were when she could see the nervousness in Rise\u2019s eyes. The redhead responding that things were pretty crappy and she had yet to try out the supplement when asked why she responded saying she was frightened to do so alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie gave a pat on the back and a reassuring smile before stating that her offer was still up about trying it out with her. Rise explained that was the whole reason she had come to see her. Of course Chie gladly agreed if it meant to help her friend in her time of need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll try it out after-school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat come over to my place, okay Sempai.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie agreed with a firm nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the day after the school day had ended Chie went with Rise over to her home, which doubled as her grandmother\u2019s place of business. Heading upstairs to her own room Rise welcomed Chie inside pointing out where she kept the supplement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie took a moment to read over the directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake two teaspoons with bottle of water every twelve hours. Do not exceed required amount nor reduce required time-span stated on product. Results will fully appear within six to eight weeks time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise nearly fainted at the last part. She didn\u2019t have that kind of time. The issue was to be released next month, which was about two and a half weeks away. Obviously she\u2019d have to do heavy promotion for it and no way could she show herself looking nothing like in the photo shoot. Her fans the media would think she was reverting to the Risette of old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed faster results now or at least in time for the issue\u2019s release and the promotion that followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly explained her dilemma to Chie the blonde pondering for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure it was risky as hell to go against the directions but Rise NEEDED help. No maybe they should first try it out the normal way before jumping the gun...</span></div></div>",

Her shoulders broadened to allow her back muscles to tighten, tearing the back of her uniform to expose her muscular back. Chie watched her friend grow in front of her eyes, not paying attention that her legs were growing to be just as thick as Rise's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girl's continued to grow bigger and bigger muscles until two very large female bodybuilders were laying on the floor, the remains of their clothes hanging from their arms, breasts, and waist. Their torn clothes barely covered their huge breasts or rears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends...</span></div></div>",

She is going to freak!\" Chie mentioned as the idol finally got to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um that's great Sempai but you might want to take one of these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie paused for a moment as the red head handed over a spare apron she had lying around. Rise was right the two of them were so much bigger they had practically grown right out of their clothing and while the apron didn't cover completely it would have to do until she got around buying some new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanking her fellow muscled up friend Chie slapped on the apron around her thicker waist before heading for the door. She seemed so excited about her new muscles, Rise wished she could say the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that she hated them far from it actually she felt strong far more empowered then she could ever recall, excluding the use of her persona, but what worried the young woman was the fact that she had ended up much larger then even her doctored photos portrayed her to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure what to do if she showed up to the photo shoot the way she was the idol was sure she'd be accused of using a steroid-like substance to juice herself with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worry nearly caused even someone as big as her to fall to her knees and weep her eyes out. She really needed someone to talk so grabbing her phone she speed-dialed a friend of hers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...so you and Chie-Sempai took this supplement to improve your muscle mass. Except you ended up overdoing so in the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto Shirogane, the detective prince, mentioned as she noticed Rise's much larger size. The idol explained that she was desperate there was no way she'd meet the deadline without going a bit overboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that Rise-san but what you did was completely reckless. In a way you and sempai are lucky all that occurred was your muscles swelling many times over the effects could have been much worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto instantly regretted her words as she noticed the idol's expression worsen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-san...I'm sorry it's not that I don't understand I am your friend so I do but you really should have thought things through first. However you stated that you did all this for a fitness shoot did you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise wasn't sure what Naoto was getting at but she nodded nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah but it was more of a stunning swimsuit size not something like this.\" Rise emphasized her point by flexing her power-upped biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't you make it about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What do you mean? A fitness...idol? A bodybuilding idol...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded so absurd yet was far from the craziest thing the young woman had experienced in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was crazy what would her agency think what would her fans and the general populace think? Yet the more she thought about the more curious she was about actually going through with the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-kun you might be on to something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-san all I'm saying is that you should do what makes you happy. I'm sure if he were here right now he'd say the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both knew who the smaller girl was speaking of and Naoto was right she was done worrying about the shoot and instead was going to turn it on it's head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Naoto-kun, and Risette is going to make history as the first bodybuilding pop idol!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto gasped as she suddenly found herself caught in the much bigger girl's grasp Rise hugging her tightly not to mention incredibly close to her larger chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she was released the two embarrassed, Naoto looking away to one side while Rise mildly chuckled, at the quick token of affection.</span></div></div>",

Now all that's left is to shake my hand to show your acceptance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise's shadow stretched her hand towards Rise. Rise looked somewhat hesitantly at her shadow's outstretched hand, as if reconsidering. No, she thought. I already agreed, beside if anything goes wrong, my friends and I will find a way to fix it. Rise slowly opened her palm as her hand moved towards her shadow's. She grabbed her shadow's hand and shook it, the dark aura from it spreading onto Rise's hand. Her shadow formed a cat-like smile as her last words were:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun with your new power!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shadow then turned into a black mist, spreading all over Rise's body. Rise quickly thought that this was a mistake and that her shadow was going to do something horrible to her until the black mist around her body was absorbed into her skin. After checking out her body to see if anything had changed, which to Rise's relief had not, Rise thought about the extent of what she had just agreed on before remembering that her friends had moved on without her. Still on alert for any signs of change with her body, Rise ran after her friends.</span></div></div>",

My answer is no, plain and simple.\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that's a shame, seems as though you have more restraint than I thought,\" her Shadow said, \"but I'll be back with my offer soon, and by then, I'm sure that it will seem more... appealing to you. Until then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Shadow Rise's body started to shimmer with a dark aura and disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need you! I can become stronger without you!\" Rise shouted to the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise didn't think that her Shadow would irritate her so much, but then again, it was a part of her so it knew what buttons to push, so to speak. Rise still couldn't shake off that urge to become more powerful that she felt after hearing her Shadow's offer. It's fine, she thought, I can go meet up with Chie later and start planning workouts with her to become stronger, I don't need my Shadow's tricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of her friends, Rise hadn't realized how far the gap had grown between her and the rest of them and started into a sprint to regroup with them. Little did she know, her Shadow had only teleported a short distance away and was observing her behind cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, she thinks she doesn't need me to be stronger, how cute. I'll make her see the error of her ways. First, I'll need to show her how much she really wants power. Then, I'll show her how powerless she really is in her current state to protect her precious friends. By then, she'll be so desperate that she'll take the offer without a second thought. But how?\" The shadow thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mischievous grin appeared on Shadow Rise's face as she got an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's up for a little competition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sprinting uphill for what seemed like hours, Rise finally caught a glimpse of her friends. Rise stopped to catch her breath before realizing that her friends were looking at something. After her legs stopped feeling like they were burning, she walked over to their vantage point see what had caught the stares of her friends. Rise saw an enormous building that appeared to be twice the size of their school, Yasogami High!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, where did this come from?\" said Yosuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" said Teddie, \"All this time in the TV world and I've never seen this place! What do you guys think, should we investigate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm down to explore! Who else wants to join?\" said Kanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke, Chie, Yukiko, Teddie and Rise's heads all nodded to answer his question. Naoto, however, was uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like everyone but you wants to check out the place, Sempai. How come you don't want to?\" said Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I will admit that I am curious to investigate the area, you should all know by now that everything this world creates always has some sort of danger or mystery attached to it. As long as everyone's guard is kept up, I will join.\" said Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! C'mon guys, let's go!\" Chie shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the group moved down from their vantage point and raced towards the building. Once they reached the entrance to the building, a small metal door, they could better examine the building's exterior. It looked very plain and unremarkable, almost harmless, but heeding Naoto's advice, they slowly opened the door, preparing themselves for any trouble awaiting them...</span></div></div>",

The group squinted their eyes as the light was too bright. After it had dimmed down to manageable levels, everyone opened their eyes and were surprised at what they saw. The entire building was just one room, a massive stage taking up the majority of the space! The rectangular wooden stage was truly big, the floor of it being the size of a football field! Behind the stage was a crimson red curtain, completely covering what Rise assumed would be a backstage. Rise then looked up at the ceiling, gasping as she could not see where it ended. All she could see was light coming out from them, so there had to be an end. Rise wondered how this could be before remembering that in the TV world, not all rules of the real world apply. Besides the stage, there was what appeared to be a small judge's table and rows and rows of seats behind the table facing the front of the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, is this it?\" said Teddie, \"I thought there would be something cooler in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what I said, guys.

The group got on stage and met with her halfway across the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Marie, how have you been?\" said Yosuke, \"We haven't seen you in awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I've been fine, thanks. Is Yu with you guys or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was the first to reply, \"How come you want to see him so badly, Marie?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise and Marie were always bickering over Yu seeing as both had feelings for the silver haired boy. Whenever Rise heard Marie talking about him, it would immediately set her off. However, Rise was surprised when Marie replied: \"Oh, I was just wondering, no need to get angry, Rise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was confused. Marie was being nicer to her than usual, and it was strange considering how cold she could be at times. Something seemed odd to her. Wanting to change the subject of the conversation, Yosuke spoke up and said, \"Anyways, what is this place, Marie? Do you know anything about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh yeah, this place just appeared a couple of weeks ago. I've checked the area thoroughly and there doesn't seem to be any danger. Afterwards, I was approached by someone to host a competition here. They supplied all the items that were needed for it: props, outfits and prizes too! Too bad there's only been a couple of sign-ups. We need a few more people to enter...\" Marie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do recall you bringing up a competition at the start of your conversation. So just what type of competition is it? And who is this person that supplied you?\" said Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a ladies swimsuit contest! First Prize gets 12 0000 yen! (Authors Note: This is equivalent to around $1 000 USD... ish, I needed a big number with lots of zeros, just roll with it) As for the supplier, I was told that they want to keep it a secret until the competition, where they will reveal themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA swimsuit competition, Rise thought, wow, we should join! Meanwhile, Teddie started to snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's just like the time when Yosuke signed up the girls for the Beauty Pageant at school and I got to add a swimsuit contest as one of the events! Man, that was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Teddie could go further, Chie had kicked the small bear right in the face, sending him flying off the stage. As the bear recovered and was about to ask why he deserved that, he saw the death glares coming from Chie and Naoto, both who hated recalling that embarrassing event, before closing his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko spoke up, \"Why don't we enter the competition, girls? We could help Marie by keeping the competition on and unlike the last time, there's also a big cash prize if one of us wins! Even if we don't win, it'll still be kinda fun. Plus, it'll be our choice if we want to join, not the boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Yosuke, Teddie, and Kanji all supported Yukiko's offer that the girls join, mostly because they wanted to see the girls in swimsuits again. Rise was on board with the idea, not for Marie's sake, but just for having fun with her girlfriends. Chie also agreed not only for her friends, but if she were to win, she could use the money for buying food, especially her favourite meat dishes. However, Naoto was a different case. Sure, after facing her Shadow, she had become more comfortable with her gender, but she didn't like revealing so much bare skin out in the open, especially with an audience. That was the reason she ditched the swimsuit portion of the Yasogami High Beauty Pageant. Then again, it would help Marie, her friends were also joining so she would not be alone on stage and the money was a good incentive. If she managed to win, she could donate it all to the Police Department to help with future situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking about the pros and cons, Naoto finally made her decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She decided that she do it to help a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I will join as well alongside you all.\" said Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Naoto's joining in! I'm proud of you, Sempai.\" said Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright red blush appeared on Naoto's face. \"This is not a result of me wanting to do this for myself. This is just to help Marie, nothing else!\" Noato replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, everyone was pretty happy, especially the guys. In particular, Kanji, while playing it cool and acting like he was fine with whichever choice Naoto made, he couldn't wait to see the detective in a swimsuit. His nose started to bleed just by the thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks everyone, it seems like the show can go on!\" said Marie, \"I'll make sure you guys get signed in. The competition starts tomorrow at noon. Make sure the competitors get here an hour earlier at 11:00 am so we can get them set up and changed as we provide the swimsuits. See you all there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Marie said her goodbyes to the group and headed backstage, moving behind the red curtain. Soon afterwards, the group left the building and headed towards the entrance to the TV world since it was getting late. Rise still had a nagging feeling in the back of her head that something wasn't right. Marie seemed too nice to her and she didn't believe that it was because she had changed. She asked the others if they picked up anything strange from the encounter, but none of them seemed to notice anything out of the ordinary from it. Rise left the topic soon after as she didn't want to worry her friends. Once the group got back to the real world, they went their separate ways and headed home, all but Rise. She still couldn't believe that Marie would act like that, but maybe it was just her being  paranoid.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thinking over the day's events, Rise decided that maybe she was just being a little paranoid. A lot did happen today, thought Rise, thinking of her and her Shadow's conversation earlier, so maybe it was just me being on edge. Besides, everyone else thought everything was alright, even Naoto! If something was amiss, the ace detective would usually be the first to know about it. Maybe all this paranoia will come off of me with a good night's sleep, she thought. With that, Rise headed home to rest up. Tomorrow was going to be a big day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting a good night's sleep and waking up bright and early, Rise got herself ready and planned to meet with the other girls at Junes so they could enter the TV world together for the competition. By the time the girls had met with each other and got to Junes, it was already 10:30 am, so they needed to get a move on! Entering the TV world, the girls went over to the building. Coming through the entrance, they were greeted by Marie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, you're right on time! That's great! Why don't you guys go backstage and get changed? Our supplier gave us a big selection of swimsuits to wear so you can pick whichever you like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was starting to get suspicious again. Forget Marie's behaviour towards her, Rise never saw Marie being so nice or polite to anyone like this before! After going backstage with her friends, once again she asked if any of them noticed anything strange about Marie but again to Rise's surprise, none of them detected anything. Rise wondered why she was the only one worrying about this. It were as if all her friends senses' were dulled... No, that's crazy, she thought, For now, I'll just worry about the competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading backstage, Rise saw that Marie was not lying when she said that there were a lot of swimsuits. There were what seemed like hundreds upon hundreds of swimsuits of all different shapes, colours and styles. It was almost like a store just dedicated to them! Besides that, the only other thing backstage was a couple of dressing rooms to get changed. Rise wondered what type of person this supplier was to afford all of this, and why? She was pretty sure all these swimsuits together would cost more than the grand prize, so why was this supplier giving so much into the props and clothes instead of the prizes? Again, it seemed like Rise was alone in wondering about these questions as her friends did not seem to notice. Just something else to figure out after the show, thought Rise. After picking an orange two - piece swimsuit, Rise went into one of the changing rooms and changed outfits. After coming out, Rise noticed that all her other friends were still choosing. Marie came backstage and told them that she could help the rest of the girls with picking and changing in their swimsuits. Finally, after everyone had changed, Rise went over to talk with the girls and see what they choose. Chie was wearing a yellow and green two - piece swimsuit while Yukiko was wearing a similar swimsuit except that the colour was pink and white and her swimsuit's bottom had small red ruffles attached to it's waistband in addition. Naoto's choice was a bit different. Seeing as she wanted to show as little skin as possible, she opted for a deep blue school swimsuit which only revealed her head, neck, arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you guys all look great!\" said Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Rise! You look awesome as well!\" said Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure it's not revealing too much?\" asked Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko giggled, almost going into one of her laughing fits. \"I think you're fine, Naoto. You look so cute in that swimsuit!\" she replied after calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red blush could be seen on Naoto's face as the rest of girls started to laugh. Afterwards, Chie spoke up, \"Well, it's almost time then! Best of luck to you all, but I'm not going to hold back just cause you're my friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, same here!\" said Rise,  \"Wait a second, that reminds me! Weren't there supposed to be other contestants besides us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Marie told us that yesterday!\" said Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although we weren't given a specified number, we can assume there is at least one other contestant based on Marie's info. The question remains as to who it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was curious as to the other contestant was when a voice rang out from behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon ladies, the competition starts in a couple of minutes. Let's get set up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie pointed the girls to the corner of the curtain where they would see the front of the stage. Before getting into position, Rise asked Marie, \"Hey Marie, where's the last contestant in this competition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems as though she is a bit late in coming over, but she has communicated with me and said that she will be here once the competition starts and be already dressed for the contest! There's no need to worry, Rise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, thanks Marie.\" was all Rise replied back before getting into her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything that Marie said to her felt unnerving to her for some reason, and Rise thought she saw her smiling as she was walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rise was starting to have second thoughts on her choice to join the competition. It's too late now, she thought, hopefully once this is over, I'll be able to calm down. Rise shook her head and pushed those thoughts away, putting a smile on as the contestants were called to stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the first ever TV World Swimsuit Competition!\" Marie exclaimed to the audience, \"Here are our lovely competitors!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise and her friends walked on stage one by one, with Rise holding up the rear of the group. As she came out from behind the curtains, she looked at the set that had been placed in front of the curtain for the competition. It depicted a summer day at the beach, with sand and a contained pool of water in front of a well-crafted background of the sky with a prop sun hanging on top of the backdrop. The background seemed to stretch and cover a good portion of the curtain. While Marie continued to give the audience the basic introduction, Rise looked and saw that the room was packed. Amidst the crowd, she saw Teddie, Kanji and Yosuke close to the front row seats. They seemed quite excited and she could already see Kanji wiping off the blood on his face coming from his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore looking away from the audience, Rise noticed that besides her friends in the seats, everyone in the audience and even the judges looked odd. Rise couldn't quite find the right words to describe it but it looked like they were all... fuzzy? Rise tried to whisper to her friends if they saw anything before taking a good at her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part, it was as she expected. Chie and Yukiko looked like they were doing fine, Yukiko looking a little shy while Naoto was quite embarrassed to be on stage and looked as if she was going to try to run away like last time. However, though all that, Rise noticed that all her friends looked a little... spaced out. Now that she thought about it, all her friends had the same type of look yesterday when they were talking to Marie on the stage. Rise was about to whisper and ask them if they felt alright until she heard Marie finish her intro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While it seems as though our fifth competitor is not going to make it, the show must go on! Let the competition...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"BEGIN!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie finished her statement and moved to the side of the stage as she let the girls take the spotlight. \"Time for Phase 1. Here's where the real fun begins...\" she muttered under her breath with a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocus on the competition, Rise thought as she started doing poses to impress the judges. As see looked over to her friends to see how they were doing, she stopped moving as she saw all of them clutching their stomachs, sweat forming on their faces as they looked like they were in immense pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Rise asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, my body... ugh...\" Chie responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hurts all over...\" said Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something feels odd...\" said Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise went over to try to help her friends when she noticed something happening. Didn't Yukiko's biecep seem a little... bigger? And Chie's legs never looked that big. Also, were Naoto's boobs... getting bigger!? Rise watched as her friends started to get up as their pain had gone away. In doing so, Rise noticed that they were all bit taller too. Why were her friends all growing so big, tall and busty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to us? Why are we growing?\" said Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but I kinda like it.\" Chie exclaimed while flexing her left bicep as she watched it grow bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, shouldn't we get off stage?\" Noato said, her face a new shade of red as she noticed all the looks from the audience they were gaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise continued to watch as her friends grow until their growth stopped after a couple of minutes. The three girls were huge! All of them were sporting muscles as big as a heavyweight male bodybuilder, if not even bigger! Additionally, all of them had grown quite tall, with Rise's full height only reaching up to their chests, which had also grown in size to profound levels, Naoto's being the largest of the three because she already had the biggest bust of all the girls to begin with! The fact that their swimsuits had grown along with them was quite odd, but considering that these swimsuits had been created in the TV world and didn't follow the rules of the real world, much like the ceiling of the building which Rise had noted the day prior, maybe it wasn't so odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rise was confused about what had happened and somewhat worried about her friends' safety, she couldn't help but feel a little jealous and left out. While see didn't know if there were any side effects to the growth of her friends, she knew that she would probably have liking growing with them too. She wanted to like what it would be like to be stronger and have a little more power. Now the gap of strength between her and her friends had grown even bigger, and Rise wasn't sure how she could catch up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Rise, if you want power, you could always take my offer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise and her friends on stage looked around to see where that sinister voice had come from before tracing it to Marie. Rise finally understood what this was and why \"Marie\" wasn't acting like Marie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! You're...!\" Rise shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh! Took you long enough to figure it out! I guess that's why Naoto's the brains of the group.\" said \"Marie\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marie\" walked towards the center of the stage, her eyes changing to gold while dark mist brewed around her form. By the time \"Marie\" had gotten to the center, the dark aura had dissipated, revealing Shadow Rise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I'm out of that disguise! I much prefer my original form!\" she said, \"I'm surprised, Rise! I thought you would know that I was faking it! I even went out of character to see how you would react!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you manage to trick my friends!? If I noticed, I'm sure my friends would have also noticed too!\" said Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you did notice? Looks like there's hope for you yet. Well, the answer to your question is above you!\" said Shadow Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise, Chie, Yukiko and Naoto looked up to the ceiling and saw nothing but... the light!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you used your powers on the light to make it so that we would lose our guard and dull our senses whenever it shined on us, am I correct in assuming this?\" said Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so quick to comphrend, Naoto. I guess your title of \"ace detective\" really is fitting, unlike your clothes, it seems!\" said Shadow Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was true since although the materials the swimsuits were made from was extremely durable and stretchy, it still looked quite tight on each of the girls who had grown. Shadow Rise snickered as she watched Naoto go from her cool attitude to embarrassment again, then switch to a hint of anger at the Shadow for the remark before she could regain control of her emotions again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the light's power was only made to affect everyone but Rise, since I wanted to watch her squirm at \"Marie\"'s attitude and try to figure things out, it was delightful! However, now that you all are aware of the effect of the light, it will no longer work as it only works on those who are unaware that it is being used on them. No matter though, this is all going according to plan.\" said Shadow Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this plan of yours involving making us bigger? How'd you even do it!?\" said Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was quite easy to do! Once I made this building with my power and posed as Marie to get you all in the competition, it was only a matter of growing your friends. I was able to get close enough to each of your friends and put my power on them by helping them pick and change into their swimsuits as \"Marie\". Now even as we speak, power is building up inside you three and I'm the one who decides to either release it in your bodies, let it build or disappear! This entire competition was my trap for you all, especially Rise! I wanted her to feel jealous and weak by making her friends much stronger than she was, that way she would take the generous offer I gave her of becoming the biggest, strongest and most beautiful idol in history!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise, is this true?\" asked Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is. Yesterday while I was separated from you guys, my Shadow came to me with the offer, but I refused and she said she would be back. I didn't think much of it then, I'm sorry for not telling you guys but I didn't want to worry you all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Rise. We're all your friends after all. We'll figure this out together.\" said Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but first, we gotta take care of your Shadow!\" said Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise felt relived. Even in this strange situation, her friends still had her back. Although part of her definitely wished she had a body like her friends, there was no way that she would give in to her Shadow's demands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, well isn't this sweet. Why don't you all kiss and make up, too.\" Shadow Rise said, making a face like she was about to hurl, \"It seems that you're forgetting that I still have power over your three friends, Rise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was suddenly aware that her friends were starting to bend down in pain like before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even while we were having this little chat, my power was building higher and higher inside your friends' bodies.\" Shadow Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change them back, you monster!\" said Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Rise, but this power only makes things grow, not shrink.\" her Shadow replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all of this was going on, Teddie, Kanji and Yosuke were still in the audience, dumbfounded looks on their faces as they heard the entire conversation. When the three girls had started to grow, Teddie and Yosuke had to try to wake Kanji after he passed out when he saw Naoto's rack, as they grew to the size of two watermelons! After he woke up and cleaned off the geyser of blood from his nose, the three boys had listened in on the conversation between Rise's shadow and the girls. Although they were still at a loss of words, once they saw Yukiko, Naoto and Chie bending down in pain again, they knew they had to act. Running towards the stage, Yosuke screamed out,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You crazy bitch! We won't let you hurt our friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but no riffraff is allowed on stage. Get them!\" said Shadow Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the entire audience and the three judges had changed into dark Shadows, all controlled by Shadow Rise. That's why they looked so odd!, Rise thought to herself. The boys (and bear) had been surrounded and started to call on their Personas. Meanwhile, her shadow was thinking about how to proceed with her plan. Those guys are strong, she thought, my minions will fail to stop them, but they will distract them long enough for my plan to work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, let's get this show on the road, shall we? Looks like it's going to be a big one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow Rise used her power to release all the energy stored up inside each of the girls bodies. Rise could only watch as the three girls started to grow again while the guys were busy mowing down her Shadow's minions...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rise was frozen in place. As Shadow Rise continued to make the girls grow, Rise's thoughts were a mess. Here she was again, watching as her friends were in trouble and she still couldn't do anything to help. The boys were still occupied with her shadow's minions, slowly mowing a path down to the stage. The other girls weren't able to move, their growth locking them in place, their faces showing pain and suffering as their bodies continued to expand, their muscles and curves growing to give each of them hourglass shaped bodies. Rise knew if she tried to attack her shadow head - on, she would fail. Her Persona wouldn't do her much good as it was not made for fighting. Rise knew a small part of her wanted her friend's mass, but pushed those thoughts away. If power meant hurting my friends and betraying them for my shadow, I'd never take it, she thought. While she couldn't do much about her Shadow at the moment, she managed to collect herself and call out her Persona anyways. I need to help get the guys get on the stage so they can deal with my shadow, she thought. With that, Rise turned away from the girls and her shadow and started to analyse the mob of shadows the guys were fighting. Afterwards, she started to yell out weak points of the shadows closest to the guys. At the very least, I can speed up the time it takes for the guys to take these guys down so that they can get to my shadow faster and take her out, she thought. The guys had heard her tips and started to attack the weak points, easily taking them down faster than before. The rate at which they were able to destroy the shadows was much faster thanks to Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Shadow Rise was still busy making Yukiko, Chie and Naoto bigger. This isn't good, she thought, with her yelling tips to destroy my minions to her friends, I don't have as much time as I thought. While I can't move when I'm making her friends bigger, I do have some power left over to keep Rise at bay if she tried to attack me alone, but if her friends manage to attack me while I'm in this state, I can't do anything. What do I do?, she thought. Shadow Rise looked at the girl's growth so far. Each of them were around 20 feet tall in height at this point, and as wide as they were tall! Each of their arms looked as though they were twice the size of minivans, and that was unflexed! Each girl's abs had become a ripped 12 - pack, looking as though nothing could break it! On top of their chests were a sizeable pair of breasts, with each one being more than three times the size of large TV sets! Their monstrous legs, each one bigger than the largest trees, supporting their upper bodies. Though it all, each girl's swimsuit had still held, keeping their modesty, but at this point, it looked like a second skin on each of their humongous bodies. Especially Naoto, with her school swimsuit showing off every curve and bulge of muscle on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, their growth is going fine, Shadow Rise thought, but I need to speed it up. Sensing the remaining energy inside each of the girls' bodies from the magic \"seed\" of her own power she had planted into them before, Shadow Rise decided what to do next. This will do, she thought, observing the walls of the building. Due to the placement of the girls when they first started growing, Chie and Yukiko were on the opposite sides of the buildings while Naoto was growing in-between them. Each of their muscles pushed away from one another as they grew, with Naoto pushing Chie and Yukiko to the walls. Visible cracks where starting to show on the walls where Chie and Yukiko were being pushed against by the massive detective, due to them not being able to stand the might of each girls' muscles. Looks like this is the end of Phase 1, Shadow Rise thought as she released all of the remaining energy in Chie, Yukiko and Naoto's bodies. To the girls, it felt like a nuclear power plant had just exploded in their bodies as their muscles and curves went into overdrive! The walls of the stage could not take it, crumbling down due to the weight of Yukiko and Chie's bulging muscles! The whole place began to shake, parts of the ceiling crumbling down to the floor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, the guys had just gotten on stage and met up with Rise before seeing Shadow Rise give the three girls one last growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the building is about to go because of your friends. If I were you, I'd want to get out of here fast. See you on the outside!\" Shadow Rise exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise, Teddie, Yosuke and Kanji watched as her shadow teleported away, before looking at the current situation. Rise was infuriated at her Shadow for what she had done to her friends, but right now, her shadow was right. They needed to evacuate right now! Using their Personas, the group quickly cut a hole in the wall and ran out of the building until they reached the grassy field next to the building a safe distance away from how big they assumed the crash of the building would be. They watched as the building broke down, debris falling down upon Rise's growing friends inside. Once the dust finally settled, Rise looked at the remains of the building for any sign of their friends, worry beginning to show on her face until she saw three bodies rise from the rubble. The girls were unscathed, their muscles protecting them from any harm and although they were still in pain from growing, they were glad that their friends had not gotten hurt. Rise and the others watched as Chie, Yukiko and Naoto continued to grow, their muscles and breasts growing to new levels and crushing the debris around them until finally, their growth had come to an end! At their current size, each girl was the size of a small building, their combined mass the size of the building that Shadow Rise had created!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise and the others came back over to check on the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all okay?\" Rise said, her head pointing straight up to look at the three girls heads, each buried in a sea of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think... we're okay...\" said Yukiko between gasps of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just... need a minute... to recover.\" said Chie, just as breathless as Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That last spurt... put a lot... of strain on... our bodies.\" said Naoto, her state the same as the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess that makes sense, Rise thought. That last one really did make them grow. Rise and the others examined the changes in their friends bodies as they recovered. They really were huge, and it did not look like their bodies offered them much mobility or control, as the girls' breasts shook uncontrollably after each massive breath they took. Once again, Kanji passed out due to amount of blood that had come from his nose. As Teddie and Yosuke shook Kanji over and over to get up while Yosuke yelled \"Now isn't the time for this, dammit!\", Rise was worried about how they would be able to get her friends back to their normal, or at least, original sizes. On top of that, her shadow was nowhere to be seen. Rise had a bad feeling that things weren't over yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, not as big as I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise and the others looked in the direction of the voice to see Shadow Rise, reforming from her teleport from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU! What have you done to my friends!\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, is it too much? I think they're a bit small if you ask me, but it'll still work. If you want me to turn them back to normal, \u266a my offer is always available \u266a\" her shadow said in a cheery tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell we'll trust you!\" Yosuke said as he and the other guys charged at her with their Personas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir attack was only a few inches away from her face before being deflected by an invisible barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you all like my shield? I was able to create it as my body reformed from the teleport. However, since I made it quick, it's quite weak. If you bash it enough times, it'll go down, but it's enough time for me to start Phase 2.\" Shadow Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phase 2?\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Rise, did you really think making your friends grow was all I would do for you to take my offer? So naive. I still have a couple of tricks up my sleeve. If you won't join because you want bodies like your friends, I'll make you join to save your friends, you pathetic weakling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember earlier when you asked about the last competitor? Well, you're looking at her, and it looks like it's my turn now!\" Shadow Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... You can't...\" Rise said, realizing what was about to unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I can! And without further ado, let the real show begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys, meanwhile, were too focused on breaking the barrier to listen on the conversation between Rise and her shadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost got it!\" said Kanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on everyone, we'll get things back to normal.\" said Teddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Yosuke said, as the final blow was struck on the barrier, dissolving it into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a huge tremor, the source of which coming under Shadow Rise's feet. Rise and the others could feel the overwhelming amount of power coming from Shadow Rise as her body tensed up. Suddenly, the three boys jumped above her, seconds away from striking her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't let you get away with this!\" all three of them exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late. Oh, this is my favourite part, hehe!\" Shadow Rise said with a smile.</span></div></div>",

Already towering over them Rise's darker self simply laughed in sinister fashion as she felt them bump and fall right off onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! More! More! MORE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow cackled again, arms spread wide as her body bloated and surged outward with power and size. Rise could only watch in horror as her shadow grew larger every passing second, the ground cracking and cratering as her legs expanded wider stronger, her arms and biceps in particular becoming globes of power, breasts growing just as massive just as impressive and just a touch under the blue-haired detective's own gigantic pair, an impenetrable shield of a mid-section as her abs went into overdrive much like with the others a dozen if not more so protecting her from any sort of damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow roared with a mix of pleasuring release and primal satisfaction as her power and body exploded outward one last time, the force nearly blasting those of standard size away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was once again astounded by her shadow, now already the size of her muscled up friends and it appeared to her that she was still growing although at much slower pace. Rise hoped that perhaps going through such a massive growth so rapidly weakened her ability to do so and maybe it would be take some time before she could explode in size again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hands off ya crazy bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was...Kanji! Where was he...oh no!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my why hello Kanji-kun. Bet you were enjoying the ride on my luscious powerful breasts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow laughed, said breasts bouncing in delight, as Kanji's face flushed from anger and embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of me! Before I smash that crazy face of yours!\" the bleached blonde young man yelled as she brought him closer to her muscle surrounded face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh such terrible choice of words, Kanji-kun, if I did that and you somehow missed my incredible muscles and curves...you wouldn't survive the fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer maddening laughter only angering the jacket-wearing boy more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are my property now and I am going to enjoy using you.\" The shadow purred seductively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let him go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the shadow was going to point out that there was nothing Rise could do it suddenly came to her that wasn't Rise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release Kanji-kun, shadow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Naoto and the detective was taking after the captured Tatsumi boy and rushing right at the one holding him captive!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naoto wasn't sure what exactly had come over here for the brief moment. She was usually one of the more calm and level headed of her friends, always planning before carrying out actions, but something, albeit briefly, had taken her over the edge. Maybe it was an unforeseen side - effect of the body she was sporting, maybe it was because one of her friends was held captive by a shadow and Naoto got caught in the spur of the moment, maybe it was the fact that Shadow Rise's \"plan\" had involved the detective to wear a swimsuit, of all the revealing clothes, to help her friend \"Marie\" out and reveal her now colossal assets to her friends and he wanted some form of payback for the embarrassment she had endured for it. Heck, maybe it was a combination of all three. Whatever the reason was, Naoto was rushing towards Shadow Rise (quite surprising considering that she didn't lose too much speed with all the bulk she was carrying on her body), her right hand starting to form a fist. As Naoto closed in, Shadow Rise turned to face her and said with a grin on her face,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, detective! Man, have fun trying to act like a boy now! With boobs like yours, not even all the binds in the world could supress tho-\" Shadow Rise exclaimed before interrupted by a blow to her midsection by Naoto's stronger-than-steel punch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow Rise was blown backwards, her breath knocked out of her, her body flailing in all directions trying to regain her balance as Kanji was released from her grip, rising through the air before gravity took its toll on the boy's body and made him plummet towards the earth below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! If Kanji hits the ground, there's no way he'll survive!\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kanji started to regain consciousness from the impact of being flung out of Shadow's Rise's grasp, he realized that the ground was coming towards him fast. Oh man, what do I do?, he thought. Kanji ended up closing his eyes and readying himself for the impact, hoping that the rules in the TV world allow him to survive the fall. Suddenly, his body hit something, but he didn't feel any pain. The ground didn't seem this close, the boy thought as he opened his eyes to see that he was lying on an outstretched hand. Kanji looked up and saw Yukiko's face, although it was a bit hard to see with the muscle surrounding her. It seemed as though he was caught by her and was saved from the impact of falling to the ground. Rise sighed with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Kanji? Are you hurt anywhere?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks a lot, Yukiko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear. I'm going to bring you back down to where the others are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Yukiko lowered her hand towards the area where Rise was tending to Teddie and Yosuke, both hurt lightly from getting blown away by Shadow Rise's growth. Kanji got up and stepped off of her hand towards the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think that you guys should stay here for now. Yosuke and Teddie are still hurt and knocked out from earlier, and they need help getting back on their feet. In the meanwhile, I think that me, Naoto and Chie should handle Rise's shadow. It seems like we are the only ones capable of hurting her right now.\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so. Be careful, though, My shadow probably still has some tricks left.\" said Rise, a hint of sadness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. And Rise? Don't be so down, none of this is your fault. You are and will always be a important part of the group. Once this is all done, I'm sure we can get things back to normal.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise watched as Yukiko joined Chie and Naoto in the fight against her Shadow. Although she understood Yukiko's intentions, Rise still felt bad inside. Her shadow doing this to her friends was her fault, yet she do nothing as others fought to clean up her own mess. I've never felt so weak in my life, Rise thought. However, she couldn't focus on that as she still needed to tend to Yosuke and Teddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving to the battlefield, Yukiko, along with Chie and Naoto who were already there began to form a circle around Shadow Rise, surrounding her. The shadow wasn't looking at them, instead looking at the area where Naoto hit her, her abs. While there was no bruise, she still rubbed her hand on the spot where Naoto's punch had connected. She began to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" Chie yelled to the Shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just how weak I am. With a body like this, I should be practically invincible, but the detective's punch managed to take my breath away and knock me back. Seems as though I misjudged you all,\" the Shadow replied, \"but I'm not making the same mistake. Oh, a big one's coming! Perfect timing! You might wanna stand back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the tremors came from Shadow Rise's body as she concentrated on making her muscles grow bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, we cannot let Rise's shadow grow again, or else it will gain the advantage! We need to break the shadow's concentration! We need to attack now!\" Naoto exclaimed.</span></div></div>",

My friends from Inaba helped me so much during a really dark time and I'll never forget them for that and I'll never forgive monsters like you who want to destroy them and our world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLabrys not wasting another moment as she took flight right at the mountainous shadow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little metal brat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise's dark side yelled out as the android closed in already shifting into a combat strike, as her weapon went from wings to axe in hand, ready to cut down her opponent!</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before the blow could be dealt, Shadow Rise managed to put a small barrier around the front of the axe, slowing the momentum of the axe to a stop. For a moment, Labrys was confused. She was not struck by the shadow, so why had she stopped? Before she realized that there was a barrier covering the area of the shadow she was aiming for, the shadow used the time to form a circular barrier around the robot and her axe, trapping them! I don't have much time, she thought, that barrier isn't holding, but I need a little more time to gather up my energy again if I wanna grow again. An idea coming to her, the shadow inserted some of her dark power into the Anti-Shadow Suppression Weapon, who was already mostly done destroying the dome in the short amount of time she was trapped inside. This won't make her grow like the others since she's made of metal and the effect won't last long, but it will give me the perfect opportunity to distract those other girls. With that, the shadow pushed the remains of the barrier back to the three girls with Labrys still on it, the girl crashing into the ground beside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Labrys!\" Chie cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Yukiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the girls were immensely worried about the mechanical maiden, since they knew she was built to withstand hits like that. Nonetheless, they still wanted to know if their friend was hurt badly or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLabrys started to open her eyes and get up from the small crater her impact had made. She had felt something enter her as she was focused on destroying the barrier confining her and it felt like she was being hacked again, although she could still move and think of her own free will. However, she had no time to analyse it as she was flung to the ground by muscular shadow. Looking back at the area where she was flung from, she was surprised to see that the Shadow had disappeared. Where are you, she thought, you couldn't have gotten far. Turning around, Labrys let out a gasp as she found what she was searching for. Not one, but three massive Shadow Rises were looking down at her, all of them mute with smiling faces. Composing herself quickly, the girl said, \"It seems as though you can perform duplication. That still won't help you!\" The robot quickly grabbed her axe and flew above them, going for an overhead slash on the shadow closest to her. The shadow managed to block the hit using it's arms this time instead of a barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Does your duplication trick make you unable to manifest barriers like before? It seems like I've gotten an advantage. Now prepare to face my wrath!\" Labrys said, charging in for another attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duplication? What are you talking about, Labrys? It's us, your friends! I know we aren't exactly the same as we used to be, but why are you attacking us!?\" Chie said, moving her arms again to block another hit from her axe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no use, Chie. It seems as though Labrys is under the influence of some sort of illusion caused by Rise's shadow and cannot see or hear us. We need to make her see reality!\" Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a show!, Shadow Rise thought to herself, friend vs friend, and its all thanks to me! The power I inserted into her body makes her both unable to see the real me and see her her friends as me, making her attack them instead, it really is wonderful! Maybe I should sit and watch, but there are more important things I must tend to.</span></div></div>",

As of yet, none of the girls had thought of a way to return the robot to normal or even try to pin her down as they didn't want to hurt their friend. As a result, they just kept blocking her hits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do, guys. All Labrys thinks is that we are going to destroy her if she hits us or stops attacking.\" Chie exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! You're right, Chie, that is what she thinks we will do. We just need to show her we won't so she'll know that we aren't shadows!\" Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, but how can we convey that to her?\" Yukiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do have one idea, but it will require us allowing ourselves to get hit.\" Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this point, we have to try it at least!\" Chie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Naoto said, \"Everyone, stretch out your hands and stop defending!\" With that, the girls stretched out their arms, steeling themselves for what was about to happen as they saw the blue haired girl about to strike again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLabrys was confused again. As she landed her third attack on the Shadow Rise closest to her, all that shadow did was stay in the same pose, hands outstretched. In fact, that was what the other two shadows had done when Labrys had hit them. They didn't even try defending themselves. Labrys quickly got mad and went in for another attack on the closest shadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you honestly believe your body is too strong for my attacks?!\" the robot asked, her axe colliding into the shadow's right arm. As Labrys looked on, the shadow looked as if it grimaced in pain over the additional hit it had taken, but still held it's position. Labrys landed back on the ground and let her body go slack for a short moment. After her constant barrage of attacks, she needed a small break for her axe's thrusters to recharge. Why weren't the shadows defending themselves anymore?, she thought, and why aren't they even talking? Before Labrys had confronted the shadow, she had watched her friends battle her and had observed how talkative the shadow was in battle, whether it was to try to persuade Rise into taking her offer or giving a sarcastic comment to the others. Now, the shadows were mute, all of them with smiling faces that looked plastered on their head. On top of that, the robot sensed a power building around the area she was in, yet she could not detect the source of it. Oh crap, she thought, I can't think about this right now, I gotta move! The shadows might be planning to attack while I'm down!, she thought. Yet as she jumped to the side to avoid any attack she thought might come her way, she looked up and saw that the Shadows are still in the same pose, arms outstretched, not moving an inch. None of this makes any sense, she thought, it's like an... illusion! The robot needed to test her hypothesis before she jumped to any conclusions first. Puting her axe down, the robot yelled so the \"shadows\" before her could hear:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of you are shadows, are you? It's you guys, Chie, Naoto and Yukiko!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as the shadows all put their hands on their sides and made what looked like a nodding motion, although it wasn't perfect thanks to their muscles getting in the way. I've been a fool, Labrys thought, remembering how she felt like she had been hacked when she was flung down by the Shadow. That shadow had put something in me, she thought, It's time I isolate it from my body! With that, Labrys closed her eyes and did an internal scan of her body, searching for any abnormalities which occurred. The only reason why she didn't check sooner was that the scan, while fast, was not instant and she was afraid of the shadows taking advantage of her immobile state during the scan. However, how that she knew these \"shadows\" surrounding here weren't her target, she could freely do so. Sure enough, the scan showed her that there was a dark power inserted into her core, which had branched out and affected the sensors controlling her eyes and ears, putting her under the influence of the shadow's trick to hurt her friends. Now knowing where the problem was in her body, Labrys managed to push back the branched out power from her eyes and ears back into the core and revert the power into his early stages. Before the shadow's power could manifest inside her again, the robot managed to seal the power, making it unable to manifest unless she broke the seal. While it's good that this power is sealed again, Labrys thought, I would feel uncomfortable letting it dwell within my body. Labrys then managed to transfer the sealed power from her body into her axe. There, she thought, now even if the power is broken from it's seal, it won't have much much effect inside my axe. Once this battle is over, I can dispose of this tainted power permanently. With that issue out of the way and her internal scan complete, Labrys's body returned to it's normal conditions. As the robot opened her eyes, she saw her three friends standing where the \"shadows\" had been. Using her axe to fly towards her friends faces, the robot said, \"I'm sorry everyone, it seems as though the shadow got the better of me and tricked me into hurting you all. Are your wounds from my attacks bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, Labrys. Although they did pack a punch, they weren't enough to make us give up!\" Chie responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are glad you've returned to your senses, Labrys!\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you all again for helping me regain my senses.\" Labrys replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, what a touching reunion! I could almost cry! But aren't you all forgetting someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four girls quickly turned around to see the shadow, overwhelming power emanating all around her! The power surge I detected from when I was under the shadow's trance!, Labrys thought to herself, was that her? The shadow let out a snicker, a cat - like grin once again forming on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should thank you, you little bucket of bolts!\" the shadow continued, \"Thanks to you keeping those three off my back, I was able to regain that power you made me lose, AND THEN SOME! I don't even know how big I'll be now, but I know I'll love it! Now then, without any further interruptions, let me show you the desires of the real Rise Kujikawa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTremors once again started to form, even worse than before as the shadow's muscles prepared to grow! Oh no, Naoto thought, at this distance, there was no way anyone would be able to hit her before the Shadow grew! </span></div></div>",

Her head seemingly sinking into the sea of muscle made up by her rising traps, powerful pecs that lead into her gigantic breasts. Her abs boosting in size from a dozen or so to halfway to three causing her waist to expand although not to the same speed as her tremendous arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! MORE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow yelled as her body continued to grow larger with each passing second.

I better make sure Rise has a front row seat to her friends demise, but it seems like I don't have to worry about that.\" Shadow Rise thought, looking over the horizon as she saw Rise, Yosuke, Teddie and Kanji running over towards the other four girls who were still looking at the Shadow's new colossal form. The shadow giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems like I have some admirers!\" the shadow said. \"Like what you see? Well, why don't I show you some of my new-found strength!\" With that, the shadow raised her left leg, the size of it being close to a skyscraper now, and stomped her foot near the are where Labrys, Chie, Yukiko and Naoto were. The entire field shook because of the earthquake that had been created by Shadow Rise's stomp. Rise and the others fell to the ground and were unable to get up until the shaking had stopped. However, Rise still managed to look in the direction of her friends to see that a enormous hole had been created around where her shadow's foot had landed, trapping Chie, Yukiko and Naoto. Although she could not tell how deep the hole was from where she was, she could hear her friends voices from inside the hole, reassuring her that they were still alive. However, she knew all too well that her Shadow would not be so merciful to them for her next attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the hole Shadow Rise created, the three girls were stuck. Their bulk had cushioned them from major harm during Shadow Rise's \"demonstration\", but they did get roughed up a bit during the fall into the pit. Currently, they were trying to get out of the pit and while it was not too deep for them to get out, their muscles made it harder to them to try to grab the walls of the hole and try to climb out. It would take more time then they had, it appeared, since they heard Shadow Rise's cackling. \"Well, now you've all seen what a bit of my power does, but why don't I get serious now? Looks like even with all that gusto about beating me with your friends, all you are ever capable of is watching while your friends fight for you! This time though, your friends are about to pay the price for your weakness, Rise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLabrys was lucky. When the colossal shadow was about to strike, she had snapped out of her daze and used her axe to fly further away from the shadow, trying to escape it's area of effect. If see had stuck around with her friends, her body would most likely have not survived the immense air pressure that was pushing the shadow's foot. Once the attack had ceased and the ground stopped shaking, Labrys went to check on the others. She knew in her heart that the other three had survived, but since the rest of them weren't as big or strong as them, Labrys wasn't sure how the earthquake would affect the others. She had spotted them, all of them sprawled on the ground. While the earthquake didn't cause them too much harm, their wounds from earlier during the Shadow's first growth were still present and added to the pain. After getting the three males up and wrapping some of their wounds up to lessen the pain with some medical supplies the robot had brought, they were all much better. However, Yosuke remembered something and asked the robot, \"Hey, where's Rise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not see her when I landed and found you all.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, I remember seeing her get up and moving after he earthquake before passing out.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how was she able to stand when you three were unconscious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we were the only ones who were injured earlier before you came to help us, so while I doubt that Rise is not hurt, she's definitely able to move better than us since her injuries aren't as bad.\" Yosuke continued, \"We gotta stop her though! I think she's going to do something dangerous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was running towards the hole where her friends and the shadow were. She was able to get up much faster than the boys were since she was only hurt lightly by the earthquake, and she knew she couldn't waste anymore time. She knew that there was only one way for the Shadow to stop, and while she knew her friends would object, there was no other option. She would not let them die. Meanwhile, the shadow was preparing for another stomp, this time aiming at the hole and using all her strength.<br>\r\n\"I wonder...\" she said, \"Will the stomp leave you as pancakes, or will it just vaporize you into nothingness! Well, let's find out now, shall we?\" As the mountainous shadow started to move her left leg up again and deal the final blow, something happened...</span></div></div>",

Instantly, the shadow stopped moving, her foot metres away from touching the pit. The shadow slowly turned her head, a smile of satisfaction on her head as she said \"I didn't quite get that. Could you repeat what you said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, I accept! I'll take up your offer of power! Make me the biggest, strongest, most beautiful idol there is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise, what are you doing!?\" Chie said, \"Why are you accepting your shadow's offer!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the shadow's pause in her attack, the three girls managed to push themselves out of the hole and were now going towards the red - headed girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's the only way!\" she said, \"If I don't, then my shadow won't stop until she hurts everyone I love, and I can't let that happen, even if you all are prepared for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's that, I suppose.\" said Shadow Rise, their voice coming from behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four girls turned around to see the shadow, her colossal form looming over them. While her body would have previously struck fear into the hearts of whoever looked upon it, all Shadow Rise could see on the four faces below her were, with the exception of Rise's sadness of what she had agreed to, anger and disgust! \"Oh, I love those faces! You should keep them up!\" the Shadow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You monster! Why are you so intent on bringing destruction and darkness wherever you go?\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying, Yukiko?\" said the shadow, in a childlike tone, \"All my purpose was is to make Rise become stronger, and I can assure you that she will be the strongest!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, as fun as it was being this strong...\", the shadow continued, pulling a crab flex which almost made her double their width and pushed out her blimp - sized breasts, \"It's time for the big finale act to take place, and it's none other than Rise Kujikawa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls watched as the shadow's form began to look misty, realizing that the shadow was turning itself into a great big cloud of mist the size of it's previous muscled up form. Then, the mist cloud started to pour itself into Rise's body by shooting itself into her mouth. Try as she might, Rise was unable to close to her due to the flow of mist being too great. Her friends tried to stop the mist by blocking their route to Rise's mouth with their bodies, but the mist must went through them and continued their path into Rise's body until the last bit of it had entered. As soon as that happened, Rise began to feel power welling up inside her so fast, her body was already starting to grow. However, Rise was pushing back against the flow of power inside herself, slowing the growth down although power was still getting through and making her bigger. Rise watched as her muscles began to grow, her abs tightening and forming a 6 - pack, her biceps growing from non - existent to lemons to basketballs, her legs growing thicker with each heartbeat and her breasts moving up to DD - cups. Throughout it all, Rise could feel a mix of pain with her skin stretching fast to make room with her muscles and pleasure, no doubt her Shadow's doing to entice her into letting go and growing. She knew that her resistance would not last long and that eventually, she would have to let all the power out inside her body. Still growing slowly, the idol managed to say through gritting teeth, \"Get... out... can't... slow... growth... forever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie, Yukiko, we have to move!\" Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't leave her like this though!\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying that we will. However, if we stick near her, her real growth will commence and she may very well crush us! We need to make some distance between us! One that's done, we will find a way to save her!\" the detective replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, let's move then!\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Rise! We won't give up on you, we will all find a way to turn back normal, and don't you forget it!\" Yukiko said, running back with the other two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in her state, Rise couldn't help but smile at the dedication of her friends to save her. She was glad to have friends like hers. At this point, Rise was now 7 feet tall and had the body of two heavyweight body-builders combined with F - Cup breasts. She was at her limit and the power was about to break though. She screamed as the power broke free and really started to grow her body.</span></div></div>",

No!

Her pleasantly plumped yet iron-hard backside reaching a level where the young idol could crush the entirety of her school, with some to spare.

There was just simply no way she continue to grow any further. She was already far bigger then shadow but just how much larger was she going to go. Rise hoped it was over...yet she suddenly felt a stirring inside her and the poor girl knew she still wasn't quite done yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gargantuan idol yelled as her body, like her shadow had done so before her, practically exploded one last time in size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral moments later Rise Kujikawa debuted her new size.

Even the gigantic form she had taken after accepting her shadow's offer was an after-thought...now stood something truly monstrous, something god-like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaller then any known building or landmark, larger then any mountain, a single foot able to grind half of Inaba into dust or hell if she wanted she could literally carry the city on her solar-eclipsing back!

I never have to run again, from now on, I'll be the one to fight for myself, and nobody will be ever able to stop me since I truly am the strongest idol, no, strongest being in the world! Even now, I can feel my body still growing, slower now but still growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gargantuan idol was correct as while her massive growth spurt had ended, her body was still growing at a much slower pace, her muscles, pecs and breasts pushing out slightly further with each breath she took. However, considering the size she was now, it was extremely hard to notice her growth. After doing a couple of body-building poses and watching her already mighty muscles inflate, a thought occurred to Rise, \"What happened to my friends? Did they make it safely somewhere before my growth?\" A look of concern briefly showed on her face before it faded away, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet they're fine out there. I gave them ample time to get away before I grew. I bet they'll love my new look though, I mean, it's not like I'm crazy or anything, I'm still me, and with my new strength, I can protect them all by myself. I'm pretty lucky this swimsuit grew along with me too, I wouldn't want to be naked at this size, but maybe I could still put it off with my new guns...\" she thought, quickly shooting a double bicep pose and watching them rise higher and higher to the sky, like two mountains. Like the other girls who grew before Rise, their swimsuits managed to grow alongside them, keeping their decency. In Rise's case, her orange two - piece managed to cover up her private areas and most of her enormous cleavage, but a generous amount of it was still showing through the top of her orange bikini top, which Rise didn't mind. In her warped mind, Rise thought she really was the most beautiful, strongest idol in history, and that she would only become more so as her body grew! \"No one will ever be as great as I am! My shadow really was trying to help me become stronger, I can't believe I didn't accept the offer in the first place!\" she thought, \"Maybe I'll go try to find my friends and show them the new me later, although they can probably already see me from miles and miles away!\" With that, the idol laughed and continued to flex her new muscles, while in a safe location much further away, the rest of the Investigation Team along with Labrys were watching the new Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happened to her?\" Yukiko asked, \"I'm not asking about her body, I'm asking about her personality! She doesn't seem like the Rise we saw earlier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective was first to reply, \"The most logical conclusion I can come up with is that due to the sudden burst of overwhelming power that Rise endured during her growth, her moral core has been warped, turning her more into a power - hungry who is more in love with herself instead of the Rise we all know. Currently, she isn't causing any harm and destruction and only admiring herself, but give it enough time and something will come that will provoke her and bring out the more destructive side of her personality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is terrible! How do we get our Rise back?\" Yosuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are two options I have considered, we can either wait until his change to her moral core wears off because the change is not permanent, or we can try to either make her go unconscious or revert her back into her normal form. However, due to her personality being unstable and able to go destructive as I mentioned earlier, I would advise we go with the second option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" said Chie, \"but how can we even make her unconscious.

But why?\" said Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't exactly have enough evidence to support my thesis, but I believe that since the owner of this power, Rise's shadow, was absorbed into Rise and no longer controls her power within us, the power has gone \"silent\" in our bodies, still gathering power like it was programmed to but unable to release it without anybody to control it. My idea was that we could try to control the power inside each of our bodies and use it to grow bigger. However, I believe Teddie was correct about the second problem. Even though the dark power within us has been building for quite a long time, I don't believe we will be able to get to Rise's size yet if it is used now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I may be of assistance?\" said Labrys, quietly listening to the detective's idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you able to help the girls, Labrys?\" Kanji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please allow me to explain,\" the robot continued, \"When I was under the influence of the shadow's illusion magic and realized what I was truly seeing, I did an internal scan on my body and removed the shadow's power from my system, sealing it and storing it within my axe, where it currently resides. With a bit of tweaking on this power, I may be able to turn it into a sort of amplifying power and shoot it into you three, increasing the muscle mass you gain during your \"growth spurt\" by a considerable amount. With it, I am almost certain that you will be able to AT LEAST become a tad smaller than what Rise's form is currently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, good work, Labrys! Who knew that storing an evil power could be put into good use later!\" Yosuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Yosuke! Now, would you three like to try my proposal?\" the robot said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we currently do not have much of a choice, so we shall.\" The detective said, \"but first, can you take Yosuke, Teddie and Kanji to another location on your axe? Once we start to grow, we wouldn't want to hurt them by accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative.\" Labrys replied, grabbing her axe and letting the guys grab hold of it. After wishing the girls luck on saving Rise, Labrys flew away with the guys while the remaining three waiting for the iron maiden's return. After about five minutes, they saw a glimpse of the blue - haired robot in the horizon as she started to land. Once on solid ground, the robot immediately got to work, reconfiguring the sealed dark power inside her axe so the core programming of the power changed from illusion to amplification. Once that was done, the only thing left was to modify her axe a bit so that she would be able to shoot the power into three equally divided beams for each girl. Meanwhile, Chie, Naoto and Yukiko were preparing their minds for what was to come. They all knew that they had to keep themselves from being overwhelmed by the power of the growth, otherwise they could very well become like Rise which wouldn't be good. On top of that, they had to visualize the dark power in their bodies in their minds in order to control it. While they initially had a hard time visualizing the power, they all managed to do so in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, all the preparations were complete. The girls had moved from their hiding spot to a vast field where they could spot Rise still admiring herself. Although it was hard to tell, it looked as though Rise had grown a bit bigger than when they first saw her gigantic form with the others back at the hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember girls, once we finish growing, we have to stop Rise fast, since there's a possibility that her seeing us after our growths could bring out her other personality in full force. On top of that, if this fight lasts for too long, Rise will end up becoming bigger than us and overpowering us since it looks as though she is still growing, albeit at a slower pace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Chie and Yukiko replied, ready to face the future. Going into their positions, the girls prepared to visualize the power in their bodies while Labrys, standing in front of the three, prepared her axe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to remind you all,\" Labrys said, \"The shadow's power inside my axe is only enough for me to do this to each of you once, and if you want to have the full effect of the amplifying beam, release the build-up of power in your bodies as soon as the beam from my axe hits you. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls nodded to the robot in confirmation. \"OK,\" The robot said, \"On my mark! 1... 2... 3!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, three beams of dark purple energy shot out and hit the three girls in their chests! At the same time, each girl managed the power inside themselves being released!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready the girls could feel the flood of power rushing into each of their bodies as their muscles began to twitch violently! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Labrys, I think we all timed it correctly! Now you need to fly out of here fast, it's starting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding no further info, the robot sped away from the three girls and got enough space between them when all three girls muscles went into overdrive!</span></div></div>",

It was an amazing experience to watch unfold yet again, only this time with three individuals rather then just one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls grew further and their already tremendous curves stretched out ever further Teddie and Kanji fought the urge to fall unconscious. Yosuke would have joined them just the same yet with Labrys nearby the young man did all he could to stay focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With Naoto-kun's brilliance leading them I know they can succeed, Yosuke-kun.\" Labrys stated as she turned over to meet him face to face, a simple smile on her lips. Her way of easing the boy's understandable worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I hope you're right.\" he said in agreement as the two of them continued to watch the three ladies continue to take up more of the horizon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last their straining growth had come to end, their bodies feeling as if they had been overcharged like batteries yet here the trio stood nearly if not damn close as could be to Rise's size after final push of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie mentioning that never in her life did she imagine herself being so strong so massive so powerful...she instinctively flexed her gigantic legs nearly losing herself to sound of her muscles expanding further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily her best friend was able to bring her back to reality with a quick shout of her name. Yukiko in doing so also picked up on their being a slight difference in their muscular forms. She was the leanest of them all so to speak which made sense when she thought about how Chie seemingly had the largest legs and Naoto much like Rise had a rather intensive hourglass figure, it also seemed that the detective had yet again laid claim to the biggest fullest breasts among the four monstrously muscular giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the detective the blue-haired titan was less concerned with her tremendous bust size and more the fact that like Rise, Chie nearly lost herself to her new size and power. It was understandable and even she could feel the temptation run her hands through her now behemoth form yet the detective steeled her mind from such thoughts. But it was something to remember and she was thankful that Yukiko was here to serve as an anchor to Chie's emotional state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the opposite were to occur she hoped Chie would do the same while she trusted in her own mental strength to stay the course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man it's rough to move like this. No wonder Rise-chan's stayed put.\" Chie mentioned as she took a more earth-shaking steps forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree but it looks like we'll have to adapt quickly then right, Naoto-kun?\" Yukiko asked shifting what part of her she could to get a better look of the detective goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, not the most comforting of choices but we will have to make due and become accustom to these much larger strength-fueled body frames. In any case nothing changes that our main objective is still to save Rise-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How exactly are we going to that though?\" Chie curiously asked, they had the size and the power but how were they going to save their friend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her mind is warped but she isn't destructive yet I hope I can at least speak some sense into the still rational side of her mind. The part of her that we know of as our friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all so massive practically muscle goddesses and with that in mind Naoto wanted to keep conflict to a minimum. The one sliver lining being that this was Teddie's world and not their own the detective didn't want to imagine the destruction the four of them could cause back home. At their size Inaba would literally be a foot-print and nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-kun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective's eyes snapped open as she overheard Yukiko call out to her. Her thoughts from before fading away as she explained that she was fine just briefly lost in thought. Yukiko understood stating that Rise was just up ahead, the idol clearly bigger then before showing that they were in fact on the clock and there was no time to waste.</span></div></div>",

Finally, the detective let out a small sigh as she heard her friend say, \"I understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, Rise! We knew you would!\" Chie responded. As the three girls prepared to move back to the site where Labrys and the others were, they heard Rise's voice ring out again, \"Yes, I understand plenty, Chie. I never knew that you girls wanted be to stay weak forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls spun around to face the idol, their head hung low (as much as she could with her body) and hair covering her face, hiding the emotions that were on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise, I don't understand what you're implying...\" Naoto said before being interrupted by the ever - growing idol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm implying, \"Sempai\", is that during very battle that I've been in with the Investigation Team, I've always been the one out of the fight, my only useful ability being to show weaknesses of enemies to you all. I always wanted to be in the fight too, but my shadow was right, I was weak. Once I got this power,\" Rise continued, curling her right hand into a fist and flexing her right arm, \"I couldn't believe how amazing it was! With it, I thought that I'd finally be able to fight for you guys and really be the biggest and strongest person in history, like my Shadow told me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you trusting your Shadow all of a sudden!? She tried to kill us for you to get this power!\" Chie burst out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, at first I agreed with you all and thought she was crazy, but after seeing what she gave me and how you guys reacted to it, I think she was on to something! Real friends would have supported my new-found strength! Real friends would have let me stay the biggest and strongest without trying to surpass me! Real friends wouldn't want me to go back to the skinny little twig I was and continue to watch during a fight! Heck, I bet that to rub in your strength, you would have kept your new bodies and only make me go back to normal so you could show off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise, we would never do anything like that, we are your real friends! Come back to your senses, this isn't you!\" Yukiko pleaded with her friend before feeling a hand touch her shoulder. It seemed to connect to Naoto's massive frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no use now, the time for talk is over, Yukiko. It seems like the Rise we knew has been overtaken by power.\" the detective said. The hair had been pushed back from her face and anger was appearing all over it. \"What are you all blabbering about now, huh? That \"I'm not myself?\", because I can assure you that I've never felt more in control than right now. In fact, I think it's time for me to finish what my Shadow started, since you've all shown me that none of you are my friends by trying to steal my spotlight! Only I can be the strongest there is! There's only room for one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, a power - hungry look began to show in Rise's eyes as her three friends prepared to battle against their brainwashed friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Rise, but since you aren't going quietly, we're going to have to take you out!\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snicker came out of Rise, almost as sinister as her own shadow, before the redhead replied, \"You weaklings don't stand a chance against me!

Look at yourselves, if you continue like this, then you'll both end up like poor Rise!\" At this point, the black-haired girl was almost on the verge of tears, watching her friends slowly change by the lure of darkness. Chie and Noato, meanwhile, just looked at the girl, their senses cleared by the girl's speech! How could I have let myself go so far down, the two girls thought to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko, you're right. I got so enticed by the power that my pride turned to overconfidence during the fight and I went too far. I shouldn't have boasted. I'm sorry.\" the blonde girl replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As am I.\" Naoto said, \"It seems as though the power made me use my tactical knowledge to command others to do only what I wanted, as well as make me lose sight of saving a friend and instead start to think of Rise as an enemy. Thank you for saving us from what we would have become.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko pushed back the tears, feeling happy that she managed to save two of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However,\" the detective continued, \"Rise is still a special case. While you managed to save us using your words instead of violence, doing this solely on Rise will not bring her back, since it seems like it is more than just the strength that has changed her personality. Me and Chie knew this coming into battle, but the dark power inside us influenced our decisions and made us move towards physical violence. I believe that to bring Rise back, we must find a way to break this new Rise, both physically and mentally, using our strength and words together. Me and Chie will join you in trying to beckon to Rise's true self, as I believe that the old personality is still inside of the Rise who currently stands before us. However, you have to join in the fight alongside us to try and take her down, do you understand, Yukiko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. Yukiko trusted in the detective now that she was back to her old self. Although Yukiko didn't like the idea of fighting her friend, she knew now that in order to save her, she'd also have to fight her. I'll apologize later to Rise about this, she thought as she prepared herself for battle alongside the other two female behemoths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you girls made up a new plan to stop me, huh?\" said Rise, darkness seeping in and out of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about my earlier actions, Rise,\" Chie said, \"but you need to stop! This is not the real you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again with that crap? I told you before, this is the real me! I liked you better when you were praising yourself! In fact, I should really thank you for what you said earlier. Your combat skills were really helpful, but strength is better than skill, and once I become stronger, I'll be number one again! Looking back at the earlier fight we head, it disgusts me...\" Rise's anger once again bubbled, the darkness surrounding her growing thicker and heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even now, your muscles are still a bit bigger than mine, Chie, and my breasts are inferior to Naoto's!\" Rise's anger rose higher, the power inside her building faster and faster than before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise!\" Yukiko cried out, once again trying to reach out to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the idol's subconcious, Rise's eyes started to open faintly, the cause of it being her ears hearing the name being screamed out, although to her, the voice was barely a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yu... ki... ko...\" the redhead thought to herself, before trying to move her head to look around herself. Most of her body seemed to be caught it darkness, and although see could barely see it, it looked as though her lower body was disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's... happening... to... me... so... tired...\" the idol thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe.., power comes at a price, Risette. Weren't you ever told that?\" said the other person in her mind. It was Shadow Rise again! Inside Rise's subconscious, the Shadow was the same size as Rise was on the outside, slowly growing bigger as the true Rise, in her normal form, was dissolving in the darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! After I let myself be absorbed by you and made you grow bigger, I started to overtake your personality. As soon as your desires dissolve you completely, I can take full control of you and become the real you! Until then, our personalties have been merged on the outside, but mine is slowly dominating yours, making you a power - hungry monster! Your friends will never be able to save you now!\" the shadow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was able to hear the entire thing, but her personality was unable to move due to her desires eating away at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must.. do... something... too... tired...\" she thought before falling asleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside Rise's mind scape, Merged Rise's anger hit a boiling point again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time for you chumps to hit the road! I'm the big finale act, remember? I'll be the strongest person in history!\" she screamed, before the power inside her body broke loose and once again affected her.</span></div></div>",

A literal muscular explosion as her traps reached high into the air, shoulders widening as did her arms thickening to the point where her biceps collided with her forearms, her thighs and calves doing much of the same as they bulged to such an insane degree that they too were locked together for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise gave out another yell of power as her wondrous breasts skyrocketed in size, her chest alone beginning to damper the area in front of her in shadow while her monstrous back did the same on the opposite end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol yelling once more as she grew onward wider and taller with seemingly no end in sight as she towered high above everything in the TV world even her friends were quickly shrinking, so to speak, before her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe power of her merger still continuing to push Rise's body to unthinkable limits , the idol growing to such lengths that more and more of the horizon was being engulfed with nothing but her muscular form.

Chie somehow finding the strength to once again protect Yukiko taking the majority of the impact they fell hard into the land below.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some time ago the worst murder case in the history of the small town of Inaba had been resolved. The truth behind it all was unlike anything any one person could have ever imagined. A fact that she firmly believed would have driven anyone to the drink, heavy medication, the \u201cloony bin\u201d itself, or a progression of all three in that same order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven however that she was neither an alcoholic, pill popper, or dimmed mentally unstable by any professional and instead busy working away at an honest living one could say that either she didn\u2019t believe in the truth of truths or she had remarkably seen it first hand. In her specific case it was much more of the latter then the former. The same could be said about several key friends of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here she was doing what she did in a daily basis and that was cooking up delicious meals for the customer of her grandmother\u2019s shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrafting up tofu of her own was her way of coping with the departure of her \u201cSempai\u201d the boy easily captured her heart like none before him. Wither it was a school girl crush or something much greater was undetermined all she really knew was that she cared so much for him and that it had been painful to watch him leave the country town\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while she had found herself wondering pondering away at how to relive herself of the emptiness in her heart, coincidentally her close set of friends were seemingly sharing the same mindset. Until one day she realized that if he were still around the boy would never want to see her so frustratingly depressed and instead would have encouraged her to live it up and enjoy the simple pleasures she still had in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking at her grandmother\u2019s shop came to mind allowing her to come to the decision that whenever he should return, and the boy had promised that he would, she would surprise him by showcasing how well she had improved as a cook at the same time it would give her the joy she needed in order for her to move forward with her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of all that she was always able to smile nowadays after each and every transaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater after the shop had closed its doors and Rise had done a bit of clean up, her grandmother having stepped out for a while, the redhead found herself continuing to work on her cooking skills her grandmother explaining that if she wanted to see any sort of improvement she\u2019d have to work at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe figured if she could come up with a desirable recipe of her own she\u2019d be one step, no matter how small it may be, closer to her goal of becoming a better chef. Her grandmother was extraordinary even at her age and she could hope that one day she\u2019d be able to reach that level of skill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could even get to that she first had to finish with the style of tofu she was currently working on.</span></div></div>",

Midnight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo it couldn't be, could it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello there all you fellow Risette fans and followers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise gasped sharply, now fully awake, on her TV screen was an identical copy of herself. Only she knew that this was obviously not her but her Shadow self it's bright yellow eyes matching the sunny two-piece swimsuit it wore on it's shapely form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Risketeers...\" The shadow started as it paced around, \"It's been a while since we've seen each other like this and last time I know you all were looking forward to such a treat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise huffed as she watched this clone walk parading around as if it were doing nothing wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...unfortunately my little peep show was stopped. But this time I've got an even better and 'bigger' showcase for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise raised an eyebrow at the emphasize on the word \"Bigger\", what was her shadow planning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And because I know you're all anxious let me give you a bit of a free sample of what's to come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow smiled devilishly as it wrapped it's own arms around it's already ample pair of breasts. After a small squeeze and jiggle it released it's hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...here it...comes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moan was heard from the Shadow Rise before her breasts began to swell in size. One cup size...no two! The copy was now much larger then the actual thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like that, huh?\" it asked coyly, \"Well there's more to come soon enough.\" The shadow laughed for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what the heck one more for the road!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter repeating the procedure from earlier Shadow Rise was now four times larger then Rise, taking into account that she was a size larger to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow bounced happily watching and enjoying it's own chest bounce and wobble yet defy gravity by still looking very firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all for now. Stay tune if want to see more...and I know you do.\" it said in a teasing and slightly deeper voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe program came to an end and Rise stood there in her room in utter shock. Her shadow was again showcasing her inner thoughts and perhaps desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo maybe she did want a slightly bigger chest but that part of her that was TV seem content with not just having bigger breasts but having a pair bigger then it's head! Would it even stop at that point...or was it just playing off her own thoughts of having massive breasts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Rise felt the confusion was going to crack her skull in two her phone vibrated on her desk.</span></div></div>",

How could she avoid the Shadows? \"I guess...all I can do is fight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise looked around for anything that could be a weapon, then she got an idea. \"It'll seem sexist for a girl to use it but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went downstairs and got a frying pan, before walking back upstairs. \"It's all up to me, I'll prove I'm not like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise looked at her TV, she was small enough to enter, so she went to her bed, moved everything out of the way and ran right into the TV. \"OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe landed on her rear and rubbed it. \"Okay Shadow time to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise looked and saw she was already at the Marukyu Striptease. \"Hey everyone! Risette has a special guest today! Herself! Or better yet her flat version Rise, ya know? The one they digitally enhance a cup size to make into the pop star you know and love? Yup, that's her, but don't worry folks before this night is done she'll go from bugs bites, to bazookas, right up to Buses! What's that you say 'Risette how can anyone's breast get THAT big?' Good question my loyal fans, but stay tuned and you'll see first hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urg I can't believe my Shadow is acting like this. I'm going to put an end to this.\" Rise said walking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place seem empty, Rise peeked around each corner to make sure she wasn't running into a Shadow's trap, but there were none! No Shadows at all. \"This is kinda creepy...eerie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh Rise, come on in. I'm waiting for you.\" Shadow Rise's voice came from behind a curtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould it really be that simple? Rise slowly walked towards the curtain.</span></div></div>",

An uncomfortable feeling kept going through her mind as she walked through the place, shame anger and all sorts of other feelings at the place her mind created. \"Stupid shadow forcing me to come back to this awful place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Rise stepped foot on the 2nd floor a mass of cheering fell the room. \"CONGRATULATIONS RISE! You made it to the second floor! Now the risk of you breasts ballooning is twice as much and of course they'll get even bigger should you mess up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was worried about that, other then Shadow Rise making this seem like a show the fear of her breasts being twice the size they could have been last floor, who knows what size that is! \"This is getting dangerous maybe I should head back and get the others...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise turned around to see the door was gone! \"Now Now Rise you're not leaving until you're chest becomes the biggest in the entire world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to!

To do what? Prove you're 'mature'? Bull shit, you wanted to grow without anyone knowing how. Admit it Rise, you're all smoke...and mirrors.\" Rise then found herself in a hall of mirror, but it wasn't a normal hall of mirrors each reflection showed Rise in various moments of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaby Rise, Ten Year Old Rise, various ages until Rise looked at one that was current, but with a bigger bust. \"Oops you peeked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise suddenly felt her chest shake before her boobs grew two cup sizes. \"AH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top of her uniform lost a button and she could see into it looking at her stretched out bra. \"Tee hee, well Rise looks like you're not leaving with a small chest at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what...you mean...THIS IS PERMANENT!?\" Rise shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, even if by some chance you beat me they won't shrink. So Rise, can you go through this hall of mirrors showcasing the 'Real' Rise? Be careful there are still ten mirrors that will make your cup size grow. Don't worry, either way you win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise felt the now larger breasts, she knew she had to press forward. \"I'll do it...I'll explain this to everyone once I get back, I'll apologize for lying and hope they don't think of me as a dirty skank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise continued forward, unknown was how many mirrors she'd see.</span></div></div>",

All that was keeping Rise's breasts to be completely exposed was her school uniform. \"Rise you look so sad, why are you crying, you're a big girl now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise finally began to understand why this was happening, she thought only because she wanted Souji to like her was why her shadow resurfaced. It was more then that, she wanted to grow up and stop being a little girl who cries crocodile tears, she wanted big girl breasts as well to prove she was growing up. \"Now I understand, I wanted to grow up but my shadow took it too far becaus my perception of being older meant a bigger rack. I can't believe how shallow I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise sighed, she liked being fun and bubbly, the life of the party. Growing up would mean losing her remaining years of childhood, she did want to marry Souji but after she had finished her childhood, mess around and have fun with her friends. \"I won't grow up yet. I won't be a whore either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but Rise your cup size is already borderline insane. Just admit it, you want to show Souji-kun your 'womanhood' so he'll fall for you like a sack of bricks.\" Shadow Rise chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise walked faster through the hall of mirrors but still was careful not to catch a glimpse of bigger breasted Rise's. \"I'm not ready to grow up quite yet Shadow, I want to enjoy my childhood with Souji-kun and the others, and I don't need bigger breasts for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad you're not careful enough.\" Shadow Rise said, Rise was puzzled she saw a moment of her and Souji on the hill together, her size was usual to her nothing seemed wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the image of Rise removed her bra, breasts ripping out of her shirt onto Souji the Rise leaping onto him and kissing Rise gasped at the trick and soon she shared the same fate as her image, breasts ripping through her uniform two buttons landing. \"Oh NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise held the massive mounds of flesh in each hand, she felt the presence of milk in them. At the very least they were natural yet somehow defying gravity by only drooping slightly despite their massive size, no one could say they were fake despite that, though the information didn't stop Rise from breaking into tears that she'd now be considered a whore at school, her worst fears will be realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise almost didn't want to move, she seemed to lose all will to press on.

Teary-eyed and quivering from the sobs along from her own increasing anger Rise released the hold she had on her breasts, a slight bounce in them as they fell back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't...I won't be made a mockery of. I told you I don't need a chest THIS size to impress anyone nor will I throw away my childhood at the drop of a dime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer soft tears continued to fall as she clinched one of her fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm am who I am shadow and I can't change that but at the same time I won't change into something that I'm NOT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mirror suddenly shattered into pieces after Rise had driven her fist into it. Amazingly the surprising action did not cause any sort of injury to her, although for a moment she nearly lose her balance due to new size up top, instead began a sort of chain reaction as each mirror shattered one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute passed and all that could be heard through the formerly mirrored hallway now littered with dozens of glass shards was Rise's soft breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The party's over...no more games shadow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise took a step forward tip-toeing over the glass remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well all determined are we. Aw that's going to shy away some viewers I'm sure more people enjoyed it when you were a weeping mess. Regardless if you face me now you have no real chance of victory. You're no fighter Rise neither was your Persona. You can not win...but come on then prove me and everyone watching wrong that you're no whore that you don't need my help to nab Souji-kun. The final curtain is just about to rise, Rise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow's sinister laugh echoed as Rise silently continued onward toward the end of the hallway, a lone stairway marking her next destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in a breath and ignoring the slight breast inflation due to such an action Rise proceeded up the steps...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around Rise noticed that the stairs had led to a room similar to the one where her friends had fought her shadow the first time around, dance pole included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome Risketeers the final portion of our programming is upon us and it seems our special guest still doesn't get it through her empty head that she should enjoy the enhancements being given to her. After all what man doesn't want to use his girl's breasts as a head rest? Apparently stupid Rise disagrees so it seems that Risette is going to have to teach her ignorant self a little thing or two personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here she comes...\" mumbled Rise, she was tired from all this foolery and really she wasn't exactly sure how she was going to combat her shadow but knew she had to give it her best shot. This madness had to end here and now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last Shadow Rise reappeared before Rise Kujikawa.</span></div></div>",

Is it my new height that's shocking? Everyone wanted more Rise so i gave it to them and then some! But Rise, your the cause of my new height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise: what do you mean!? how could i ever want to see you bigger then before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow Rise: The more you deny me, the bigger i become and you have been denying me since you arrived. i was normal sized at first but now here i stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Entirely new to Rise as she never expected to encounter her Shadow version at such a large size meaning that this fight was gonna become much harder for her to win then she first thought. Rise wasn't a fighter at first and thought even she could take down her shadow self but it seem's that anything can happen in the TV world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise: I'll still find a way to defeat you no matter what! You won't get away with anything else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow Rise: And just how do you dare try to stop me? you can't fight and even if you did try to attack your attack's would be like bug's attacking my ankle. I wouldn't even feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she had a point. If Rise was gonna try to do some effect damage, she'd have to make sure it was powerful enough to damage a 40 ft shadow. She then had a idea. If Rise could make it so that her Shadow self couldn't move, she would be able to get enough time to come up with a plan good enough to defeat the Shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise: Even if you say your me, i'll never accept you! No matter how much you look like me or sound like me, i'll never accept you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, Shadow Rise smiled and grew even bigger and bigger as her huge breasts swelled up bigger as well with her moaning some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow Rise: mmmmmm! That's right Rise, keep on denying me. Make me bigger and bigger and stronger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had reached 55 ft tall, Shadow Rise was stuck in the room and couldn't even see past her own massive bust. This was Rise's chance as she turned around and began to run the best she could while trying to keep balance from her bigger bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow Rise: You can run Rise but i'll find you! You can't escape from me! I AM YOU!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise: NO! YOU WILL NEVER BE ME!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise soon made it back outside of the striptease and was panting some from all the running she had to do and the extra weight she had to carry thanks to her bigger bust but she knew she now had a chance of to at least come up with a plan while her shadow self was trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so she thought as the top of the striptease began to creak some which caused her to turn around with her eyes wide as she couldn't believe what she was hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise: It can't be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow Rise soon busted through the roof of the Striptease as she was now at least 70 ft tall with her breasts nearly as big as her now while having a devious smirk on her face. Rise took this chance to quickly run and look for a place to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow Rise: I told you you can't escape from me! NOW WHERE ARE YOU!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise soon hide behind some large bushes and a few trees that were near by as she panted more trying to catch her breath from the running. She hoped she had gotten far enough away from her Shadow self to think of any kind of plan and a way to stop her from growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unknown to her, a mysterious shadow of a person crept up closer and reached out to her as it was none other then...................</span></div></div>",

If you decline...well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sinister shadow leaned in once more and placed a quick peck Rise's lips passing yet another cup size (didn't seem like much compared to all she was already carrying) onto the immobilized redhead. Apparently her shadow's breasts were still relatively large despite having passed on most of their weight onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the dark tormentor could easily bloat up her chest to it's previous size if not more so allowing Rise to figure that she could do this all day till she did in fact reach bus size breasts. She silently whimpered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you say Rise? Do the smart thing and just say \"I accept you\", it's real easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted defeated and broken by emotion Rise realized her shadow was right. There really was nothing she could do to prevent the further expansion of her chest, she'd regain desperate mobility, and would do everything in her power to prevent her senpai from being ridiculed to hell and back for dating a potential circus freak...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-chan!\" yelled out Yosuke as he, Souji, and the others came barging in unannounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shadow huffed in anger before backing away from the former pop idol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well damn just as I was going to get a confession out of her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here, Rise-chan!\" chimed in Chie a moment later however she gasped sharply at the \"new\" Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-chan!\" Yukiko exclaimed a deep feeling of concern in her outcry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-chan's boobs are HUGE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddie grumbled in pain after Yosuke had slapped him across his furry head for stating the \"perverted\" obvious. Even though he mentally agreed since one could see that he and Kanji were fighting equal nose-bleeds. Yosuke however was amazed at how Souji seemed unfazed...or maybe he just has a damn good poker face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you reshape her the way you have.\" yelled out Naoto as she took aim at Rise's shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? No no no Naoto-kun...it was all Rise's doing. She wants to be a big girl so I gave her a bust size worthy of fame. She is me and we are Risette after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow laughed as Rise whimpered in shame. While thankful for her friends to show up when they did she was also ashamed at how disgusting she must look to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You monster you change her back right now else we'll smash you to pieces!\" growled Chie as she took a bold step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Chie-Senpai you should really watch your tongue. Wouldn't want anything unfortunate to occur now would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow smiled in sadistic fashion, a plan already forming in it's mind.</span></div></div>",

Now for you Yukiko-senpai, oh how jealous I am, you're my rival when it comes to cup size. Maybe I should curse you to never have a size bigger then me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE STOP.\" Rise shouted breaking into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mwwwwwa!\" Shadow Rise blew a giant lip shaped bubble from her lips her slightly smaller then bus sized breasts returning to Rise's original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch this, Shadow Rise's Super Special Super Sized Love Bubble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RUN SENPAI!\" Rise shouted as the bubble was launched towards Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys got in the way. \"Sorry guys...girls only...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bubble passed right through them, not affecting them in the slightest, Yukiko shrieked in terror as the bubble approached. Suddenly Naoto and Chie leaped in. \"Don't worry Yuki we'll take it with you! No way is your chest getting that big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bubble collided with the trio, Chie's chest was Double that of Rise's, Naoto 25% more and Yukiko a single cup size bigger. \"Awww damn... guess I got to make a new one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow Rise's chest got even bigger then before! Rise's tear filled eyes stared at them, then she looked at her friends who where bemoaning their chest sizes, there wasn't much time, Rise had to act or not act.

But in all honestly that wasn't correct at all instead by using us a bait her counter self knew she (Rise) would willingly give in if it meant we would be spared from any danger.

Wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanji was officially confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to simplify in order for her breasts to be restored to what they originally were Rise must accept herself and her shadow truthfully. The fact that she was tricked into acceptance is what allowed her shadow to unleash one last cruel trick upon her. There is indeed a method to all of this madness and that something is what must be conquered if Rise wishes to return to how she was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least that is my belief...but I pray that I'm not wrong with any of this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what could that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise Yosuke was stunned to see Souji no longer standing beside him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell's Senpai doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanji yelled out quite wide-eyed as he pointed out into the distance where Souji's dashing form could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH what's Sensei doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's it huh...heh guess it should have been obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious the group all stared at Yosuke waiting for him to fill them all in on the sudden revelation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise's flesh was so ridiculously soft Souji almost felt as he would simply sink into the creamy bust he continued to make his way through her monstrous mounts. At times however he could faintly make out her sobs and pain filled screams in ways it pained the boy to hear the former idol in so much physical and mental pain yet he would only use this as a motivation to reach her of her faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she wept Rise wondered what was left for her as far as her life went. Her friends were safe (at least she believed them to be safe) but now she was confine to this world seeing as how she was strapped to the ground by THE largest set of breasts in all existence thus making it impossible for her move and on the rare chance she could actually get the twins off the ground where could she go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't a TV screen big enough on the entire planet to squeeze her through, hell even if she somehow got through she'd most likely bury all of Inaba underneath her mighty boobs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were hopeless for the poor girl until she heard her name be called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sen...Senpai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true someway Souji had scaled and broken through her seemingly endless sea of cleavage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Souji! Souji-kun!\" squealed a delighted Rise as she laid exhausted at top of her gigantic bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gray-haired boy smiled as he crawled over to her and before either could speak another word locked lips with the tired redhead. Surprised for a moment Rise allowed the warmth of her love to surge through her. Did he not care? Was her crush as good a person as she had thought he was? Did he really care for her despite everything that had occurred?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got her answer when Souji broke away for a moment leaned into her ear and silenced her fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I love you too, Souji!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she struggled a bit Rise was still able to press her lips yet again with young man that she loved so dearly.</span></div></div>",

Of course no one outside of her close friends had come to know of such a feat but in the aftermath, and finding true love with Souji Seta, Rise had been left with an extraordinary power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow through the bond she shared with herself, her shadow, and Souji she had gained the ability to alter her bust size not just hers but apparently any woman's seeing as how she had for the most part repaired the damage done to her friends by her shadow self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile ever thankful for the rescue, and for getting closer with Souji (she had just come off spending the weekend with him, Nanako, and Dojima), Rise had used portions of her free time to get a better hand on her new power. It was after all a great responsibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part it seem that she was doing just that.

We all know Shadows are just the extremist versions of ourselves.\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai, are you still jealous that I have a bigger bust?\" Rise asked sounding worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda, I'm not going to treat you differently though.\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Senpai.\" Rise said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem.\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two walked to school they talked about various things, Rise was trying to get Chie to crack a stupid joke so she could laugh and kiss her hand while she does so, she had a special 'kiss' ready, a time delayed one. Eventually Chie made a stupid joke she heard on TV and Rise laughed before planting two red lip marks on Chie's breath with a blown kiss, speaking of kiss she got one when she was met with her boyfriend Souji. \"Hey handsome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you two love birds hurry up, class starts in 10 minutes.\" Chie said leaving the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at each other lovingly, holding each other tightly before kissing passionately, a cup size was added as she leaned into him, the breasts up against his chest. \"So how about after school tomorrow you and me have a nice afternoon together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji nodded and kissed her again before the two headed for their classes. During the 2nd year's class Chie stretched as she yawned not realizing she was being looked at by some fans of her, they memorized her cup size and knew that wasn't it, that was a cup and a quarter bigger. No one noticed except them, not Yukiko, not Souji, just her fans. \"Lunchtime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie went up to the rooftop to eat already seeing the Lovers of Rise and Souji up there. \"Oh I was going to eat up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come sit here anyway Chie-senapi, I'm sure Souji-kun wouldn't mind, would you sweetie?\" Rise gave a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh geez, you two are like something out of a lover story or something.\" Chie sat down some distance to give the two space, Rise saw, those breasts were looking two cup sizes bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Chie didn't expect was Rise's plan in case Chie did come up, on Souji's cheek was a red lip mark, as Souji was a guy her kisses didn't effect him so she rubbed Souji's cheek saying he had something on it, she then blew the red mark leaving a double effect on Chie's delayed breast growth. \"Well Lunchtime is almost over, see you later Senapi, Souji-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise left as Chie got up stretching. \"My back's been aching today, maybe I need a back rub later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise loved it, she had started to master her power well. She needed to try it on another friend, perhaps she and Yukiko could be rivals sharing the same size, or how about Naoto? She needs some womanhood on her, Rise had a finger on her now magic lips smiling devilishly thinking who her next target will be.</span></div></div>",

That girl really needs to do a better job of embracing her inner-female. True she's gotten better but maybe having a bit more up top will help her see that you can be a genius and be busty at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was that Naoto would be the next \"victim\" Rise would use to test out her power, even though she humbly believed all she was doing was improving their lives in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought in mind, Rise smiled as she entered her next class...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last bell rang for the day with every member of the student body more then happy to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise took a moment to kiss Souji goodbye, this time making sure she didn't bloat up her chest by accident, informing the boy that she had to take care of something first but would be sure to give him and Nanako a call later. Souji understood completely and bid her farewell with a soft hug, unaware of what his love was planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting outside the gate was proving to be rather tiresome but Rise knew this would be the best time to catch Naoto unaware. To pass the time she secretly blew a few kisses to random passerby female students increasing their bust a few inches to a quarter, hardly noticeable or at the very least nothing that couldn't be passed off as a minor growth spurt during teenage years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh\" she chuckled in a near silent tone before turning her attention back to waiting for Naoto.</span></div></div>",

Well sadly the Shadow is right, taping your breasts up does somewhat damage a woman's breast. I've been considering stopping it.\" Naoto said thinking hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise blew a kiss as Naoto was deep in thought. \"Plus...I think they've been tighter lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto said adjusting the tape to make it looser, which Rise planned on, by the time Naoto didn't feel tightness her breasts were visible. \"I guess they really were tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise smiled, her kisses were pretty much perfected. \"Well I must be off Rise-chan, I will talk to you tomorrow.\" Naoto said, turning her back was a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise pointed her lip mark with her finger in a gun motion. \"Bang...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fired a time delayed kiss. \"Tonight you'll be a brand new woman Naoto-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise smiled.

While staying with her grandmother in the backwater town of Inaba Rise was not only wrapped in it's biggest mystery murder case to date but along the way made and forged bonds with some truly wonderful people, friends that above all else she considers family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever at one point Rise was thrown in yet another troublesome situation which was what led her to gaining use of a special ability that even now is only unique to her and her alone. A power which was kept secret to only her close circle of friends, even her own children weren't aware of it...of course considering her eldest was two and the youngest barely six months old well there wasn't any reason to bring up the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of her children Rise giggled as she watched her two-year-old redheaded daughter play with her \"Auntie\" Chie. The blonde woman laughed as she carried the child on her shoulders, the little girl joining in with sweet laughter as it held on to Chie and the police cap the child had taken from the young officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you spoil her so much.\" commented a smiling Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah maybe but I can't help it your children are adorable, Rise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redheaded woman nodded in agreement as she peered down at her sleeping six-month-old son resting peacefully in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the Seta household Chie asked if Souji was home Rise explained that he wasn't for the moment he was out with Junes' manager Yosuke, sewing instructor Kanji, and of course Junes mascot Teddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was a tad disappointed at the news, after all she still considered Souji her BFF as far as her guy friends went, but was reassured by Rise that he would around when she'd stop by again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater sipping on a cup of fresh tea and after finally getting her hat back from the two-year-old (the kids were back in bed now) Chie mentioned how good it was to get some rest. Apparently Nanako-chan wasn't kidding when she said her father would get home dead-tired at times, a comment that made both ladies chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a knock at the door. Rise excused herself to see who was on the other side. To her surprise it was Chie's superior and partner not to mention their close friend, Naoto!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile the young mother allow the detective entry into her home. Naoto thanked Rise and wasn't at all surprised to see Chie lounging on a nearby recliner. Chie nearly choking on her tea as she eyed Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I can explain! I mean it's not like I was avoiding duty or anything! I just ran into Rise and well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie quieted down as Naoto raised a simple hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright I won't report this...again...\" she stressed with a minor sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise laughed as she watched the interaction between the two women. Yes Naoto for close to a decade now had been dressing more womanly. Her breasts no longer taped down instead showing off their bigger then average size, tight pants however were still out for her though. Guess some things never change thought the redhead amusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting herself up Chie thanked Naoto for the yet another free pass, Rise could only assume at how lucky and happy Chie must be with the blue-haired woman being her partner. At the same time Rise wasn't surprised when Chie hugged and gave Naoto a small peck on the cheek causing the younger woman to blush slightly and blurt out something under her breath. Chie understood though and finishing the the tea in record fashion thanked Rise for the treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise offered some to Naoto who politely declined however staying that the two of them should get going, HQ wanting them to look into a supposed traffic incident, but Rise wasn't beaten so easily. A few moments later as the two ladies were making for the door Rise stuffed a container of still fresh tea into Naoto's arms stating that she and Chie may need it if they stay out long into the night. Afterwards the blue-haired woman sighed softly before thanking her dear friend for her continuing kindness, as did Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving waved goodbye to the friends in the police force Rise closed the door behind her. She smiled thinking back how of everyone in the group Naoto and Chie were the least likely to end up together and yet...a small laughter escaped her lips as she went on with her evening activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhispering simple words to her crying baby boy Rise made her way toward the kitchen, thankful that the crying hadn't awoken up her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay mommy's here.\" she mumbled softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat on one of the kitchen table chairs Rise adjusted a portion of her nightgown and with a simple thought increased the size of her breasts. A part of her wanted to go with two cups but ultimately she decided one was enough for her son to get his fill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door suddenly parted open with Rise smiling as she heard the oh so familiar voice of her husband. She called out to him informing the young man that she was in the kitchen. Setting his briefcase down on the couch Souji strolled in and smiled at the scene of his wife feeding their son making his way over he kissed her fully on the lips, which instinctively caused Rise to swell up her bust to that second cup she had pondering about earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji pointed it out to Rise who scowled him in a playful fashion. She was just about to shrink them back when Souji locked lips with her once more. For a moment she thought twice about it and ultimately decided to keep them as they were just for tonight.</span></div></div>",

This answers it, she somehow triggered the natural production of milk a woman has, thereby increasing Rise-chan's bust without silicon or any method that's considered unnatural, the Rise we all know would never go through operations to look better. Even her Shadow had that much decency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all well and good, but how does that help the situation?\" Yosuke asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We drink the milk inside.\" Naoto said quite frankly despite looking quite disturbed by the prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" Everyone was shocked by the plan, they looked to see that there was milk on the breast Kanji squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, what did we come here to do? Help Rise. This may be the only way we can do so. Now I'll volunteer, whose with me?\" The party looked to each other before Yukiko stepped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help, I know Rise was a little shallow when it came to comparing out breasts but I know she doesn't want these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help too, I'll tag in when one of you needs some breathing room.\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone else?\" Naoto asked, as much as the guys liked Rise, this was way too odd even for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guess it's us girls...\" Yukiko and Naoto walked up and climbed the fat to the nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can drink it all that's good but there's a chance we can inform Rise of the plan, I'd think she'd rather have losable weight then permanent Blimp Breasts.\" Naoto said giving the two results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls nodded. It was either drink it all up or drink until they inform Rise and she takes the rest. This was their plan, they'd be fat and have big breasts, but at least they'd save their friend from these Monster Mammary glands. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rise's shadow was laughing. Souji, Yosuke and Kanji ran forward. After all, they were the ones immune to the effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise: \"You think you're so tough, huh...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gracefully dodged to the side as Souji's katana sliced the air next to her. At least, as gracefully as someone with boobs the side of pumpkins could move. Then she jumped back as Yokuke slashed the air in front of her. Finally, she heard a roar from behind her as Kanji leapt straight at her. She jumped into the air, almost seeming to hover. Kanji tried to change directions, but it was too late. He crashed right into Yosuke and Souji, bringing them both to the ground. Then, while they were in a neat little pile, Rise's shadow snapped, and a domed barrier appeared over thrm. They were trapped and out of the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie: \"Crap! Looks like it's up to us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow Rise giggled a bit, and increased her breast size a bit more, back to hiw she was when Rise first confronted her. She looked up at her opponents. Chie was the largest, by far. She had taken full breath of air, and then part of the kiss. Her shirt was on the verge of ripping, with her breasts sticking out almost a full foot in front of her. Naoto was next in size. The buttons on her shirt had popped off, leaving her chest bubbled out around 3/4 the size of Chie. Then, there was Yukiko. She had only barely been hit by the bubble aimed at her, meaning she had only gained probably one cup size. But still, that put a bit of a strain on her red school shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nS. Rise: \"Let's see... Eenie, meanie, miney...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko: \"Persona!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nS. Rise: \"You!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yukiko summoned her persona and launched a beam of fire, Rise took a second to build up a kiss. She jumped back, as thr beam hit the ground in front of her, creating a wall of smoke. Then, out of the smoke, came a bubble. It flew like a bullet, hitting Yukiko square in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie: \"No!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko recoiled, as her chest tingled. She put on hand to her breasts, as they began swelling out. They went from slightly above moderate, to the size of watermelons. Yukiko stumbled a bit, getting used to the new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie: \"Right, NOW I'm mad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto: \"Chie, no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie ran forward to meet the still smirking Shadow. She immediately went for a round-house kick. The shadow bent back, underneath the attack. It chest, thiugh, couldn't quite clear it, and Chie landed her kick. Her foot, though, bounced right off. As the shadow's hands reached the ground behind it, it sprung backwards kicking up as it't feet passed by. Normally, Chie would have been fine. But now, with the added weight of her basketball-sized boobs, she could get away fast enough. The kicks struck her square on the nose. She stepped back, as her tear reflex activated. In that moment she was blinded, the shadow stepped right up to her, and kissed her. Chie's eyes widened as her breasts forced their way outwards again. They tore through her jacket and broke her bra. as they reached the size od Yoga-balls. Then, the shadow considered it's handiwork done. Finally, it turned to Nao- Actually, it first noticed Yukiko's shirt was barely holding on. It puckered up, and blew a kiss towards her. Yukiko gasped and blushed as her chest puffed out another two cup sizes. Of course, this finally broke the last buttons of her shirt, but it also sent her to the floor, as she lost balance again. Finally, she turned back to Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto: \"Garudyne!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe summoned her persona, which launched a huge gust of wind which began to swirl around the shadow like a tornado. The shadow giggled. It breathed in heavily, completely absorbing the wind... which went straight to her rack. Her breasts ballooned out again, but still seemed as light as ever. Finally, the shadow fired the bubble. It sped away like a bullet. It was faster than all the ithers, and Naoto hadn't been expecting it. As such, she could only brace herself as her breasts became the size of globes, like you would find in classrooms. She too was brought down by the weight.</span></div></div>",

She burped lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise: <i>Man, this sure has a lot of carbonation in it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise shrugged it off, and went to her room to get ready for bed. As she entered her room, she felt a strange sensation from her stomach. It was like a bubble was building up inside her belly. Then, the bubble seems to split. Part of the bubble shifted up, towards her chest, while the rest shifted down, towards her rear. Then, suddenly, the feeling seemed to pop. She felt a burp build up, but she could get rid of it. Then, she felt a weird warmth in her chest, and then tightness from her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise: <i>Huh... I thought this shirt was pretty loose this morning...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise's mother liked to buy her clothes a bit big, in case she would grow anymore. After all, Rise was a teenager. This meant her school uniform was a bit loose, even on her well-endowed form. But now, her shirt felt a bit taught against her chest. She looked across her room at a full body mirror she used to check out outfits. She didn't seem much different, so she just chalked up her weird feelings to her tiredness. After all, it was a late evening after school and a shopping date. She put one of her hands on her breasts. She didn't feel anything weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise: <i>Well, I guess that settles it-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her boobs puffed out, pushing against her hand and spreading out her fingers. Looking in the mirror, they seemed almost a full cup size bigger. They strained against her now-tight uniform top. Even if she stood with her shoulders hunched, her bust stuck out noticeably further than normal. Then, she felt a warmth lower down, around her butt. Then, she felt her skirt rub against her legs as it moved, without her moving at all. She looked in the mirror. For a second, she though her skirt was riding up a bit more than usual. A quick check over her shoulder confirmed her suspicions. Her rear was growing, just like her chest had. After only a few seconds, it made her skirt flare out behind her, like someone had shoved two balls of dough up her skirt. Finally, the burp she had felt at the top of her throat this whole time squeaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise: <i>Seriously, how much carbonation did that Elixir... Wait...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elixir. It had come in that hourglass-shaped bottle. Looking in the mirror, she was even closer to an hourglass figure than she had been before she drank that Elixer. Plus, it had had way too much carbonation. She poked her breasts. They bounced lightly, even though you would think melons that big would be quite heavy. Thinking about it, there was one perk that stood out at the front of her mind. Maybe Souji-senpei would like ger like this... or bigger. Thus, she decided to buy Elixer tomorrow to experiment with. Getting ready for bed and barely squeezing into her pajamas, she thought about her plans, and realized...</span></div></div>",

I don't think I ate THAT much..</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put a hand on her stomach and burped again. That soda was making her super gassy. She felt she's swollowed a balloon. Suddenly, she felt her belly push against her hand. She hesitated. Maybe that was just her breathing. She took a deep breathe and felt her belly expand under her hands, and held it. Her belly kept growing. She looked at herself in the mirror. With her belly pushed out like this, she looked pregnant. She let the breathe and continued rubbing her belly. It barely slowed its growth. After a few more seconds, her belly finally stopped growing. It looked like she had swollowed a basetball. Then...</span></div></div>",

Her belly was tight against the waistband if her skirt, probably since the skin wasnt ised to stretching. Poking her belly, it was taught but bouncy. Her finger would press in, but with quite a bit of resistance. Then, she thought of something. She put both hands on her stomach and pushed. Her hands sank in. She pushed a little harder, and felt her stomach bubble a bit. When she lifted her hands her stomach was flat again. She celebrated a little. But then, she felt a similar bubbling feeling across her rear. She thought she felt a bit of movement with her skirt. She reached behind her... and was met by a huge butt. All the air had shifted straight there. When she sqeezed it, she felt the same thing she had with her belly. Yeilding, but springy. She pulled over her chair, and tried to sit down. She felt like she was sitting on an airbed. As she sat down, the bounce easily sprung her back to her feet. Then, she though of something. She put one hand against her belly and the other against her butt. Then, she pushed. Once again, she felt her body bubble a bit on the inside, and she felt resistance against her hand on her belly. But she refused to let the air back there. She felt the bubbles rise, until her chest puffed out significantly. There was a pop as one of the buttons on her shirt came off. Lookng in the mirror, she had jumped up probably two cup sizes at once. Of course, that would be a bit too noticeabke of a change, so she tried squeezing her breasts. She felt the bubbling sensation, but stopped halfway through. She felt her butt grow a little, but not as much as it had before. Poking her chest, her boobs also hadn't lost all their air. They were still a full cup size larger than normal. She should probay go buy some more bras, since hers started to dig into her chest. Now how does she experiment with her new powers?</span></div></div>",

I did prescribe you a simple cold medicine just in case though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto Shirogane nodded as she took the medical note from her doctor's gloved hand. The ace detective then thanked the much older brunette for squeezing her in for a check up this late into the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh one more thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity filled Naoto as she stopped just a foot from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-chan I know it's normally not my place for such statements but you're...well a tad bit underweight. While you seem more embracing of your figure lately I still suggest you increase your weight to at least normal standards for someone your age. It really isn't healthy to be rail-thin...despite what the media may paint into people's minds. Of course being obese isn't right either but you get the point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto chuckled slightly along with the doctor, Ms. Haruno's simple but fun sense of humor was perhaps the reason Naoto had kept the same physician since her childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. Thank you for the information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime Naoto-chan. Take care now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way home Naoto thought back to what she was told. It was actually surprising to know she was underweight. Then again she was always keeping herself busy. Subconsciously she looked down at herself for the longest time she had believe she was of normal weight. She poked away at her jacket-covering stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it would be best if I added just a bit to bring me to standards...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto paused in her tracks for a moment wondering how she should go about such a feat. Obviously her friends would be willing to help was her first thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes maybe something at Junes would be good, there was the Amagi Inn, and Chie was always running out for meat of some sort. Of course there was Rise but her family ran a tofu shop...and tofu wasn't exactly fattening and it would be downright rude to simply show up at Souji's door looking for a meal so those two choices were obviously out.</span></div></div>",

I like the sound of that.\" Naoto smiled, hearing this made her task all the easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to the counter and looked at the new selection, she then ordered a sandwich of ham, cheese, lettuce, and tomato. \"Yes that'll be all for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto was then handed a freshly made sandwich big one, she wondered if her mouth could fit it, she sat down and ate it, wonderful! \"I can taste each ingredient, and each of them tastes like they were freshly made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto ate the sandwich quite fast but still in a somewhat refined manner, after she was done she licked her lips. \"Senpai was right, I do want seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back up, she then decided to try something different. \"I'll take a...cheese steak sandwich?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was then handed a long roll with steak cut into flat strips with melted cheese in it, she blinked having never seen it before. \"I've never seen this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's all the rage on the East Coast of the United States, in fact the person who designed this new menu was a State born Dietitian whose stopping by in Inaba.

I'm sure I can reach a decent weight with a practiced Dietitian's help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto has learned the new menu was made by a Western Dietitian who is currently in Inaba and that he has a book teaching on how to bring the taste out of food the best.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Thank you so much Shirogane-san!\" Naoto had heard that phrase more times then she could count in the past few weeks. It had seemed that for some reason a number of rather poor attempts of dine and dashing and thefts attempts at various grocery stores had occurred at the local diners and markets of Inaba. \"<i>What exactly is causing this string of petty criminal acts?</i>\" Naoto thought to herself as she stuffed another 5 coupons and \"free meal\" tickets into her pockets. With all the small crimes she had stopped, she had amassed a big enough number of coupons to feed herself for well over the next few months. \"<i>I understand that the owners felt grateful for me keeping their supplies safe, but should they really be giving me all these rewards every time I solve their cases?</i>\" Naoto thought for a moment, but decided to forget the oddity of the events as her stomach growled. Seeing as she had nothing to do today, as it seemed Yu-kun (using the anime and from Persona 4 Arena here) and all the others were off doing various other things, the highschooler decided to go use up one of dozens of coupons at the well known diner Aiya Diner, after all it was having one of its famous or rather infamous \"Rainy Day Special Mega Beef Bowl Challenge\" and to be honest she had been thinking of taking on its challenge for quite some time now after hearing of it from her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Shirogane-san, welcome! I assume you're here to make use of one of your free meal coupons?\" the chef smiled as the young woman walked up to the counter. <br>\r\n\"Yes, I would like a pork ramen bowl with extra pork...and I would also like to take on the Rainy Day Special.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright...that'll be coming right up!\" the chef began working on preparing various meals alongside Naoto's.<br>\r\n\"I wonder what this challenge is like?\" Naoto muttered as she reminisced of a time where Chie had mentioned taking on the challenge, even with starving herself for 2 days she hadn't even finished an eighth of it. Another time, Yu-senpai had trained himself for days on end and only had finished a quarter. It seemed that whatever this Mega Beef Bowl was, it was surely quite the task. She chuckled slightly upon imagining the shock of her friends upon finding out that she had accomplished it, if she did in fact reach that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, one pork ramen bowl with extra pork free of charge and one Mega Beef Bowl!\" the chef said as he placed the orders down in front of Naoto.<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" Naoto trailed off as she took in just how massive the Mega beef truly was. Putting her hands on the furthest edges of the bowl, her hands were separated by a good 14 inches, and the bowl itself was 6 inches tall.  Looking at her pork ramen, with its pitiable bowl sitting next to the gargantuan king of Mega Beef, she took it in her hand and dumped it into the Rainy Day Special. Determined not to lose to mere dish of noodles, she broke apart her chopsticks and dived right into the dish.  Knowing that to properly maximize her chances at completing the challenge, Naoto paced herself as she ate, not going too slow or too fast, she also took a sip from her glass of water to relax her throat. Continuing on for 20 minutes, she was making her way through the first quarter of the special. However, due to her being so focused on her goal, the detective girl failed to notice she was steadily gaining weight. As she made her way to about halfway through the bowl, Naoto had easily put on 30 or so pounds. Her uniform was getting tighter and tighter as time went on, fat was developing in her breasts and her ass was starting to envelop her seat. Her weight gain and her progress in the Rainy Day Special began to attract the attention of everyone in the restaurant. As the girl continued, she began to lose track of her surroundings and started to let out random burps from her lips and every now and then would slurp directly from the bowl. Going further and further, Naoto had gained 70 pounds from the challenge already with only a quarter left, and it looked like she wasn't stopping anytime soon. Finally, after a grand total of 1 hour and 20 minutes, Naoto had finished the Rainy Day Special, and thanks to  applause of the crowd around her, regained complete awareness of the situation at hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?...What the?!\" Naoto looked down at herself and was shocked, her uniform was now taut and stained with the soup and noodles from her meal, she had somehow despite all logic and physical impossibilities gained 100 pounds in the short time she had been here. She very much now rather chubby, and her figure was looking far more feminine due to the heaping amount of fat in her body now.  \"How did I...?\" Naoto said to herself as she was interrupted by the chef.<br>\r\n\"Well...I must say Shirogane-san, I didn't think you would complete it, but you did. As such you get that meal for free.<br>\r\nGlad that she had gotten herself full in more ways then one at no cost to herself, Naoto however couldn't help but obsess over her fuller figure. Her larger gut and breasts, the faint touch to them caused both to shake in a manner that to some extent, pleasured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from her seat, she made an order to the chef.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was still rather odd and foreign to her and she wanted to retain some her usual professionalism so she stopped herself from going any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind instead focusing on how she would explain her sudden weight gain to the others.

During her time in Inaba and with the Investigation Team, Naoto had come to discover that behind her outgoing, bubbly personality; Rise Kujikawa was a dangerous girl, with a keen awareness and willingness to use her own manipulative abilities against anyone who may have wronged her, or simply unfortunate enough to catch her in a playful mood. Especially if she had caught them in a less-than-stellar moment such as the one Naoto was currently experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God...\" Rise muttered as she gave Naoto a wide-eyed gaze of astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-san...I-I can explain...\" Unfortunately, the normally-composed detective struggled to get a grasp on her electrified nerves, delivering instead a series of choking noises and uncomfortable-sounding mumbles, in a desperate to say something. <i>anything</i>, before Rise could take the first action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naoto fumbled on her umpteenth attempt at beginning a sentence, an unlikely noise had halted her frenzy. Particularly; a noise which sounded like giggling. Particularly; giggling which was coming from Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-kun...you look absolutely <i>adorable</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto could only give Rise a wide-eyes look of complete dumbfondedness, followed by a very un-Naoto-like squeak as the flustered detective was caught off-guard by a very Rise-typical hug, which held little difference from the ones Rise had given her in the past- save for the inability to wrap her arms completely around hefty detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Rise-san...p-please stop!\" Naoto begged, her cheeks burning a deep shade of red as Rise nuzzled her head near Naoto's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn either a show of restrain or mercy, perhaps even both, Rise had let Naoto free from her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're like a big, cuddly stuffed animal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto was about to voice her disdain with being likened to a stuffed animal, but Rise playfully grabbing a mound of her sloshy belly made her let out a yelp instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smooth on the surface...but soft and squishy on the inside, this is totally like you, Naoto-kun!\" Rise said as she slowly kneaded the handful of flab. Naoto could only respond by reddening even more, slightly from Rise's uncharitable comparison between her body and personality, but mainly from the fact that Rise had a very pleasurable touch that was making it difficult for Naoto to rationalize, let alone think straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough...'playing' with...me, <i>please</i>...Rise...\" Naoto begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another show of sour-faced mercy, Rise let go of Naoto, but not without giving her belly a quick parting slap, sending small ripples throughout it's flabby surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Naoto-kun...\" Rise apologized, her playful tone suddenly gone. \"It's just I didn't expect to see you...this way so sudden, and you're reaction was just super-<b>CUTE</b>.\" A slight squeal trailed from that last thought; a squeal that she usually reserved for anything involving Yu-senpai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...suppose that could be understandable...\" Naoto accepted, giving a firm tug to the tip of her hat in a bid to avoid looking directly at Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if it's not too much to ask, how on Earth did this...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Right, I apologize for not explaining earlier...\" Truth was, Naoto had intended from the very start to explain herself, an explanation that Rise's intervening had cut short. After giving a very thorough explanation detailing her triumph over the Rainy Day Special, as well as a recipe rearrangement she had discovered firsthand, resulting in the fairly apparent conclusion, all the detective could do was fall into silence, bracing herself for Rise's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome, Naoto-kun! You're probably the only one to have ever finished the Rainy Day Special! But it totally sucks that you didn't know it would...umm...do <i>that</i>... But look on the bright side! Doing the challenge a second time should be a breeze for you! And if I could say it again; those pounds just make you look way <i>beyond</i> adorable. Especially when you're all super embarrassed. Ooh!  That gives me an idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that's good Rise.\" Naoto sputtered, uneasy as to what idea Rise was scheming. \"ButitsgettinglateandIshouldbe-\" She had hoped to leave before Rise could...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't be such a party pooper, Naoto-kun!\" Too late; Rise had already wrapped her arm around Naoto's, her firm squeeze signaling no intention of letting herself go \"We have to celebrate your victory over the Rainy Day Special, and we'll do it by...\"</span></div></div>",

As neither did Rise having joked that she was thankful that Naoto hadn't been charged for two tickets. - But before long (although for Naoto, it had already been too long), the duo had arrived in Okina's shopping district. And Rise, having knowledge of the district that came second nature, wasted no time in dragging Naoto to - as she described in her own words, \"Is the <i>perfect</i> place that will make you irresistible!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retrospect, Naoto was sorely beginning to miss the memory of the train ride to Okina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-san, I'll only say this one more time; could we please lea--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh, not listening, Naoto-kun.\" Rise repeated in a lilting tone. \"I made a promise that one day I would see you actually dress like a girl. And today, I'm keeping on that promise! Oooh- this looks nice...\" Rise said as she musingly grabbed another dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is demeaning...\" Naoto muttered, doing her best to shrink into the corner as much as her larger frame would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-kun, If you're gonna be such a sourpuss, I'm only going to look at more stuff; speaking of which...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto preemptively winced at what was to likely follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise shoved a handful of dress-holding hangers close to Naoto's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to try one of these on. Y'know, to see how you look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto passed a quick glance at the dresses, only to return a cold stare back at Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't give me that look, Naoto-kun. You only have to try on one of them, besides, I'm sure you'll look great no matter which one you pick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly, Naoto swiped the hangers from Rise's hand, proceeding to head to the nearest changing room; her head held low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least try not to look miserable when you come out.\" Rise added before the detective closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving temporarily shut herself away from Rise, Naoto disdainfully examined the dresses, granted; they certainly weren't as revealing as she had initially assumed (and feared), but were still far less concealing and loose-fitting than Naoto would ever be comfortable with wearing, it was likely Rise was being merciful with these choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it still went without saying that Naoto had absolutely <i>zero</i> intention of trying of the dresses on, let alone display herself in them in public place for Rise's amusement. In fact, she gladly obliged to the potential idea of remaining inside the changing room for the indefinite time being, regardless of how childish such an act was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Naoto-kun!\" Rise alerted along with slight knock on the door. \"While you're busy deciding on a dress, I'm going to take a quick look some clothing for myself. Find me when you're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...understand...\" Naoto resigned. No use in arguing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't wait to see what you picked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only the sound of her fading footsteps, Naoto had assumed that Rise had made her temporary leave, what followed in the detective's mind was almost instinctive; it was the perfect opportunity to make an escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so soon, I must wait a bit so I can be almost certain...\" Naoto cautioned herself, the lack of visual aid to distinguish Rise's distance meant the detective had to minimize her risk with delayed pacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter passing a few minutes with repeated recitings of the Featherman R theme, Naoto braced herself as she lifted a hand on the door lock; her pulse picking up in tempo. This would likely be her only chance of, and yet, success was uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding the hinge, the door loosened.

Do I have to remind you? You have friends now, me, Senpai and the others. You're obviously bothered by your sudden weight gain, and you shouldn't have to go through that alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Naoto was impressed with Rise's ability to read people, although she probably had good assumption of Naoto's predicament with prior knowledge from her shadow. <i>Afraid of being alone.</i> It was an fear that Naoto admitted to having, alongside with body image insecurity that came from working in a male-dominated career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit Rise, you do make a valid point.\" Naoto said. \"If you were quick to accept me at this size, then I should have little concern for what the others may think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, see Naoto-kun? I know what I'm talking about.\" Rise replied, glad to see Naoto agree with her, even if she could sense some remaining uncertainty from the detective. \"So let's go and see...\"</span></div></div>",

But for every step listed in the Rainy Day Special recipe, Rise stormed up another 'brilliant' additional ingredient that she felt the recipe couldn't be without. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, Naoto-kun! How about we add--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>No</b>, Rise-san.\" Naoto cut off, clenching her teeth as her generous amount of patience gradually decreased with every instance Rise made a suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, but you didn't even hear me out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm quite certain that the bowl will be perfectly consumable without any additional ingredients.\" Naoto firmly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise's face soured into a childish-looking pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto sighed, she knew Rise would never stop badgering her if she didn't agree to her demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist, Rise.

Oh, and a cherry coke to go with it.\" Naoto said calmly, ignoring the warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-as you wish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, another beef bowl was being cooked for her. Naoto couldn't help but drool a bit as the intoxicating aroma wafted around her nostrils, taking in the scents of the tender pork, the naturally swell balanced and delicate white rice...it all tasted so good, even with her bloated and chubby body she needed to just have one more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bowl was popped right in front of her, along with your standard 12oz can of Cherry Cola. Naoto took her chopsticks stoically and dove in! She found herself eating much, much faster then before, already starting to see a huge portion of the meat nigh on vanish down her throat. She took a sip of her cola, going back to tearing in almost immediately<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buurrp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unladylike belch passed her lips, but she didn't really care. Even as a couple more followed suit and her uniform started to slowly either rip or some undone slowly as more fat packed onto her once lithe body, Naoto continued to eat and eat. It only took her three minutes to get to the rice this time and her stomach seemed to only roar further with hunger as she took the whole bowl and crammed it in her mouth. Alsmost instantaneously her body swelled with more pounds, her breasts billowing forth, her hips widening and flaring out as they became fuller and fatter and her ass expanding and oozing over her stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more please.\" Naoto asked in her usual stoic tone as she reached for her cherry cola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only snowballed from there, folks. Naoto just found herself in a ravenous hunger, every bowl after that failing to satisfy her growing appetite. She ate faster and faster, gaining more and more, hoping the next bowl could fill her, if not the next one or the one after that! Her body just billowed forth faster and faster as her increasing eating speed made her swell out. Her clothes became useless within mere minutes, tearing off and getting caught in her growing folds as she swelled, breaking the stool under her but having enough blubber packed onto her body to pad her from the blow. She began to ooze over the counter, asking politely if she could have the bowls served over her stomach or if they could skip the bowls and for simplicity's sake serve all the pork and rice inside of her growing numerous chins and belly folds, since her gluttony drove her to eat each bowl served. That didn't stop her from, in her cravings, start to rip out other things. In order to make room for her growing bulk, Naoto ripped out the smaller tables and benches behind her, stuffing them in her mouth and rubbing her belly with satisfaction as she felt it swell with even more fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>BBBUUUUUURRRRRPP</b>!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was heard out of Naoto quite a bit. Her massive eating streak, of course, led to massive fits of belching as well, more often then not interrupting her sentences. Being a professional and logically minded, however, Naoto kept a firm grip on her manners and apologized as promptly as she could...sometimes interrupted with another belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's growing folds became further and further stained with grease and bits of rice as she ate (as well as a couple \"wood chips\" from her furniture appetizer) turning her growing belly into a greasy mess. She cared little for weather or not she was a dripping mess so long as it didn't get in the way of her job or her fixation on eating and gorging until she was full, already the blobby bluenette filling out the interior of Aiya, her flabby back squishing against the back wall and her belly flowing over into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>BBBUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRPPPPP!!!</b> Excuse me...fina-<b>BBBUUUUURRRPPP!!!</b> ...Finally, excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto sighed happily, a tranquil smile washing over her face as she rubbed her meaty hands on her full, grease-coated belly. Well, full for now at least...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto had, within only two hours, grown to a blob of roughly 10,000lbs! The five ton detective looked down with a surprisingly nonplussed reaction to her corpulence, her messy, massive belly that squished the poor man at the counter against the wall, causing him to break the lenses on his glasses, her massive ass that seemed to be in danger of busting down the wall behind her with it's bountiful, shapely bulk...and her breasts! Even as a fat blob, Naoto stood out as quite top heavy, the massive fat spheres standing on her chest like massive twin beachballs that squished up against two or three of her chins. Naoto, after apologizing, grabbed a banner from inside the diner and used it as a makeshift tube top, hoping to keep herself half-decent, since at least her belly did more the cover her feminine area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter managing to squeeze through the door (A trial that took 30-minutes and resulted in massive belching fits on Naoto's behalf) the blubbery detective looked around as best she could with her blubbery neck, looking down at her body and smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess a majority complaints about being overweight are nothing more then manifestations of the mind</i>, Naoto mused internally.</span></div></div>",

She rolled her eyes recalling the memory honestly her grandma could be as stubborn as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess that's where she got it from she thought amusingly as she continued to skip down the sidewalk a catchy pop song \"playing\" in her head. Bopping along mouthing the lyrics in silence fashion Rise accidentally failed to notice where she was going that is until she felt her body run into an object that seem to made of pure dough!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so soft, so pleasant to feel Rise almost didn't realized that she had sunk in a bit from the collision.

Admittedly she could have just looked around and spotted the familiar blue cap resting as usual at top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head for moment wondering how Naoto of all people had become so damn enormous, the detective looked like a damn parade balloon only it wasn't air she was stuffed with but pure fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch soft comfortable fat...Rise's thoughts drifted back to when she was nearly enveloped by Naoto's girth after she had collided with it. She was so big...she forcefully pushed those thoughts aside realizing that she was possibly a moment or two away from her face matching the color of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back to get a somewhat better view of her friend's new size Rise was practically stunned at how massive Naoto truly was. Her small yet shapely form she knew her to have was nothing but an afterthought now to this incredible blob she had become!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto was just so big, those puffed up arms and legs, that wondrous belly, a mountainous looking butt, and her breasts...sweet mercy Rise always knew that the girl was top heavy but now she was sure Naoto was in possession of some record-breaking boobs! They were so massive...Rise found herself losing it again as she was able to catch herself in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough to be honest she was beginning to wonder if this was some sort of sign. Admittedly Rise had always found Naoto cute if not adorable there was just something about the ace detective that made her want to be so emotional around Naoto. She couldn't really explain it and now that there was just so much more of her Rise found it almost impossible to resist the need to run up and dive right into Naoto's glorious flab!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever a part of her also wanted to know just how Naoto had made herself so fat in the first place?

At first she was afraid Rise would bounce off comically and break something. Instead, the bubbly idol only sunk comfortably into Naoto's creamy fat, allowing her body to become engulfed in Naoto's belly fat. Rise closed her eyes, as if she were laying on a soft, warm beach. A very soft, squishy beach. Rise rolled over on her own flat stomach rubbing Naoto's belly more while pressing her right cheek against the downy blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto was in awe, blushing as she experienced the sensations of having her belly cuddled by Rise, who was so tiny compared to her. She felt heat rise to her puffy, even more adorable face as she placed her thick arms against her belly. The feelings resulting from Rise massaging at her belly were...pleasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto closed her lips together to suppress a squeal of some kind as she shook her blubbery head back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>N-no Rise-san is...a friend, yes! A friend!</i> Naoto tried to convince herself in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Naoto felt more of her grand bulbous body quiver. As she looked up, Rise had \"swam\" up her glorious fat to her impressive round bust that sat atop her massive belly. Naoto practically bristled at the look Rise was giving her chest, afraid of what would come of it, making feelings of embarrassment and panic well up inside of her. As much skill Naoto may have had as a detective, she was still rather shy about embracing her feminine traits. Naoto's mouth was agape as she tried to take in slow, deep breaths to calm herself, making sure not to go overboard and hyperventilate as Rise climbed over her chest and to the detective's puffy, round face, swollen adorably with fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eheh...heh, uh...sorry.\" Rise said innocently, a luminescent blush on her own face as she leaned down on Naoto's bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto just stared at Rise. She was starting to come off what could almost be considered a panic attack, if only for lack of a more appropriate term.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I...I dunno this all feels so nice and comfortable and...\" Rise leaned, then lay down on Naoto's fat like a massive waterbed, slowly hiding her head down with her arms crossed in front so Naoto couldn't see her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto stared in curiosity, the blush still burning hotly on her face and she could swear she felt Rise's legs dangling atop her bosom, which didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what are you getting at, Rise-san?\" Naoto asked shyly. Her tone switched from her authoritative and logical tone she used trying to convince people she was a detective and a boy, to her real tone. The soft, shy feminine voice she had only truly used around Yu-senpai thus far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-kun...\" Rise lifted her head up, but only enough that Rise could see the girl's brown eyes, glimmering as they stared up at the bulbous detective's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like...being around me, right?\"</span></div></div>",

The answer was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I do enjoy...your company, Rise-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective bashfully admitted swearing she could feel her blush intensifying, lucky for her Naoto's own embarrassment kept her from noticing Rise's own blush along with her wondrous eyes from light up like the morning sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do? I figured that I had to annoy you at times. I just get so excitable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise's own bashful words trailing off as a singular dainty finger of hers circled over and over Naoto's doughy flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no reason to hold ill will against you, Rise-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was thankful to hear that her legs bopping up and down accidentally rubbing against Naoto's enormous breasts, causing quite a pleasurable sensation to flow through the detective blob. Naoto having to stiff as best she could a moan that had threaten to leave her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise's accidental action had felt so good granted this wasn't the first time the idol had rubbed up and groped her chest, she knew that was what Rise was apologizing for, but something about this particular time had just felt so enjoyable she almost missed Rise's speaking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See just like that. Sorry, Naoto-kun.\" Rise apologized again just as Naoto was able to tear herself away from her current thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was with her today, first she ate herself into a blob-like state, and now was she actually feeling something of a spark between her and Rise? But she had eyes for their leader, their brave senpai, didn't she so what had brought about this change...or was it always there from the start and she had just deduced it to be Rise being open and friendly just as she was with everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what about her, where did her alignment lay? Maybe she couldn't say at the moment or just completely wasn't sure herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-kun?\" Rise called out interrupting the younger, bigger, girl's thoughts her tone with a bit of worry afraid that she had offended the detective in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you don't have to apologize Rise-san you've done nothing wrong.\" Naoto paused wanting to make sure she had the right words \"In fact it should be I who should apologize for ever making you worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blush from before returning with just as much intensity as Rise lifted herself back to her feet and made the journey over to Naoto's blubbery yet still so adorable face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment the idol was surprisingly quiet her cheeks however matching those of her hair and of Naoto's, yet neither commented on the other girl's flushed expression, gripping as best she could to Naoto's chubby almost comically chipmunk in style cheeks Rise smiled nearly a mile wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too kind, Naoto-kun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise whispered in near silence after their foreheads had met with one another. Naoto surprised at how close the two of them were from one another barely fighting off the urge to sink her far too flushed face into the blob of fat that was her body.

What was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like some kind of giant float, but...my word it looks so soft and bulbous. Whatever could it be...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!

Is that meant to be some kind of attraction by Junes or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise looked around in awe, her face red and a panicked expression on her face as she quickly pulled herself out of her trance, blushing as she cried out in awe looking around at the gathering crowd around the two of them. She could even see people she knew from school among them all, like those guys Daisuke and Kou who Senpai hung out with on the sports team, a couple regulars who stopped by the tofu shop every day and...aw crap, there was Hanako of all people! This would not go well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Rise san...\" Naoto whispered, her face burning so red it looked like it would pop any moment. First of all, aside from the banner covering her chest, Naoto was naked, kept decent only by the aforementioned banner and her belly covering her feminine area. Secondly, suddenly revealing to the whole town that you went from a svelte girl trying to act as a boy to a massive, curvaceous blob with a massive rear that spread out over the pavement, possibly big enough to crush cars and breasts that must have broken any and every record relating to a woman's chest by leaps and bounds, the latter standing out especially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey is...is someone up there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-R-Rise!\" Naoto whispered more urgently as she tried to make sure no one noticed her, resisting the urge to wave her puffy arms and hands about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Rise whispered back as her lips quivered in awe of the crowd Naoto's grand 10,000lbs bulk had drawn in down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get out of here somehow...wait...Rise do you know where we could possibly go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Well we could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, I gotta call my friends and see what they think!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time!\" Naoto snapped in minor panic as her face didn't lose it's redness, making Rise worry about not only Naoto but how she would get down if Naoto was gonna act so cute she was finding it impossible to resist clinging to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get inside one of my folds and get comfy, then give me directions on where we can go, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Rise slid down on the right side of Naoto, closest to the buildings, but stopped herself as she grabbed on the shelf of one of Naoto's thicker grand folds, sliding inside comfortably and feeling her face flush as she felt the soft fat press against her slim body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alight, for now just try to get up and get out of here!\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Naoto raised her feet and tried to walk away. People were in awe as they saw the massive blob, which they still didn't expect would ever be another person, start to move ahead, wobbling with every foot step as the grandiose form of Naoto slowly made its way out of the shopping district. Naoto felt relieved as she passed the bus stop sign and could feel the stares die down, letting a sigh escape her lips as she continued her march.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...one problem down. Now...Rise.\" Naoto looked down at her fold. She reached inside, wondering what Rise could be doing, only to find the answer when she saw Rise drooling as she mindlessly cuddled Naoto's fat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Ahem.\" Naoto cleared her throat to get Rise's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh? What? Oh. Uh, Naoto! ...Where are we going again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto felt a large bead of sweat roll down her fatty neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I was going to ask you.\" She said in her \"detective\" voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh!

Dammit she just couldn't help herself and now that Naoto was so enormous...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-san, we still need to decide on a destination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol's thoughts forcefully interrupted as she heard that oh so familiar serious tone from the detective prince. She apologized her blush still shinning before she gave their next move some serious thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know how about the flood plains!\" Rise excitedly exclaimed throwing her arms into the air as if she had just solved a far too difficult question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the riverbank?\" asked Naoto, doing her best to ignore Rise's own degree of adorableness still she couldn't hide the smile that had sneaked onto her lips. Much like the redhead herself the detective found Rise to have this sort of charm to her more so after her recent actions had prove to be rather...pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sure anyone else would have freaked and scowled her for what she had done to herself but not Rise, she didn't seem to mind or care. In a way Naoto appreciate that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah so let's get going, Naoto-kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe agreed with a brief nod, her chins nearly colliding into her massive chest in an almost comical fashion Rise having to stiff the giggle desperately wanting out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater having made it to the plains in surprising time, both ladies amazed that Naoto was able to learn to move as swiftly as she had, Rise let out a soft moan as she stretched her limbs once again resting in the same spot she was prior to her and Naoto's grand exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time her legs were resting still instead of kicking away at the air so Naoto didn't have to worry about feeling those sensations of pleasure she had before when Rise had accidentally rubbed up against her breasts. Still Rise's moan did seem to influence her a tad as she too found herself enjoying the calm scenery the wind flowing freely through her thick blob-shaped form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels good doesn't it, Naoto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead's words seem to trail off for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it does...Rise...\" Naoto said in response because of the setting around them her eyes began to feel as heavy as the rest of her, her eyelids fluttering for a moment or two.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naoto sighed as she drifted off into her dreams, her eyelids heavy as she closed them tightly in a deep sleep. Rise was fine sleeping between Naoto's folds like a pair of soft, warm down comforters that pressed between her. Naoto's slept sweetly along with Rise, her blubbery belly expanding and then contracting as she breathed in and out in her sleep, her impressive chest heaving, pressing up against her chins as it swelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...to.....aoto....Naoto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto opened her eyes. She looked around, seeing she was in what looked like an absurdly spacious detective's office from some sort of surreal American Noire film. She looked down at herself, slim once more, the detective \"prince\" clad in her usual blue uniform in addition to what looked like a cape, making her look like Raidou Kuzunoha, like Chie had mentioned once...had she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked up, she saw Rise walking up, wearing her usual orange and yellow top like usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Naoto...'nother case solved, 'nother demon outbreak resolved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto groaned aloud while Rise laughed, partially at her companion's expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...since that was our last case...how about the usual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsual? What did she mean by that? Naoto leaned forward, wondering what Rise meant as, seemingly out of nowhere, she thrust a chocolate eclair inside of Naoto's mouth. Naoto groaned at first, swallowing a good portion almost against her will, as if she were force fed. Naoto groaned as she stepped back, looking down as she saw herself suddenly expand outwards with fat. In mere seconds, her form ballooned out to obesity, her clothes in tatters as she slowly grew bigger. Rise only smiled as she fed more sweets into Naoto's mouth, making the detective only grow bigger and bigger, once again feeling herself blow up into a blob. Naoto's grand belly spread out further within the incredibly spacious room, remaining bulbous and mainly round as it grew larger, her arms and legs becoming pumped full of blubber as she only expanded further. Her ass bubbled and blew out behind her, gaining size quickly while retaining an amorous, round shape and become more and more jiggly and fulsome. Finally, of course, were her breasts, a pair of massive, impressive spheres that seemed to know no end. Even as Naoto grew immense, her breasts seemed to surge outwards more and more each time, pushing her proportions further beyond as the twin mounds grew larger, their round shapes becoming fuller and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto would have bit down on her lip if Rise wasn't constantly filling her mouth with pastries. But all of it, the sweet taste, the enriching and, as much as she hesitated to use such a term, ecstatic feeling of becoming a massive blob of fat and only growing larger and larger permeated her mind and became a clear focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-more please...\" Naoto shyly asked, her head lowered as she looked up at Rise with a shy gaze. Rise smiled and of course fed the massive detective blob more and more. However, as she did, Naoto noticed Rise eying her chest with lust, which made her squirm nervously. Rise reached down while Naoto's mouth was full of food, rubbing her hands against Naoto's tender bosom. Naoto gasped and moaned, her face bright red as Rise continued. Naoto continued to surge with bountiful fat, filling her room until she finally broke through the roof, a flawless sky awaiting her and Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto looked over, to see if Rise was alright, only to see her right by her puffy face, Naoto's eyes opened wide as she allowed a small gasp to escape her lips, Rise's brown eyes meeting her own. Rise smiled, said nothing as she leaned in closer. Naoto knew what was coming, so she closed her eyes and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Naoto, wake up!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's eyes snapped open at Rise's voice. She looked around. She was in the flood plains as she was when she went to sleep. It was morning now, the sun shining past the trees and glimmering on the water's surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A dream...all just...a dream...</i> Naoto thought to herself, her face flushed cherry red. She shook her head from side to side, making her blubbery neck and chins sway as she tried not to think too heavily on the subject. Naoto turned her attention over to Rise, to see what she was doing and...if she acted strangely in her sleep.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly the answer came in the scent of delicious morning food! With her eyes wide open now Naoto was able to get a better look at the idol and the numerous amount of carts filled with food trays sitting beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a feast fit for a king so to speak seeing as it was the best way she could describe the tremendous amount of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R...Rise-san what is this?\" she wondered in bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what does it look like, Naoto-kun? It's breakfast.\" Rise cheerfully stated oblivious, intentional or not, to Naoto's confusion. The detective questioning if it was really all for her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I figured someone as big and healthy as you needs a huge meal...\" Rise trailed off for a moment a heavenly blush kicking in as she realized she had again gotten ahead of her herself and possibly had made one too many \"fat\" comments. She recalled how sensitive Naoto seemingly was about her figure when she was of average weight now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shoot why do I always have to embarrass her like that.' the redhead wondered sighing inwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose you do have something of a point, Rise-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise allowed a sigh of relief to escape her lips apparently Naoto hadn't taken offense to her comments from earlier. Lucky her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen asked how she had come to accomplish such a feat Rise stated that she had awoken early and sneaked away, not mentioning how adorable Naoto appeared in her slumber or just how hard it was too pull herself away from the detective blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of your grandmother? She didn't ask any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, just told it was for Yosuke-Senpai. Said that management was planning a party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise chuckled as she noticed Naoto rise an eyebrow at her lies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It's a not a complete lie. I'm just swapping one friend for another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue enough she supposed, still she couldn't find herself to stay mad with the redhead especially after she noticed her approaching with a cart. Guess her meal was about to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for understanding, Naoto-kun.\" Rise said with her usual beautiful smile as she made the final steps toward Naoto's awaiting chub-filled face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Biscuit?\" she asked in as cute a tone as she could mutter, nearly breaking out in laughter at her own playfulness.</span></div></div>",

Rise grabbed a few more in her arms, feeding Naoto a large amount of food at once. With her new gluttonous appetite, Naoto happily managed to cram the massive mouthful of food in her mouth, happily eating each and every bite. Rise smiled as she started hauling more food up to Naoto's plump face, her puffy cheeks and round face making her look like she had a sort of exaggerated chipmunk face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore food piled into Naoto's mouth, resulting in more pounds packing onto her body. Naoto poked at her soft belly, making the mass of lard and flesh wobble as it swelled with new fat from her meal. Rise, however, wanted it this way as she started rubbing up against Naoto's belly, hugging it and rubbing her cheek against it. Naoto blushed as she merely dug into some more fried tofu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no no let me keep feeding you!\" Rise insisted as she climbed back up Naoto's blubbery body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto blushed, looking up at Rise's energetic brown eyes.

She seemed to practically inhale her breakfast feast as bite after bite of food disappeared down her throat and only becoming more fat for her body as she spread out more. Naoto felt herself blush as she sat back and allowed Rise to feed her more and more. It was like her dream only not as much of a massively fast pace to her meal and how much weight she gained, but...she could not find any reason to deny within herself that this was enjoyable, sublime, exquisite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feed me more...\" Naoto muttered shyly after swallowing a mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise managed to pick up Naoto's quiet words, smiling as she slid more and more tasty bites of food into Naoto's mouth, rubbing at the thickening mass of fat that was Naoto's body as she spread out further and further with more blubbery bulk. Naoto sighed, her belly expanding and contracting as she did, taking in the oddly...delightful feeling of her already impressively blubbery body growing fatter and fatter with what seemed to be every bite of food she consumed, her breasts becoming fuller and larger as more fat was pumped inside like enticing fleshly balloons and her incredibly large rear spread and bubbled out further and further behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>BBBBUUUUUUUURRRRPPP!!</b> E-excuse me, Rise-san! But that was...very delicious, thank you...\" Naoto smiled, a bit ashamed she belched right in Rise's face after the last bit of food passed her lips and down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise laughed a she sat up straight, her hair blown back comically behind her from the wind of Naoto's belch. Rise untied her hair, letting her brunette locks flow downwards behind her as she tried to ruffle and brush it all back in place with her hands. Naoto found herself blushing for some odd reason watching the event, the way Rise looked with her hair down, how her...back was arched in a somewhat suggestive manner...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>N-no, dammit! I'm looking too deeply! ...I suppose this is a flaw of mine. I need to look as this not as a detective but...as a woman...</i> Naoto thought to herself, her lips quivering nervously as she couldn't help but gulp as Rise's eyes met hers once she'd finished fixing her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise inched closer, pressing her hands down as she crawled over towards Naoto's puffy face, her own face was only centimeters away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Naoto...I...suppose now that we're alone, to ourselves...I...I kind of want to say I really...appreciate and am thankful for knowing...you...like, a lot...\" Rise nervously fumbled over her words, her eyes occasionally darting away as she spoke, trying her best to make direct eye contact with Naoto. Naoto herself blushed as her face burned bright red. She could feel Rise's legs pressing against the bountiful, pillow-like bulk of her breasts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-as do I, Rise-san...\" Naoto said softly, her eyes shimmering as she tried her best to move her head forwards as well. Alas, it was to no avail, but Rise was more then eager to close the necessary distance...</span></div></div>",

This powerful passion from Rise just forcing and pouring straight into her it felt so good, so right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise didn't waste time deepening the kiss as she over heard Naoto's soft yet muffled moan. It sounded so beautiful, gripping onto the bigger girl's cheeks she pressed on. She needed this she needed this as badly as sea-life needed water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly Rise as well couldn't explain what come over her or maybe that was what she was trying to convince herself of. Naoto had an undeniable charm to her, an awkward adorableness that seem to sprout up from time to time, and even when was in her usual \"male\" clothing she had a true sense of beauty that Rise found so astounding hard to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Naoto had awoken something that she wasn't aware of, maybe she was always aware but denied it, or maybe the bluenette was that one special exception. No matter what it was the one thing she did know was that this moment between them felt perfect...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last they parted neither really knew nor cared how much time had passed both blushing as bright as the morning sun. The girls didn't say a word Rise simply stared with as wide a smile she could muster tears almost shinning at the edge of her eyes. Naoto with a smile of her own as she stared at the beautiful idol whom she had shared such a wondrous kiss with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither could properly explain what had happened just that it had, eventually however one was able find to her voice.</span></div></div>",

But she lucked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise I...I have to admit I thought, you and senpai...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise shook her head a bit, matching eyes with Naoto once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess after he rescued me from my Shadow, I sort of clung to him out of being thankful. Plus, there was what he did to help me sort myself out and what I want to do. But...it was when I was around you I felt something stir. Even when I found out you were a girl, that, if anything, only made this...feeling stronger. I...I didn't know what to think. So I...guess I just acted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto started to chuckle nervously, looking to the side a bit. Was the temperature suddenly rising? No, maybe her thick fat just provided more insulation that was it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder myself. I knew I fit into the Detective Prince personality I adopted because it made me feel more comfortable pursuing such a career then if I tried as a woman. B-but...I suppose now I have to find something else for a title. Detective Princess sounds a bit too much like a Magical Girl title then a fitting nickname for an investigator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise giggled at Naoto's oddly rare humorous penchant just now. She leaned forward, laying down on Naoto's thick, blubbery chest. She gazed down playfully at her blobby crush's puffy face while folding her hands under her chin and her feet rubbed up against Naoto's bosom, making her stifle some more...passionate moans while trying to contain the sudden surge of emotions lest things go beyond the detective's control or worse: she accidentally snaps Rise like a twig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...uhh Rise...chan...could you come a bit closer to my face? I'd like to have you closer by me...\" Naoto said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise nodded, moving up a bit closer so her face was right next to Naoto's. She kissed Naoto's fat, chipmunk-like cheek, making Naoto unable to keep herself from smiling further as she fidgeted by rapping her fingers against the sides of her massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Rise-chan...what do you think we should do next really?\" Naoto asked shyly.</span></div></div>",

Just like I'm Risette. Those titles are a part of us we shouldn't have to depose of them because then we'd be throwing away a part of us ourselves. You of all people should know that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was surprisingly deep for the redhead idol although Naoto didn't have the heart to say such a thing to Rise instead she found herself agreeing with the small girl's words. She'd always be The Detective Prince just like Rise would always be Risette no matter how much they changed over time, it made sense in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it's either that or stick to calling you a Killjoy Detective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the Rise she was accustom to even if she had to remind her of that accursed title given to her during the incident with Labrys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I rather you not.\" Naoto mentioned not at all amused. Not a moment later she received a tight hug from Rise that served in easing her expression into one of a more calm if not pleased mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that settle she got back to asking the redhead what she had in mind for them to do next? Rise thought it over for a short while Naoto silently watching as she paced circles into the thick fat of the detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it! Oh you'll like this Naoto-kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto chuckled briefly at Rise's usual excitable nature.

She was able to contain herself however once the actual meaning of Naoto's words hit her. Sounded like Naoto was on board but just how exactly where they going to do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise pondered away silently tapping the edge of her own cheek her eyes directed high into the sky Naoto felt as she should volunteer to help her out when it seemed that a light-blub at last went off inside Rise's head.</span></div></div>",

It's mostly outside anyway, so you wouldn't have to squeeze into the inside or the, er, the elevators.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto frowned hard as she knew what Rise meant. She could barely get inside of the main Junes building at her current size; it was a miracle she was even able to get out of Aiya without them having to remove the roof and pull her out with a harness. Naoto pulled her cap over her eyes a bit as the thought came to her. Rise curiously tilted her head to the side as she noticed a large drop of sweat flow down Naoto's face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that's true, but...how would I eat there without swamping everyone else in my...er...bulk?\" Naoto asked with a nervous tone as she looked down at her blobby form, squeezing the sides of her belly with her thick, cuddly hands as her doughy arms squished against the fat of her bulbous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus all I have for clothing, aside from my hat, is this improvised tube top which is just slightly above nudity and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaugh...Stop being a cynic!\" Rise scolded as she pressed her hands against her hips, giving Naoto a stern gaze while puffing up her cheeks a bit. Naoto just shifted her cap over her eyes again and remained silent for a short moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, just once okay? If you don't...maybe I could tell Chie and Yukiko about your appetite and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's gaze shot back up to meet Rise's face quick as lightning. A look of panic that no foe before could have instilled formed on her face as the blobby detective broke into a cold sweat and her forehead looked as if it had a blue tint to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-NONONONONO!!\" Naoto squealed frenetically, waving her hands in panic. \"Th-that's fine! We'll g-go to Junes, post-haste! Uhh, godspeed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rise could wonder where that last part suddenly came from, she yelped as Naoto suddenly picked herself up and waddled her grander bulk off towards Junes, her massive form wobbling from her massive, round and perky breasts, to her massive ass which lazily shifted back and forth like massive pudding cakes and even seemed to smack together and her bulky legs even, which almost seemed partially glued together by how closely the bulky trunks hugged together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what was somewhat above the normal time it usually took Yu-Senpai, the two finally made it to Junes, albeit not without attracting a crowd. Naoto blushed as she made heavy foot falls towards the food court, cracks forming and spidering under her plump feet in the pavement and tarmac as Naoto slid down her bulk like a kiddie slid, even cheering in a similar, gleeful manner as she gracefully twirled on her feet after sticking the landing. Walking over to a table, the one usually used when the rest of the Investigation Team got together before, Rise sat down with a cheery look as one of the teenage girls working part time walked out, gawking at Naoto as she took a picture on her smart phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Ahem* I'll have a...hmmm steak croquettes sounds good to me. What about you Naoto?\" Rise asked cheerily with her eyes closed. Naoto shyly pouted as she poked her thick index fingers together and looked to the side, her bulk around her chins and neck shifting ever so slightly as well.</span></div></div>",

She had gotten so massive before but perhaps that a different moment Naoto as usual so focused on her task that she paid little attention to her escalating weight now that she was somewhere more public and of all things out on a date with Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course she's embarrassed so she won't order much...guess I'll have to step in and assist then.' Rise thought to herself as her vision quickly shifted over toward the worker girl. The young woman seemed as surprised as Rise was, fortunately Naoto wasn't able to catch either of their expression, however Rise recalled how the girl had taken a picture of Naoto. Even though it was quite possibly just a innocent reaction, understandable really, Rise couldn't shake the surprising anger she felt run through her. Something about that girl taking a picture of Naoto and possibly uploading it to the net once she had the time had stir her the wrong way a sense of protectiveness eventually taking hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto was her girl and no one messed with her girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rise wasn't a master all those times she had hung out with her beloved Senpai she had picked up a few things about how to keep a good poker face going. So with that said she explained to Naoto how she was going to step aside for a moment. Naoto understood completely nodding as her chins and blubbery neck collided with one another, Rise smiled at the adorableness causing the detective to blush hard yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So just wait here and try not to make a scene, okay Naoto-kun.\" Rise said in a playfully teasing tone the detective rolling her eyes as the idol walked away with a brief giggle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to find that girl.\" Rise muttered to herself as she continued on her way suddenly she heard the sound of someone calling out to her. It had to be someone rather unfamiliar or of the business since she had been addressed by her last name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got a better look at the young raven-haired woman turns out something about her was familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Kujikawa-chan, I'm Yumi Ozawa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she was that aspiring actress she had heard about. Once a part of the drama club if she remembered correctly. Rise properly introduced herself and turns out she was right after all. Yumi then went on to explain how she had left the club due to personal matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry, Yumi-Senpai...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older girl waved it off not at all offended at Rise's curiosity instead she went on to ask what Rise was doing here at Junes, her current place of employment. Rise pondered things over for moment before she asked if Yumi could keep a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. you have my word, Rise-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all Rise needed to hear so she decided to come clean telling the other girl how she was on a lunch date with someone! Yumi nearly exploding in excitement so many questions running through her head, who was he, what did he look like, was he smart or laid-back, and most of all how hot was the young man. Yumi assuming that Rise didn't see just anybody due to her idol status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise again wasn't sure how to respond ultimately deciding that it was best to show her...so she did...by pointing in the direction of Naoto!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it wasn't excited that made Yumi quite wide-eyed it was the sheer surprise. She had overheard that something \"big\" had made it's way into the store but that....Naoto was so enormous it made her wonder how such a weight was possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise noticing the understandable shock decided to step in and shifted the discussion back to them as she explained how Naoto had ordered a simple salad Yumi stating that would be no where near enough and the idol agreed so she wanted to spice things up a bit as a surprise for the over five-ton detective. She then asked if Yumi knew of the worker girl who had taken a picture of Naoto, she did but not in a personal sense Rise stating that she needed to get her hands on the girl's phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi didn't ask why there was just something in Rise's eyes that told her that she had to have in her possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm quick enough I think I can try to get it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect while you do that I'll work on Naoto-kun's meal!\" Rise gleefully cheered her arms flying into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope this doesn't get me trouble with Hanamura-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief sense of worry washing over her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about that. If anything happens once a certain someone comes back to town I'll have a word with them so they can then speak Yosuke-Senpai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi wasn't completely reassured but it was enough to give her some added courage and soon enough the two of them were off their separate directions.</span></div></div>",

She wondered why Rise was taking so long as she tried to distract herself by fishing out a bit of fried tofu she stuffed in her folds from earlier, one of very few morsels left over from breakfast as she ate rather slowly for someone of her...stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perhaps she was distracted by fans or press who saw her here at Junes and she got sidetracked...</i> Naoto thought as more tofu passed her lips becoming unnoticeable amounts of extra fat on her form in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto couldn't help but shyly squirm as more people kept starting at her, some even rejecting their meals altogether. She was so hungry that, for a brief moment, the thought of stealing everyone's food while they were distracted had honestly crossed her mind before she shook it out of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the leftover tofu only held Naoto over for all of a few seconds as her belly began to grumble and growl again, making the blubbery detective blob blush as she placed her thick, blimp-like arms against the sides of her bulging fat belly. Naoto let out a groan, half the uncomfortably large hunger she had and partial annoyance at how relatively short a time had passed since breakfast and here she was feeling as if she hadn't eaten all day!<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n'Damn me for asking for a salad just because I was afraid of embarrassing Rise...'</i> Naoto cursed inwardly <i>'Now if anything I'll just make more of a scene...plus how could I have embarrassed her? With how she's been acting, I would think seeing me fatten up even further and glut myself would very well drive Rise mad with desire.'</i> Naoto chuckled at the thought, as she imagined herself stuffing her mouth in as dignified a manner as anyone could while Rise bit down on her lip and leaned over while trying to remain calm and not looking like she wanted to jump Naoto's fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Grrrrwwwllll~*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto sighed as she felt grand stomach growl again, this time even sending a small quiver up her grand belly as she gripped the fatty mass once more while rubbing her thick, chunky hands against the sides in the hopes of calming her growing hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Rise...please hurry...'</i> Naoto groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, observing bit by bit her surroundings. A thought came to her, as she slowly made her way out back of Junes. She looked on at a pile of boxes, all containing junk electronics that had been thrown out back. There must have been enough to warrant a second small stock room just for each of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Can't believe I'm going to do this....\" Naoto muttered to herself before her stomach quieted her. Blushing a bit, the blobby 10,000+lbs detective grabbed at the cardboard boxes with her cuddly fattened hands and started to shove them whole into her mouth. Circuits, metal, plastic and silicon all became crushed an crunched up between her teeth as Naoto chewed them all up and swallowed them. While she was thankful this was nowhere near as bad as she imagined, it wasn't exactly a gourmet meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Naoto greedily loaded box after whole box into her mouth, eating up junk electronics and feeling them hit her stomach, creating a strange gurgling noise for a couple seconds before she felt the extra fat flow onto her body. She hummed to herself as she started to get used to it, cramming more boxes into her mouth and feeling her form swell, feeling a strangely tranquil sensation wash over her from the extra influx of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'...I suppose it would be foolish denying any love I feel for this new form of mine.'</i> Naoto mused internally as she gripped a newly developed fold of belly fat while she finished off a defunct plasma TV, feeling an unladylike belch pass her lips. She considered asking Rise for an antacid or something, given how prone she was to belching lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BBBBUUUUUUUUUURRRRRPP!!! Haah~ That certainly wasn't bad...\" Naoto smiled as she looked down at her new bulk, rubbing her hands over her further lard-filled belly while smiling at her new form, looking back to observe her full, wobbly butt that seemed to have an amorous jiggle to it along with her bulky legs and wide, flared hips. Naoto looked down at her breasts, put paused as she saw the extra fat had broken her makeshift tube top, leaving her bare to the elements. Naoto suppressed an embarrassed squeak as she tried to reach her arms around far enough to cover the rosy pink nubs sitting proudly on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around frantically, Naoto sighed with relief as she saw an impressive white sheet draped under some ladders sitting nearby. Naoto picked it up and wrapped it around herself, tying it in back as best she could manage with her thick arms into a knot to make a new top for her ample chest. She couldn't help but blush as she watched her full body wobble in nigh entirety as she made her way back to the food court. Her thick arms shook, her belly wobbled and her folds seemed to softly clap together along with her swaying back rolls and her butt had a lazy wobble to it like massive pudding cakes as the massive moons sometimes slapped into one another and her breasts had an uncanny jiggle to them even with how much coverage her improvised white top provided.

Not her finest moment that was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case she was almost instantly relived of her hunger pains as she at long last overheard Rise's cheerful tone call out to her.

If it meant anything despite the absurd of it all the hard plastic that made up the table was a lot easier of a meal then the boxes of scraps.

It was pleasantly cool today, so it seemed like no one would be too upset if she decided to swallow up the umbrellas dotted around some of the tables. She folded each one up and one by one stuffed them into her mouth, slurping each one up and swallowing them. She did get a bit of an uncomfortable kick from what she could only imagine was one of the umbrellas unfolding inside of her grand belly, making her jump a bit, causing her massive bulk to wobble all over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I should try e-*hic!* ...Crap...\" Naoto groaned. She saw even more reason to eat slower and carefully when it came to eating solid objects, given that she had now developed hiccups from that last batch of umbrellas going down her throat combined with air trapped inside of her belly and esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to counteract and perhaps remedy her sudden hiccups, the blubbery woman made her way around and spotted a vending machine loaded with bottles of sodas, colas and root beer. It was one of those models you saw all over Inaba with an ATLUS logo on the side. Sighing, followed by another small hiccup that made her chins and neck fat jiggle slightly, Naoto picked up the vending machine and bit into it like a candy bar. Unfortunately for her, her teeth also sunk into some of the soda bottles as she held the machine up, causing them to burst and pour their colorful contents all over her face as they flowed and tricked down onto her fat belly and pooled in her folds. Naoto coughed and hacked and hiccuped as the unexpected burst of carbonated beverages poured down on her head, getting her hat and hair wet slightly as she desperately shoved the rest in her mouth, chewed it up and swallowed. The soda bottles burst in her mouth like ripened berries as she mowed down bite after bite, unfortunately causing some more soda to splash onto her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>BBBBUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRPPP!!!</b>\" A belch that could only be described as monstrous in size passed Naoto's plump lips, making her face burning crimson afterwards as she rubbed her stomach as best she could with her massive, thick arms and plump hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Augh...I feel like there's a hole burning in my stomach.

Outgrow Junes with all her wondrous creamy bulk, maybe even outgrow Inaba itself or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise stopped herself right there as she felt drool trickle slightly from one corner of her mouth and blood trickle from her nose as her face burned as a transparent blush formed on it. The Idol's brown eyes glazed over, her pupils dilated as she felt short of breath at the mental images she had given herself. She placed her hands on her chest in an effort to calm her heart, while she smelled something as she passed by Aiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Rainy Day special? Guess the weather did say it would rain this afterno- ...Wait a minute...\" Rise paused as she thought for a moment. An idea came to her as she remembered just how in the world Naoto got so big to begin with. A cheshire smile formed on her face as she happily trod inside of Aiya, humming to herself as she decided to see just what made the new Rainy Day Special to delicious and wonderfully fattening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto had a rather unamused look on her face as she took shelter under a canopy of trees from the rain this afternoon. Rise had been gone for a few hours now and it left her worried. She was calm enough not to doubt their love, believe Rise had run off on her. Rather what she was worried about was something along the lines of kidnappers, serial killers, sexual assailants...things a detective would worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-kuuun~!\" Rise shouted as she made her way towards her beloved blob, a parasol held over her head in her left hand as she pulled what looked like a cart with a bunch of...bowls it seemed covered up pulled in her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there you are Rise...chan.\" Naoto sighed as she smiled, blushing a bit at addressing Rise with what she found a more fitting honorific. \"What took so long? Did you have errands to run? Did the others run into you and you got sidetracked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, nothing...*Huff* like that...\" Rise panted as she leaned over, catching her breath from rushing while dragging the trolley behind her. As she did, Naoto looked on with a studious expression. A scent began to waft from all the bowls, making its way to her nostrils. It was easy for her to discern just what it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More Rainy Day Specials? Well I suppose now is as good a time as ever.\" Naoto mused with a slight smile on her puffed up face. Rise brought her attention up to the blobby blue haired detective's face with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just any Rainy Day Special mind you~! I present to you, my beloved Naoto-chan, Rise Kujikawa's improved Deluxe Rainy Day Special~!\" Rise cheered in a manner that would have been more fitting if she were doing a commercial as her old Risette persona. Naoto felt a large drop of sweat run down the back of her head, not only from this display, but last she checked Rise wasn't...the best cook in Inaba. She certainly wasn't as horrid as Chie and Yukiko tended to be (Yousuke had started changing the nickname of their culinary flops from \"Mystery Food X\" to \"Dark Matter\" lately)  but last she checked, when she tried to make an omelet for Nanako...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on! You gotta eat before it gets cold!\" Rise cheered as she passed the first bowl and some chopsticks into Naoto's thick, cuddly hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right...\" Naoto said as she tried to smile. Taking in a breath, she tried the bow and decided the best way to sample it was a crash course.</span></div></div>",

Amazingly superb dare she admit even better then same meal from Aiya! Somehow someway this was better then anything Rise had attempted to make in the past. She didn't know what brought about the change in the idol's culinary arts but it seemed that Rise was surprising her left and right today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case Naoto shifted her blubbery face over toward Rise, a smile on her lips causing the smaller girl to grin practically from ear to ear, she then stared at the bowl still in her thick hands Rise seem to understand what the detective was silently asking and gave her a thumbs-up to go ahead Naoto muttering a thanks under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with the okay given to her Naoto proceeded to drink up the meal much in the same fashion she had back when her amazing weight gain first began and drink she did before she knew Naoto had already finished in the bowl in her hands. Her body swelling with newly formed fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise decided to step in here using a few folds as a step-ladder of sorts as she made her way over toward Naoto's fatty hands removing the empty bowl and replacing it with a fresh new one, a deep smile on her lips as she gave her beloved a civilized bow although she couldn't help but burst into laughter shortly afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmused herself Naoto chuckled slightly before continuing on with her meal. Each new bowl causing more blubber to be packed onto her ballooning form. Her body swelling faster and faster numerous folds growing thicker as she oozed out further in weight, a few rain drops here and there falling upon her gelatin-like belly. She found it enjoyable as she let a slight soft moan escape her lips. Rise all but melted at the angelic sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she continued her body growing further, her arms and legs swelling into immense pillars of fat, her butt-cheeks overflowing with fat as if they were hot air balloons, same for her tremendous breasts now many times bigger then her fat-surrounded face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowl after bowl went down the hungry detective's mouth reshaping her into a much larger blob as the minutes went by. Rise meanwhile found herself sitting comfortably somewhere on the Naoto's enormous belly although she was contemplating moving to another location if she found herself in the rain due to the continuous growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment she was find as is and was in heaven as she could literally feel Naoto growing bigger by the second. So thick so fat...so damn loveable...she shook her head free again from her thoughts this adorable blob girl was going to her pass out from blood loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled nonetheless grabbing a beef bowl ready for when Naoto would need another. A part of her so glad that her cooking had turned out as well as it had. Despite the lack of time Rise had put everything she had into this meal. It was for Naoto it was for her Detective Prince for her beloved Fortune she knew she couldn't screw up and it made her so happy to see she hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a bit curious though and knowing that she still had some time Rise snuck a quick sip of the bowl in her hands. Almost instantly her body swelled with new poundage! She ignored the tiny burp leaving her lips instead more surprised at her new weight. Her breasts, butt, belly, and thighs all a tad bit bigger then before giggling as she grabbed a hold of her now puffy belly. She also had to admit the feel of her bigger shapelier butt was real nice same with her bigger bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronic to her idol status but being rather chunky actually felt really good. However before she could lose thoughts any further to her new size she remembered that Naoto still needed more feeding so she decided to get back to doing just that.</span></div></div>",

The warm beef bowls were the most sublime thing she had eaten and the blend of rice, fine beef cuts and some spices Rise had added made it the perfect meal for a foggy, rainy day. Rise almost wanted to squeal and hug Naoto's bloating, blubbery blimpy belly at the sight of her face and the adorable sounds she made made Rise shift nervously and grin as she held her desires down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she climbed up Naoto's form, handing each bowl into her thick, cuddly hands she would use the blind spot of Naoto's large belly to slowly take conservative slurps and bites out from the beef bowls. Pounds piled onto her body with each mouthful, but also seemed to promote a bit more hunger within the once so lithe girl. However, the now quite obese Rise held back so she could make sure Naoto got as much out of each bowl as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto herself seemed to not even be paying attention. She was so into the delicious taste of each bowl coupled with the euphoria of her escalating weight gain that she was lost in the moment, slurping up and scarfing down bowl after bowl as her fat poured out.

There were at least five other bowls, excluding the one she was eating, sitting within reach of the massive, expanding pillars of fat and flesh that were her arms.

It appeared to her that the fatten idol was out like a light with a face as flushed as her hair-color Naoto didn't even want to know what the girl was dreaming of. She obviously choose to ignore the memories of her own dreams from the night before instead focusing her attention completely on the plumped idol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn doing so she began to realize why it felt as if just a small part of the contents of the recent beef bowls was missing. To be honest she had assumed that she was simply eating far too fast that each bowl felt less then the one prior but in actuality it was Rise's own doing. Somehow she must have gotten a taste of her own cooking and much like with Naoto realized how good it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlurping down the set aside bowls Naoto kept watch over Rise still waiting for the slumbering beauty to awaken and beauty she was the detective had to admit even with the added weight Rise still had a great look to her. The idol's bigger breasts and belly rising as if they were mounds of dough with each of her breathes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinking her chub-filled face into her doughy form Naoto did her best to shake off the sudden blush born from her thoughts of Rise's assets and exposed belly, truly thankful she couldn't get a solid look at the redhead's obviously much larger rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she shook her thoughts away deciding to once again wait for Rise to awaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...so good...Naoto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective blob's eyes seem to widen as she heard her name leave the idol's lips. Yes perhaps she was better off not knowing what Rise was currently dreaming of, as the redhead subconsciously began to stroke her plump belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case it appeared she was about to wake from her slumber.</span></div></div>",

Her fat face still felt hot and she could feel a bit of drool tricking down the corner of her mouth. Rise pulled herself out from Naoto's belly fat, but the pouring rain made her snuggle back inside of her love's developing folds of thick belly fat as the now eleven ton Naoto continued to glut herself, pretending she had not noticed Rise literally fried her brain with perverted fantasies. Rise tried to make sure her red-brown hair hadn't gotten too sopping wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, be careful there...\" Naoto said in a rather embarrassed tone. The feeling of Rise's fatter body squirming inside of her impressive folds was enough to make her blush at the image of how her body must have been jiggling as she pressed against her fat and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto shook her head to get the thoughts out, her chins swaying and clapping against her absurdly massive breasts, in turn making the soft and heavy spheres wobble from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise poked her head up from Naoto's fat, her plump face making her look sort of like a groundhog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naoto...\" Rise muttered in what sounded like a shy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto tilted her puffy and uncannily adorable face to the side, wondering what had gone through her beloved's head when she conked out for those moments of euphoria shutting down her brain. However, in a flash, Rise was in front of her face, force feeding more beef bowls down Naoto's mouth, making her body swell with more fat. The sudden large influx of food and fat came so suddenly, Naoto barely had time to prepare as her eyes were comically bugging out in shock wile Rise took turns to slurp up beef bowls for herself like a woman possessed on both fronts. The bubbly idol turned feeder crammed food in her own mouth whenever Naoto's was so full her cheeks bulged to over twice their size, filling up with fat quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise could feel herself quickly approaching that level of fatness where she could be called a blob herself now, her bulbous belly draped over her thick fatty trunks known as her legs while her breasts bulged in front of her. Unlike Naoto and in a somewhat interesting twist, it seemed Rise's butt was the centerpiece of her from, in contrast to Naoto's being her immense boobs. The massive flanks blew out behind Rise at impressive speed, her hips flaring out further and further as her bulky legs thickened and their increasing fat pressed together. Rise was leaning forwards, making Naoto's face glow red from the impressive view she got of Rise leaning forwards, unintentionally showing off the canyon of her cleavage and her massive rump swelling with more lard behind her. Naoto felt herself begin to breath in and out again to calm herself, which in a way helped Rise feed more food down the now 13 ton detective's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get fatter Naoto! This won't do for now! Come on, we'll get so huge we cover Inaba up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had gotten into Rise?! Was this all her desires coming out at once or did some new idea spark inside of her?! Whatever the case, Naoto relaxed, feeling she had no choice to resign herself to her fate (but also subconsciously wishing she could slap Rise's amazing ass) but amused herself with one thing: Outgrowing the entire Yasoinaba with all of her and Rise's fat was a pleasant and even novel concept.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naoto was still pondering over Rise's request as the idol passed the time by drinking up a bit more from a few of the beef bowls. Her body becoming even more blob-like, especially that tremendous backside of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think?\" Rise asked giving the bowl in her chubby hands a cute-sounding slurp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell there was a part that told Naoto to really stop and think about what Rise was asking, after all it sounded as if she wanted the two of them to reshape themselves into literal mountains of fat. Yet glancing at that swelling booty of Rise's she found it hard to actually deny the redhead her request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto you in there?\" Rise asked politely as she took another drink, her body growing further in size, making a quick estimation the detective assumed that the idol had already packed on a ton inching ever closer to adding another half on top of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...Yes. I mean I'm not opposed to your idea, Rise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol happily throwing her fatten arms into the air while leaning back so her massive rear ended up colliding with Naoto's already enormous girth, the two of them jiggling like crazy due to the forceful contact. Rise giggling like a child while Naoto found herself blushing hard for what seem like the thousandth time today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards as Rise came down from her emotional laughter and Naoto got the flush on her face to fade away the detective began to ponder on things yet again. This time she recalled how Rise and mentioned that both of them grow to absurd levels that obviously meant that only one thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-chan I believe before we do anything else there's something that's come to my attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise asked what that was as she continued stuffing her chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being that if we are indeed going to go through with this it's my belief that we'd be better set if you were to match my size before going any further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another cute slurp Rise thought over Naoto's words. She did have a point the more she thought about it and she'd be the first to admit that she absolutely loved the feeling of her body growing ever fatter and she didn't have to guess too hard to know that her immense butt was no doubt working it's magic on the detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did seem to make sense and while doing her best to control her emotions she thought back to what made her black out earlier the idea was of her and Naoto growing together not just the bluenette herself and so it was that she found herself wholly agreeing with her beloved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea! Oh leave it to The Detective Prince to as usual be the one with the sharp mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could blink Naoto found the blobbly idol pinching her thick cheeks as the two of them found themselves sharing a cute nose rub. Honestly Rise had so many ways of making her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that means I have to a lot work to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...Rise, what of your career?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto had perhaps finally touched upon something that even Rise hadn't fully thought about. Her heart and mind were clearly running away from the idol's logical side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is for love, Naoto\" Rise stated as serious as ever after a lengthy pause, \"Nothing is more important then that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliche as it sounded Naoto found herself smiling as she watched Rise's serious yet joyful expression. She had to give the idol credit it really did seem that she had thought everything through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if that meant that Rise may already have an idea of how she was going to super-charge her weight gain? There were the remaining beef bowls after all and she had no problem handing everything that was left to Rise, even if she wasn't sure how many were left.</span></div></div>",

The massive flanks, round bulbous butt-cheeks that had an alluring and lazy wobble to them, her wide and ample hips which flared out to the sides and her thick blubbery legs that only became thicker and thicker as the idol ate and grew in the hopes of matching Naoto's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto felt a minor pang of guilt inside. Rise was practically throwing her whole Risette career away just for her so the two of them could become massive mountains of fat together.

As long as she was happy and felt like she had control over her life, well...that thought alone was good enough for the blobby detective. She looked on smiling as Rise continued to eat, growing grander and blobbier as hundreds of pounds packed and stuck to her body. Sweet mercy, that ass of her's was getting huge! She had grown to Naoto's previous size of 10,000lbs and already her butt was looking uncannily massive even for her proportions. Naoto felt herself shaking her head in an attempt to ward off any raunchy thoughts she may have of her and Rise and specifically the swelling, wobbling twin moons that had practically entranced her with their wobbling full mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise ate and ate yet still, swelling quickly with fat and lard as her body swelled out, her bulbous form only growing as her breasts reached impressive sizes for their own rights, but still very much paled by Naoto's perky chest and her belly flowed outwards. Naoto honestly wondered how the hell Rise's clothes seemed to warp in size so she was kept decent as her orange top was stretched out into a bra and even as Rise passed the eight ton mark she could make out the idol's panties stretched into a thin thong pressing into her fat around her hips as her white shorts barely contained the billowing masses of Rise's booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise may have been energetic and bubbly, but she was certainly not oblivious or air headed. Noticing Naoto's bashful gaze cast at her butt, Rise decided to see if there may be a covert pervert lurking inside of Naoto. With a catty expression on her face, Rise playfully waved her buns back and forth slowly, the twin masses wobbling back and forth lazily, clapping into one another as the flowing rolls of fat on the idol's back wobbled and softly clapped together, making Naoto's eyes bug out as she tried to cover a bleeding nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, there's nothing to be ashamed of Naoto-kun~ If you like my butt so much, why don't you just kiss it?\" Rise teased, giggling as she slurped up what remained of the beef bowls, allowing her blubbery pillar of an arm to reach around her billowing love handles as she gave her mountainous ass a playful pat with her cuddly hand, the bountiful flesh wobbling and rippling slightly from the smack.</span></div></div>",

She was energetic and loose where the detective was firm and serious.

She smiled however as this was her beloved Naoto so she made a compromise with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it you don't have to do what you don't want to, Naoto.\" Rise stated in a sweet yet serious tone.

I...I suppose if you want I can at least give...it a slight tap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise's eyes seem to perk up as Naoto stammered through her words, her tone clearly more feminine then the rather usual serious business tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving it some thought she couldn't help but mentally squeal at how adorable Naoto was she wasn't a perv but she was willing to give Rise some satisfaction. That was just like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well okay if you want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just this once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise all but melted at the bigger girl's bashful expression as she got into position.

She was pouting, but trying to remain steadfast even as her lips quivered a bit from the nervous energy rushing through her. Rise grinned on her own fat face as she knelt forwards, waving her blubbery, wobbling booty at Naoto's face which seemed to make her serious companion redder in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well~? I'm waiting~\" Rise teased, chuckling a bit at Naoto's expense as she wobbled her rear back and forth, the massive mounds of her butt soflty clapping together and wobbling in their gelatinous manner. Naoto gulped, suppressing a nervous moan that almost made Rise squeal in delight as the idol closed her eyes and grinned, shaking her head a bit at how adorable Naoto was acting right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally bringing her confidence up enough, Naoto thrust her bulky thick arm forward with her palm open as she delivered a deceptively soft and light pat to Rise's bottom, the copious fat of her blubbery cheek rippling and wobbling from the impact. Rise decided to screw with Naoto by moaning in a suggestive manner, eliciting a cute and distressed wail from her shy lover who was still not used to fully embracing her feminine side. She was cute in that awkward, shy and dorky sort of way. Rise wondered if there was a word for that maybe. 'Adorkable' seemed to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was about to turn around to let Naoto know she was fooling with her, but her rear was still wobbling from the love tap Naoto had given it, which in turn made her whole rear wobble and shake more, distressing Rise's sense of balance. She started to wave her bulky arm around in circles to try and maintain her balance, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Ohh! W-waaah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise lost her balance, the blubbery idol falling forwards into Naoto. Naoto stood her ground, holding her arms out to catch Rise as she and her new blubber wobbled forth but was surprised as Rise's trajectory not only allowed her to fall right into the Detective Prince's arms, but also lock lips with her in another kiss! Rise and Naoto were both shocked, their puffy faces lit up red as their fat bodies squashed together, fat squished together as their massive bellies squashed against each other and Rise's own impressive breasts pressed up against the massive mounds sitting proudly on Naoto's chest, dwarfing Rise's own sizable bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat added feeling of their own fat pressing together added an uncanny element of electricity charging through them as the passion of their blobby bodies pressing together overcame them. The two absurdly fat lovers closed their eyes, Naoto keeping her blubbery arms locked around Rise as much as their figures would allow, while Rise hugged her back. They moaned and cooed, breaking off their kiss only due to the deep for oxygen, otherwise the two of them would likely have remained like that for who knows how long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's eyes were glazed over with a dreamy expression on her face. Rise had her own serene smile as she broke out into a full on grin. Feeling her playful nature act up, she grabbed Naoto's trademark blue cap off her head and put it on. Naoto wore a face like she was about to object, but she just sighed and smiled calmly while Rise giggled and continued to hug against her beloved Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-by the way R-Rise...chan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise-chan?? Wait, she wasn't speaking as the Detective Prince this time. This was Naoto's 'real' voice. Her feminine tone, not her disguised voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-as long as we're...together, d-do you think it...\" Naoto gulped nervously, breathing in a bit as her tremendous belly trembled from this as it expanded, then contracted. \"Do you think...it would be better if I talked like, er, like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise had to admit that hearing Naoto's soft voice only made her want to kick and squeal in joy as she cuddled Naoto for as long as time would allow. But, was that what she really wanted. Rise took pause, making sure she picked her words carefully no matter what answer she gave.</span></div></div>",

She was speaking in her feminine voice this time, bashfully turning her head away as best she could manage with her copious chins and thick, blubbery neck. Rise looked up from their shared embrace with a look on her face, not of puzzling, but expectancy. It wasn't too hard for her to anticipate what Naoto was going to say next in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want another kiss, don't you?\" Rise asked in a playful and cheery tone befitting of her upbeat personality. Stoic Naoto felt her face flush as she nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" That shy little noise was Naoto's only other confirmation on the given subject. Rise could feel more unstable energy inside herself as she just wanted to snuggle Naoto and cuddle her with how cute she was being, maybe see if she couldn't commission some cute clothes to dress her up in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, she decided that, if anything, dressing up Naoto could wait until the future. She instead chose to focus on the present moment, looking deep into Naoto's eyes as she closed in. The two blubbery beauties still kept each other hugged tightly in one another's massive bulky arms as best they could manage. Rise leaned forwards, pressing her lips against Naoto's and holding her just a bit closer, her fatty arms sinking into Naoto's blubbery sides as the fat filled masses squished against her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto was a bit bashful and submissive at first, letting Rise take the lead, but once she felt her passion well up inside her once more, she picked up the slack and reached up, cuddling Rise's absurdly puffy face in her own thick, soft hands, the two blobby lovers cooing happily from their shared passion. They felt fulfilled in that moment, both of them. Rise and Naoto would never have known the day before that they would find happiness together as well as a mutual love for one another growing so absurdly fat and bountiful! But as they spent that moment passionately kissing one another, all doubts seemed to melt away and all they knew or cared of was the peace brought about within that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the need to breathe caused them to break off, but even then Rise still leaned in close to Naoto, her smaller fat body pressing into Naoto's larger, more corpulent form, one of Rise's fat cheeks pressed against Naoto's as she leaned against her beloved detective blob. Naoto smiled bashfully as she held Rise in a hug, gently stroking her reddish-brown hair.</span></div></div>",

As humorous as it was she rolled her eyes briefly before tossing it straight at the small yet pudgy animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man sometimes it's like food is the only thing you understand isn't it, huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself laughing as she rubbed the back of the flabby pooch and perhaps she purposely ignored the irony in her words given her own nature from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the snacking done her faithful hound seemed ready to continue on much to her silent joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good day today now that the rain's finally let up.\" she mentioned shielding her eyes from the sunlight shinning in their general direction. Still she smiled as her pooch was actually walking alongside her well attempting to do so anyway stopping on occasion when something caught the interest of the flabby doggy or whenever someone stopped her to tell her just how cute her pet was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued on their way she began to ponder on what to do this now well-weathered day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Yuki said she had to work all weekend at the inn...and I don't think you'd survive a trip all the way there and back again.\" she stated with a hearty laugh the pooch didn't seem to understand and maybe it was better that way she thought amusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did go on to give her pet a quick rub to the head afterwards her thoughts returning to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yosuke's busy over at Junes, Ted's no doubt driving him up the walls again. Kanji-kun's probably working with his mother and...he's not here at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused as she thought over the young man that was close to all of them. She refused to give in to any sadness she was better then that stronger then that, they all were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess that just leaves Rise-chan and Naoto-kun. Well I know where Rise must be but Naoto's a little tougher. I mean what are the odds of finding them together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself laughing again yet with no idea how right she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately she decided to head in the direction of the flood plains. It was nearby and if she wanted she'd stop by and speak with any of her friends after she finished walking her pudgy pet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving at their destination she noticed that the place seem to be rather empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More space for us, huh.\" she mentioned to her loyal dog who seemingly barked in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll take one around then head home, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pooch didn't seem to disagree and for that she was thankful as they started their walk around the area. As they continued however she eventually came to spot something rather noticeable in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" she wondered her pet unsure how to response not that she would have noticed anyway instead she focused in her eyesight on the strange object up ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost looks like a balloon...a parade one maybe? But what the heck is it doing out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious as hell she pushed forward she couldn't get a good luck just yet so maybe from a shorter distance she'd be able to actually make out what that stunning object was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving as silently as she could, if one wasn't aware of her motives it almost appeared as if she was sneaking around like a master thief, she hid behind a large neatly-aged tree. Even as she carried her pooch in her arms she was still able sneak a peek from around the side that thing whatever it was hadn't made any sudden movements making her believe that her guess of it being a some sort of balloon was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she got closer it almost appeared as if there were two objects being squashed together and one of them had some orange and white color to it. Just what was she dealing with here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really didn't have an answer so again she inched her way closer this time diving behind a bush, a hand over her pet's watery mouth preventing it from exposing her to whatever that...those \"things\" were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've come this far right?\" she asked her pooch not expecting any sort of answer and still very much unsure as to what it was she was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all that however Chie Satonaka put on her bravest of faces as she popped her head out from behind the bush.</span></div></div>",

She looked a bit closer at one of them, keeping her hand over her pudgy dog's mouth as he too seemed to grasp the weight of the situation while he hung limply in his owner's arms. Chie looked up and saw...what looked like a familiar blue cap resting on...was that someone's head? Wait, that other one looked liked it was wearing clothes. Wait...were they...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naoto-kun...? Rise...chan...?\" Chie was dumbstruck, standing in a half hunched over position as she had not fully gotten up, nevermind fully composed herself for what she was looking at. The two massive blobs whose bulk reach out across so much of the flood plain's expanse turned around, their blubbery bellies shifting and their breasts, butts and chins wobbling and swaying in a lazy sort of manner as the two massive fat loves, Naoto and Rise, looked on as Chie had a pale face, her expression one of shock and disbelief which was comically matched somehow by her pooch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...hiii Chie-san...\" Rise said as calmly and politely as she could. Chie just looked on for a few moments, like she was frozen on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satonaka-san?\" Naoto was concerned as she looked down at the almost comically tiny Chie who seemed to just be glued in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...w...w...w...w...w..w..w..w..wwwwwwwwWHAT THE HELL!?\" Chie screamed, scaring off all the nearby birds in the area...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes for the brown haired girl to calm down. Even longer for her to become composed enough to hear about Naoto and Rise's explanations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So here's what you're telling me.\" Chie said as she sat on the sopping. \"You two not only harbor a deep love for each other, but it's sort of gone under your radars so to day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of yeah. I guess we kind of beat it down and tried to convince ourselves we were...well. something we weren't...\" Rise said in a somewhat nervous and shaky tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie nodded, her body language remaining unchanged like she was a yakuza boss questioning her men, her eyes remaining closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And now you tell me that you also happened to share some sort of...fetish for fattening up and eating a lot that you guys want to indulge in together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto and Rise both blushed, shifting a bit as their bodies quivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Naoto said, her usual formal detective voice faltering and making way for her real, feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay.\" Chie said as she got up slowly, untying her dog from a nearby tree to keep the chubby canine close by. Rise and Naoto just sort of stared in awe as Chie turned around to look at them. She realized what they must have been thinking and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yeah I'll admit it. This is weird. Like surreal even. But...what say do I really have? You guys love each other so if anything I'd be kind of a bitch to get between you two. Plus...you do legitimately make a cute couple.\" Chie smiled as her dog barked as if to back up it's master's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie and Naoto smiled alongside Chie, Rise cuddling Naoto from behind a bit, almost knocking the blubbery bluenette over and making her blush at the sudden show of affection. Chie looked over at the pile of empty beef bowls behind the two, surprised they ate so damn much even if they were multiple tons...</span></div></div>",

Almost to answer her own question she glanced over in the direction of her heavy-set friends, Rise being playful as ever as she attempted to cuddle while Naoto gently explained that she should control herself in front of their Senpai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself smiling as it dawned on her that Rise's affection for Naoto was what had fueled the improvement of her cooking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it helps when you have someone to cook for, huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pooch agreed as she gave it a gentle ear rub afterwards she turned her attention back to the bowls. Most were already empty although there seem to be a few here and there that were still filled with meaty deliciousness...instinctively she licked her lips a sudden sense of hunger almost getting to her until she remember how astoundingly huge Naoto and Rise had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one bowl and I'd be making him look thin by comparison...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe muttered to herself with slight amusement instead she decided she'd do her good deed for the day and that was finding more food for her close friends. Even though she had no real idea as to how fat they were, and their girth was pretty stunning, they were still her friends and she did want them to be well-fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that in mind Chie explained that she was going to step away for a while so she could round up some food for the two massive lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope none of this has traumatized you Senpai or made you think any less of us.\" Naoto stated in her usual tone, afraid she and Rise had forever tainted their friendship with Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a problem Naoto-kun. You and Rise-chan are free to do what you want and I already said I wouldn't get in the way of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she spotted a slight blush on Naoto's vastly puffy cheeks after the detective had muttered her thanks, Rise as well thanking her stating that she'd hug the much smaller girl but went against idea because she'd be burying poor Chie in a valley of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the concern Rise-chan...I think.\" Chie stated with a laugh afterwards repeating that she'd be back soon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rise and Naoto smiled as they watched Chie walk off, her dog walking beside her as Rise smiled. After the tomboyish brunette was out of both their sights, Rise sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness...I was afraid after how badly she freaked out that things were only gonna snowball from there...\" Rise sighed. Naoto only replied with a slight nod and a stoic \"Hmm\" as a sign of her affirmation and that she had heard. Rise, slightly annoyed, puffed up her cheeks a bit and decided to say something when her bulbous gut interrupted, quivering lightly from it's greedy growling, making the bubbly bulbous girl blush. Naoto looked in her direction, a slight smile forming on her face as she looked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...There's still plenty left in those beef bowls. It should be enough to tide you over until Chie-senpai returns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise looked up, then turned around. It was true, there was still a small portion of beef bowls left compared to how many there had been initially. She wondered why Naoto didn't want them, after all she was the larger of the two still by a good margin and she was also very likely the most gluttonous. Wait...was she giving up all of it willingly? Normally this wouldn't seem like much, but considering the new lifestyle Naoto and Rise had adopted, this was a rather deep gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks Naoto-kun...\" Rise said with a smile. As she turned around, Naoto couldn't help but blush, her eyes widening a bit as she got a nice look at Rise's wobbly rear, her massive flanks lazily wobbling back and forth and even smacking together a bit as the ex-idol's back folds wobbled here and there. Naoto gulped audibly as she tried to resist the allure of Rise's amorous backside, placing a thick hand against her bosom as she felt her heart pounding harder than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise cooed in contentment as she tasted the meat passing over her tongue as it entered her mouth and filled her thick, puffy cheeks, in addition to filling her form with even more fat. She rose and spread out with each mouthful she swallowed, making her hips flare, her belly grow outwards more as her blobby form developed more folds and her breasts billow forth. And, of course, her ass practically inflated with more fat as she ate, Naoto feeling her very wits tested by the tantalizing testament of Rise's backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving in a little, she approached Rise from behind, surprising the idol as she felt her beloved Naoto's puffy pillars known as her arms wrap around her side and squish against the growing mass of her belly as Naoto gently nuzzled and rubbed one of her puffy cheeks against Rise's. Rise paused her meal, setting the bowl she had down between her own cleavage, which looked modest in comparison to Naoto's bust, as she reached up and gently placed a hand against Naoto's other thick fat cheek, closing her eyes and smiling as she and Naoto shared a quiet and tender embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Rise's surprise, Naoto leaned against her as she reached over, making Rise's face glow crimson as before she could say anything, Naoto's bosom had already buried Rise's head between the two massive fat spheres. Any speech Rise made was muffled and cause Naoto's bust to jiggle slightly in reverberation, making the detective bite down on her lip as she pulled back with all the leftover beef bowls scooped in her thick arms. Looking at Rise, the two of them still blushing after that little event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already fed me plenty so...I suppose it's my turn.\" Naoto said stoically. Rise nodded as she opened her mouth, bowl after bowl piling inside her mouth as Naoto poured it in the greedy girl's mouth as she swallowed it and filled her stomach with more food and her body with more fat and lard. Rise giggled as she felt the last couple bowls pass her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel like you could stand the wait a bit more?\" Naoto asked, a bashful smile on her face as she was trying to tease Rise as the reddish-brown haired girl had done to her before, making Rise giggle a bit more at the irony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Then again, if a certain someone wanted to give me a belly rub well...that'd just be a bit extra, wouldn't it~?\" Rise teased back, sticking her tongue out as she winked mischievously at Naoto.</span></div></div>",

Slowly her pudgy hands made contact, the detective understandably shy about what she just about to attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise cooing as she felt her beloved's gentle touch as she leaned back resting on her astounding backside, she wanted to be comfortable after all. The two shared a smile and she had to fight off the giggle born from the sight of Naoto's nerves flaring the still bigger girl's face almost matching the idol's shade of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go for it, Naoto.\" Rise cheered on her bright smile easing some of the detective's nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo following up on her love's advice Naoto did just that as she began to rub away at Rise's eclipsing belly. As her hands ran through the girl's sizable flab she started to realize just how soft the two of them really were Rise was simply a joy to touch she was just so soft and her belly was amazingly easy to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure this is your first time doing this?\" Rise asked in her usual playful tone as she kicked back resting her head on a portion of fat made up from her shoulders or was it her back, ah hell she'd care at the moment right now all that matter was for Naoto to continue working her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In truth, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective answered in a shy tone more reminiscent of her birth-born voice seeing as this was still highly embarrassing for her, still she continued to work away ignoring the occasional moan of pleasure leaving the idol's tender lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're really good at it, Naoto-kun.\" Rise muttered as she allowed another blissful moan to escape, the pleasure she was experiencing starting to work on the detective's own emotions as she could feel her face begin to light up. It was difficult for her to believe that she was doing that...good of a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T...thank you, Rise-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her turn to mutter her blush intensifying slightly as Rise responded with a soft purr Naoto almost taking it as a way of her saying to continue on and so she did despite the flush building in her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naoto continued she attempt to ignore the moans the purrs of pleasure and satisfaction coming from Rise. The blob of an idol was really enjoying herself her head thrown back eyes shut and a smile as bright as ever, Naoto had to assume she was completely lost in her own little world where the detective's delicate touch was all that mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course all of this had driven her blush into overdrive if she had to guess she'd say her face resembled an overgrown tomato. A part of her actually glad that Rise couldn't see such a face, her soulful moans were enough she wasn't sure she could deal with endless teasing on top of everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever much to her silent thanks Rise's eyes began to blissfully open, her expression still that of a happiness but it seem to Naoto that she had something on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Naoto-kun...all of this just feels so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a moment wondering what Rise meant, a few answers ran through her head but she wasn't sure if she had hit the mark with any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Rise-chan?\" Naoto asked curious as to what the answer could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean everything that's happen between us recently\" Rise started off saying as she shifted her vision back at the detective who was busy rubbing away at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way we opened up with one another. How we fell for each other, we've shared tender moments together...and the weight, oh the weight...\" Rise nearly lost herself but luckily was able to regain control of her emotions, \"point is the time I've spend with you...if I could do it all again...in a heartbeat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto smiled at Rise's honest confession, at times she could forget how despite the often playful nature Rise was still a very loving person it reminded her of how she hid her own bashfulness from the others from time to time. Looking away for a moment Naoto paused the belly rub much to Rise's surprise but what came next would truly surprise her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective repositioned her pillar-like arms around the idol's wide waist, looking into her love's eyes she smiled bashfully before leaning in connecting her lips with those of Rise's!</span></div></div>",

You're already hungry but I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Grrrwwwlll~*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto stopped dead as she looked to the side a bit with a further blushed face, feeling the irony sink in. Rise chuckled a bit as she decided she may as well get back up. She could always just ask Naoto to feed her, but she felt like she was starting to get a cramp in her rump from laying on the uneven ground of the flood plains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moved backwards a bit, Naoto placed a thick, doughy hand against the silky soft surface of Rise's belly, sliding her palm across its surface gently, making Rise moan a bit from how good the feeling of her lover's hand against her billowing middle was. She tried to sit back up, rocking back and forth a bit even. Her face went red as she shifted and wobbled, her boobs bouncing and her folds softly clapping together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, uh, you need a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no I can do it myself, thank you...\" Rise protested in a strained voice as she tried to sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto just sweat a bit as Rise rocked back and forth, using her massive rear as a center as she finally found herself rise up back onto her massive blubbery legs and fat-swollen feet as every inch of her body wobbled and jiggled, fat folds clapping together as her breasts collided with her chins and her massive rear smacked against the ground in its wild fit, slamming the ground and splashing away at puddled up water from the recently ended rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto gulped as her face went fire red at the massive display of Rise's assets and how she happened to be standing in a clear patch of sunlight, which glinted off of her sleek, wondrous skin which lacked any kind of flaw. Naoto started panting a bit, which she noticed seemed to be a habit when she was especially nervous, an unconscious reaction to Rise's more provocative moments. Rise pouted slightly as she rubbed at her backside, the massive and sensitive mounds, so large they spread out across a good portion of the ground, felt a bit sore from laying back on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahhh...that was a great belly rub~ Thanks, Naoto-chan! Maybe next time we co-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RMMMMBBBLLL~*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you the first time, shaddap!\" Rise scolded as she looked down at her blubbery belly, placing her thick plump hands against her sides, as she could no longer place them against the massively flared hips she possessed, and puffed up her cheeks in annoyance as she looked down. Naoto merely sweat again as she readjusted her cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it shouldn't be much longer until Satonaka comes back with our food...I hope...\" Naoto stated as she looked around. The two of them covered an impressive amount of the flood plains with their combined mass and flab, but as far as she knew, unless they started eating inanimate objects or tried to buy food in town, the two blobby lovers had fairly limited options to quell their uncanny hunger.</span></div></div>",

Amazingly said touch seem to calm her stomach at least for the time being allowing Rise to mouth her thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto simply nodded happy to assist Rise in any way perhaps now she could get back to finding some possible food for the two of them on the off chance that Chie wasn't returning any time soon. However the more she put her mind to it the more she realized that their grand forms would be in need of a vast amount of food to quell their hunger that seem to grow alongside their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The larger the mass the larger the nourishment required...\" she muttered to herself afterwards Rise asked if anything was wrong she declined explaining that she was merely thinking out loud. Rise deciding to lighten things up jokingly stated that she did that as well from time to time, Naoto chuckled for a moment rather amused at the idol's humor although she couldn't help but wonder how much was true and how much was part of the joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case she went on to explain to Rise how if Chie didn't return soon well they'd have to head back into town to hopefully find something that could ease if not outright end their hunger. The alternative...she had to pause herself upon realizing how absurd it sounded in her head...well the alternative was that perhaps they should start munching away at any inanimate objects around them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Rise had found herself deeply in love with her detective blob but that last part just sounded crazy and with everything the two of them have experienced they knew a little something about crazy and absurd but really eating say a park bench because they were so damn hungry?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew however that while Naoto's gentle touch had stopped her belly from roaring in hunger it would start up again soon enough and of course she knew that the detective herself was hungry as well so they had to make a decision soon.</span></div></div>",

Rise stuck her tongue out as she rubbed her plump hands against her massive, blubbery belly which vibrated from the hungry growling inside of it caused by her stomach. Naoto blushed as she seemed to be simply trying to ignore her own hunger altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto...\" Rise whined a bit as she pouted, another growl emanating from her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto tried to keep her cool, one of her eyebrows twitching under the brim of her hat as she tried to stay composed. By this point, she started to lose it, wishing for something to simply fill the hole in her gut, weather it was \"food\" or not as long as it did the job. With this train of thought seeding itself inside of her mind, Naoto grabbed a nearby tree suddenly, startling Rise as she pulled it right from the ground. Like how she had eaten all the furniture at Aiya when her gluttony became uncaged, the massive detective plowed the whole tree, from the roots to all the way up the trunk, all the way to the branches and leaves, slowly down her throat as she felt the huge tree fill some of the gaping void that was her hungry stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise looked on in shock as Naoto finished off the last of the branches, a couple of leaves still sticking from between her lips and a couple twigs stuck between her massive breasts as the blobby blue-haired woman rubbed at her belly in contentment that she finally ate <i>something</i> lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was desperate enough that, rather then call Naoto out on how crazy she was acting, she groaned as she felt another fit of hungry growling resonate from her meaty middle, as she found that a park bench wasn't sounding too bad by this point. Besides, Naoto swallowed a whole freaking tree just fine! What harm was one park bench gonna do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gggrrwwwwll~*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay maybe more than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise reached down as best she could with the blimpy arms that served her without risking her whole form tumbling forwards as she picked up two benches nearby, one in each hand as she stuffed each one down her throat. She cooed in bliss as she felt something finally get in her stomach once the first bench passed and fell into her stomach. The next one slid down the desperate blobby idol's throat as she swallowed it up, once again feeling the same bliss like when someone stranded in the desert finds an oasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, just that alone was not enough to fully satisfy the two women. With growling stomachs still pleading for more, the pair begrudgingly tore out more trees as well as rocks from the surrounding area. The fact their bodies didn't reject their strange, bizarre binge must have meant even their stomachs agreed that anything that could pass their lips could be considered food. Rise enjoyed that at least whatever mass belonged to what she or Naoto ate became her own. She found a scrapped jeep sitting in some deep growths of trees, weeds and bushes and must have shot up a whole two tons after cleaning the huge junker off! Naoto still exceeded her in weight, which suited her just fine, as the idol still found herself not-so-guiltily indulging the pleasing sight of her serious, stoic love stuffing herself full of \"food\" as her wondrous and absurdly massive breasts only continued to billow forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise stopped herself as she found herself getting red in the face, stuffing some more trees down into her stomach to distract her from her own steamy fantasies before she let herself go too far.</span></div></div>",

Instead Rise greedily ate away at literally everything in front of her, trees, benches, rocks, chunks of grass, and anything else in the area really. Much like Naoto when her inhuman weight gain first began Rise was apparently reveling in her streak of relentless gluttony she just wanted to eat as if she hadn't had proper meal in months!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe muttered willingly tipped herself over so she could lay on her literal dome of a belly afterwards she began to swallow up the area around her swelling form!

Their relationship was still fresh and the last thing she wanted to was strain it with regretful selfishness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-chan I'm sorry I didn't ask if you wanted anything to eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Naoto heaved herself around hoping to come face to face with her fatten love, what she saw however left her astounded and mouth agape at the sight before her!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Instead of being met with the adorable, uncannily puffy and fattened up face of her beloved Rise, Naoto was bewildered as she laid eyes on the wobbling mounds that made up Rise's puffy, amorous butt cheeks, the massive backside even bigger then Naoto herself! Rise had consumed so much of the area of the flood plains, trees, earth, rocks and all, she had essentially dwarfed Naoto in terms of size as her bulk jiggled and quivered with fat and fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise panted heavily after her massive feast, her stomach feeling so packed tight with \"food\" that just breathing made it feel even tighter, like an overfilled balloon. It wasn't painful, but the full feeling in her stomach and all the sudden new fat left Rise in a very sensitive state as she found her face blushed as she felt herself quiver. Naoto waddled around her mountainous beloved as best she could in order to get a look at Rise her form swamping all of where what could have been seen all over the horizon for Naoto for the most part. Rise panted a bit as she felt Naoto's plumped hands rub against her fatty flesh and coo as she felt Rise climb up her ballooned fatty form. Every touch sent some sort of electrifying feeling of pleasure as Naoto pressed against all of her deep fat, making Rise purr from the sensation of Naoto's hands and the rest of her smaller blubbery form pressing against Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an almost bizarre feeling between the two as Naoto raised her puffy face up to look at Rise's own fattened up face, swollen even further with fat from her even more absurd form, her massive cheeks taking up more space then her actual head as her chins collided with her sizable bust. But that massive rear and those hips and thighs...Naoto almost felt a shudder pass her body at remembering how absurdly huge Rise was still in back, but she was able to hide her guilty reaction of pleasure as Rise purred yet still from feeling Naoto press against her sensitive fat body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I suppose I would be right to assume you don't mind me not sharing?\" Naoto asked in a bit of a coy tone as she adjusted her blue cap while looking into Naoto's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...if I ate anymore, I'd probably explode or something.\" Rise laughed, causing her chins to quiver and collide against her breasts, in turn sending small ripples through the upper part of her bulk as she pressed the absurdly massive, well, masses that were her arms as she rubbed her thicker hands against the swollen, bulbous sides of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it feel being so big so fast? I...have to admit I sort of miss being the bigger of the two.\" Naoto laughed a guilty laugh. She was feeling as if she should stop trying to be as serious as usual around Rise, not only due to her bubbly and, well, very much cute demeanor but honestly every other action seemed to bring out reactions in the detective she would otherwise suppress in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels amazing~\" Rise gushed as she rubbed her hands in circular motions against her significantly thicker belly fat, making her massive form jiggle more like she was made of gelatin. \"It feel sorta sensitive, if you didn't notice though. Every little touch just feels great against my skin...oh man what I would give for a back massage~\" Rise sighed as if she were drifting off into a nap. Given her elated state now, she just may do that soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone can reach your shoulders and spine through all that rolling blubber.\" Naoto teased again, blushing a bit as she was still not exactly used to being playful or overtly upbeat. She was easing her way out of her stoic exterior, little steps at a time, as she made the most of this almost magical feeling of love between the two. She pulled herself forwards, once again kissing Rise on her plump lips. The two moaned in bliss as Rise's eyes fluttered shut, feeling as if that one moment was all it took for things to be right in the world. All that mattered was that one moment, where time slowed down and they knew each other's passion and the taste of the other's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise smiled as Naoto broke the kiss off slowly, placing a hand tenderly against one of Rise's absurdly plush, puffy cheeks and rubbing it gently with her cuddly, plump hand. Rise tried not to pay too much attention to the rather...welcome perspective of Naoto's bloated boobs, the perfectly shaped orbs etched into her mind with their beautiful form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say...Naoto-chan...\" Rise started with a bit of a shy, hesitant tone. \"I...had an idea. Think you can...\"</span></div></div>",

That was actually false though this mailbox was used nearly every day by kids with the mail in stickers and adults for various purposes but right now Naoto was willing to use any kind of logic to justify her eating, even if she had to make it up herself. Placing her thick hands around the cold metal frame of the maibox, she pulled upward until it's metal working underground that kept it in place were ripped off. Grunting slightly as she had exerted herself in this endeavor, Naoto moved her move onto the cold object and bit in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmh, its like a cold crunchy bar of candy.\" Naoto said as she ate more of the tasteless piece of metal. Eating more and more, soon the girl's mouth began to fill with several parchments, stickers, and envelopes. \"I can't believe how good this is. These will be of much more use filling my belly then their original purposes ever were.\" Naoto's jiggling mass began to fill out ever so slightly as she consumed more of the letters and various types of mail. Finishing off the last bit of envelopes, Naoto looked around again, still not satisfied. \"Hmm...the local shrine hasn't seen much use recently, and people have been reported stealing from its offertory box.\" Walking over to the offertory box, she uprooted it from its spot and ate away at the golden box. Feeling a number of coins and banknotes slide down into her throat, she could feel herself getting fatter and fatter, Naoto was slowly beginning to fill up the shrine with her flab, grease inside her belly folds from her time at Aiya Diner were starting to drip out onto the ground. <br>\r\n\"Ohh..<b>BBBBBBBUUUUUURRRRRRRPPPPP!!!!!!!</b> I'm beginning to enjoy all these inanimate objects. Naoto began to wonder just how fat she would get upon eating other things...though she still would need to use up those coupons, no reason to let them go to waste. She began to wonder...how would her friends take to this? Having always known as the small, skinny, and androgynous girl, she chuckled as she imagined their reactions. \"<i>I wonder just how Chie-senpai and Yukiko-senpai will react to all this flab I have now.</i>\" She pondered as she finished off the last of the offertory box.

Coffee.\" Naoto thought aloud as she continued to eat the vending machine, her blubbery body wobbling as it swelled with more bountiful fat, trying her best to hold down her belches. She didn't need her track record mired by a noise complaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she moved on to a small mom and pop store that had closed. They were fortunate enough to have closed their doors due to the couple who owned the store retiring and moving to Mikage-Cho, rather then being run out of business by Junes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Since this house is no longer occupied, I suppose no one would mind if it were gone.</i> Naoto thought, once again warping reality just for the sake of her appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto demolished piece upon piece of the small, rectangular building as she crammed it in her mouth, eating it and allowing all the wood, drywall, insulation and occasional painting or picture frame to fall in her mouth and fill her blobby belly. Naoto shoved hunks of the building that, based on their size, should not even have been able to fit in her mouth, but gobbled them up anyway, the former mass of the building slowly but surely adding to hers now. Her body only spread out further along the street, as she grew larger and larger, reaching the size of a small manor by the time she was done with the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRRPP!! Hmm...a well-done, understated taste...\" Naoto thought aloud, closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after her larger meal, her stomach only rumbled as she started to rub her belly. She was still hungry. And that suit her just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she moved over to some apartments not to far from her last course. They had been opened here in the past but closed due to lack of tourism and customers over the years. Naoto tore apart the brick walls and crammed them into her mouth, billowing fat pouring forth throughout her body as her butt began to push against a building behind her, making its walls creak. Her belly helped knock down more of the brick building as it slowly grew, pushing against the abandoned apartments and knocking them over. Naoto picked up what was there, not caring for stray bricks and dust staining her belly as she just continued to devour more like chunks of crunchy candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm~ Plain, but still not not bad by far\" Naoto mused as she licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around at how much more she had spread out, her fat starting to engulf building around her. This only did more to tempt her as she used her billowing flab to knock said buildings over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops~ Pardon me\" Naoto said calmly as she picked up the debris and began feasting on it, her body billowing out to much more fantastical proportions and covering more and more of Inaba by the second...</span></div></div>",

So I did and it was right!\" The General Store owner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it just appeared? What about royalties? The creator had to have wanted SOME money off these, after all this IS a big hit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was told to put 25% of what I earned in an envelope and place it in the mailbox on Saturday, oh that's today! Thank you miss for reminding me.\" The Lady said getting some money out and placing it in an envelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto knew this was her chance, she'll stake out the mailbox, find the one responsible! \"Thank you ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh miss, sure you don't want one, after all what with the big promotional sale Junes is having it'd be a shame to miss out.\" The Lady said Naoto stopped and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sale?\" Naoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Manager has made a promo that if you bring a necklace you get half off on all food sales.\" The lady said, Naoto froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the sales at Junes already low priced, half off would be ludicrous, women all over Inaba would binge until they can't binge anymore! Ma'am when is this sale!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It starts at 6 tonight.\" The lady replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 in the morning, Naoto had 10 hours to find the one responsible, or she'll never walk again and the mystery will remain unsolved. \"It seems...error is not an option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto felt her undergarments stretch and start to tear, she blushed as she hid where she could she the mailbox, this was it. Naoto waited for an hour, gaining 20 pounds in that time! Her face was red because under her clothes her bra and panties had torn off. Though it was worth it, Naoto sees something!</span></div></div>",

The stores never been this busy before,\" said Kanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, didn't you hear?\" A girl dressed in a school uniform, probably a senior, turned to the pair as she stood in line for the general store. \"To combat Junes's takeover of the local economy, a lot of businesses around here are running a special sale! If you show them your special no-weight-gain bracelet, every store in the area will offer you a special discount!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear God!\" Naoto cried.

Free refills!\" She could literally feel her gut expanding beneath her as she stood near the jam-packed shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto,\" Kanji said as he tried to avoid looking at the girl's expanding waistline.

Huffing and grunting, the weight of an entire city continuously piling up upon her, Naoto was at last able to make it out the doorway and into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sides and hips sore from not only being stuck but the pressure applied in order for her to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe huffed a tad while quickly removing her near broken bra, her now much bigger breasts thankful to be free from the confined space, along with her shoes and loosening her shirt, last thing she needed was the buttons blasting off the clothing like bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still gaining but at least for now she could move about the house luckily her grandfather was away on personal business for a few days she didn\u2019t want to imagine what she\u2019d say or how she\u2019d begin to explain the sudden increase in weight. But that was for another time at the moment the detective knew she had to contact and warn her friends warn them of the necklaces and it\u2019s affects on those that choose not to wear them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing as best she could downstairs, the actual stairway creaking under her new found girth, she estimated to have gain at least sixty pounds just on the trip down! This was getting worse and worse by the second so she had no choice but to sprint to the cordless phone in the main room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nearly torn in two shirt flew away prior to her reaching the phone. Three hundred pounds, Naoto couldn\u2019t believe she was pushing that much weight and still gaining as the clock continued to tick away. Her bloated extended gut nearly knocking the phone away before she got a chance to wrap a fatten hand on it. Sausage-like fingers struggling to punch away the numbers until she remembered she had the others on speed-dial bringing up the list she quickly called up the first name\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was busy snacking away after having said goodbye to her dear friend Yukiko. As she did she recalled the conversation with Naoto from earlier in the day. The younger girl was obviously upset and had left in a huff Chie at the time had shrugged it off but now she felt a sting of guilt. She really shouldn\u2019t have been so hard on the detective after all they were friends not as close as she was with Yukiko but still she knew she would have felt horrible as well if someone had acted that way to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft sigh left her lips as she thought over giving the blue-haired girl a call or maybe a surprise visit to mend the emotional wound. Suddenly as if by coincidence her phone went off. It was Naoto! What luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe answered quickly and greeted Naoto cheerfully. Naoto on the other hand still plumping up, now pass three twenty five, did her best to blurt out a quick warning to Chie accidentally moaning as her belt snapped off her belly now rolling over to cover her panty region. Said panties were about to blow off as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde was rather confused about the call raising an eyebrow when she heard the younger girl moan then gasp rather loudly, her underwear had finally given up as she pasted the three fifty mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe necklaces\u2026they\u2019re\u2026cur\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line suddenly went dead static filling the air leaving a really confused Chie in the wake of one extremely strange call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing however remained in her mind something no doubt had happen to Naoto. The moans the gasp lack of overall breath she didn\u2019t like it not one bit. Worried for the younger girl she sped off in the direction of the detective\u2019s home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did so Naoto\u2019s last words played over in her mind. The necklaces what was she trying to tell her, gripping the jewelry in her hand she thought of removing it before thinking twice once she got over there she could ask Naoto first hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ran through the street Chie for a moment also thought of calling up one of the other girls Naoto had mentioned the necklaces for a reason after all but there was a chance that calling them up would burn precious time and she was still very concerned over Naoto\u2019s condition\u2026</span></div></div>",

They don't just make it so you don't gain weight, but gain hunger! Senpai...don't you see, even removing it you're starving right...then that means...it's permanent!

Now she was too big for her own room, her butt was wider then her couch and rounder then beach balls, her breasts bigger then her when she was thin, her belly like the largest bed for a single person. Well over 1500 pounds Naoto would reach One Ton within a few days. After hours of searching the trio of Chie, Yukiko and Rise rendezvous at the Shirogane Mansion. It was by luck Naoto's Grandfather was gone. Naoto would feel shamed if he saw her like this. \"Find anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's words had a deeper tone coming from her 4 chinned mouth. \"Nothing...sorry Naoto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Yukiko-senpai...as long as you're all okay.\" Naoto said as she saw the girls looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Naoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-kun...we can't...we can't bare to see you like this anymore.\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been suffering too much on your own. Stop trying to take things into your own hands! We're your friends aren't we?\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls...please don't tell me...\" Naoto said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry...\" Chie said as the girls placed their hands around the chains Naoto trying to move her tree trunk arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Don't!\" She shouted as the girls removed their necklaces. Silence filled the room, nothing happened at first but within 30 seconds the girls felt their clothes get tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhh....\" Rise held her side as she ballooned out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhhh...\" Yukiko sat down as a belly pushed out of her clothes tearing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie's small breasts then became huge. \"Nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a belly broke her sweater. \"Ohhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, put them back on!\" Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" They said throwing their necklaces down and stepping on them, breaking the frame and cracking the crystals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You idiots! Why would you do that!? You're now doomed to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-kun we would rather be huge with our friend then let her suffer it alone, besides this way you can grow slower.\" Yukiko said as the girls kept gaining, Naoto was still gaining as well but now it was slowed and was less visible due to the already sea of fat she had, the girls on the other hand soon found their clothes were starting to tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls what are we going to do now?\" Naoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise walked over to the couch, this may be the last time she walked ever so she made it count. \"Maybe there's something on TV that can give us a hint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all we've got now.\" Chie said as Rise turned the TV on with her plumping out fingers.</span></div></div>",

A mad doctor of sorts and one that was in no way human despite the appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's current test subject was also it's most favorite. After the failed last attempt it was very pleased with the outcome of this session. Something of a grin broke on it's lips as it neared the door to where the subject laid unconscious to the rest of the world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness, a fog-filled mind, a loss sense of time, among other uncomfortable sensations were what youthful ace detective Naoto Shirogane was currently experiencing as she began to come around. Her body felt heavy while her head felt so light an awkward combination that made getting a sense of her surroundings rather difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the first time she had experienced such sensations however but for the life of her she couldn't remember when was the last time least of all what day it even was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly blinked as she overheard the sound of twin metallic doors begin to part open, yet again this was familiar to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft laughter echoed around the chamber room as the figure that had been walking the halls entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my\" it began slowly, \"it seems this experiment has been turning out beautifully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was instantly of recognition to Naoto but the girl was so exhausted all she could really do was take in a few breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab-coat wearing figure approached the detective girl and with a single reaching out hand felt up some of the doughty mass before it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto moaned slowly as it continued to rub away. However slowly but surely she was remembering where she was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...shadow...\" the bluenette muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow's sinister golden eyes lid up with vigor before giving a playful slap to the softness in front of it. Naoto moaned softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" said the shadow copy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you're up again. That means soon enough we can continue our ever going experiment.\" It explained as it took a brief walk around the unfortunate test subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow smiled as it squeezed another soft portion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The results have been very nice but they are not enough are they ME..heheh no no...more tests must be run! More of this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt squeezed another portion and Naoto moaned in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be made. After all what is there to be ashamed of about a full figure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is beyond a full figure you know it as do I!\" exclaimed an outraged Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah finally regaining our usual spunk are we.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release me else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Else what?\" inquired the shadow, \"You plan to threaten me? How, you have no real means to do so. Listen you should simply sit back and enjoy in how I'm assisting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you aren't. What good does this do me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a fuller figure and now no one will ever ignore you. What more could you want?\" asked the shadow as it stared mockingly at Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being noticeable in some other way. Not as a 600 pound blob.\" stated Naoto in a fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true the formerly lithe Naoto was nothing but a memory now in light to this much bigger heftier version all born from the \"experiment\" of her shadow self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, most likely due to it being in a completely other dimension, her attire had stayed on though it was stretched like hell to contained her massive thighs, blubber butt, thick roll-like arms, already big but now made immense breasts, and a huge exposed paunch of a gut that extended a good deal in front of her. A second chin also wobbling whenever she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto wasn't immobile (yet she thought) but she was heavily restrained in place. Nothing short of a miracle that the chains strapped to her now overly fatten wrists and feet weren't broken. Apparently her shadow was making sure she wasn't going anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a while now so I'm sure your companions from before must be on their way but I do so wonder what their reactions will be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow laughed while making it's way over to an already up and running console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's restart the experiment shall we. After all you deserve no desire a fuller figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow snickered as it pressed away at the controls of the console a moment later set into motion what Naoto dreaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTightly restrained the detective girl could do nothing as a hose rose from the floor while two canisters of who-knows-what (although to Naoto tasted like pure lard) descended from the ceiling above. Naoto gasped as she felt the hose stick straight into mouth. The detective then glared sharply at the shadow for once again it was feeding time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ooze did it's job well and the shadow flashed a grin of pleasure as it watched Naoto visibly fatten before it's golden eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's attire was as usual holding up rather well for the most part as she felt every portion of her being bloat and extend outward. Breasts reaching a point where in the real world no bra would be able to contain their massiveness, butt-cheeks each increasing to match a beanbag in girth, an incredibly soft belly that could easily overflow and crush a bed, wide thick tree trunk sized thighs and arms making them virtually useless to move if she were even free. A third chin even began to develop slowly as Naoto's gaining continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt around or close to a thousand pounds give or take a tad Naoto began to feel hazy again. She was bloating so fast and so sudden that just as before her mind couldn't keep up and was beginning to shut down for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore it could completely close up Naoto thought back to just how all of this had started...</span></div></div>",

He had something on his mind once he heard that story. \"Dojima-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDojima sighed. \"Naoto, are you sure that's what Souji wants? To see you more like a woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He helped me realize how important being true to that part of me was, I wanted a woman's body a curved figure, my breasts to not be tiny, to look like an average girl. Let me ask you Dojima-san, why did you have such a sullen look on your face when you were thinking about what to say? I may be your apprentice but nothing of what I said was depressing.\" Naoto said a serious tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Souji, is coming by for a visit in a few days.\" Dojima said looking away from Naoto in shame to tell her the news she didn't want to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's eyes went wide. \"H-he's coming in a few days!? I-I don't have time to grow! I'm still far too small! I still look like I'm trying to be a boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto ran out, Dojima rushing out the room they were in. \"NAOTO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto ran as fast as she could, she ran to the hill where she looked over town. Panting she leaned against the fence and tears fell down her eyes. \"I want to be more of a woman for him. I want to show him I'm trying to be a woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Naoto headed home, the Shirogane estate, she made it to her room with no one seeing her, just as she wanted. \"I can't believe this is happening...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crashed down onto her bed, sniffing, she heard rain pattering down outside, she looked outside to see a heavy rain, she then looked at her clock, midnight. \"Naotoooooo Shiroganeeeee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?\" Naoto turned her attention to her TV, an image slowly appeared, it was a fuzzy image, a dark figure on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, come to what you desire Naoto...\" Naoto was in shock, a Shadow! The Midnight channel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto, come here Naoto...\" The voice said, Naoto walked forward, grabbing her gun that she uses to defend herself, she moved her hand to the TV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto was grabbed was being pulled in, she struggled to break free and accomplished her goal, the Midnight channel turning off, Naoto knew what this meant, she didn't want to bother the others, she had a good idea what she was up against, and decided to head into the TV the following day.</span></div></div>",

The evil spirit figured Naoto must have been briefly thinking back to how all of this came to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick glance it noticed that the canisters weren't completely empty just yet but still went ahead and flipped a few switches here and there on the console effectively shutting down the fattening process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow smiled at the new turn out of it's experiment. Walking up to the slumbering Naoto the shadow was glad it had chosen to use this large a room to hold the experimenting nevermind the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark being recalled that a status screen on the console had informed it that Naoto had passed out at around half-a-ton rising an eyebrow slightly pulled out a small device from one of the lab-coat pockets.It appeared to be a detector of sorts and with a quick wave the shadow got a better reading on Naoto's current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwelve hundred, or one thousand two hundred, pounds of pure forced out flab!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow laughed as it poked away at a hand-sized roll of fat on the right side of Naoto. It continued to laugh as it gave a slap to the gargantuan butt-cheeks, appearing as if they fill out an entire couch and more individually, causing them to vibrate for a minute's time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bed was what Naoto's belly could previously overflow and potentially crush now one had to believe that a small car would easily give in to it's immense girth of course didn't take into account the beanbag size her breasts had taken now that her butt had grown much much thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot her ridiculously large arms and thighs would be much help either, they were weighted down with far too many rolls and pounds of fat that if they weren't already useless before they sure as hell were now. Finally the shadow noted the third chin of Naoto's that wobbled along with the other two every time the massive girl took a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was truly huge now Naoto's blubber still only took less then a fourth of the room as noted earlier the shadow was well aware of how big the subject was going to continue getting. And continue it most certainly would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully the shadow was rather surprised with how quickly Naoto was gaining. The formula was intended to make the user far larger then ever before but it seem to be working so well with Naoto almost too well. Was her inner desire to become more curvier actually altering the substance to work at an even faster rate then the shadow had originally expected?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark spirit had no answer to that but felt if it continued to experiment away at Naoto eventually it would come to a decisive conclusion even if at the end of it all Naoto would end up overflowing the entire lab with her girth! The shadow found the thought of the girl detective crushing her friends with her uncountable unstoppable amount of fat rather amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the shadow was alerted that Naoto's friends had already cleared the first floor of the lab twelve left to go and there was still much more work to be done. After all they were in for a BIG surprise once if they reached the final floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow smirked giving the titanic belly a mocking slap before walking back toward the console to check up on the party and to continue the fattening procedure...</span></div></div>",

Why is it back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto went inside the TV, she memorized where in the TV her 'Secret Base' was, so she needed no guide, but there was something different about the whole situation, she accepted herself as a woman, she accepted everything about herself. This was different because the desire was different, she didn't want to just accept herself as a woman, she wanted to enforce that she was a woman now, in fact her attire was only that of her boyish cloths because she couldn't fight in her school outfit or any of her new cloths. \"This thing is still a bit dusty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto dusted herself off from time to time before she reached the base, she sighed looking at it, everyone was embarrassed by their locations. \"Never thought I'd have to see this place again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome Naoto.\" A loudspeaker said in a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto looked up at the loudspeaker which also had a camera next to it. \"WHY HAVE YOU RETURNED!?

I no longer try to hide it, I wear my school uniform, I don't tape back my breasts I shop for cloths a normal girl would wear, I've even gotten more used to speaking with a higher pitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't about THAT Naoto, you know why I'm here.\" The voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming in there, and trust me for putting me through this a second time I'll shoot you before I utter those words again.\" Naoto said walking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shadow laughed like mad being she WAS a mad scientist and all, pressing some buttons. \"Oh Naoto...I have a surprise for you this time around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto stepped into the base looking around, same as always, except it was empty. No shadows, Naoto was clearly suspicous when the door in front of her opened. \"Good Afternoooon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto was in pure and utter shock, it was a robotic duplicate of herself! Except the hair was longer down to the shoulders and her breasts were big! \"W-w-what is this!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it? It's a little something I designed while waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi I'm Naoto Shirogane! I'm going to be the most beautiful detective ever!\" The Big Breasted Robo-Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto had no problem shooting a hole in the robots head. \"I may be trying to be more womanly but don't push it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh You broke me...that's okay my Ssssisssteerssss will will make you n-n-nice and hap-hap-happy.\" The robot collapsed before exploding, a strange pink gas game from the explosion, Naoto couldn't see it as she was covering her eyes from the bright flames from the blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hate this place now more then ever.\" Naoto said, not realizing she inhailed the gas, which made her breasts a bit more mailable, a drug to prepare Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing up to the next room the door opened before Naoto this time a big butt Robo-Naoto walked in. \"Hey boys Naoto here, I'm in the mood for some loving, and it seems we've got a rowdy customer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is stupid.\" Naoto pulled out her gun but it was kicked out of her hand by Robo-Naoto, who squeezed Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh such a small little girl, don't you want to be a grown woman like me?\" The robot chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to Hell! I want to be a woman not a whore!\" Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but won't you do ANYTHING for Souji-kun!?\" The Robot raised Naoto over it's head, it was opening it's mouth ready to gas her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto struggled to break free, when she saw the hole for the gas tube was small enough, she broke an arm free and dropped a gun round it, stopping the gas causing the robot to explode, Naoto dropping to the ground. She signed not realizing the gas did to her butt as the previous did to her breasts, they were all prepping Naoto's body for the experiment. \"What next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto reached the 3rd floor and stopped expecting a Robo-Naoto, and her expectations were met, but shocked to find it waddling in, an obese Robo-Naoto. \"Hi I'm Naoto Seta, Would you like some of my cookies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-This is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't mind the weight, after me and Souji-kun had the first two I never got it in me to lose the baby fat, and I want to try cookie recipes so that they can love their mommy when they're old enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto was blushing red, she will admit the prospect of marrying Souji and settling down with him crossed her mind, but this was ludicrous. \"Can I shoot you? Now? For Three minutes straight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Naoto, you want to make Souji-kun happy right? I bet he'd love these new batch of cookies.\" Robo-Naoto tossed the cookies, Naoto shooting them like she was at a shooting range, one got through and cut her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot rolled itself towards Naoto who rolled out of the way shooting it, but the momentum and size of the robot deflected the bullets. The robot came around for another attempt, Naoto saw one of the many consoles behind her, shooting it open she took two wires out and rolled as the robot rolled right into the controls frying from the exposed wires exploding and releasing the last batch of gas  ensuring her body the same fate as her bust and butt, but there was also knockout gas in the mix! \"Oh...crap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto fell down, her Shadow coming in laughing. \"Oh Naoto you're going to love what I'm going to do with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto recalled it all before slowly stirring, she could hear Shadow Naoto laugh in excitement. Shadow Naoto looked pleased with the result, almost too pleased. Naoto saw the smirk as her Shadow walked over. \"Ready Naoto? Souji-kun is almost here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Soui...kun?\" Naoto said still somewhat out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a whole two days since you came here, my experiment went off without a hitch...but I'm not done yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Shadow Naoto have planned?</span></div></div>",

While you have truly filled out in more ways than one I'm more then sure our Souji-kun would enjoy seeing you with much bigger breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow had to be kidding Naoto already felt as if she had a hundred possibly more plus pounds on her due to her chest alone why the blue hell would the shadow feel she needed more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Souji-kun would enjoy that so much. Can't you already imagine him wanting to bury himself in your chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto did her best to resist the mental thought if only because she feared the boy would suffocate with all the fat gathered in her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thus it must be biggest. It deserves to be just as you deserved and desired to be more womanly. Scientifically speaking I'm positive Souji-kun would be a man that appreciates his girl having big healthy breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow laughed as it faded away and reappeared at top of Naoto's humongous belly her chest just a few steps in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately it must be a bit difficult to see what I have in my hands so allow me to explain. In each syringe is the fattening compound I've mixed with the ooze, or lard if you prefer, that you've been drinking down the past forty-eight hours. In it's pure form however it will trigger a powerful release of expansion. I'm sure you can guess where I'm headed with this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! NO don't!\" yelled out Naoto powerless to stop the mad shadow from lightly piercing each breast with a needle. The chemical sinking into the detective's already humongous bust. Realizing what was to come the shadow faded away and back onto the floor eagerly awaiting the new results as Naoto's bloated form began to quake and quiver more specifically her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take too long however for the shaking to come to an end and give way to Naoto's newest growth. Before she had grown all over this time though because of the shadow's actions Naoto was quickly realizing that her entire field of vision would be taken up by her rapidly increasing bust size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigger, fatter, thicker, her chest grew and the ace detective had no earthly idea when the expansion would come to an end.</span></div></div>",

The gases and serums are also what's keeping your bones from snapping under your weight, in fact you should thank me, once I'm done the procedure you'll still be able to walk...or waddle as the case will be, so you can still get up off your fat ass and feed your fat face.\" Shadow Naoto laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breasts felt soft as they were cushioned on Naoto's belly, Naoto could only look at the ballooning breasts, they were like beach balls each!

Look at them! They're wonderful size!\" Metal arms came down and pulled Naoto's arms forward and made her rub them to get a feel, for this was possibly the last time her arms will ever move even with help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe base's alarms started going off, Naoto looked around as well as Shadow Naoto, she knew it could only mean one thing, Souji and company.

Hearing about Naoto being captured, seeing her as a huge blob and now three other friends of his being forced into being fattened. Souji couldn't stand down, period.

The Final Blow, right into the steel walls surrounding them, even leaving an indent of the fist that struck it. 22. That's how many times she'd have died had Souji not healed her. \"Enough! Y-You win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mad Scientist was bowing her head in defeat as she was on her hands and knees. \"I-I'll stop the experiment, I'll let Naoto go! Just please, no more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess there was something even a genius detective couldn't predict, and that's what happens when the calm ones get angry.\" Yosuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, remind me never to get on Senpai's bad side.\" Kanji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji looked down at Shadow Naoto lifting her up by the shoulder and dragging her to the control panel, demanding the girls be released. The Shadow fearfully complied. it seems even the Shadows, should fear an angry friend.</span></div></div>",

She walked out of her home stretching. \"Those guys kept me up longer then I wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto was thinking about a party she had with the gang. They were trying their best to stay together despite their Leader leaving. It was Naoto's turn to host and she felt she overdid it on everything, a better clue though was some love handles. \"It'll go away by tomorrow, some walking will make me burn off last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naoto walked around she remembered the times she spent alone with Souji. Solving a 'mystery' and more importantly falling in love with him. She then remembered she vowed to become more ladylike. Nodding her head Naoto went to see about some more girl like clothes. Though Naoto was out of touch with her feminine side, but she knew who to call. \"Thanks Rise-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for an hour Rise came up to Naoto. \"Ooookay, Operation 'Femme Fatal' is go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise...it's not THAT big a deal.\" Naoto said a bit shocked Rise was passionate about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, still we're going to find the nicest things for you.\" Rise said taking Naoto by the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two found a nice place Naoto took a shirt and skirt that matched well and went to change. \"Uhhhh Rise-chan can you check to see if these are the right sizes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping the clothes by Rise picked them up and returned to Naoto. \"No, they're exactly the same as they say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible! They're too tight!\" Naoto shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh why don't you try these?\" Rise slid similar clothes in...except they were size larger and Naoto was silent before slamming the door open in her normal attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise...what's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just trying to help Naoto, not my fault you've been binging at our parties lately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto didn't you notice? You've been eating more then most of us...look I understand you're upset that Senpai...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm gaining weight!?\" Naoto offended walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto? NAOTO!\" Rise went to follow Naoto but since she was still carrying the clothes the alarm went off and Security grabbed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that Rise.\" Naoto looked at her pudgy sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I really be gaining weight?\" Suddenly a familiar scientific figure was in the reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be...you WANT TO.\" Shadow Naoto said as Naoto stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're connected...you and I...What's the matter, frightened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away!

She knew her shadow wasn't that evil. Perhaps her own desire to find the truth for herself was that intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay...\" Naoto went inside the TV, little did she know a trap was waiting, a Robo-Teddie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLO, NAOTO...CHAN...\" The robot duplicate said bashing his rounded fist into her gut knocking her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good my cute little toy, now bring her here...we have much to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is how Naoto was captured and Fattened...what is the evil Shadow Planning?</span></div></div>",

Well, Mission Accomplished for now.

Though I guess I'm really going to overeat now.\" Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise hugged Naoto who hugged back each forgiving each other. The group left and Naoto sat at the base while everyone left for home and Teddie checked outside every hour. When the coast was Clear Naoto was escorted home by Teddie. \"Well, think you can sneak in like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I...used to sneak all the time when I was a kid.\" Naoto blushed remembering her childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.

Just leave it by the door...\" Naoto was sweating bullets as the sounds of a tray being placed down and footsteps leaving calmed her nerves as she quickly took the food and devoured it, her new size wasn't just for show. She had the hunger of someone that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could my Shadow be thinking?\" Naoto wanted to think on it more but she was tired. She leaned onto her bed which creaked and groaned as it sunk down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe faded into the world of dreams. Unknowing that her Shadow's plan was already in place.

She looked closer, puzzled by the large white object she saw, only to start to realize as she saw red atop the figure's head, when she finally saw what she was trying to look at she wished she didn't! It was her! She had somehow blimped up beyond belief! She couldn't help but scream, lucky her grandmother was out of town getting some particular suppiles for their shop, though she probably woke someone close by up. \"What's happened to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was shaking her fattened head around in confusion, her double and triple chin going with, she stood up to get a good look, her belly was pushing out and drooping covering her straining panties, and the large gut was proving a nice resting place for breasts that were half the size of Rise's head, but half the length of her arm! Slowly turning around she looked to see her ass had widened and rounded out quite a bit a well, her panties barley covering her butt crack. \"I don't understand, how could this have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Rise realized this was the work of Shadow Naoto! Rise went to the door and began to struggle once she got to it, because her belly girth got too wide halfway through, stepping back Rise quickly went to check her weight to tell the gang just how big she was once she manages to escape her own bathroom. She stepped on the scale, it was tipping 600! Rise's plumped fingers met her frightened face, however her true nightmare only began, slowly the scale was increasing! \"W-W-WHAT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n605, 610, 620! She was gaining weight faster then before! By the time Rise got off the scale she was pushing 650! Trying to move her thunder thighs was difficult as she rammed through the door way, she didn't care she just took out a wall, she went to look for her phone, and realized she left it in her purse. She looked around for her purse, slowly a fourth chin forming, the bra and panties reaching their upmost limit, Rise finally found it and raised it gloriously into the air. \"YES! Now to warn the others!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise tried dialing the numbers but her thumb was much to fat to hit a single number! She tried her index finger, then her ring  finger, but by the time she thought to use her pinky it too was larger then a normal thumb. \"U-Uh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was confused at how big she was, so she went back to the scale. 900, 1100! She was gaining like mad! \"This isn't good! What are we going to do!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise slowly tried moving towards the door but her shape made her too exhausted  to move that much. \"Guys...how am I going to warn you before it's too late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise fell down onto her large ass, wondering how they're going to survive this ordeal.</span></div></div>",

Rise could only assume it was around the ton mark when their undergarments at last gave up the fight against the wave of flab pouring out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bra being torn off with a rather audible snap, Rise having to use one of her tree-trunk sized arms to remove it from being buried inside a fat fold, that was about the most action her heavy set arms was going to get at least that\u2019s what she thought. Her panties however simply ripped clean in two and were most likely buried beneath her continuously growing form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise really couldn\u2019t believe she was still growing in weight she must have six chins by now and her immense cleavage was making it hard to see beyond her ballooning breasts someone like Naoto could easily be trapped within them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait Naoto oh hell while Rise was concerned worrying about warning the others she had somewhat forgotten about who may already be affected!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaoto-kun!\u201d she called out with horrible worry, her chins wobbling in the process. If she was already close to two tons, although it seemed to her that at last the gaining was beginning to die to down, she could only imagine how massive (Rise figuring that was an underestimation) her blue-haired friend must be\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver at the Shirogane home perhaps for the first time in her entire life Naoto was completely speechless! Everything her close group of friends along with her had gone though was remarkable and stunning in many ways but nothing prepared her this\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had instantly felt something was off when instead of waking up at top her bed she had found herself on the cold floor except she shouldn\u2019t have been able to feel the cool surface of the tiles beneath given her casual sleep ware. Another thing as well was the fact that she felt rather cramped in as if unknown force was compacting her body into a rather tight space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all rather unreal for the blue-haired girl doing her best to rub the sleep out of her eyes strangely she found a lot of foreign material around her naturally small face and her arm why on earth did it feel as if an oak had suddenly swapped itself with her usual appendage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously she knew that her shadow had altered her weight by a great deal but this\u2026felt different even to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last upon waking up and the mental cobwebs disappearing Naoto, much like Rise would a short time later across town, came to a shocking discovery! She was massive, no not even downright massive would be a proper term for it immense perhaps? Gigantic? A part of her mind struggled to find a proper term to describe her titanic girth the other part trying to make sense of how she had gone to bed a big woman and woken up as a living breathing blob of blubber!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a shot in the dark given the situation but the detective girl had to assume that she was close to if not already four tons in weight, having taken up most the space in her private room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bed nowhere to been seen, not that she could see much pass her small vehicle-sized breasts so plumped and perky sitting gently at top a belly that again if she had to guess was about as thick and wide as she was tall. She could somewhat make out the sensation of some of her folds pushing into the side walls and the edge of her engorged stomach pressing into the wall directly in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to move her head as best she could but found that all she could make out was more of her spreading outward like a sea born of her own blubber. It didn\u2019t help that in doing so her dozen or so chins wobbling as if they were waves out at sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came this rather uncomfortable feeling in her backside, Naoto\u2019s monstrous butt had literally crushed her bed into pieces or perhaps even into dust (she wasn\u2019t too sure nor did she really care at this point) and much like her belly stretched outward to where it too was struggling against a room wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing her best to compose herself it wasn\u2019t hard for her to realize that her body had grown so insanely massive that she was now trapped within her own room, most of her possessions possibly flattened underneath her tremendous girth but most material items can be replaced right now she had to clear her head and despite the strangest wake-up call she\u2019s ever had she had to gain control of her senses and her emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to the days before Naoto knew this was her shadow\u2019s doing but to go this far to convert her into a blimp of flesh was utter madness. She also wondered however how she was going to inform the others about what had just occurred to her\u2026then it hit her like a ton of bricks <b>RISE</b>! The redhead had shared a hug with her could she have been affected in some way as well?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh but her size was keeping her heavily grounded, her elephant rivaling legs pinned down beneath the rest of her bulk, regardless she had to think of something\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the opposite end of the door both Chie and Yukiko stood still a little puzzled over what they had been told from the blue-haired girl\u2019s butler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSick? No after a bit of thought on the matter Yukiko didn\u2019t buy it was an obvious lie to keep anyone from finding out about the tremendous weight her friend had put on. While it took her a bit longer then her close friend Chie too had come to the conclusion that it was a cover, good thing she and Yukiko had decided to pay Naoto a visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were also rather concern with tone Naoto had just used. Something about it felt off but they just figured it was due to the embarrassment she must be going through at being so large. Stepping into the room however proved that they were right\u2026just not to that much of an extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d questioned Chie staring at the enormous flesh-colored blob before them, before she could lay a hand on it though Naoto called out to the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo please\u2026don\u2019t touch me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaoto-kun? Is that you?\u201d asked a very concerned and confused Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026It\u2019s all me Sempai.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-haired girl answered honestly seeing as there was no reason to lie now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie could only gasp at the situation yet she could feel a deep anger boiling in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was your shadow wasn\u2019t it, Naoto-kun. Somehow she made you even bigger didn\u2019t she!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Chie was fuming Yukiko did her best to calm her blonde best friend down even though she could easily understand where Chie was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto gave a confirmation before yet again asking for them to not lay a hand on them. Yukiko taking a moment to ask why she was requesting such a thing the blue-haired girl responded by stating that she believed that if they were to come into contact with her the two of them would begin to swell outward with fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little late for that\u2026\u201d mentioned Chie a not so amused look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell because Yukiko and I have already begun to pack away the pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis revelation stunned Naoto just as a much as it had stunned her friends when the change had occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth ladies were rather chubby but more specifically Chie had been hit harder. One could say she was around 250 pounds far bigger then what she normally was. Thicken thighs and arms, a jacket struggling to contain her much larger breasts, and a belly that stuck out a few feet in front of her. Not to mention how she had to constantly keep an eye on her skirt from completely exposing her huge hips and panty-now-thong wearing butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko had been spared somewhat her weight closer to 175 making her just a chubbier version of herself, the hardest hit section being the spare-tire of a belly she had going on. Still relatively nothing compared to what had occurred with Chie and especially Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note the young detective turned blob pondered away at what she had just been told. Originally she was led to believe that coming into contact with her was enough to trigger a chance but seeing as she had no way to confirm this Rise (the sole person who made direct physical contact with her yesterday) but perhaps her shadow\u2019s intentions were far more sinister than even she had first believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie and Yukiko hadn\u2019t made contact with her yet they bloated up\u2026Rise surely and unfortunately must have grown as well. Yes the signs were pointing toward something far worse. A \u201cvirus\u201d was the best way she could put it but it wasn\u2019t spreading through touch alone no it was made worse due to the possibility that it was spreading through the air, how else could it had struck Chie and Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it pained her to admit given their shared brilliance her shadow was one magnificent bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat aside Naoto still felt she had to get word from Rise, to see how the redhead had fared (unaware that Rise had already bloated far beyond that of either Chie or Yukiko\u2026)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly however she felt her body begin to flare up again, as unbelievable as it may sound she was still growing larger! She did her best to quickly warn her friends of her increasing girth, now coming very close to encasing her entire room with her body. The floor beneath her and the walls to the sides of her begin to crack further leaving the blue-haired blob girl in even more of a troubling position. Something had to give soon either the weakening wall structure or the floor boards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she wasn\u2019t the only one growing Chie began to freak out as she plumped out quickly removing her jacket to allow her body just a bit more freedom, her skirt becoming even more troublesome, the rest of her fattening until she reached about 400 pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko again was the luckiest expanding and ending up around Chie\u2019s old weight of 250, every part of her bigger and more filled out especially her huge paunch of a belly. She blushed a tad after her sweater had ridden up and exposed a bit of her creamy flesh for the entire world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their sudden fattening done the girls knew they had to do something fast considering they were still getting bigger, especially Naoto, with Yukiko bringing up an intriguing point. Outside of the virus potentially affecting people on different levels what if every time someone grew due to becoming \u201cinfected\u201d all those already <i>tainted</i> grew simultaneously!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto, her now tiny head resting on the sea of blubber all around, gave it some thought. It was certainly possible and for the moment would explain the continuous growth spurts they been having, more so her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there was still Rise to worry about\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go check up on her.\u201d stated Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m the <i>thinnest</i> of us all so I can make the best time over to her place. Chie its best you stay here with Naoto-kun\u2026\u201d explained Yukiko before leaning a bit toward her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll need your support if she gets any bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie said nothing in response instead simply nodded she knew Yukiko was right leaving Naoto alone right now wouldn\u2019t be fair to her and even if she couldn\u2019t do much else she\u2019d at least be able to comfort and support the younger girl during her time of need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying her goodbyes Yukiko left as quickly as she could despite her new weight and body size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Be careful Yukiko\u2026\u2019 thought Chie as she glanced over the inhumanly immense blob that had become her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould they all end up like Naoto, how much bigger could Naoto get, what was Rise's current fate, and could Yukiko make it to her in time?</span></div></div>",

She huffed and had the occasional wheeze but she soon came upon a familiar scene, the local stores. She slowly and sweatily made it past the gas station, then Deidara's and finally stood before the Tofu Shop. Yukiko sighed and lifted her now thunder thighs, feeling a bit of a gain coming on, her sweater rose a bit more, her stocking tightened, but before he shoes could constrict her feet Yukiko removed them as slowly made her way towards Rise's room. \"R-Rise-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YUKIKO-SEMPAI!? NO! STAY AWAY! YOU CAN'T...\" Rise screamed, terrified of her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-chan...I know what's going on, please...let me in!\" The door was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-chan the same thing is happening to Naoto, I know you've gained a weird amount of weight! Please let...me...IN!\" She rammed the door with her new found weight and eventually forced it open, falling down to the ground and into the shadow of a 2500 pound idol whose face was puffy from fat and tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T LOOK AT ME!\" Rise shouted as Yukiko stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-chan...so you really are a victim too.\" Yukiko took the time she had to explain the situation, as well as catch her breath from heading to the shop, Rise listened her eyes still red from crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A virus...then how do we cure it, there's a cure right!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Rise-chan. Look the important thing is we're okay, alive. As long as we contact the others we can head back into the other world and solve this and get ourselves back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we don't Sempai? What if we just keep getting fatter and fatter?\" Yukiko stood there, breathing hard and questioning if Rise was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back in the lab where Naoto was fattened before Shadow Naoto was looking at a pocket watch. \"Everything is going as planned. Soon we'll hit the twelve hour mark of the infection and Stage two can commence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes became seconds as the girls all felt something happening, the second stage of this illness was beginning as well as it's new effect.</span></div></div>",

She ran as fast as she could given her current situation, but the thought Rise could be even HALF as big as Naoto made her push forward. \"Rise-chan, please be okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Yukiko tripped and hit someone while running. \"OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair sat up, Yukiko shot up. \"I'M SORRY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran off, the pinkish haired girl looking at her. \"Wasn't that? No...she was too big to be Amagi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time to think about what just happened and what might occur with Yukiko, she only had the health of Rise to worry about. Then it struck her! Kanji lives closer to Rise then where she was! Yukiko looked through her things, her cellphone was missing! She had dropped it in that bump and didn't realize it! Sighing she rushed off, she noticed that it had become harder to run, and that she was breathing a bit harder. She stopped and looked at a car window to see her reflection, YIKES! She had a double chin already! Her clothes were stretching to contain her fat, holes already in her stocking from some flab breaking through, her breasts pushed her shirt up, exposing her pregnant like stomach. \"I'm...this huge already! Rise! Hold on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko pushed herself, if she was the same size when she left the Shriogane estate then she'd be going faster, but she was slower with this new found flab. As she began to sweat she bumped into someone else, but this time her size and stability made it so the person she hit took the fall she stopped and gasped bowing down repeatedly, least as much as she could given her gut was even larger now. \"I'M SO SORRY! I'M IN A HURRY! IT'S AN EMERGENCY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko ran past the person, it was a slender woman with short black hair. \"Owwwwww....that hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko had been delayed by these incidents that she just barely made it to the Tofu store. She panted as she went in, her stocking were ripped exposing her fat thighs, legs and butt which started to tear the panties she wore, her sweater was torn off only leaving the shirt she had. Her third chin formed as she marched up the steps, belly dropping forward as she made it to Rise's door, she had to be pushing 575 to 600 now. \"R-R-RISE-CHAN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was exhaustion and the large size that made her breath hard, her chest pounding. \"Y-Yu...kiko....sempai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Rise it's me!\" She opened the door and gasped. \"Rise...No....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Yukiko's horror Rise was even larger then Naoto! Least to what Yukiko knew. Rise's stomach was the width of a small camping RV, and was even longer pushing forward, her breasts stretched out further and was as wide as Naoto when she first left the TV World during this mess. Her arms and legs were like sturdy oaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sem....pai? I can't...see you...\" Rise said her fat covering her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise...this is terrible! Oh what are we going to do?\" Yukiko asked as the sounds of the floor creaked as Rise grew more! She was obviously past 7 tons at least! Soon she won't even be able to fit in her house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko had to think of SOMETHING! Anything! The same with Chie who was clocking in around 800 pounds! Naoto must be 12 whole tons! How can this situation get ANY worse!?</span></div></div>",

The raven-haired woman was actually surprised at how well the person could move despite their size and she was pretty sure it was a woman, a <i>big</i> woman but a woman nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sort of reminded her of Yukiko Amagi but in a much grander scale of course she figured that no way was it Amagi, the young woman wasn\u2019t that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back she kind of wished she could have gotten a better look but the need to regain her composure and lack of breath forced her to only catch a glimpse of the stranger\u2019s fleeing form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged with a sigh continuing on her walk, no real destination currently on her mind. Suddenly she paused as she noticed a cell phone that had seemingly been knocked to one side apparently no one had come to notice it\u2026yet anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi being something of a good person figured she could use the phone to contact and inform the owner about their forgotten property. Casually making her way over toward it she leaned in to lift it off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely however she let out a small grunt, it wasn\u2019t because the phone was heavy no instead it felt as if something was pushing into her midsection. She didn\u2019t even consider the idea of having gained any weight since she always ate well and took a small liking to walking around Inaba (it was her way of calming her mind and putting the recent incident with her family behind her\u2026as well as recalling the times she spend and inner strength she gained from hanging out with Souji Seta, at times though she still missed his presence\u2026)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo no she shook away the idea that it was a \u201c<i>fatty grunt</i>\u201d instead focused on looking up the owner\u2019s info. To her surprise it was Yukiko\u2019s own personal phone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi now knew she had to return it immediately while the two weren\u2019t exactly friends or even acquaintances Yumi figured it was better for her to have found the phone then some sicko pervert or nosy reporter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she stuck the phone in her purse and decided to head up to the Amagi Inn all the while not noticing the slight new layer of thickness in her arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did however feel her skirt begin to strangely ride up on her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried fixing it a bit figuring it must have shrunk a tad in the wash or perhaps was just being stubborn. Placing her purse down near her feet she now began to use both of her hands her fingers however touching upon another startling surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips felt wider and her butt felt thicker fuller rather then the firmness she usually felt. This was too weird, no way had she let herself go that much. Even though she was rather confused at the moment Yumi quickly remembered the collected phone in her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning down she let out another grunt much like the one from before. Okay so now she was a bit freaked on top of being confused but still remained determined to give Yukiko back her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll just head up to the inn and not think at all about what just happened.\u201d She muttered to herself changing in direction so she could begin to make her way toward her new destination.</span></div></div>",

She shook it off saying she'd take a break at the inn. Along the way she saw other school mates, all of their uniforms were tighter, she looked away confused. The school couldn't really have made mistakes for every single female in school could they? No if that happened it would have been apparent at the start of the school year and it was near the end! She rubbed her eyes. \"Must be seeing things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing and feeling, as she felt her stomach was touching the fabric of her clothes, adjusting it without feeling anything she passed up a chance to notice her belly was slowly oozing out. She also passed more girls, heavier. Their outfits stretching and exposing parts of them. \"Whoa, something isn't right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could say that again, as her stomach did the same but more, forcing her top to cover her inflated chest. Not to mention her big ass was moving side to side now and barely had cover seeing as her panties were being consumed by the posterior and her skirt was slowly ripping, Yumi noticed she was breathing harder and harder. Her steps were harder to pick up and easier to drop. \"W-What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi then noticed some girls walking by that were waddling, their clothes barely fitting. She gasped in shock as she heard a rip, the top of her shirt was tearing from her added cleavage. She was now SURE something was wrong and needed to do something about this soon, she decided on dropping the phone off at Yukiko's place and hoping someone else finds it and gives it back to her. She tried running but her new size prevented that. \"This has to be a dream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain this new weight gave her ensured her this was no dream. This was a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went as fast as her flab would let her towards the Amgai in, sweating as she continued to swell up, when will she reach a limit!?

Then she felt her shoes were feeling a bit snug. \"Hmmmm okay that's just odd, I know my pants and shirt might have shrunk in the wash, but my shoes? Something is up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi's pondering was then interrupted by a loud creaking. She looked around, she saw the general store, that wasn't it. The Weaponsmith? No of all the sounds she's heard passing by this was nothing like it. She then looked to the Tofu Shop, where Rise lives and works. Something was off, she could feel it as well as hear it. The hard timber was creaking, stretched out by something. That's when Yumi noticed it, mounds of flesh pushed up against all the windows and sneaking down into the lower levels. Her gut (no pun intended) instincts told her to stay away, but something peeked her curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked towards the shop, unknowing and at this point uncaring of the fat her skirt and top were riding up to the point her panties were exposed and her top was almost a second bra. She walked in and the creaking noise was in full force, Yumi looked and saw more flesh poking down, though one was a bit different color then the other, Yumi pondered this when she finally snapped to. \"Oh crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to move quickly but found herself huffing as she only just made it out before a loud CRASH! Suddenly she was knocked to the ground by something soft, luckily she landed on something soft, her new gut that she just now began to notice. She rolled onto her back and was shocked by the sight she saw. The Tofu store gone, replaced by a HUGE building sized mound of fat, and next to it was an almost equally sized mound of fat, this one however she could see the head, it was Yukiko Amagi! \"What is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could get an answer the larger mound of flesh grew more, a roll landing on Yumi's legs pinning her down. \"H-Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko turned her head as far as she could, but she barely made out Yumi. \"Rise-chan! You have to move! You're going to crush someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can't...Sempai...\" Rise replied slowly, Yumi was shocked hearing all this, Rise Kujikawa, the famous pop idol bugger then her own home! This had to be a nightmare of some kind, however then numbness in her legs proved otherwise. She was confused, as would anyone outside the group. It was obvious the Virus was making the increments of growth larger as time went on and prolonged contact increased it further, which is why Yukiko was minutes away from catching up to the longer infected Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver where the Shirogane estate once stood Crows flocked away screeching from the two increasing mounds of flesh on the horizon.

Although she didn\u2019t really have any time to come up with an accurate calculation she figured she was close if not past a quarter of a ton, by comparison she was still a <i>bug</i> when matched up against the unfortunate Yukiko and Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was nice to not be that big\u2026yet\u2026Yumi quickly realized that as she continued growing so were the other two girls. Girls that were already far and away bigger then her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggled trying to pry herself free barely making out the whimpering of an immobile Rise with Yukiko doing her best to encourage the redhead to move in at least some way, the raven-haired girl also attempting to move her massive form but unfortunately to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below Yumi continued to shift and turn nearly panicking once she spotted that her lower body was mere inches away from being consumed by the ever-growing Rise. Desperate she tried shoving away the incoming girth but was far too weak and the flesh far too soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have blown up another hundred pounds or so during her continuing struggle but that was the least of her worries, right now she just didn\u2019t want to be buried beneath the flood of fat that steadily overtaking her and anything else in its way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit\u2026why is this happening\u2026what is happening\u2026\u201d she muttered with a pained grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be the way I die\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the tonnage pinning her down beginning to cut away at her air she still fought on but her stamina, divided by her struggle and her own growth, was draining rapidly and Yumi could feel her consciousness fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026I can\u2019t die this way\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was apparent however that despite her protests soon Rise would inadvertently bury the poor girl alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026Father\u2026Mother\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mumbled as one of her arms hopelessly extended outward her pudgy hand reaching nearly begging for any possible salvation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSouji-kun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that her arm fell towards the ground...</span></div></div>",

Looking forward however she came to lay eyes with her rescuer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026And it wasn\u2019t exactly who she expected it to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slender yet beautifully shaped woman whom she believed to be a few years older then she was, well groomed thinly blonde hair reaching just about to her shoulders, a uniform colored in deep blue that reminded her of a hotel worker\u2019s, lastly striking golden eyes that she almost felt as if they were staring directly into her very essence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi couldn\u2019t help but feel a little taken back but not before blushing just a tad bit at her savior\u2019s beauty. This mystery woman certainly was quite a looker, which was obvious by just passing a glance at her, yet she shook away any further thoughts when she realized neither had said a thing yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi felt rather shameful that she had yet to thank her rescuer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems I arrived later then expected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t even get a chance to say a thing before the woman began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm thank you for saving me but who are you?\u201d she asked kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was my duty and you will learn of <i>the truth</i> soon enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the response she expected and what did she mean by <i>the truth</i>?

Somehow she was able to drag her along as if Yumi\u2019s weight was that of a child. Just who was this woman anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment she wondered where that door before them had appeared from. Her thoughts would be interrupted however after the woman pushed it open and nearly shoved her straight through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman ignored the horrified yell let out by Yumi as the girl passed through dimensions. Taking one last glance over toward the flab-eclipsing horizon she silently stepped through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door locking and fading away as if it were never there to begin with\u2026</span></div></div>",

It was then that Yumi saw all of Souji's guys friends, Youske Teddie and Kanji as well as Souji's cousin Nanko, unaffected by the virus and of course right next to her was the person who brought her here. \"This is all of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't she infected too?\" Kanji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Infected, what's going on, what is this place?\" Yumi asked getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in another world, a world that until now had been peaceful since Souji helped figure out the secret behind the murders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme explain.\" Yosuke said, within ten minutes, and a change of clothes thanks to Margaret using the three sisters Personae to weave Yumi new clothes that fit her, only for her infection to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Souji....saved the world? But what does that have to do with now?\" Yumi asked still confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now we face a greater evil then Izanami, an evil that even my master knows little of, we only know of his powers. To nurture hatred, anger, fear. He took the rage the one you called Naoto had, and amplified it a thousand fold, if not for Souji helping her see her light her shadow would have killed her, her friends and everyone she knew. This fate they suffer is a better alternative.\" Margaret said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, okay so what do you want us to do? If this dude makes Izanami look weak, what are we supposed to do without sempai?\" Kanji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to head into the domain the creature had made. Nega Inaba. He's gathering all the shadows of all the residents of Inaba, he intends to make them stronger, darker and thus through the connections, make them even more powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about this virus? How can we stop it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Kanji shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This virus can not be cured, it can however be slowed to a point where it's effects can be reversed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we can slow this massive growth down, and it'll be up to us to fix the rest?\" Teddy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what about these two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of all the remaining people touched by Souji's light, these are the only ones capable to come, the young one because the virus in her won't become active until she's of age, and the dark haired one because she is still mobile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean...?\" Yosuke asked and Margaret nodded making a portal showing Ai Ebihara on the street, unable to move, Sayako trying to help other female patients but has succumbed to her tons, Shu tending to his expanding mother, the members of the Basketball team Kou, and Soccor team Daisuke, crushed under two girls Kou set them up with and Ayane equal to her opposite counterpart, except her natural body is smaller thus she was rendered immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the remaining ones. You are the ones blessed by the Light of the World Arcana, and already have your hand into the next stage of Evolution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evolution?\" Kanji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the 'cure' for Humans to evolve. You must find the body of Inzanmi, which has be cleansed by the Light, and these two girls must be the first ones to undergo the next step, what you would consider 'Gods and Goddess'. Then we find your friends' shadows and bath them in the light and begin the evolution with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, but Nana-chan nearly died last time, and Yumi-chan is still grow...\" Teddy was about to Finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To keep them safe, they will take my power.\" Margaret said giving half of her powers to each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't be long before I share the fate of every other female now.

Someone something out here was actually more powerful then Izanami. The fallen goddess had already taken them to their absolute limit now without their close friend and leader of old they had to stop this new menace and what did she mean by evolve? \"Gods and Goddesses\" was too vague of a clue to work with, of course if Naoto were here he was sure she\u2019d attempt at peeling away at the meaning behind the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto he recalled the young detective outright replacing her home with her own fatten form. He didn\u2019t even want to think about what the girls were currently going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last thought did make him wonder why the virus was being so gender-specific but before he could get to that there was something he had to take care of first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi turned over toward Yosuke for a moment after he spoke her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured you should have this Ozawa-san.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired girl stared at the iron rod handed over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure if you\u2019ve ever handled a weapon before but things might get a little hairy and well it\u2019s best to be prepared. You know just saying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke doing his best to explain and Yumi recalled how he had stated that Souji and the others used not only actual weapons to deal with shadows but mystical beings known solely as Personas. Curious Yumi wondered if she had the same thing inside of her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless she stated that she had little if any experience using any sort of weapon but was confident she could wing it to a good degree with the rod Yosuke had just handed her. Afterwards she thanked him for the gift. Yosuke turning away with a chuckle before she could catch sight of his mild blush. She did anyway but decided not to comment on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip went on with a few chats here and there. Teddie explaining the ins and outs of his world to Nanako, who seemed fascinated with everything told to her all the while still very concerned with her big brother\u2019s friends and for the safety of her own father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi on occasion was chatting away with Yosuke and Kanji helping her get a better idea of things and at times consulting Nanako in that everything would be alright the girl smiling whenever the child\u2019s expression became softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo even your own master can\u2019t smash whatever it is that\u2019s causing all of this shit?\u201d asked Kanji of Margaret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo never mind that he does not specialize in physical combat.\u201d The older woman stated rather bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay but do you have any idea why the virus plaguing our world is only affecting the women?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was Yosuke asking a question, one that had been bugging him for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately I do not have an answer to that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrange I\u2019m no expert but usually viruses don\u2019t aim for a single gender and dodge the other. But you mentioned Shirogane-kun earlier and given her intelligence if her shadow as you call them made the virus then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen maybe <i>she</i> was smart enough to make it so the outbreak only infected the female half of Inaba.\u201d Stated Yosuke then apologizing for interrupting Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d asked Kanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe the one who is behind all of this got <i>her</i> to do it for them\u2026dammit we have more questions then we have answers\u2026\u201d muttered a now frustrated Yosuke\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is where Izanami is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I don\u2019t know about you guys but isn\u2019t this where we fought her last time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly Kanji did in fact have a point. Margaret had indeed led them towards Yomotsu Hirasaka, the very same location where the investigation team had confronted Izanami in the past. At the time however they were sure the fallen goddess had been dealt with\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe very same, now time is short so I suggest you head in without a moment\u2019s notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not coming along Margaret-san?\u201d asked Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not. I will await here on the off chance that my Master requires my services.\u201d The older, and pleasantly plump, woman explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t he have any one else that can take your place?\u201d wondered Yosuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed he does. Unfortunately my brother is away at the moment handling matters given to him by my Master and\u2026my sister has taken personal leave\u2026she wishes to save the soul of a young woman and change the eternal fate bounded to her\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Yosuke found that he was confused by what Margaret had spoken of. Admittedly however he was somewhat curious at just what it was that her sister was trying to accomplish. It sounded rather difficult not only in execution but her departure had apparently shaken the older woman in an emotional sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell regardless she didn\u2019t appear to be too talkative about the details so it was best to avoid the subject entirely and just refocus on what they were here for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was meeting once more with Izanami.</span></div></div>",

Okay so that leaves, 'the evolution.' Margaret mentioned.\" Yosuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must know...you can never go back, once you're changed your kind must learn a better sense of peace...otherwise you'll be destroyed. The Power is emotions to the extreme. Negative emotions will turn you into wild beasts, like the lesser Shadows, and your powers will be too much to handle, you'll die from being unable to control yourselves. There is a bright side, finding peace in your hearts and you'll ascend to a higher level of strength and abilities, so much so even I couldn't stop two Evolved Humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...this is heavy.\" Kanji replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why Maragret wants the girls to go first, they're pure hearts unlike me or Kanji.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU SAYING I'M NOT CALM!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay.\" Yumi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yumi-chan...\" Yosuke looked to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it'll help everyone, I'll do it.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna help too, I don't understand all that much, but the lady in the blue dress told me I can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step forward, take the light that Souji implanted into me, the Light of the World Arcana...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two did so, Izanami placing her hands on the girls' heads</span></div></div>",

She knew for sure one side she had Yukiko who had blown up so massive in her own right yet was still smaller then Rise. Others were bumping into her but she had no clear idea who they were since it seem to her and Yukiko that every woman in the city had become a human blimp and just like them were still growing ever fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross town however stood what supposedly could be considered a monument of blubber. While most if not all the ladies in town were now larger then the Junes mega-store, in Rise\u2019s rare case even bigger then the majority, they were no where close to the size of the blue-haired mega-ton blob that was slowly eclipsing all in her wake with her vast amount of flab!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto couldn't even begin to assume how monstrous her weight had become. All she really knew was that she alone was burying about less then a quarter of the town and all the while still growing larger by the minute. So much so that she had begun to actually elevate other immense-sized ladies onto and on top of her numerous folds/rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen this had begun she had hoped that their added weight would slow down her own out pour but nothing seem to change instead she continued gaining and piling more helpless ladies upon her as she further blanketed the town with more of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such gal was Chie who had found herself resting somewhere near the detective\u2019s left breast. It was so huge and vision-spanning the blonde figured at some point Naoto would grow so mind-numbingly huge that even at her size she be able to live in it or in the sea of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless all Chie could do was wait and ride out their continuing growth. She only hoped that her friends even if they were fatten to a ridiculous degree were alright and prayed that the horror would end before Naoto replaced the entire town with herself\u2026but would it even end there? She could only hope so\u2026</span></div></div>",

Their lips met and time became a blur\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later the blue-haired shadow proceeded to put on her tossed aside jacket.

You're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel different, this better not be some kind of trick.\" Yosuke said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No trick, your bodies are simply slowly adapting, the changes can be harmful if they happen too soon. I am afraid that option has to happen when you fight the Shadows of your allies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey what about me?\" Teddy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not human, least not fully so, no matter how hard you try you're part shadow. You can not gain the same evolution as humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess that means I'm useless...\" Teddy turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary, you are the one who can save humans if they do not learn peace, for as I said, they would destroy everything, including themselves. You will be the last remaining imperfect being that can go into the Human World.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're basically a fail-safe if we let this power go to our heads.\" Yosuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yumi?\" Kanji was looking over as Yumi as doubled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her body is changing, it's trying to burn away the girth she acquired, the virus is strong though, however she will be fine.\" Izanami said as kanji got down holding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! Damn she's burning up!\" Kanji said blowing on his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here let me...WHOA!\" When Yosuke pushed Kanji aside he saw Yumi had lost a small fraction of her weigh in the gut but not her rear and cleavage, her hair grew a bit, and the cute face had become that of a model's, Yosuke was looking at her new beauty in sheer awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their bodies are also adapting to fit their new status.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that means...all the women who get this light become...sexier?\" Yosuke asked a bit excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yosuke-sempai...you're sounding...kinda creepy.\" Kanji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, hey Nana-chan...are you...taller?\" Teddy realized that Nanako was about 3 inches taller and her hair was longer too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her desire to help in the battle is causing her to age faster, the infection will afflict her when she's done but as long as she keeps active the virus will be at bay.\" Izanami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Nanako, you're throwing away your Childhood! You can't do that!\" Kanji shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to help though! Big Bro saved me, I want to pay him back by helping all his friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems she's maturing mentally as well...forget it Kanji, women can never change their mind when they set their minds onto something. Besides we don't know what other effects these new powers have, maybe she can change back when the fighting is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got what you came for, now you must spread the light to your friends shadows and beat Yami no Ouja. Or else Humanity is doomed.\" Izanami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" Yumi asked, her voice was a bit more angelic in tone as she rose up, having lost another 10 or so pounds to her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will stay here...I can not be cured, so I will contain myself until I reach the point I cease to be...this will be out last meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thank you, and I'm sorry we can't help you.\" Yosuke said, the group turned around and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like they'll be okay.\" Izanami closed her eyes and she bloated out to the point her robes snapped, and just kept going, sealing off the entrance once they were gone. She eventually would find peace this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gang got out they were met by a MUCH larger Margaret who had found herself a large cake and was partaking in it, frosting adorning her lips. \"Forgive me...I became...as you call it, Peckish while waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh no problem.\" Yosuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'll lead you to Nega Inaba, where the Shadows of your allies await, you'll need to use your news powers when defeating them. Otherwise they'll be cursed forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip brought about many changes, Margaret was growing more and more fat, panting sooner with each passing minute and slowing down every 2. Nanako, bless her soul had already stepped into Teen years, she was developing like any girl at 12-13 was despite her real age being much younger, as for Yumi, she had become a Hourglass looking Goddess, her hair grew to Yukiko's length, her face was beyond that of a model's and looked like a sorrow filled goddess waiting for her lost lover, and her chest and butt were still the same size when she was huge, only now her gut was more curved at the side then huge as beach balls. Yosuke remained calm and didn't act out any perverse fantasy out of respect for Souji who cared for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're *urp* here.\" Margaret said as the group saw a near exact replica of Inaba, only shadow versions of it's residents reside there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we find the Shadows, beat up this Yami guy and head home.\" Kanji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Guys! Look!\" Teddy said, in the distance, the exact distance where they were to were the Amagi Inn would be in real Inaba, they saw an all too familiar castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Yuki-chan's castle!\" Teddy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we know where to head first.\" Yosuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where we part.\" Margaret said turning, her massive gut and breasts jiggled as she did, pulling a cookie out an eating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...but what's going to happen to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My powers will return eventually once the two won't need them, I'll...work out.\" Maragret said before waddling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys! Let's do this!\" Yosuke said as they faced the castle, what trial awaits this quest now?</span></div></div>",

I thought you enjoyed the company of others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled grinning like a cat at the cheeky attitude of the approaching figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow of Yukiko Amagi dressed as usual in her pink princess garb, glass shoes on her feet, and shinning tiara resting at top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite the party you have going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll in accordance to our Master\u2019s desires.\u201d The raven-haired shadow explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course of course.\u201d The redhead nodded swiftly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m guessing you were looking for me for some other reason, hmm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked her curiosity peaking just a tad.

It was your time, we lied to you to get out of saying sorry.

Not feeling yourself today?\" The laser whip came in Yosuke's direction, he broke out in time to roll out of the way, however despite her size she was quick and got into Yosuke's face, kicking him across the room through a stone pillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOSUKE-KUN!\" Yumi could only watch in terror as Yosuke fell to the ground onto his knees, where Shadow Chie kicked him in the gut, forcing his head down only to be kicked back up, Yosuke could feel his bones ready to snap as he was kicked in the side of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Yosuke, use your new power KILL ME, you know you want to! You HATE me, for all the suffering I put you through.\" She picked him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO ON, LET IT ALL OUT!\" She laughed, Yosuke grabbed her arms pushing them down, and eventually pushing the Shadow down, Yosuke's arms started to morph into something inhuman as he wrapped his hands around the Shadow's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shadow coughed and wheezed a demented smile on her face. \"Y-Yes...that's it! Strangle the life out of me Yosuke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sempai stop! You're killing her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what!? She's right, all the shit she put me through! All for what!?

Isn't she really suffering back home!? Unable to move, maybe even unable to breath...ISN'T SHE SUFFERING ENOUGH!?\" The young former actress said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke looked at the Shadow and remembered the real Chie is back home, unable to do anything. He let go and stepped back. \"My god you're right...just what was I doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? You being a pussy now!? Come on, finish me! Or I'll finish you!\" Shadow Chie prepared her whip, Yosuke was standing there still looking at his hands, the whip came down faster then a bolt of lightning, the gang couldn't finish calling his name as the whip cracked, Shadow Chie was in shock, the whip was cutting into Yosuke's shirt, but not his flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe how much of an idiot I am. I let a shadow get the better of me AGAIN. Heh, guess I really do deserve half that shit.\" Yosuke stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Yosuke...\" Teddy was in shock looking at Yosuke standing there, he removed the whip from his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand now, this power, I was so distrusting of this whole mess. Now I see, we're all victims here. You, me. We're just his pawns aren't we? Yami No Ouja. He left this town on the right terms, and I'm going to make sure it stays that way. So watch 'King of Darkness', I'm not going to let you change that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gust of wind blew through the castle as Yosuke's Persona card appeared between his index and middle finger and a green spiral formed a belt, he removed his glasses and crushed his card and pressed the belt. A light overcame Yosuke as he was covered in a ninja like armor. \"Playing dress up now Yosuke!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whip's edge came at Yosuke from various angles, he walked towards the seemingly impassable wall of pain, then without warning was on the other side walking towards Shadow Chie, the Shadow tried kicking, only for Yosuke to vanish as if he wasn't there, everyone was looking for him when he appeared near the exit, then vanished again, this time appearing on a pillar, again he vanished but this time he left a mark, he cut Shadow Chie's arms, then cut off a piece of her whip. \"I can feel it, this new power. It's amazing, everything you do is like looking at one of those flip books where each page has slightly different motions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke was beside Shadow Chie, then in front, then at the entrance. \"I've already won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell you...\" Shadow Chie stopped, and her whip broke apart and was cut all over, Yosuke walked towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie, if you can here me...sorry for putting up with my idiocy...\" Yosuke leaped up and spiraled like a tornado kicking the Shadow in the fattened gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yosuke?\" The real Chie was speaking through her shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie...don't worry...you girls will all be okay soon...I promise.\" Yosuke said as his armor faded away and the Shadow fell, vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One down, three to go.\" He said before falling to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Semapi!\" Kanji and Yumi rushed over checking on Yosuke's condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay...just a little tired...feels like when you first get your Persona.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You scared us for a moment there...I honestly through you were going to kill Chie-Sempai...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't, and I won't...but thanks Yumi, if it wasn't for you I'd have let petty things take away something more important...a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh I ummm...\" Yumi simply blushed and looked away, suddenly Nanako gasped and the trio looked over to her.</span></div></div>",

The raven-haired girl couldn\u2019t help but smile at the affection shown to her for her simple act of kindness thus returned the hug with just as much vigor, at the same time nearly burying Nanako\u2019s still adorable face right into her much bigger breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke coughed softly, not sure if it was the sight before him or the lost stamina returning to his body that made him do so, while Kanji unfortunately had to turn away cursing under his breath as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat all aside Teddie brought up the point that Nanako would soon need some new clothing, yes Yumi\u2019s jacket covered her up but that was only from the top\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was a Junes-looking store on the way over.\u201d He stated, the group taking a moment to think things over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if we leave now who the hell knows what\u2019s going to happen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t let Nanako-chan burst right out of her clothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a woman Yumi knew full well that even though she was among friends Nanako would never be able to live down the shame and she wasn\u2019t about to let that happen to Souji\u2019s cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take her there then.\u201d Stated Teddie with a determined growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey but since Rise isn\u2019t here we need you to be our guide!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanji did make a good point yet Yosuke found himself inclined to agree with the bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like the castle\u2019s changed too much I\u2019m sure we can manage just fine until Ted and Nana-chan get back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust don\u2019t take too long.\u201d Yosuke stated pointing straight at the now startled and nervous bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry everyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako felt terrible having to sideline the group due to her continuous aging yet she gasped as she felt Yumi give her one more reassuring hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you fret just get some new clothing and don\u2019t worry about us. We\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako smiled. This girl this new friend Yumi in some ways reminded her of her \u201c<i>big bro</i>\u201d. That smile of hers was almost like the one Souji would give her whenever he would comfort her. Nanako hugging the older girl with more emotion lost herself in that smile and the memory of her \u201c<i>brother</i>\u201d\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell guess we\u2019re flying blind for the moment.\u201d Yosuke stated while he, Kanji, and Yumi bid their farewells now turning their attention over toward heading deeper into the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after the group had parted away and the chamber found itself empty a very familiar face reappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sinister redhead chuckled having watched, through her own hidden methods, the battle that had taken place earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now it seems Yosuke-kun has developed a new talent. One that leaves him weakened afterwards but a new talent nonetheless. Heh, I\u2019m sure this is something that <i>she</i> would be real interested in\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the spot where the blonde knight had been defeated the shadow ran a pair of fingers through the spot eventually licking them over with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShame they got to her but I guess it couldn\u2019t be helped\u2026oh well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer laughter filling the room as she walked away disappearing into the deep shadows from where she came from.</span></div></div>",

No nothing to plug it into. Same for the power saw, and the...Jackhammer? Needless she needed something to use NOW. Then she saw it, a large hammer. That could work, she outstretched her now dainty thin fingers she looked at them and realized she was now about 17-19, rubbing her gorgeous face. \"I was a child. I can't be anymore. Even if I go back to the body of one, I'm maturing from this experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the hammer off the shelf, it's weight forced her to drop the heavy end. She lifted it up as the Robo-Ted walked up. \"I have to grow up now don't I Big Bro? You're not here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once child now woman lifted the hammer, and tried smashing the robot in. It took the blow to the noggin quite well, and then smacked Nanako away cutting her new shirt and leaving a small scratch along her stomach, she got up, still holding the hammer. \"I won't lose, Big bro fought so hard, his friends are fighting hard now too and some are suffering from all this! I won't lose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried again hitting the Titanium Teddie only for it to keep hitting her down. She kept getting up. Something was different, confidence she realized something. \"I see now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe touched where she was cut noticing there was no blood there. \"This is my power, slowly seeping to the surface.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako lifted the hammer onto her shoulder. \"I grew faster then I expected because it's my power, regeneration. I see now! I can't lose to the likes of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear then proceeded to attack. Nanako's eyes glowed blue. \"Big Bro, this is the power you had right? I'll surpass it like Yosuke-kun and the others will, but for now...LET ME BORROW IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hammer changed into a hammer with angel wings on them. \"PER...SO...NA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Nanako was a Angle in white armor with 6 wings with a similar hammer, the two struck the Robot bear sending it flying out of the aisle. Nanako was breathing hard. \"This is...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am thou and thou art I.\" The Angel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...this is the power I have to evolve beyond huh? It's already quite amazing.\" She smiled as the Persona vanished, then she heard the gears inside the bear turning ever so slowly, it still functions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grizzly gears turned, exposed to the world as it crept slowly to the finally matured Nanako. \"It's over you impostor. I'm not the helpless girl I was when this all started, and I won't be anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear launched rocket fists at Nanako who gracefully dodged each blow, and coming closer to the bear, then with a twirl she smashed the hammer across the bear's head sending it flying off. Too make sure the dead was done she called upon the power of her Persona again the smash the body into pieces, the head touched the ground wobbling. \"it's....over...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako held her body feeling hot, her Persona vanished, her evolution starting, despite the pain she smiled and rolled onto her back. \"That wasn't as bad...as I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako felt tired, how could she not? She ran through an entire mall, manifested her Persona power and then evolved past it all in the span of five minutes. She laughed though realizing she had helped, she fought off one of the villains.

After having caught the killer, Naoto and her friends rarely hung out at Junes anymore, having more time to spend visiting each other at their homes for friendly banter, study sessions, and the occasional visit to Okina City to catch a movie or go shopping, though, this mostly excluded Souji and Naoto, Souji having travelled back home since the murder case was solved, and Naoto being very busy with her detective work; the two sought to enjoy spending time with the members of the Investigation Team on their free time however, mainly during the holiday season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto stopped into Junes on this rare day where her schedule wasn't filled with work, hoping to find a remedy for her height problem, even if the effect provided was very little. Naoto stood in the electronics department, reminiscing of her time spent working the Inaba murders with her friends, and started mapping out scenarios in her head that may relieve her of her problem. \"There are two common options many take when looking to grow taller.\" Naoto thought to herself. \"A good diet of vitamins, minerals, and proteins would be a great option of promoting height growth, of which the Food Court would be able to fulfill these qualities, and the other option...\" She trailed off, glancing at the map of Junes that directed shoppers to different floors for their various needs; in particular, Naoto was staring at the label that read \"HEALTH &amp; BEAUTY\". Naoto made a slight frown, continuing her monologue, \"While I've put my gender issues behind me, I still don't feel that showing myself in the Beauty Products department would be a smart idea. While a number of compounds there would help promote human growth, if Rise-san ever found out I was spotted in an aisle where women look to bring out the best in themselves, I'd never hear the end of it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto was conflicted in her decision, both options were on two opposite sides of one another; dieting was a slow, long-term process, but seemed normal enough not to cause a ruckus amongst Inaba's gossip-seeking population, while health and beauty products could have overnight results at best, though, knowing her friends Rise Kujikawa and Teddie, a hit-idol in Japan and a would-be Casanova, both known for their gossip-spreading nature, it'd be almost impossible to salvage the reputation of a strong, serious detective she'd been building up through most of her life. Then, it hit her, perhaps the answer wasn't one that normal reality would be able to fulfill. Naoto glanced at the large flat-screen TV her friends used to enter the Midnight Channel in the past; the realm was full of crazy happenings and items that are impossible to explain and dubious in effect, the Midnight Channel in particular unlocked Naoto's Persona, Sukuna Hikona, which carried a long, sci-fi-esque beam sword and shot pure beams of light and darkness from its body, two things that would not be considered in the realms of normality. If she was able to acquire a being that was able to eradicate demonic Shadows with a single thought, then perhaps the world of the Midnight Channel would be able to provide Naoto with an option to grow taller without the negatives her two realistic options each carried.</span></div></div>",

Talks of the Midnight Channel have ceased at Yasogami High since last year, after all.\" Naoto beamed with confidence at this reasoning and made her way to the elevator to proceed a floor, however, her hands shook as she tried to press the button for the department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the elevator stopped and opened, Naoto tugged her hat down to cover her face and quickly entered the aisles, hiding behind a group of women gossiping about Taro Namatame's run for public office. She perused the shelves looking for a compound that would solve her personal problem, finding nothing worth noting as she scanned up and down the aisles. \"<i>Conditioners...Moisturizers...Foundations...</i>\" She almost gave up her search before reaching the end of the aisle, her eyes coming upon a package full of glass vials, each containing a transparent, dark blue liquid. \"What is this?\" Naoto asked, leaning down to read the label. \"Ishtar Tea: For the Future Goddess. Official Beauty Enhancer of Kanami Mashita. Contains 12 vials, promotes smooth skin, hair health, height growth...\" Naoto trailed off as she read the last part of the label, she found exactly what she was looking for. She grabbed the package of vials and hurried to the register, paying for the compound and hurrying out of the store, hoping for dear life none of her friends were at Junes that day, mainly Rise or Teddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got home, Naoto went to her bathroom and filled her sink cabinet with the vials, all save one, which she proceeded to read the instructions on. \"Drink one vial daily. Effects will start 3 hours after consumption. For continued effects, drink one daily for the desired number of days after consumption. If more than one vial is swallowed, contact the Poison Control Hotline. Being very careful about following instructions, especially when they pertain to safety, Naoto decided against drinking more than one vial. \"Here goes nothing...\" Naoto said as she uncorked the vial and put it to her lips. In one fell swoop, she drank the entire vial, not a drop of the liquid was left, though Naoto noted the taste was awful, and she begun to feel nauseous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving a hand to her head, Naoto began towards her bed. \"Perhaps I should take a nap...\" She noted, slowly trudging to her bedroom as the world began to feel dizzy. She laid down in her bed, setting the alarm on her clock three hours ahead in order to awake and note the effects. Naoto imagined thoughts of herself as tall as her friends, enjoying activities with them on a similar scale, one thought even snuck in of her being Kanji's height. \"This may help me with my detective work as well, if I had to subdue a criminal...\" Naoto thought in particular the serial murder case from last year, the thought of her friends almost dying in the TV World raced through her head, the biggest thought being of Nanako Dojima's rescue, of Souji's face in emotional distress as they fought their way through hordes of Shadows to rescue her from her kidnapper; the thought disgusted Naoto, she'd never want her friends to ever suffer that again. Putting her thoughts to rest, Naoto drifted off to dreamland, ready to awake 3 hours later.</span></div></div>",

She moved over to the doorway of her bedroom which was covered in marker dashes to record height; Naoto thought it might have seemed childish if anyone else were to see it, but she lived alone in a rental home, paid for by a sum of money each month from her grandfather, so she felt she could keep her measurement ritual a secret from others. Naoto moved her head to the wooden frame and grabbed a yellow-colored marker, dashing just above her head as usual, and turned around to view her results. Her heart sank when she saw that the yellow mark was at 5'0'', overlapping the green tick, as well as the pink, and the blue, and the purple, blending to create a rainbow of disappointment of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should've known,\" she thought, \"Errouneous claims backed by a celebrity name, textbook advertising at it's finest.\" Naoto felt silly, a detective like her fallen prey to a beauty product without any research before hand, it was not one of her proudest moments. She looked at her clock on her desk, it read 9:00 PM, the sky outside her window was a mix of black and dark blue to confirm this. \"Junes must be closed by now, I can probably return these vials tomorrow, provided they accept with one missing vial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a devious thought came to her; <i>\"You have nothing to lose Naoto, drink one or two more.\"</i> Naoto froze, what would posses her to think of something like that? She tried to think rational thoughts, almost as if to argue with the imaginary devil upon her shoulder. <i>\"The label mentioned overdosage may lead to poisoning, I can't just drink more after one dose!\"</i> <i>\"But Naoto,\"</i> retorted the tempting thoughts, <i>\"Didn't your grandfather give you small doses of various poisons and medicines at a young age to build immunity? Didn't he want you not to end up a casualty of a criminal out for vengance?\"</i> The voice was correct, her grandfather and her practiced mithridatism as a method of self-protection, surely one small dosage of the formula could not be lethal with the proper care taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Drink it.\"</i> That was all the voice said before disappearing back into the recesses of Naoto's mind. She stared at her bathroom cabinet for a good while before making her decision.</span></div></div>",

She opened the cabinet and grabbed another vial of liquid, ready to take a small dose. <i>\"One drop won't hurt, I can live.\"</i> She took one little sip of the vial before preparing to set it down, before something funny happened. Almost like ecstasy, Naoto began to feel an overwhelming high come over her, followed by a sense of euphoria; whatever was in the vial felt good to her, and she wanted more of it. Naoto moved the vial back to her lips and swigged it down, finally moving the vial back to the sink counter, only to move her hand back to the cabinet for another vial. She drank a third, then a fourth, then a fifth, she chugged away like a marathon runner with water after a series of sprints. Finally, in her euphoric frenzy, she consumed the last vial of the liquid, slumping to the floor with it as her high wore off. \"That was...unexpected...\" Naoto never expected such a rush from the mixture, likewise, she didn't feel any pain from her throat or body, usually common of overdoses. \"What was in that mixture anyways?\" Naoto moved the vial closer to the face to read the ingredients, one small batch of letters stuck out to her; \"Contains small, watered-down trace of lysergic acid diethylamide. This product is approved by the PMDA.\" Naoto was puzzled, <i>\"Well that would explain the high, but how did they get away with putting LSD in the mix?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a chest pain overcame Naoto, a tight feeling in her chest was digging into her, making her wince in pain. \"A heart attack?!\" She quickly undid the buttons of her shirt to allow blood flow, enough to possibly get to the emergency phone in the bathroom and dial 119; as the last button was undone, she looked down and her expression of pain turned to shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Wha?!\" She saw the bindings upon her chest begin to shift and tear, almost as if something was trying to get out of what was essentially her bra. She moved her hands to her chest and felt two rapidly-expanding globes trying to burst from their prison, she immediately recognized that her breasts were growing. \"This can't be real!\" thought Naoto, \"Enlargement like this can't be so sudden, I must be hallucinating from the vials!\" Suddenly, a sharp pain in her legs caught her attention, she felt pain in her feet as her socks constricted around her, her legs began to sprout from her pantlegs, and she felt the tight grip of her underwear around her pelvis; this was followed by a pain in her shoulders as she looked and saw her arms bursting from her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm growing! I'm really growing!\" Naoto felt a sense of joy in her mind knowing that she finally obtained the height increase she wanted, but this was soon replaced by worry once she realized her body wasn't stopping, even as her growth reached a 6'0'' mark. Panicked, she tried to command her body to stop, hoping her words would cause a response; \"Stop! Stop growing! I'm getting too big!\" As Naoto tried to stand up, her toes burst through her socks, her pants began to split, her shirt split down the middle and fell from her body, and she crashed her head into the ceiling. \"Ouch!\" she cried as she moved her hand to her head. The impact sent Naoto back to her sitting position, the sudden change in position finally destroying her pants, leaving her in an almost-Amazonian attire of her bindings, her panties, and her torn socks, with her toes and heels bursting through each sock. Naoto estimated the impact must've put her at 9'0'' at least, meaning that any more time spent in the house will certainly cause compression and injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get out of here!\" Naoto cried, as she leaped from her position forward into the living room, the speed burst tearing her bindings a little more and destroying her socks. She tried to exit from her front door, but her hand was too big for the knob. <i>\"Damn!\"</i> she thought, <i>\"I have to bust it down!\"</i> Naoto banged her arm against the door a couple times, breaking it off its hinges on the 7th hit and sending it into the front yard. Her success didn't get her far however, as she tried to squeeze through the doorway and found her shoulders too broad to squeeze through, only managing to get her head out the door. She turned around and felt her bindings break and panties tear away, finally exposing her gargantuan breasts and leaving her fully nude inside her own home; Naoto felt a flush of red over her face, suddenly regretting breaking the door down and hoping the noise didn't wake the neighbors or alert any passerbys. Naoto decided to make one last mad dash for the sliding doors in the back, hoping that she was small enough to squeeze through and run away, unfortunately, as she broke the glass with her fist, she found that she had grown too large that her body would just end up stuck in the frame. \"This can't be happening! I'm going to end up crushed!\" Naoto got herself in a fetal position so that she faced the ceiling and squeezed her eyes real tight, all she could think of is how her bones would break inside of her own home and how investigators would find a the Detective Prince as naked giant, dead inside of her own home, the story would certainly shake up Inaba as much as the murders did. Naoto felt her head and legs press against the ceiling and waited for death to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Naoto felt a breeze run across her body, and she opened her eyes. She couldn't believe it, her house was destroyed by her own body instead, the beauty mixture must've strengthened her body as well, her skin must've been as thick as an elephant and her bones as strong as steel beams. Naoto looked around at the neighborhood and thought, <i>\"Judging by the size of the houses, I must be 50 feet tall right now. I feel no pain, no shifting under my feet, so I must've stopped growing, but was that my final growth spurt?\"</i> One thought raced through Naoto's mind: <i>\"My feet...My feet...\"</i> She felt a gust of wind across her body again and immediately picked up on it: she was still fully nude. Naoto let out a small yelp and moved her hands to cover her privates, her face completely red with embarrassment. <i>\"I-In any case, I need some clothes! S-Some sort of cover!\"</i> Naoto looked around frantically, it wasn't easy finding clothes to wear at her normal size, especially since she preferred men's clothing, but as a giant, it would be borderline impossible to find something to wear. Her eyes happened upon large stockpiles of tarp in a neighbors lawn, used to conceal wood, the color a dark blue similar to Naoto's hair. <i>\"It'll have to do!\"</i> She swiftly grabbed the tarp, hoping to have made as little noise as possible, stood up, and started wrapping it around her figure. By the time she was done tying small ribbon-knots tight with the tarp, she looked like she was wearing a giant bikini, her cleavage being completely visible, a sharp contrast to the bindings she used to conceal her breasts with. <i>\"I need to find some help, one of my friends should be able to help me.\"</i> Two thoughts raced through her mind, she could go find her senpai, Yosuke, and see if he could get in contact with the company and find a cure, Naoto also hoping the product be removed from shelves, or Rise and Kanji, her friends of the same class who were within walking distance of each other, surely Kanji could sew something more...decent than Naoto's current attire. Naoto shuddered at the thought of Yosuke seeing her, knowing how perverted he can be, and shuddered even more at the thought of Rise, who'd probably take too much pleasure and excitement from Naoto's gargantuan figure, though she felt Kanji was a very dependable and easygoing friend, though he may be easily overwhelmed by her current stature. Quickly weighing the scenarios, Naoto quickly walked as quietly as she could to the home of...</span></div></div>",

Ever since he crashed his yacht on the Island of Hot Amazon Babes, his life\u2019s been absolutely great, the amazons have never seen a male human before and quickly fell in love with his cute size and adorable face, and before he knew it, he was king of the amazons!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore grapes, Yosuke-sama?\u201d The amazon kneeled before her leader and extended a plate of fruits, she wore a leopard-skin bra and loincloth combo and had a slender, sexy body; even as she kneeled before her leader, she still trumped him in height by a good foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy thank you Sachiko, you always know where the best fruits are!\u201d Sachiko let out a squeal and fell over into the arms of her amazon sisters, her face was beet-red and covered in a large ear-to-ear smile. <i>\u201cThis is great! No Teddie, no rules, no customers, no Teddie, this is the life!\u201d</i>  Suddenly, an echo began to ring in his ears, quietly, but it began to get louder, louder, louder, it rang out: tap, tap, Tap, TAP\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke awoke in bed absolutely annoyed at his dream world being crushed, his focus coming to an obnoxious rapping on his window, quieter than usually banging on glass, but annoying nonetheless. \u201cOh for the love of\u2026\u201d Yosuke walked over to his window and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, he opened it and looked around as he slowly came back to reality. \u201cThis better be good, I was having the most amazing dreaaaAAAAA HOLY CRAP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke was greeted by Naoto\u2019s embarrassed face, about as large as Yosuke\u2019s body and covered in a bright pink blush that seemed to illuminate the night. \u201cN-Naoto-kun, is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes, g-good morning, Yosuke-senpai\u2026\u201d Despite her size, Naoto seemed almost like a mouse, squeaking the words out, a clear sign of how embarrassed she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, uh, I- uh, some overnight growth spurt, huh?\u201d Yosuke was definitely more awake and noticed more about his giant friend, more specifically, the fact she was clad in a tarp-bikini. Naoto noticed this and moved her arms to cover as much skin as she possibly could, her blush lit up and her eyes darted to her right, breaking eye contact with Yosuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, actually, it has a lot to do with Junes, so I find it\u2019d be better to speak with you\u2026\u201d Naoto moved her eyes back and saw Yosuke practically leaning out the window, mesmerized by her cleavage. She moved her arms to cover her cleavage and spoke again, \u201cUm, p-please stop staring\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke jerked his head back and banged it against the windowsill, a clear sign he wasn\u2019t dreaming if there was no indication before. \u201cWhoops! Sorry! It\u2019s just this dream I had\u2026\u201d It wasn\u2019t every day you got to see your friend the size of a kaiju straight out of a movie. Yosuke took some time to compose himself and breathe before he continued, \u201cBut Naoto-kun, how did you get so big in the first place? And why did you come here wearing that? You know how You-Know-Who gets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto let out a high-pitched yelp, not unlike a Chihuahua, she forgot about Teddie! Who knows what he\u2019d say or do while she\u2019s this big and wearing almost nothing? \u201cHe\u2019s not here, is he?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax,\u201d replied Yosuke, \u201cHe\u2019s spending the night at Junes, Employee of the Month is coming up and he really wants that lapel pin. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s ever worked before\u2026\u201d Naoto breathed a sigh of relief and composed herself, she looked around from side to side to make sure nobody awoke and saw her and began to talk to Yosuke about her growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s some story!\u201d Yosuke was in awe at how unreal it sounded, and his face grew a little hot at the mental image of a giant nude Naoto. \u201cStill, how did we manage to get <i>that</i> at the store? We\u2019re going to have to get those bottles off the shelves immediately before we end up liable for something.\u201d Yosuke tried not to show it, but he continued his train of dirty thoughts regarding Naoto\u2019s story. <i>\u201cNote to me: Save some of those bottles for Chie-chan, Yukiko-san, and Rise-chan.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto\u2019s face finally returned to its natural color as she grew more comfortable with her outfit and predicament. \u201cYes, naturally we\u2019ll have to remove the concoction before we find an influx of giant women in Inaba. I was hoping that we could go to Junes together and deal with this matter, and possibly find a warehouse I could hide in until we find a cure for this. Unfortunately, with Teddie on the premises, our task has become harder to manage.\u201d Teddie was a wild card, everyone knew it, if he knew Naoto was a giant, he\u2019d probably expose her to the world, and if he were to figure out the serum\u2019s effects, he\u2019d probably do everything in his power to get a giantess harem; Naoto feared this outcome and Yosuke, while enjoying the thought of real-life amazons, didn\u2019t enjoy the thought of being sued and crushed by a group of angry giant women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I understand. Just let me get dressed and then we can go, try to squeeze into the alley until I\u2019m ready.\u201d Naoto gave a nod and crawled to the alley next to Yosuke\u2019s house, she squeezed back in carefully, as to make sure she didn\u2019t destroy anything, curled up, and waited for Yosuke. Yosuke took a quick shower and put on his summer clothes, school was out for the summer so they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the Detective Prince missing from school for a while. He took the keys for the store and left the house quietly to avoid waking his parents and met Naoto outside, the difference in stature now being more apparent. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go. You don\u2019t mind carrying me, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Naoto replied, \u201cIs my shoulder okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Yosuke retorted, \u201cNot to sound picky, but your shoulder is pretty high up, I don\u2019t want to slip and fall off, last thing I need is some broken bones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, what do you suggest?\u201d Naoto was almost afraid to ask, she almost knew what Yosuke was going to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Yosuke stammered, \u201cThe best place I could ride on without falling would be your, uh\u2026cleavage\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, absolutely not!\u201d Naoto\u2019s face became bright red again, she never did like to let others see her breasts, or let Rise tell everyone how big they were, but to let Yosuke use them like cushions just sent her face into an embarrassed flare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh! Not so loud!\u201d Yosuke knew Naoto would act like that, and the last thing he wanted was for his friend to blow her cover. \u201cI know you don\u2019t like it, but it\u2019s the safest option, can\u2019t you just throw me a bone here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto pondered Yosuke\u2019s comments for a moment and decided:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201c\u2026Okay, but this is only for safety.\u201d Naoto gave in, she scooped up Yosuke and nestled him in between her breasts, her face a bright tint of red, as was Yosuke\u2019s at the whole situation. Naoto slowly got up and checked for any onlookers, after confirming nobody was watching, she quietly began walking towards Junes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the Hanamura family managed the Inaba branch of Junes and even moved to Inaba because of this, the Hanamura household was actually a little far from Junes, even for Naoto\u2019s size, the pitch-black night didn\u2019t help either. While traveling together, the two spoke more in detail about what had happened to Naoto, more specifically, why she drank the serum in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, so you wanted to be taller and you thought beauty products would help?\u201d Yosuke giggled a little at Naoto\u2019s reasoning and she huffed a little in retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Is that not a good reason? 4\u201910\u201d is not a respectable height for my line of work.\u201d This of course was a lie, Naoto wanted to be taller out of a pure selfish desire to be up to size with her friends, and Yosuke seemed to buy the fib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I get that, but why beauty products?\u201d Yosuke replied, \u201cEveryone knows all those \u201cmiracle\u201d products are a bunch of crap, there isn\u2019t actually a beauty products that can make you taller.\u201d Yosuke looked up and locked eyes with Naoto\u2019s pale blue eyes looking down at him. \u201cWell, at least there wasn\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a desperate venture I suppose,\u201d Naoto pondered out loud, \u201cRise-san had always mentioned her constant use of skin conditioners and shampoos during her career, so I figured the best option was to replicate her routine, hoping I could at least catch up to 5\u20191\u201d.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke pondered that for a moment before coming to a realization: \u201cHey wait, \u2018catch up\u2019? You just wanted to get taller because you were so short compared to us!\u201d\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-What?!\u201d Naoto was caught in her lie, all she could do was deny it, but her face didn\u2019t help her case. \u201cThat\u2019s preposterous! A detective should maintain proper physical condition, I was simply trying to keep to a standard!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah right!\u201d Yosuke giggled and gave Naoto a smug smile, \u201cI can see your blush, I bet you didn\u2019t want to be dwarfed by Kanji anymore! I guess you don\u2019t need to worry about that now though!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto stopped and looked down at Yosuke like a child who just lost an argument. \u201cHow dare you! I wasn\u2019t asking to be this big!\u201d She puffed her cheeks out a little and folded her arms beneath her breasts, causing them to shake a little, and Yosuke, who wasn\u2019t totally snug, shook and tumbled in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey! Watch it! There\u2019s no seatbelts here!\u201d Yosuke tumbled backwards towards Naoto\u2019s sternum and further up her cleavage, and unfortunately for him, towards a gap in her cleavage where her breasts weren\u2019t pressed together. \u201cAh! Shit!\u201d Yosuke tried to grasp onto Naoto\u2019s breasts, but her skin was smooth, and he slid between Naoto\u2019s breasts and fell down from her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto her makeshift bikini bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto\u2019s face was overcome with a hot flush as she felt Yosuke trying to move around and resituate himself. \u201cKYAA! Y-Yosuke-senpai! S-Stop squirming!\u201d She moved her hands to her crotch to try and remove him from her bottoms, her own body squirming the more Yosuke moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m trying here! Gah! Stop moving around, I keep getting tossed around!\u201d Naoto tried to heed his advice, but she kept yelping and squirming the more she felt the sensation of Yosuke so close to her sensitive areas. After a minute or two of this embarrassing moment, Naoto finally managed to dislodge Yosuke from her makeshift bikini bottom, she held him close to her face and gave him an angry glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever. Speak of this. To anyone.\u201d Yosuke was covered in sweat and hanging from Naoto\u2019s fingertips, he was in no position to talk back, so he just nodded with a defeated expression. \u201cShoulder. Now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am\u2026\u201d was all Yosuke could muster to say. Naoto moved him to her clavicle and he laid down, trying to get comfy and prevent falling. <i>\u201cYou were the one who made me slip\u2026\u201d</i> was all he could think of as he tried to make the best of his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Naoto saw a light to her side, someone had awoken from her outburst! <i>\u201cOh no! Someone will spot me!\u201d</i> In the movies, the citizens who always saw the giant monster called in the military, who quickly captured the monster and begun to run tests on it; Naoto always found those movies to be unrealistic, but she wasn\u2019t ready to test her theories, especially since her definition of \u201cunreal\u201d changed ever since entering the TV World and becoming a giantess. \u201cYosuke-senpai, we have to go! Which direction is Junes?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke noticed the light and felt the same sense of panic as Naoto did. \u201cOh crap! Keep going straight past the river and make a right at the station!\u201d Yosuke hung on tight as Naoto quickly moved, still careful as not to crush anything in the street or make any unnecessary footprints in the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid they run into any trouble on the trip?</span></div></div>",

The two were chatting up one of their usual conversations when suddenly Chie was a bit taken back as she heard Naoto Shirogane call out to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls paused an waited for the younger detective girl to reach their location. Naoto thanked them for waiting and surprisingly asked if she could speak with Chie alone. While Chie was a bit confused Yukiko caught on by Naoto's posture and vocal tone that it was perhaps something personal so she excused herself adding in that she would give Chie a call later once things at the inn cooled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie understood and nodded before turning her attention over to Naoto. The blonde tomboy couldn't help but wonder what was on the blue-haired girl's mind. Usually Naoto went to Souji when she needed to talk in private about something. Chie was sure there was nothing going on between the two and perhaps Naoto found he was the easiest to talk to, after all she herself had done the same many times in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this time Seta had already left with Yosuke, apparently Hanamura had talked Nanako's \"Big Bro\" into helping out at Junes the night before...yet again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell regardless she would at least hear out Naoto though Chie wasn't sure how much help she'd actually be to whatever may be on Naoto's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's up, Naoto-kun?\" she asked casually, best to start on the right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto responded by asking if Chie could take a brief walk with her down toward the park area of Inaba. Shrugging with a bit of smile on her lips Chie agreed and the two were off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater now resting on a park bench Chie repeated her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh Naoto removed her cap for a moment before running a hand through her locks of hair. A moment later the cap was back on and when the younger girl turned her vision over to Chie the blonde was a bit startled when she noticed a bit of a blush creeping on Naoto's cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie's mind nearly when into panic mode right then and there. She had heard the rumors some students loved telling about her and Yukiko's relationship...but those were completely false at least on her end anyway. Now she found herself sitting next to another girl, on a park bench away from anyone's eyes, who had sighed just before showcasing a bit of blush directed straight at her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Naoto really? Maybe that's why her relationship with Souji had stayed on friendly terms, was she instead interested in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was on the verge of collapsing from mental fatigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you train me, Chie-Senpei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's words came to her so suddenly Chie actually found her brain having to take a moment to reboot. Said moment later Chie wiped the sudden cold sweat from her brow before blinking a bit at Naoto. Had she just her heard right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto herself was a tad confused why Chie looked as if she had just recovered from a panic attack, she was the one that was embarrassed so why was her senpei looking so exhausted?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie-senpei, are you alright?\" Naoto asked softly, her blush now gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie nodded and explained that she was totally fine but in returned asked Naoto to repeat her previous question, anything to put this very awkward moment behind them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I wish to ask...if you will train me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Train?\" Naoto nodded, why was this such a secret request wondered Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see while my Persona has great magical potential, the same can not be said for it's offensive and defensive properties. Yes it is strong but it is certainly lacking when compared to yours, Kanji's, or some of Senpei's numerous Personas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true what Naoto had said that much Chie agreed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to ask if you could perhaps train me for a certain amount of time. My assumption is that if my own physical strength increases so will that of my Persona.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Naoto brought up an interesting if not very true point. Her and Kanji's Personas were incredibly strong and that had to be because of their own personal strength, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um sure I guess I can help you out, Naoto-kun.\" Chie stated with a goofy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah thank you. I did not wish to ask you this in front of the others for fear of what they may think of me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto turned away until she felt Chie's hand press on her jacket shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way we wouldn't have teased you, I personally would have kicked anyone who did.\" Chie smiled proudly while Naoto merely chuckled briefly and rather softly. It did seem like something Chie would do and Naoto was glad the older girl was very understanding of her situation.</span></div></div>",

Worse came to worse she'd head to Junes and buy something simple but still to her tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll meet at One or is Noon fine with you, Naoto-kun?\" asked Chie trying to lock down a doable time for the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noon is fine.\" stated Naoto, best to start right away were her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, not sure how well of a Sensei I'll be but I'll give it my best! I'll see you tomorrow then, Naoto-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two exchanged a friendly goodbye before Chie was off most likely either heading home or toward Yukiko's place. Naoto however headed straight home, figuring she should get enough rest for tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome nightfall Naoto was pleased to have found attire appropriate for the training sessions tomorrow. As her head found the soft pillow below Naoto was pleased as well with Chie agreeing to train the young detective.

That she must have hit a late growth spurt, looked more fitting for a high school student now, even hearing the phrase \"Naoto-kun now has the body to go with the brains\". That last part made her blush awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto wasn't doing this to better curve her body, she knew better then anyone she already had a curvy form...it was just always concealed, rather she was doing this so the young detective wouldn't be a liability to any one of her friends/teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater during the day she took a restroom break to catch a better look at herself in the mirror. When she did so Naoto was pleased with the apparent results of her training with Chie. She wasn't overly muscular by any definition but definitely more lean and cut. Her pants were a bit tighter then usual but nothing too serious instead they served as means to show off her now rather athletic looking pair of legs. Her hips and thighs were a tad larger but it wasn't fatty tissue instead they were firm and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTopside her dark jacket was slightly less loose around her upper body then it had been before same for the usual shirt she always wore underneath it.

Gasping Naoto instinctively clutched her chest having felt as if the burning sensation had originated from her upper body. Still stunned the young detective wondered what had caused her to nearly keel over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the same unpleasant feeling returned this time with even more vigor. Standing somehow Naoto wrapped both of her arms around her mid-section gasping and grunting as she tumbled around the open area between the sinks and toilet stalls. The pain was still very much intense and it felt as if her body seemingly wanted to tear itself in two!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stumbled about Naoto could barely find her voice to get any coherent words out but when she did she called out for help from anyone that may be within hearing distance. Unfortunately no one came and the inner torture continued with it also came a new change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto began to panic and yell in a mixture of horror and agony as she watched and felt her body expand slowly with a somewhat sickening popping sound.

She groaned as her body continued in it's growth pushing out further and further. She caught sight of herself in the mirror of the bathroom and was extremely shocked by her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't gained any height butt she had put on at least a ton of muscle! She gasped as she looked at herself her muscles were all extremely striated and she had veins, some at least an inch high, pulsing on her body. Despite her muscle growing her breasts hadn't changed in fact they had gotten even larger! Naoto couldn't believe it was still herself as she stared at herself in the mirror as she continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's biceps bulged and flexed pushing themselves outwards from her body almost five feet around. Her lats had pushed up over a foot above her head making almost a hood over her cute face. Her pecs jutted out from her body rippling like almost a shelf of muscle with her insanely huge breasts on top, each one perfectly round and twice the size of a volley ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer waist was extremely thin but it flared upwards with lats coming out the sides like wings. Her abs were ripped much beyond a common six pack it looked more like a 36 pack or more! Her obliques on each side were almost impossible to count with more than a hundred on each side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt that was small and cute had bulged out like twin cannonballs making a thong out of her panties. Her thighs were insane across almost 5 feet wide each muscle was completely separate and tensed as she walked. Finally her calves were like two giant hearts sticking off the back of her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto continued to gasp in pain as her body continued to grow.

For as long as she could recall Naoto was always the short one, the one everyone had to look down upon which ironically made her look down upon herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust once she wanted to see what it was like to be the biggest in the room and not the pipsqueak detective. In her dream while it was painful to her dream-self she was living out that inner hidden fantasy. As she did so her body continued to flare out in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smashed a cannonball-sized hand accidentally through a stall as her eight-foot biceps surged outward. Lats now having extended two maybe three feet above and around her head, her pecs pushing forward breasts not to be outdone also bloating higher in size now resembling a size closer to over inflated beachballs yet still firm wide and ever round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grunt left her lips as the chest binds across her chest at last gave up the fight tearing into pieces, a few strains here and there lucky enough to cover her more sensitive portions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she were so occupied with her chest she would have noticed or at least tried to considering her cute face was slowly being lost in a valley of bloating muscle that her thighs had matched her arms in length continuously growing alongside them as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuge massive pillars made up her previously soft legs with each step even if it were but a small one she left a crater in the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her body continued to stretch outward with muscle mass she did come to notice that while it was much harder to make out there was no reflection of her face on the mirror in front of her. Of course one to would think that her head had just become too tiny to spot admass the flood of muscle but no there was another reason she was also gaining small doses of height along with strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to assume she was now around 6\u201d something, at the very least it meant her body could stretch out and not leave her in the shape of a \u201cball\u201d made from pure inhuman muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seem as time passed the pain was at last beginning to subside yet the growing continued, mostly likely her subconscious was refusing to put an end to it. Now closer to 7\u201d and of course in turn much wider then before a portion of Naoto with the pain now fading simply wanted to see how far her growth would take her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould she actually grow so absurdly massive that the restroom space would no longer be able to contain her immense portions, or would the growth end before it came to that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again\u2026what if it didn\u2019t end there?

Her legs as well adding inches to her heights as they extended upward and outward. Naoto couldn't help but moan in a near angelic tone as she grew larger and ever powerful. It seemed with each new breath her body expanded further into unimaginable levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...impossible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe muttered just before her head surprisingly made contact with the ceiling that used to be so high above. Startled she did her best in shifting into a sitting position, in doing so she took a moment to spot that her muscles were immense! A singular arm for example now wider larger then an average-sized person!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer focus was interrupted however when the tip of her head made contact with the ceiling once again forcing the over-muscled girl to shift herself onto her back. She didn't know how big was going to end up but it was obvious to her soon enough there was going to be more Naoto then there was room...and strangely a part of her was okay with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected she soon enough crashed through the ceiling, the weaken material no longer able to contain her growing form in a singular school floor. Adding to that she was now quickly outgrowing the next one as her body seemingly showed no signs of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can this be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered but no real answer came to her instead only the sound of her body stretching and growing stronger by the second. A full ten minutes was all the multistory school took take before collapsing into broken pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment it appeared as if Naoto had been buried beneath the shattered remains of the school but that couldn't be further from the truth as she as stood up in all her empowered glory brushing the scattered portions of rubble off her enormous size. This was in fact true Naoto had grown into a literal behemoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood twice as tall as Yasogami and amazingly even wider then she was tall, it almost seem as if she could fit an entire neighborhood onto her runway of a back. While down below each of her legs twice as thick as a full-grown redwood. Just above each ab practically the size of a small car. Her gigantic butt resembling two flesh-colored hot air balloons large enough to smash a portion of the school if she hadn't already done so completely. On the opposite end her still perfectly shaped breasts were each the size of an average home. Her inhuman arms individually as large as small buildings. Lastly her now much more muscular neck could barely been seen by her immense pecs and traps, essentially burying her still cute face in a field of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did her best to look around but she was quickly to notice that all she could see was simply much more of herself then she thought possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I have reached such a size.

No matter which direction she stared at there was simply so much of her new muscle mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer traps now reaching far above her head like a mountain range made for her to rest her miniature-appearing face which is exactly what she did for a moment so she could gather her thoughts. Her bulging pecs adorn with huge yet still surprisingly soft breasts heaving up and down at a slight rhythm with each of her breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly afterwards the gigantic detective took a few simple steps forward each of her footfalls causing a strong quaking tremor the ground cracking and breaking under her new multi-ton muscled weight. She paused however when she felt her overly-muscled thighs momentarily rub together, again it served in reminding her how massive she was and how enormously powerful her legs alone had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring down as best she could, a rather difficult task due to her view being obscured by her pecs, breasts, and shoulders, Naoto simply took in the sight of the devastation her new size had caused. A good part of her concerned for her fellow student body after all she had seemingly grown out of nowhere destroying Yasogami in the process. Yet another part of her felt as if this new body of hers was so good, so right, and so unbelievably strong. It was as if this portion of her was telling her that this is who she should be what she needed to be, not a miniature detective but a towering goddess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto for a moment gave in and let out another angelic moan as she instinctively flexed every portion of her incredible body, every part of her practically doubling in size causing her adorable face to be buried further into the field of muscle that was her upper body alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused however once perhaps the logical part of her mind reminded her that the fate of her dear friends was still uncertain. She couldn't allow herself to be caught up any other thoughts except finding possibly saving the others from the destruction she herself had caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tough due to her inhuman size to get a good decent look at the ground below, each of her footsteps leaving immense craters in the shattered pavement, as she searched, at times blindly, for any sight of survivors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did in fact puzzle her how there didn't seem to be anyone around all of a sudden, completely unaware she was still very much in her own dreamworld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a detective she wasn't about to give in to failure she had to find them, she just had to!</span></div></div>",

Not to the same rapid degree as before thus making it easier for the blue-haired giantess to not take notice of the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarger and larger her body grew as her muscles expanded and multiplied by the passing seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto still found it so strange that she couldn't come across anyone she knew or anyone in general. Where had the entire student body gone to and how had anyone kept from noticing the mammoth blue-haired girl searching the area of where Yasogami used to stand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were questions she had no answers to and all the while her body continued growing taller and wider the detective still so focused on finding her friends she hadn't noticed any sort of change that is until she at last felt something make contact with her titanic legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment the girl believed that in a twist of irony her friends had actually found her...how on earth was she going to explain the change to them?! Well no matter what was important was that the group of friends was reunited...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Naoto was in for a rather stunning surprise after adjusting her vision as best she could, again a simple feat that was difficult to accomplish due to her massive size, and she came to notice it wasn't her friends she felt at her feet but in reality were sets of neighboring trees forcefully knocked down and aside by her bulging calves, each so immense they threaten to engulf her feet. The ground cratering further as her tremendous thighs swell in an attempt to catch up and surpass her growing calves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...not again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe muttered her body however much to her dismay seem to take this in as a trigger of sorts and the young detective could only watch in silent astonishment as she nearly exploded in size and girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbs now rivaling the size of her former original self as she continued to inflate with power each hard yet firm to touch as she did so with her formerly huge now gargantuan arms. Arms that her now nearing the size of multistory buildings, hell it was quite possible that each one was close to the total size of the Junes mega store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy comparison her back had been busy expanding to the size of several city blocks, her breasts inflated to roughly half that degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile buried deep in the cavern made up from her pecs and traps her still tiny and cute as ever face flushed in pain as her growth continued onward. Naoto wishing for nothing more then for this madness to end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive painstakingly-filled minutes later the detective behemoth got her wish and behemoth may be too small a size to describe her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though their size was \"tiny\" compared to the rest of her Naoto's feet alone were now far too large and wide for the poor streets of Inaba with even the tiniest of her toes several sizes larger then your average individual. Just above her calves were now wider then two Yasogami Highs combined, while her tremendous thighs had surpassed the length of four city blocks leading to a pleasantly plumped backside that could without question bury a quarter of the town or possibly more if she wasn't careful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer upper body not to be outdone was just as equally monstrous if not more so. Naoto's set of abdominals were now closer to a set of thick cut armor then flesh, each so powerful not even she knew what could possibly pierce through. Her pectorals amazingly budging out proportionally yet her breasts had once more taken a stellar hit, each rivaling Junes in size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her sides each arm rippled with power, even without so much as a flex each rose high into the clear sky far above her head, while her gigantic back had only grown further in size it wasn't a stretch to say it was practically a mountain of muscle, a part of her almost wondering if she could carry the entire town and still have room to spare, she was that ridiculous in girth. Of course her height was nothing to ignore either, at her full size the detective stood roughly a mile and nearly a quarter tall, easily putting her as the biggest strongest and most powerful being on the face of the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was understandably stunned and greatly confused, her still adorable face buried in a literal field of muscle, Naoto took a moment to flex her arms the biceps shooting so high into the air she feared the twin peaks would break straight through the atmosphere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe truly didn't know what to make of all this, a part of her so confused by it all and yet another small part enjoying that she was so big so powerful. She deserved this didn't she...no she shook away the thought still so unsure what to think, none of this was making any sense and her new size was just...just not possible by any stretch of reality...and as if to answer her lingering questions...</span></div></div>",

Something, whatever it was, was bothering the young detective and she was determined to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Rise hadn't mentioned any of this to the other girls who stated that they were on their way as well instead she wanted to get there first to see in private what was troubling Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way inside Rise called out the blue-haired girl at first not getting a response thankfully after a second attempt the detective stated that she was in the living room. It wasn't too far away from her so Rise wondered why Naoto had hesitated to answer, when she walked on over she got her answer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the detective standing shyly at the opposite end cloaked in an grand-sized coat, her massive bust pressing against the fabric, and her usual hat resting softly at top of her head.

Her biceps ripping and tearing through the coat in an effortless fashion as they pushed outward.

Breasts and butt resting like shelves of steel yet round as any ball Rise had seen, not to mention those armor-like set of abs that also took her breath away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile high above sat the detective still untouched adorable face hat still on her head and even with the height difference between them Rise could still make out that the normally serious girl was extremely embarrassed with what had just occurred to her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Difficult as it was the over sized detective continued her restless search attempting to find any sort of clue that may give her a heads up of the whereabouts of her missing circle of friends. Again so focused was the blue-haired titan on locating the others that it still had yet to occur to her that no one else seem to be around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn inhumanly sized muscle girl appearing seemingly out of nowhere and not a single soul is curious? It just didn't add up. That said the detective would at last get her much wanted sign of assistance...but not in the way she could have possibly expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found it odd that the temperature of the area around her had suddenly decreased a slight notch or two as if she were being shadowed by something but that was crazy she was without question the largest object, living or otherwise, in town and higher above the sky was as sun-filled as could be. Had a sudden storm-front or just a pack of drifting clouds moved in?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo in fact it was something even she couldn't have anticipated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-kun there you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing digging through the dirt, Naoto-kun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Naoto! So this is where you were!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree distinctive yet oh so familiar voices, Yukiko, Chie, Rise...but something was off here granted she was now rather easy to spot but where were they, and why did it sound as if they were so near to her. It was as if her sense of awareness was attempting to warn her that something about all this was wrong she kept that in mind as she turned over...and nearly fell flat on her enormous rear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her stood three of her missing friends, the girls to be exact, but what had shocked the hell out of her was not that she had found them but they had found her and the lady trio were even bigger in muscle mass then she currently was! Which said a lot considering prior to their sudden arrival she had little reason to not believe that she was the largest strongest human on the entire planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to her revelation Chie asked politely if everything was alright while Yukiko extended a massive arm forward reaching out to help the detective back to her feet. She accepted the assistance her mind still trying to process what was going on, she hadn't yet answered Chie's question and by the look of things she'd be delayed further as Rise came rushing in leaching her own mountainous form onto Naoto's equally impressive but now much smaller in scale body just as the bubbly pop idol always did in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto struggled as she always did against Rise near vice grip the girl's enormous arms holding her in place as her gigantic breasts smashed into the poor girl's face, she wasn't sure how to explain the feeling of being completely surrounded by uncountable tons of muscle and yet here she was. Again that feeling of things being familiar except for one massive main difference came back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost as if the others strangely weren't even aware of how large they all currently were. To put things in an easier sense the girls, muscle aside, were all proportionately sized to how each of them were normally. Meaning Yukiko was the largest, followed by Rise, then Chie, and as expected Naoto was incidentally back to being the smallest. She'd be lying to herself if that realization didn't strike a nerve with her especially after she had, albeit briefly, enjoyed being the biggest and strongest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case upon Rise releasing her from the immense hug Naoto answered Chie's question from earlier with one of her own, asking if any of them felt as if things were different in any way, they all answered with a firm no. Undeterred she asked again stressing if anything at all felt weirdly out of place, they stared at her for a moment before yet again answering with a no. Naoto however could feel it something was very wrong here, as if a tiny voice in her head was urging her to seek out and find the truth as she always had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood firm as she took in a quick sharp breath, her titanic breasts rising and falling back into place, explaining that something was certainly strange that they weren't meant to be the way they currently were! They should all be in class learning not standing around as if they were four goddesses that had descended upon the land!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Naoto?\" questioned Rise placing a hand on the blue-haired girl's massive shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've always been like this, you know that. The four of us are home schooled because lets face it none of us fit inside the building...the same building that you trashed for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to make out but Rise smiled as she chuckled in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto however wasn't amused she was getting stronger and stronger vibes that this was all wrong. It was she just had to make the girls see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is not who were are.\" she relentlessly argued if only there was some way to make them understand.</span></div></div>",

Sure you're feeling sick or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she questioned her Naoto began to notice a sight that quickly caught her eye. She couldn't explain how, much in the same way she couldn't explain how it had happen to her, but Chie was in fact growing bigger with passing second!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this her definitive clue that things weren't as they seem? It certainly did seem as if it was and she was going to make use of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see it now, Sempai. For whatever reason it may be you're growing larger as we speak with one another. That's not logical if things were as they normally were it be inconceivable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying, Naoto?\" again Rise still questioned her reasoning even when it was right here right in front of them. Could they not see Chie was already larger then Yukiko could they not hear the sickening sound of her muscles growing higher and expanding ever wider!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth is standing right in front of you all how can you still remain so blind to it! Please explain to me how.\" Naoto demanded the red on her face mismatching with the blue of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise and Yukiko stood silent as larger and larger Chie's muscles grew. Her body stretching upward in height not to mention continuously wider, expanding to a size that rivaled several city blocks. In that short while she had eclipsed them all, it was difficult to pinpoint Chie's head surrounded in the valley of muscle that had become her upper body but Naoto would get a bit of assistance when the titanic girl reached down and plucked the miniature by comparison detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching in her hand as if Naoto was an muscled up plush toy Chie stared at her with a curious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-kun are you sure you're okay? You're not making any sense with what you're saying. I think you need to rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, none of this right. I can't explain it but I know you are not Chie-Sempai. None of you are who you claim you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may have come to regret those words as she felt the grip on her tighten up a tad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still talking crazy, Naoto-kun. Of course it's us who else would it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you are not. My friends my true friends would not be so blind or purposely ignore what is right in front of them. All of this is false and you are not Chie you are simply some type of monster that has taken the familiarity of my friend and used it against me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was beginning to come to her, the self-realization of where she was why everything was so bizarre...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto-kun I think you really need to take a nap...for your own good.\" Chie muttered as she really began to apply the pressure in hopes of making Naoto submit to her will all the while Rise and Yukiko stood by silent as if they were nothing more then gigantic statues made in the images of the detective's friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you do not exist nor does anything else here...\" Something had urged her to stare at her right hand and to her surprise she found her ever trusty pistol, grown proportionally in size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto!\" yelled the massive Chie as she glared a hole through the stubborn blue-haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This only truth in this entire plain of existence is that I am still me.\" Naoto stated as she pointed the barrel of the gun straight at the monstrous imposter's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't dare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto paused for a moment yet smiled afterwards much to the blonde titan's displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are correct...if you were indeed who you say you are, but you are not! Her none of you are. So this is where the dream ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was silent as a single shot rang out and after what seem like an endless slumber the detective prince at last awoke from her absurd dream...</span></div></div>",

Raising herself up into a more comfortable sitting position she wiped away at her forehead with her right thumb. Her breathing was bit erratic but slowly was beginning to stabilize as it did so she took a moment to look around her room. To her surprise it was early morning, the sun attempting to enter through her slightly closed shutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh she planted herself back onto her pillow her head still reeling from the muscle-fueled nightmare she had experienced apparently all through the night. She had no real answer as to why she had dreamed up such a scenario logically none of it made sense seeing as it was physically impossible to reach the size she had much less the one of the false Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted some extra strength yes but to be that powerful that massive...she shook her head believing that it was simply unneeded and would be far too much of a hassle to actively live with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the young woman exited her room and headed for the nearest bathroom to freshen up. As she entered she carefully looked over her reflection in the mirror. Even though she was in her simple sleep wear there didn't seem to be anything different about her. She was as normal as she could be minus the slight case of sleep still her eyes and the obviously ruffled up blue locks of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing had changed it really was all a dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran a hand through her hair a brief smile on her lips, what on earth could have possessed her to even believe that any part of it was real, maybe just maybe a part of her did miss being so strong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo that it was foolish to think that way she thought instead she'd focusing on clearing her head with a nice relaxing shower...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower seem to have worked it's magic as later while she was properly dressing herself for the day Naoto thought back to not the size she had reach in her dream but the reasoning behind it all. There had to be something she wasn't understanding, which said something considering the intelligence the young woman possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing at it alone wasn't going to get her anywhere no instead she figured it was best if she seek out the assistance of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she should mention it to Chie, the two of them were going to meet up for some physical training anyway so why not ask her tomboy of a friend if she could provide any sort of help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there was also Yukiko, who was rather sharp herself, maybe she could help her in some way and if she hurried she could meet with the raven-haired young woman before heading over to met up with Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions, decisions, she thought as she placed her favorite hat at top of her head.</span></div></div>",

Not counting her strange dream the last thing she remembered was heading to bed at her home, which beg the question where exactly was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she couldn't glance around she was able to pick up on the sounds all around her...machines buzzing and whirling a strong set of lights sitting high over her.

Let me make things clearer for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab-coat wearing shadow strolled on over in her direction as she explained how Naoto had come to spot her shadow on the television screen, curiosity and bravery getting the better of her she leaped into the TV world eventually coming to spot the reformed laboratory. But why couldn't she recall any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A temporal memory wipe I'm afraid a bit of side-effect from after you were so carelessly captured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she remembered going to bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do pay attention your memories from your discovery of me and the lab were purposely hazed because unlike last time I couldn't allow you to be saved not before I was able to finish helping you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelp her, what did she mean by that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your desires your hidden desires you saw and felt them in your dream didn't you? I simply assisted in making them a reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto huffed as best she could given her current state the young woman's frustration from before was beginning to return. Honestly her shadow was making no sense although a part of her knew of what she spoke of as much as she wanted to deny it...but that was in her dream state so how exactly did she achieve that last part? Nevermind what else her dark self could possibly do to her now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we just need to run one last little test and you'll be all done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow's golden eyes gleamed a sinister hue as a pleased smile spread from ear to ear from inside a pocket on her over-sized lab coat the shadow then pulled out a shot of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young detective tensed for a moment before attempting to break free with every once of her being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do be still.

Naoto did find it ridiculous that anyone could obtain a size as massive as her dream-self had reached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was utterly impossible from a physical stand point of course here Chie took the opportunity to state that so was using Personas and having an entire alt dimension exist within their television sets. Naoto smiled at Chie\u2019s quick humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case Chie went on to state that it shouldn\u2019t be anything worth worrying over adding in yet another bit of humor by stating that if Naoto would actually get that massive from just one training session Chie herself should logically already be mountainous. Obviously she wasn\u2019t and Naoto understood what Chie was getting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to be stronger yes but in her sudden case of happiness at Chie training her her emotions must have ran away with the inner thought of getting bigger getting stronger. Her nerves now settling down she thanked Chie for the advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem like I said it\u2019s probably nothing just a case of jitterbugs in her head get some sleep Naoto-kun and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow for our first session together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I understand much clearly now. Thank you\u2026Chie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her eyes lid up at how Naoto had thanked her. There was a bit of nervousness behind her words but the girl did seem to be so thankful and it was the first time she had ever used her name in such a fashion. She couldn\u2019t explain why and maybe it was the still lingering amount of sleep on her part but she was happy to help Naoto during her time of need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha\u2026no problem, goodnight and see ya tomorrow Naoto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head resting on the soft pillow Chie wondered what exactly was going through Naoto\u2019s mind at the moment, maybe with that said she\u2019d have a better night sleep who knows. She felt herself smile at her actions she really needed to get back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she did so however she thought back to the immense size Naoto had described in her dream. She laughed thinking back to what she told Naoto earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d be the size of a freaking mountain if that were true\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie smiled for a moment before drifting off back into her previous slumber.</span></div></div>",

While she didn't have the fashion sense that her friends Rise and Yukiko had when it came to beautiful clothing she did know what one would need for a work out. A simple tee, a pair of sweatpants (Chie took a guess that Naoto really isn't the type to show off her legs), and a lightweight jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be good for Naoto-kun.\" she thought vocally. Calling over Naoto the older girl asked if the attire was alright with the blue-haired girl's standards. The young detective nodded in agreement. She a smile and a skip in her step Chie instructed Naoto to follow her once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out even the simple weight set was bit steep for Chie's current income, Naoto had asked if she needed assistance in paying or she could just go ahead and pay for the clothing but the tomboy disapproved stating that Naoto could just use Chie's personal set and that she was buying the sports attire as an act of friendship. Naoto thanked Chie after blushing rather embarrassingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now the only thing left was the energy drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two wondered the aisle Chie was just about to pick up her usual brand when her eye caught on to a new product, one that was rather foreign even to her. It was a powder mixing with water style of drink, like a tea of sorts. Curious Chie grabbed the mid-size can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it has a green tea type of flavor...guess it is tea then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find something, Chie-Senpai?\" asked Naoto not wanting to peek over Chie's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah um instead of the usual I'm going to go ahead and take this new style.\" stated Chie as she walked over toward Naoto...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the back storage area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you put them back out on the store shelf, I told Souji to take them down for a reason, ya Crazy Bear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frustrated Yosuke growled in rage before slumping into a nearby chair and opening a cold soda can tossed over to him by Souji, the gray haired youth could only sigh as the sometimes bear now in human form Teddie apologized as if his very life depended on it.

Now Souji's gotta take them down again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke sighed after explaining to Teddie, the blonde shooting an apologetic look toward his self-proclaimed \"Sensei\". Souji smiled somewhat before shrugging in a \"can't be helped\" yet understanding manner. For that Teddie was thankful even Yosuke was still ticked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing his soda Yosuke then told Souji to take care of the drinks and Teddie to get back to his mascot duties. Yosuke himself would make sure no one grabbed any of the drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going back and grabbing two more cans Chie, with Naoto in tow, paid for all the items.

Since she had decided to be more womanly, she wanted to try doing something that girls normally sit down and do (at least, she thought they did): Style their hair. Naoto had always just left her as it was, and put her hat on, but she wanted to change. and so, she began fighting against her hair... and very quickly lost. She huffed as she threw down her comb. No matter what style she tried to do, her boyish frame made it look strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto: <i>I just wished I looked more womanly... But still, I know I shouldn't care about my chest size...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she realised there was rain, pattering against her window outside. A grandfather clock nearby in her house called out midnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto: <i>Huh... That's strange. I didn't think it was raining a few minutes ago...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the TV in her room flickered on. To her surprise, the same white-labcoated figure she had previously faced came on, still in the secret underground lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nS. Naoto: \"Hello, one and all! I am Naoto Shirogane, and this... isn't that. Hello, me. I've focused this airing, so only you can see it. Recently, I've been researching an idea I had. Since those ignorant fools foiled my plan to become a man, I decided to try the other direction. Making myself a woman. 'But you're already female. How are you going to become something you already are?', you might be wondering. And yes, while I am a woman, I don't quite fit the part. That's why I developed this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow stepped to the side, revealing a huge raygun behind it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nS. Naoto: \"Behold, a machine which will double the breast size of it's target, curing our more troubling desires. Observe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's shadow pulled out a button from its pocket and pushed it. Light sprayed down from above for a full second. Then Naoto's shadow began to smirk as it's lab coat was pushed further open. It's boobs swelled out, to exactly double their original size. They now looked only a little smaller than Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nS. Naoto: \"Now, it's your turn! You should come in here and see about it's powers for yourself. Now I know you'd never come in here by yourself. So, I've set all my gaurds on standby. You should have no trouble with them. Oh, but I guess you might not have an incentive, do you? Well, if you don't come in here by tomorrow night, I'll start broadcasting all over. And you know your friends will notice. Well, then I will see you when you make the right decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen flickered off. Naoto was stunned. She... her mind had created something like that? Either way, the ultimatum it gave could be a problem. After all, way more people have started watching the midnight channel than ever before. She needed to go face it. But still, what should she do about her friends? It didn't necessarily say they weren't allowed to go... but it would be pretty embarrassing if they found out about this.</span></div></div>",

Luckily, her fall was quite cusioned by her new rack. Unfortunately, falling well wasn't the goal. She looked up. Her shadow stood back up, holding the button. The ray recalibrated and aimed directly at her. She could only brace from her position on the floor while she listened to the machine charge up. Finally, the light burst over her. She felt herself get pushed further off the ground as her boobs inflated quickly. She heard a couple rapid fire pings as the buttons on her shirt burst off. She was still laying down, but she could only barely touch the floor with her hands. She rolled back, so she was seated with her beachball-sized breasts in front of her. They were incrediy heavy. She felt like she would never stand again. She looked up at ber shadow, who was standing a safe distance away, smirking. She still had the button at the ready.</span></div></div>",

But then, she heard a click from behind her as the door to the room unlocked and slod open. Her eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji checkes his watch. It was 2:00 on a Sunday. Daytime. He was walking theough the shopping district, trying to think of what he could do. Pretty much most of his friends weren't around, so hanging out wasn't an option... or was it? He knew at least one person who would be available on a sunday during the daytime. Naoto. Though, when he checked out in front of the bookstore, where she normally hung out, he didn't find her. That's weird... where else could she be? He tried calling her. She didn't pick up. She could just be doing some errands or something along those lines... but something kept naggging at the back of Souji's mind that she was in danger. After a while longer, he couldn't take it any longer. After another attempt to call Naoto, met only with the voicemail, he decided to at least check. He headed over to Junes, and called his friends over, too. When they arrived, he explained the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise: \"So... you called us here because she didn't respond?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko: \"It makes sense to me. It seems Naoto-kun could be in danger. I haven't been able to get in touch with her either, so I think it would be worthwhile to at least check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the group nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise: \"Ok, whatever... Well, even if it's just a waste of time, at least we'll know for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, they entered te TV World. Rise stepped forward, and did her thing, summoning Himiko. After a few seconds of silence, she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise: \"I got a signal! It's comming from.... the Lab...? Hey, there's a super powerful shadow there, too! C'mon, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the group set off. They sprinted through the lab, mysteriously not finding any shadows on their way. Finally, they reached the final floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise: \"Ok, I sense her up ahead! Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji nodded, and opened the door. The sight in front of them shocked them. Naoto's shadow seemed to be back, and seemingly had gotten a bust enhancment. A little past the shadow, Naoto was sitting on the ground, only barely able to support her chest, after she also DEFINITELY gotten an enhancement. Her breasts were absolutely massive. The Shadow turned to her new guests. Naoto could see Kanji immediately turn such a deep red that she could only barely see the blood coming out of his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nS.

With the added weight, she went down. This left Yukiko all alone to face the shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Naoto couldn't even watch what was happening, but somehow she knew hiw the fight was going.

Yesterday had been one huge mess, but her friends were very understanding of her thoughts. According to Chie, she had those exact same worries, too. As she got ready to go to school, she noticed something sitting on her night stand. It was a remote with a single red button on it, like her shadow had used. There was a note next to it, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Behold! The boob beam mini! Built fresh for use in your world!

She pulled in a slight breath, before pushing the trigger. Yumi's chest rumbled for a second as she looked down questioningly. Suddenly, her boobs swelled out to huge proportions.

The girl hadn't gone much outside her circle of friends, but to know more about Souji and to try and close the wound his leaving had left. After becoming acquaintances with them Yumi slowly forged bonds of friendship with them, eventually hanging out on regular basis. It was one fateful instance that would change Yumi's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi and Yukiko were both waiting on Rise and Chie to head over to Junes for lunch, Naoto was on a case and wouldn't be able to join today's excursion. \"So We pushed him and Yosuke in and Moroka was puking in the river.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww Nasty.\" Yumi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two.\" Rise said as she and Chie walked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we were just retelling the trip into the mountains we had.\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you mention the part where we snuck into the boy's tent because of Hanako and Kanji and had to wait for Moroka to leave?\" Chie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...you guys had all the real fun with Souji...I just got cheered up by him and that's it.\" Yumi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, don't feel bad...we also had a very important...project that we needed his help on. If he didn't I'm sure he'd have spent more time with you.\" Chie said as Rise and Yukiko gave her glares at what she was implying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys, really. I should be apologizing, after all I feel like I'm becoming friends with you all for the wrong reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true, all of us were brought here by Sempai. Fact is a lot of us are very different, I'm a pop idol, Chie's a tomboy, Yukiko is prim and proper, and Naoto is extra serious. We have almost nothing in common.\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right...\" Yumi said looking at her cup with a drink in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now it won't do to see a lady upset.\" A Familiar voice said as Teddie sqeekly walked up in his bear suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ted, what brings you here?\" Chie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've been noticing you're new friend lately and figured it'd be nice to introduce myself. I'm Teddie.\" Teddie faced Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teddie huh? Well I'm Yumi, I've seen you working here a lot, isn't it hot in that costume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem for a man such as me.\" Teddie said with a light growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi gave a light giggle. \"Well since it'd be insulting to not face such a beauty with a gift I picked this in my wor...I mean I picked this in a field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddie pulled out a beautiful rose, it was bloomed more then any normal rose, with delicate and bright petals all over. \"Wow it's beautiful, thank you Teddie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey how come she gets flowers?\" Rise asked Teddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well like I said I just found it...I'll try and find more for you girls.\" Teddie was distracted by the angry trio that he handed Yumi the rose wrong and she pricked her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" Yumi held her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, I'm sorry Yumi-chan, are you hurt?\" Teddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine it's just a simple rose thorn. Didn't hurt too bad.\" Yumi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better find some water and a vase for that, I think there's a nice selection here in the gardening section.\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi nodded, she looked at the rose before saying her mind.</span></div></div>",

Instead she overheard Teddie apologize before speeding off to find her a proper vase for his gift, the all too familiar squeak of his suit resounding in their ears until he at last was out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s certainly quite the character\u2026\u201d Yumi mentioned with a slight giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d Chie piped in rather bluntly, Yukiko scowling Chie a bit afterwards while Rise merely chuckled at the exchange Yumi eventually joining in with the redheaded idol\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired girl waved while saying her goodbyes to her new found friends, the four of them going their separate ways with Yumi heading home vase in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was fun day at least for her being able to hang out with the girls, still wishing that Naoto could have joined in as well, and being introduced to the loveable mascot of the Junes department store. Focusing on the flower resting within the vase she smiled it really was a beautiful gift and she\u2019d make sure to keep it well attended to. Teddie\u2019s surprising kindness in a way reminded her of Souji\u2019s\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed for moment doing her best to shake away any depressing emotions. She had become a stronger person because of him it wouldn\u2019t be right for her to, the flower in her hands, whiter up and give into her sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing up her mind seeing as she was almost home yet Yumi took a moment to catch her breath strangely she felt as if she had to work harder on getting home then when she had left from it earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't really explain it but for some reason or other it felt as if for every ten minutes or so that passed her steps would become come down harder and heavier then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a strange sensation at the same time it didn't help that her attire as well felt as if it were mildly tightening around her body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe the heat was causing the clothing to stick to her just a tad, she wasn't too sure though all she knew was that this walk home was turning out to be rather confusing. However she went ahead and placed it all behind her just as she was coming up to her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelived to be home at last, the strange sensation from before still ever present and still bugging the life out of her, Yumi choose to put on some more casual since the clothing she had on was really starting to tighten around her. Again something she couldn't really explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripping till she was left in her matching black bra and panties she quietly passed by the mirror in her room on the way toward the closet.

Pushing a coffee table aside she figured she\u2019d have this would be the best and widest place to work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did so Yumi was unaware another ten minutes had passed thus causing her body to bloat out again just a tad.

She felt her fingers press down onto the skin. It was real, Yumi had no clue why, but it was real.

Everything was simply happening too fast for her to comprehend yet there was a small glimmer of hope as she could almost make out the rose \u201chiss\u201d in pain as it withered away on the floorboards. Although due to her new mass she obviously couldn\u2019t make out if the demon of a flower had truly been put down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fears were lessened a tad after catching a bit of a glimpse of Naoto\u2019s approaching figure. She couldn\u2019t move too well much less move her face but still managed something of a smile as the detective made her way over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her pistol put away the blue-haired girl was ever so thankful for her precise aiming skills. She only had a single shot at nailing the hell flower one misfire would have spelled disaster thankfully she was as good a shot as ever and now the strange plant life lay dead on the floor. Scoping it into a jar she had picked up Naoto ensured that was it indeed lifeless after all the last thing either girl needed was the flower coming back to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter setting the jar aside Naoto at last made her way over to poor helpless Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaoto-kun is it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi choked a bit on her words obviously still very shaken from the ordeal she\u2019d been going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Sempai everything\u2019s going to be alright now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-haired girl reassured her with a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright Yumi-Sempai?\u201d she asked kindly staring at the mass of female flesh that Yumi had unfortunately transformed into. A part of her wished she had gotten here sooner perhaps if she had she could have prevented the older girl from becoming completely immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she could Naoto would have kicked herself right then and there but her thoughts were interrupted once Yumi spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026well not fine, but you get the idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto nodded noticing that Yumi seemingly had more to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026I think I\u2019ve stopped growing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that had certainly caught the detective\u2019s attention. Was she sure? Yumi responded stating that she certainly felt as if she was no longer growing any thicker but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older girl\u2019s now puffy cheeks nearly beamed a sharp crimson as she felt Naoto placing her hands upon her bed of a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN\u2026Naoto-kun, what are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a bit of a muffled cough after the younger girl released the hold on her flesh. Clearly embarrassed Naoto ran a hand through her short locks of her hair, her usual hat removed for but a moment, the detective prince explained that she was checking to see if Yumi was indeed finished. As it turned out as far as she could tell the raven-haired girl was in fact done growing of course this still left her in a blob-like state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. Then thank you, Naoto-kun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi\u2019s heart-felted thanks actually caused the blue-haired girl to blush a bit as she placed her hat back at top her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026now what, do you have any idea of what happen to me?\u201d Yumi asked attempting to break the sudden awkward moment between the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes actually I have something of an idea\u2026\u201d Naoto explained once again deep in thought at the flower\u2019s origins and it\u2019s strange abilities.</span></div></div>",

She turned around, the rose gone. Naoto silently scanned the room her gun in front of her, looking down the iron sights on the barrel. \"Where's it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Naoto felt something latch onto her back, she knew right away what it was, it was the rose. She looked at the TV's reflection and confirmed it, she tried reaching for it but she couldn't reach. The rose climbed up and Naoto used the reflection to aim for the bud and tried to fire, but the rose leaned it's bud back and wrapped it's thorns around Naoto's neck. \"OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rose got off and seemed to giggle as Naoto held her bleeding neck.

'Souji won't ever like me like this, he'll think I'm hideous.' Is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know he cares about the you on the inside.

They used to call her Piggy-hara.\" Despite herself, Chie let out a yelp of laughter, though she did look affronted the moment she slapped a hand over her own mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not nice to tease people,\" Chie admitted, coming to a stop as she sat down on the wall next to Yukiko, \"But.. but she deserves it! She's proof that you can be pretty on the outside and still really ugly inside!\" She huffed, resting her hands down against her knees. \"Surely if she used to be fat, she must know how it feels..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps she needs a reminder,\" Rise, Chie and Yukiko looked over in some surprise as the smallest of the group spoke; Naoto looked up from her book, her blue eyes gleaming with determination, \"If she's to become fat again, she'll realise a pleasant exterior does not necessarily equate a nicer inside.\" Rise blinked several times, before giving a little cheer, jumping to her feet with a squeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" she beamed at the rest of them, \"Let's do it! We'll get rid of mean ol' Ai, and we'll find ourselves a cute Piggy-hara!\" </span></div></div>",

She remembers all of them; Souji, Yosuke, Chie, Yukiko, Kanji, Rise, Teddie, and Naoto. Though she smiles a lot when she's home or at school Nanako feels lonely at times. The alarm rang as Nanako took her hand out and hit the clock, from such a small girl came a 5 foot 7 brunette keeping her hair down, a moderate sized bust and when she wasn't wearing her school uniform she would wear pink shoes like the ones she had as a kid but bigger, a pink tank top that wasn't reveling because she wasn't that kind of girl, with a white jacket that went to her waist, and white leggings. \"Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Nanko you're up.\" Dojima had some gray in his hair from old age, Nanko hugged her father before sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you doing today?\" He asked as she put bread in the toaster and getting some butter out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm just going to take a walk, maybe I'll try and catch some fish at the flood plains. The old man always gives me nice things for those fish.\" Nanko smiled as the toast came out and she buttered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well be careful now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will dad, I'm always careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know sweetie. Well I have to head off, oh can you pick something up from Junes? We're out of Coffee cream and some sugar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coffee cream and sugar, got it dad!\" Nanko said as her dad left, after breakfast Nanko stretched a bit before heading out and locking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanko's bright smile she gave her dad melted into a moderate smile, she really wasn't as happy as she used to. Her cousin was in College so he can't visit much, Chie and Naoto are both studying Criminology together, Yukiko had become the assistant manager of the Amagi inn, Yosuke was the same deal but for Junes, Kanji always gets so many for his arts and crafts class, Rise was a superstar again and lastly Teddie had seemingly vanished. \"I miss them. All of them, I wish I could go back to when I was a kid, we spent so many great times together, we even suffered through the worst together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanko walked around, she saw some people she knew from Yasogami which she was attending, but didn't really say anything to any of them. Nanako was walking around the shopping district, the place wasn't dead yet, faithful costumers kept them in business, as Nanko walked past to Tofu store and nearing the General Store she heard a voice. \"Three Topsicles please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh!?\" Nanko stopped as a boy with blond hair and strong blue eyes walked out, she couldn't believe it, she rubbed her eyes in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-T-TEDDIE!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I thought I heard a young maiden cry out my name?\" Teddie said looking over to Nanko who was still shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Miss, do you know me? I am quite the ladies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teddie it's me! Nanko!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nana-chan!\" Teddie said being shocked himself, more of a worried shocked then surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teddie it really is you!\" Nanko walked up pinching Teddie's cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? You're still so...young!\" Nanako said seeing that Teddie hasn't aged a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddie was worried this would happen if he kept coming to and from his world for some of the human world's treats and leisures. \"Nana-chan, you've grown up to be quite the beautiful lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako blushed at Teddie's comment. \"T-That doesn't answer my question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed sighed. \"Nana-chan, I don't know how to tell you without you being unable to understand, do you remember back when you were young and you were kidnapped?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I was so scared whenever I heard the doorbell ring or someone knocking for a whole two years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember...that place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the place inside the TV?\" Nanako replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you do remember, but you never told anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad doesn't even believe it, so why would anyone else.\" Nanako replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nana-chan I'm from that world, I'm not human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not. That's why I was hoping no one I knew would see me, I figured my Bear suit would be too obvious so I tried this body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teddie...you idiot! I was so alone! I wouldn't have told anyone! I mean I DO have friends but, they're not as great as you guys were! I miss those times Teddie! I missed you and all the others!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nana-chan...\" Teddie felt bad, he remembered he made a promise long ago to play with Nanako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nana-chan come with me to my world, we can have fun together!\" Teddie took Nanako's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Nanako said taken aback by his sudden enthusiasm <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddie wants to take Nanako to the TV world, free of corruption it was a beautiful place, Nanako was happy to see Teddie again.</span></div></div>",

Her attention was caught by a dress in a store's display window but she quickly realized she didn't have the money to buy it. Disappointed she kept on walking, a little later he began to feel hungry and headed towards the food court. There she saw something interesting an eating contest and one with the cash prize, enough for her to buy the dress she saw and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako signed up and took a seat at the long table where the competition would be held. Once the contest was about to get underway she began feeling nervous all of the other competitors were older than her and some were, judging by their fat quite gluttonous. The rules of the contest was simple the food court were providing plates of food and whoever ate the most without getting full won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contest started and everyone began eating after the first couple plates people began dropping out one by one. It didn't take long before was just Nanako and two others, a man and a woman Every time she started to waver Nanako just thought of the dress she wanted to buy things kept pushing forward. At the 20 plate the man gave up leaving just Nanako and the woman. Nanako was so close to winning she could feel it and was excited by the prospect. Five plates later the woman gave up making Nanako the winner. Almost without thinking Nanako proceeded to completely clean off her plate showing her victory wasn't won by a narrow margin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako examined herself realizing she had gained a noticeable bulge in her belly from all the food she had consumed. The little girl collected her cash prize and soon made her way to the clothing store buying the dress that caught her eye earlier. Nanako felt on top the world the competition had been so much fun both the thrill of victory and the pleasure of eating so much food.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">As I've browsed the net there seems to be a lack of growth/expansion material for the Persona series and even with 4's popularity there is still little if none (Major props to the WG interactive on here though).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wish to remedy that and offer this interactive as a haven of sorts for all sorts of potential growth/expansion story material for Persona 4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few ground rules though,<br>\r\n-Mostly all of the girls, with a few exceptions, can be used in any type of story. On that note, Nanako can be used but her story will be a mandatory time-skip due to her in-game age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-While there is an \"18+\" rating to keep with the \"M\" rating of the game there are still a few things prohibited. Language is allowed as are Sexual themes but actual Sex on the other hand is not, Vore is allowed but only if the subject isn't killed off in the process (more on this later), Nudity is also okay but please let's keep it at least somewhat tasteful, thanks. Also let's stay away from anything too strange (as in constant crapping, animal transformations, putrid farts, etc). Basically in short keep it to the original game's standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Story additions must be at least a paragraph or two with a decent amount of detail and effort. Plot may not be as important as in the actual game (and Arena) but let's have at least something of a story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No \"script\" dialogue, goes back to the above rule. Remember this is a story not a script.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-No killing off the cast whatsoever, gets complicated with any possible vore but just use a bit of DEM in that case. Regardless no one dies alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-There is no limit to the growths the girls can experience so go crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The growths are obviously female-only though the guys can take part in the story but they must remain as they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Please no OOC, as in one of them suddenly turns evil at the drop of a dime, that's what their Shadow forms are there for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Lastly I would like to thank everyone who at one point or another contributed to this story. Thank you with your help this has been by far my most successful interactive having passed the four hundred entry mark. A fantastic achievement, really!. So once again thank you all past and present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that's about it, other then that the whole point of this is to have fun and with any luck come up with some great P4 stories.</td>",
