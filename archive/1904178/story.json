You are a girl that's at least 25, with long brown hair, brown eyes, an attractive face, a decent build and slender arms and legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I probably should take a shower...\" you say walking into the shower and turn the water on.  You wash yourself, and notice that her soap smells like flowers.  You finish the shower and walk out and brush and blow dry your hair, which the body seemed to take over for.  You make your hair look nice and then go out to put on clothes.  You see a business suit hanging in the closet, so you grab it and go into her drawer for a bra, panties and pantyhose.  You put on the lingerie and then look at yourself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is weird\" you say \"I look kinda hot\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue getting ready, put makeup on and then the suit.  You have trouble with the skirt because it is so short.  Then you put the heels on, they were like 3 inches! This chick is nuts! You look at yourself in a mirror.  If you were a guy, you would want to have sex with this girl, but now your thoughts are on how pretty you are, in a personal sense.  But whatever, where the hell does she work?  You check her phone and it has an address and name of the place.  ThundCorp... weird name.  </span></div></div>",

Jeez, those cars look like they could get torn through by a semi truck.  Oh well, it's the only car you can use.  You put the address into the GPS and start to drive. You can't help but notice that you feel smaller, almost weak and fragile.  You brush it off and keep driving.  You try to turn on the radio, but it looks like it's broken.  You turn on the CD Player.  Out of the speakers comes the most girly sounding song ever, you've never heard it before, but it's really catchy.  You listen to the entire CD and then you are at her workplace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the building, not used to the heels yet,but you manage to make it to the elevator.  Her phone said that she worked on the 15th floor, so you click the button and wait.  It stops on a floor and a man walks in.  For some reason, you can't place, you feel weak and fragile again.  The man turns to you, glaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, did you finish the reports yet?\" he says, instantly reminding you of who he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no sir, I just got here\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, have it finished by the end of the day, got it?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir I will be sure of that\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And good choice on the skirt\" he says as the elevator beeps for 15 and you get off, you can feel him staring at your ass as you walk towards your cubicle.  You see one that says Sarah Anderson, and inside there are pictures hanging up, one with an old man, an old woman, and the woman whose body you now inhabit.  You assume that those are here parents and sit down.  Now what to do?</span></div></div>",

Sure, you managed to find some allegedly \u201cimportant\u201d reports that you emailed to Sarah's boss \u2026 hopefully! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was blind luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scarcely know how to walk in heels much less do Sarah's job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long while you sit there, just staring at Sarah's computer screen and fidgeting with the hem of the short, tight skirt you're wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the phone rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReflexively you pick up the receiver and answer: \u201cThundCorp, this is Sarah Anderson speaking. How may I direct your call?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a moment ago, you were hopelessly lost. Now at the sound of a bell, you're like one of Pavlov's dogs, conditioned to respond automatically in just the way Sarah's body is accustomed to doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe caller is a gruff sounding man who treats you rather rudely and demands to speak with your boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d you chirp pleasantly. \u201cI'll connect you with him immediately, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou deftly press a few buttons on your phone console and in no time flat have the call dutifully transferred to the boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet him handle it, you think. He's a man and knows better anyhow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even realizing what you're doing, you've bent down and picked up your purse. Removing a nail file, you begin to studiously work on your nails and wait for the clock to count down to lunchtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes have passed, the woman you had made a lunch date with earlier finally returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready to go, Sarah?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you forget that she's talking to you. Weird, you think. A few moments ago, I was completely in \u201cSarah Mode,\u201d thinking and acting like her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah, I'm ready,\u201d you say, rising unsteadily to your wobbly feet. You might be able to answer a phone call as Sarah, but you still haven't mastered the art of walking in three inch heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter get used to it if you're going to remain a woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I figured we'd go to the usual place,\u201d says the strange woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat lot of help <u>that</u> is, you think to yourself. If you want any worthwhile clues about your new life, it appears you're going to have to try a lot harder than that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow your new friend to the elevator, listening to her constant stream of gossipy chit-chat about various co-workers you haven't even met yet. Despite not recognizing any of the names, you feel easily drawn into listening to all the juicy little details of who got caught saying or doing what to whom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it, the two of you are in the parking garage getting into the woman's car.</span></div></div>",

I'm an imposter \u2013 trapped in Sarah's body. But I'm not really her, and I actually don't know anything about her or her life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're kidding me,\u201d deadpans Allison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head somberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let's play along with this,\u201d replies Allison, still not quite believing her ears. \u201cUh \u2026 so you're not my friend and co-worker Sarah. That just begs the question: who the hell are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Bill Johnson,\u201d you answer. \u201cI'm the CEO of IntrepiCorp, Ltd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how did you end up in my friend Sarah's body?\u201d asks Allison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just woke up in Sarah's body this morning and have no idea how it happened?\u201d Allison asks skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d you answer. \u201cI swear, this is all the honest truth. I don't know how this happened. I'd love to get my own body back. You think I like going from being the boss to being a secretary?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot just a secretary, but Mr. Horndog's personal plaything!\u201d laughs Allison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you say, gulping nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really aren't Sarah, are you?\u201d says Allison, more seriously this time. \u201cOh my god. I don't know why \u2013 but I believe you. This is crazy! Things like this just don't happen in real life. But it's the only explanation. You're not Sarah. You're \u2026 uh \u2026 I'm sorry, I forgot your name already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill Johnson,\u201d you say meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Bill Johnson,\u201d she repeats. \u201cWell, perhaps you and I better keep that our little secret, eh? Sarah is a ditzy dingbat, but so far she doesn't have a reputation for outright insanity. I'd hate to see my best friend get locked up in an insane asylum for running about claiming she's a man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're going to help me?\u201d you ask shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are friends for?\u201d smiles Allison. \u201cWe should probably check in with your life at some point and find out if the real Sarah is now trapped in your old body. Maybe she has an idea of what happened \u2026 and how this can be undone. Or, I'm sorry \u2013 did you want to remain a girl from now on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she serious, you think in horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou vigorously shake your head no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not all bad, you know,\u201d says Allison. \u201cI'd hate for you to steal my friend's body without her permission. But if Sarah did this deliberately, maybe she wants to remain a man. In that case, you might have to get used to wearing skirts and pantyhose everyday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and struggle to hold back a flood of tears. Damn, these female hormones messing with your emotions already!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey calm down,\u201d Allison says. \u201cWe won't know anything until we find your old body and see whether or not Sarah's spirit wound up inside it. In the meantime, you and I are best friends. I've got your back, okay? Just listen to good old Allison \u2013 I'll help guide you through work and the rest of Sarah's life. You just have to promise me that you'll be a good custodian of Sarah's body until we find out if she did this on purpose or not. That means no getting yourself tattooed or knocked-up or anything like that yet, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suggestion of you getting pregnant is too much, and the floodgates suddenly open. Before you know it, tears are streaming down your cheeks and you're softly sobbing on Allison's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere there,\u201d she says. \u201cCalm down, and just let Allison help take care of everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suspect there's precious little Allison can do, though, to alter the fact that you're now a woman and could theoretically get yourself pregnant. You don't want Sarah's life, her body, her clothes, her job, and all the problems that come with living inside her skin for the rest of your days!</span></div></div>",

This itself wasn't surprising. It had been a lousy night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't stop prattling while straddling him about cosplaying as Yana-Yugo-San or some-such nonsense at an anime convention; all the while, Dante kept his ear peeled for the garage door in case his parents had lied and weren't staying the night with friends. He threw in the obligatory grunt here and there, whispered \"I love you's\" and \"Oh yeah's\" but his heart wasn't in it and he figured the girl knew. She was just happy some football player had paid attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. The ceiling was the same slate-gray as his own, but everything else seemed different... The bed was closer to the ground, the sunlight came from another angle, the covers felt thinner and the corner pulled across his shoulder was decorated with green-and-brown bamboo sticks. His had been plain, and he was sure the nerd girl hadn't brought her own blanket...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA poster on the wall caught his attention. \"MARTYR OF THE RUCKUS,\" bold, faux-3D letters declared beneath a photo of sleazy, scowling men in leather and dreads. They were the big pop-band of that year, geared mostly toward popular girls who wanted to feel \"rebellious.\" All the cheerleaders loved them. Dante's thoughts began to race at the association until, spotting family photos featuring a certain brunette, his mind seized the impossible. He clutched his head and felt a thicker mane of hair, and in the motion several strands fell before his eyes - brown, not blonde and close-cropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe covers flew off and Dante discovered the damp camisole plastered to his new rack of epic proportions: breasts he only dreamed of, now two inches from his vision. Green boxer shorts cut off at his thighs and revealed tan, vibrant legs, no doubt as muscular as his old ones, but more compact in their power and capable of a grace beyond the limits of his old broad-shouldered, 6'3'' body. Bare feet with pink-pig toes wiggled at the edge of this smaller bed. They taunted him with the new reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck!\" he squeaked, voice crackly, soft and new. \"I'm actually Maya Braynard!\"</span></div></div>",

All the boys were clamoring for her attention, but only the hunkiest and hottest could be her date, of course. All the girls had been put firmly in their places: either as ladies-in-waiting to run errands for Rebecca and laugh at all her snide jokes, or cast off into the outer circle of losers and social misfits deemed unsuitable to interact with the rest of teenage society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, what a wonderful dream, thought Rebecca as she yawned and stretched in the golden, warm rays of the early morning sunlight streaming through her window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d she grumbled to herself. \u201cI hate morning sunlight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd insisted her parents put up expensive, extra-thick curtains to block the light from disturbing her beauty sleep. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrritated, Rebecca sat upright in bed, fully prepared to fight with the drapes to get them closed. Mom and dad would get an earful about this at breakfast, of course! They'd promised her these window treatments were the best, and yet here she was being awoken by rotten old blinding sunlight when \u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca abruptly stopped her mental tirade in order to blink her eyes a few times in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn't my bedroom,\u201d she said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was a cluttered, claustrophobic mess of drab colored, dirty piles of clothes. Paperback books were stacked waist-high along one wall. A bookshelf nearby stood filled, not with books but with a bewildering array of plastic model spaceships and little toy action figures of robots, aliens, and comic book heroes. The walls were plastered with badly hung, cockeyed posters ripped out of cheap, glossy magazines. Rebecca, who normally had perfect vision, couldn't quite make out the pictures depicted in the posters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is it so blurry?\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt <u>wasn't</u> her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a squeaky yet low-pitched voice. Almost like the voice of a \u2026 a boy?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Rebecca leaped out of bed and started examining herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer worst fears were confirmed: she was in the chubby, pale skinned body of a sixteen-year old boy right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was currently shirtless, and could see her flabby yet flat-chested, male torso clearly displayed. Whoever's body this was, the poor schlub clearly never worked out! Around her legs was a pair of flannel pajama pants. Lifting the front waistband of the pajamas, Rebecca peered down and sighed in disgust at the sight of her own flaccid penis, just hanging there limply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've become some pathetic loser,\u201d she said, still staring in horror at her small yet undeniably masculine sign of manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroping around a bit, Rebecca managed to find a sweatshirt to pull on. Next came a pair of glasses with mind-bogglingly thick lenses and unflatteringly unfashionable cheap, plastic frames. They allowed her to see much better though, and she was finally able to complete a visual survey of the tiny bedroom she now occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, the posters on the walls all depicted various stupid sci-fi movies and television shows Rebecca was unfamiliar with. Likewise, the stacks of paperback novels all had dumb science fiction or fantasy titles on them. She didn't see a copy of the <i>Hunger Games</i>, <i>50 Shades of Gray</i>, or one of the<i> Twilight</i> books anywhere! Clearly this geek had <u>no</u> taste in literature!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho the hell am I?\u201d she wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, an obnoxiously nasal voice called out from somewhere else in the house: \u201cRonald, darling sweety-pie, are you awake yet my little pumpkin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh \u2026 my \u2026 gawd,\u201d Rebecca said, trying to fight a rising tide of panic within her. \u201cI'm that clumsy, fat nerd kid from school \u2013 Ronald Dwebble.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just then, a thin glittery purple phone on Rebecca's dresser started playing a Lady Gaga song Ronald was unfamiliar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing his eyes away from his angelic new reflection in the mirror, Ronald picked up the phone and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou miserable toad!\u201d came the familiar voice of an angry, teenage boy. \u201cYou stole my body. I want it back <u>right now</u>, or else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Ronald said, actually confused for a moment about who would be so angry with him. \u201cOh, wait \u2013 is this Rebecca Ward?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I'm Rebecca!\u201d she shouted with Ronald's voice. \u201cYou think you can steal my body and leave me trapped as a fat nerd? Oh, I'm going to make your life so miserable \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down,\u201d Ronald said. \u201cI didn't do this on purpose. In fact, I don't think I did anything at all to cause this. It's as big a surprise to me as it seems to be to you. Believe me, I'd love to get back to my own body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Rebecca. She found it inconceivable that Ronald didn't want to remain in her body. She was beautiful, popular, and spoiled rotten by her rich parents. Ronald <u>had</u> to have done this on purpose. He was jealous of her and had wanted to steal her life \u2026 right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said I didn't do this,\u201d Ronald repeated calmly. \u201cAnd if you'd like, I think we should cooperate and work together to find a way of reversing this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou actually want to go back to your fat, loser nerd body?\u201d Rebecca asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Ronald said. \u201cI guess I do. Look, you're very pretty Rebecca \u2026 but \u2026 well, I don't really want to be a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald laughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Rebecca said suspiciously. \u201cSo what do we do to change back then, Mr. Braniac?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Ronald. \u201cIn episode seventy-nine of <i>Star Trek</i>, Janice Lester uses an alien life-energy transfer procedure to steal Captain Kirk's body, and \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gawd!\u201d groaned Rebecca. \u201cI can't believe I'm listening to my own voice say all this creepy, nerd stuff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm just trying to help,\u201d Ronald said with an irritated edge to his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen help!\u201d sighed Rebecca. \u201cBuild a warp drive and beam us up back to normal, or whatever you nerds do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, in the show it was a life-energy transfer procedure, not a warp drive or transporter,\u201d Ronald pointed out. \u201cSecond, I couldn't build a transporter, much less a functioning warp core, even if I wanted to! Which believe me, I'd love to be able to do. But some things are simply in the realm of science fiction rather than \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d screamed Rebecca. \u201cLook, can you switch us back or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at the moment,\u201d answered Ronald. \u201cBut if we work together, I'm sure we can eventually find a way to reverse this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis sucks!\u201d yelled Rebecca. \u201cOh, and great. Now your mom is yelling at me to get dressed and go to school. I don't want to be you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll talk at school,\u201d Ronald said, trying his best to calm down the melodramatic diva now inhabiting his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better find a way to give me back my body!\u201d shouted Rebecca one last time, before hanging up the phone.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ronald sighed and looked down at his girlish new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca sure sounded angry on the phone, he reflected. It would be best, Ronald mused, to avoid further arousing her ire. He felt confident they'd eventually find some way to reverse the bodyswap that had affected them. After all, that was the natural course of events in the fantasy and sci-fi stories Ronald had often read. To be sure, it was awfully strange being a girl right now. But Ronald remained confident that his tenure as the occupant of Rebecca Ward's body would be temporary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Ronald simply had to act as an interim steward for Rebecca Ward \u2013 don't do anything to embarrass, annoy, or otherwise fluster the real Rebecca. He was simply a caretaker for her body. Ronald resolved to keep a low profile and strive to simply blend in with the crowd at school. That should be the safest course of action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile bashfully averting his eyes, Ronald stripped out of the skimpy negligee and panties Rebecca had worn to bed last night. He then groped about in her underwear drawer (a prospect that normally would both aroused and embarrassed him) before pulling out a pair of lime green cotton granny panties from the far back of the drawer. These would be the best to wear, he thought. After all, he'd have to change clothes in the girls gym locker today. He'd hate to embarrass Rebecca by having the other girls see her body wearing something skimpy, provocative, or otherwise too revealing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the panties up onto his smooth, soft legs, Ronald tugged to get them properly fitted to cover his large, curvy, round hips and behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Ronald pulled out a random bra from Rebecca's dresser. He wasn't sure it was important to match the bra with the panties, but figured such things were fairly trivial. He struggled for a few moments with the stiff, lacy purple garment, but finally managed to get it securely fitted over his firm, perky breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's weird, thought Ronald gazing down at his feminine chest. He'd always thought the role of a bra was to restrain and secure a woman's breasts. And yet with the bra on, Ronald's new female assets seemed even bigger and more jiggly than before. Somehow this garment was padded or something to enhance the size of Ronald's boobs and even make his cleavage more pronounced than ever. He had to admit, it was a pleasing sight \u2013 one that would have pleased him far more had he still been a teenage boy! But he now felt himself hoping Rebecca wouldn't be angry with him for choosing a bra that drew too much attention to her former breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClearly, there's a lot I still need to learn about women and their clothing,\u201d Ronald said aloud to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill bashfully worrying and fretting over his breasts, Ronald opted to dress himself in modest, reserved clothing. As a boy, Ronald had been a simple t-shirts and jeans kind of guy. So he dug through Rebecca's clothes hoping to find something similar. He managed to find a plain, light gray t-shirt made of some soft, girlish fabric. He put it on, but chose not to pair it with jeans. Everything Rebecca owned seemed too tight and revealing \u2013 skinny jeans, jeggings, leggings, and super short shorts. Exasperated, Ronald finally gave up and put on the longest skirt he could find in Rebecca's closet: a dark pink garment that came down to mid-calf on his new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skirt left him feeling cold, drafty, and exposed around the legs though. So Ronald found a pair of opaque, hot pink tights and worked them up onto his feet and legs. He then found a pair of black and white, Converse Chuck Taylors and put them on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood enough,\u201d Ronald said to himself, finally checking out his reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in the mirror, however, looked all wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I not doing right?\u201d Ronald wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed a pink, button down cardigan sweater and slid his arms into it. Did that help? Not really. Maybe he needed to do something with his hair? Ronald hurriedly brushed his long, golden blonde locks, slicked it all straight back, and tied it into a loosely limp ponytail. Still not right! Maybe he needed makeup? Girls like Rebecca were always wearing makeup. Timidly, Ronald reached for a random tube of lipstick and began smearing his lips with a coat of bright, bold, ruby red gloss. Again, back to the mirror \u2013 again, still not right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I give up!\u201d Ronald said in exasperation. \u201cThis will just have to be close enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald made sure to grab Rebecca's school bag full of books before heading out the door. He definitely didn't want to embarrass her by forgetting to bring her homework or study materials for class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Ronald himself, Rebecca owned her own car \u2013 a sporty little red convertible. So while Rebecca was trudging to school on foot in Ronald's body right now, Ronald got to enjoy the new experience of driving himself to school. He made absolutely certain not to speed or do anything foolish. He didn't want Rebecca getting a ticket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the high school's parking lot, Ronald got out of the car and had to adjust his tights and skirt a bit, in a most unladylike fashion. At the other end of the parking lot, Ronald spotted two other teens \u2013 a pair of social misfits named Edith and Penelope. As a guy, Ronald had enjoyed a passing acquaintance with the two. He was lab partners with Edith again this year, and he and Penelope were in the audiovisual club together and had done some behind-the-scenes tech work on sound and lighting for school plays. Ronald wasn't exactly friends with either girl, but had enough of a casual association with both to say hello in the school halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow disguised in the body of popular Rebecca Ward, Ronald skipped up to Edith and Penelope and greeted the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, guys!\u201d he chirped in Rebecca's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith and Penelope stopped dead in their tracks, staring long and hard at Ronald without speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope, a tall skinny girl with a pale complexion made worse by her choice of all black clothing, forced herself to smile politely and nod quietly at Ronald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith, a short chubby girl with thick glasses and hair dyed an unnatural neon green girl, stared with her jaw dropped wide for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you today, Li'l Miss Prom Queen?\u201d Edith asked. \u201cSince when do you deign to grace the dregs of high school society outcasts with your stylish presence?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope said nothing but quietly began to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald blushed with embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I'm sorry if I haven't been that nice to you in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cBut bygones are bygones, right? I just thought \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou? Thought?\u201d laughed Edith. \u201cThat's one for the history books, Penelope! Our pretty pink cheerleader princess here just had her <u>very first</u> thought. Stop the presses! Rebecca Ward's brain develops a thought \u2013 details during the 11 o'clock news.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I probably deserved that,\u201d admitted Ronald ruefully. Normally, he rather enjoyed chemistry class with Edith's caustic, biting sense of humor constantly aimed at the popular kids in class. This morning though, it was all directed right at him. \u201cBut now, I'm \u2026 uh \u2026 I'm turning over a new leaf and trying to be a new person. I'm sorry about everything that I've done in the past. I hope you and Penelope can forgive me. I assure you, I really am a changed ma- ... a changed girl. I'm a whole new person now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood for you,\u201d Penelope said quietly, still struggling not to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why you let a pack of hyperactive, color-blind, four year olds dress you this morning?\u201d asked Edith. \u201cSheesh, at least the old you had style \u2013 vapid, shallow, superficial style \u2026 but style nonetheless. What are you now: the Ugly Betty Barbie Doll? Ooo, I love your makeup Rebecca! Tell me: is it maybelline or lipstick by the Joker?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEdith, come on. Let's just go,\u201d giggled Penelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way,\u201d said Edith. \u201cThis Lindsey Lohan wannabe here has made our lives an absolutely miserable living hell since middle school. And now she suddenly has a change of heart and wants to play friendly? What happened \u2013 did your little bimbo friends all desert you, and now you have no one to be snooty and arrogant with? Or were you visited last night by the ghostly spirits of prom queens past, present, and future and given visions of why you must change your simpleminded, superficial ways? Is that why you want to play at this little game of Let's Patronize the Freaks and Geeks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about her,\u201d Penelope said, still struggling not to snort with uncontrollable laughter. \u201cWe like the new you, Rebecca. We <u>really</u> do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope now forcibly dragged her shorter friend away, leaving a stunned Ronald standing alone in the parking lot, scratching his head and wondering what he had done wrong. A brilliant but friendly nerd like himself in the body of a beautiful, popular girl \u2013 he should have the best of both worlds right now!</span></div></div>",

So, he decided to throw caution to the wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlyssa, would you like to come over to my house after school?\u201d he said. \u201cI think we could be pretty good friends.

Other than catching a few snide comments from Rebecca's meaner friends directed at his lack of fashion sense, the day seemed to progress remarkably well. Ronald was confident that he'd performed very well on a few tests he'd had to take in Rebecca's classes. She'd thank him later, he was sure, for helping raise her grades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, Ronald found Alyssa waiting for him at his new locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Rebecca!\u201d Alyssa said with a shy smile. \u201cDid you still want to hang out after school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d Ronald said with a bashful smile. Despite the fact that he was in the body of the hottest, most popular girl in school, Ronald still found himself attracted to the female gender. And there was something about this shy, unassuming new girl that Ronald found very attractive. If only he was still a guy, perhaps he'd try to work up the courage to ask her out even?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, who was he kidding. Ronald was a nervous basket-case around girls. He'd never asked out anyone on a date yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that Ronald <u>was</u> a girl, it felt like the pressure of was. He could relax and be himself around someone like Alyssa. It would be fun to actually get to know her. Maybe they could be best friends?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I've heard a lot about you,\u201d Alyssa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Ronald replied carefully. Tugging nervously at his skirt, he started to grow nervous. If Rebecca's reputation had preceded him, maybe a shy, smart girl like Alyssa would want nothing to do with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Everyone here knows you,\u201d Alyssa said, with a bit of reverent awe. \u201cI hear you're a cheerleader? And everyone loves the big parties you throw at your house. You've dated tons of really super cute guys. And all the really popular girls with the In Crowd here all claim to be your best friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don't know about all that \u2026\u201d Ronald said cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRebecca, don't get me wrong,\u201d Alyssa said. \u201cI'm very flattered that you're being so nice to me. And I really do have a good feeling about you. I think we could be good friends. But I just have to ask: you're not just pretending to be nice to me as some kind of prank or mean joke? I know it sounds crazy, but things like that have really happened to me before, at my old school. I'm accustomed to being a social outcast and a reclusive loner. Nobody like you has ever wanted to be my friend before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlyssa, I swear to you,\u201d Ronald said solemnly. \u201cI am not playing any jokes on you. I really want you and I to be friends. And as for my reputation \u2026 well, let's just say the other kids are probably exaggerating. I'm really not as popular as you might think. A lot of what you heard is old history. I'm a different person now from who I once was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you're still a cheerleader?\u201d Alyssa said, clearly impressed with Ronald's perceived social standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald had to reluctantly admit to himself that yes, as long as he inhabited Rebecca's body, he was in fact a cheerleader. Sooner or later he'd be wearing a tiny skirt and prancing around in front of crowds of screaming fans. It wasn't something he was particularly looking forward to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah, I'm a cheerleader,\u201d Ronald said. \u201cBut I'm a lot of other things, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I could never be a cheerleader,\u201d Alyssa said, a touch of hero-worship creeping into her voice. \u201cI'm so clumsy! I really envy you Rebecca. You've got the perfect life. You're awful pretty. And yet, you're such a nice girl. I think I'm actually going to enjoy living in this town.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It had still been less than 24 hours since Ronald and Rebecca's strange bodyswapping odyssey first began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Ronald was immediately disgusted by Rebecca's bedroom, decorated thoroughly in pinks and whites.

I really admire that about you. Everyone at school says you're the most fashionable trendsetter around. And I think you've done a fabulous job with your room. It's everything I wish my room was. You should see it: my bedroom is so bare and spartan. It's a lonely place. But your bedroom is happy and chipper and full of fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, thanks,\u201d Ronald slowly admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRebecca, do you think you could help me out?\u201d Alyssa suddenly said. \u201cI've never been popular or cool. And I know my fashion sense is horrible. Could you give me a makeover or something? Or at least some lessons on how to be one of the 'In Girls,' because I do so desperately want to fit in. I'm tired of being such an overlooked wallflower. Half the time, nobody notices me at school. And when they do notice me, it's only because they want to make fun of me. Can you help me, please?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh dear, thought Ronald. This was a job for the real Rebecca \u2013 not the clumsy, male, nerd imposter that he was. He might possess the body of the hottest, most popular girl in school, but he clearly possessed none of her sense of what was chic or in vogue. </span></div></div>",

Sure, he'd always known Edith had a mean streak to her sarcastic, biting sense of humor. But Ronald had always enjoyed being lab partners in chemistry class with the quirky, eccentric girl. Until today, she'd always seemed funny, friendly, and nice in a offbeat, kooky kind of way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ronald watched Edith and Penelope head towards the school's main entrance, he spied them encountering Jenna and Mindy \u2013 two popular girl flunkies of Rebecca Ward. The duo ranked just one notch below Rebecca herself in the school's pecking order and basically served as sycophantic lackeys to the teenage beauty queen whose body Ronald now inhabited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning Ronald watched with mixed emotions as Jenna surreptitiously slipped out her foot in front of Edith's path, causing the short, chubby girl to go crashing down into the hard pavement. As Edith picked herself up from the ground, now sporting a scraped knee and a purplish-yellow bruise on her thigh, Jenna and Mindy laughed themselves silly at the nerd girl's pain and humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald quietly approached the kerfuffle, hoping to overhear everything without being seen and getting drawn into the row. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, because physical violence is not only really mature, but it's hilarious too!\u201d Edith spat at Jenna. \u201cWhere'd you pick up your highly refined sense of sophisticated humor, Jenna? Was it watching reruns of <i>The Three Stooges</i> or just zoning out in front of old <i>Tom &amp; Jerry</i> cartoons?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, you dumb nerd,\u201d laughed Jenna, twirling a strand of her long, straight blond hair. \u201cYou're not only like weird, but fat and all nerdy too, and I don't know why you, like, dye your hair 'cuz you're totally not trendy and your hair is so ugh, so like why don't you just go build a model space ship with your loser Trekkie friends and stuff and don't even bother trying with hair and make up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d said Edith rolling her eyes. \u201cWas that bit of verbal diarrhea all just one single, gigantic run-on sentence?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEdith, come on,\u201d whispered Penelope nervously. \u201cLet's just go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Wait,\u201d insisted Edith. \u201cI want to hear more monosyllabic insults from this troglodytic trollop. Please, entertain us again with your rapier sharp wit, Jenna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d asked Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWit,\u201d said Edith slowly. \u201cIt means humor: banter, whimsy, badinage, drollery, satire, rapartee. Am I speaking your language yet, you neanderthal nitwit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm proud I don't speak <u>your</u> stupid nerd language!\u201d retorted Jenna. \u201cI don't need to understand you in order to know you're just a loser.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn't understand me again?\u201d replied Edith. \u201cI'm sorry. Neanderthal means Caveman. I guess you haven't heard the latest Katy Perry song:  'Paleoanthropology of the Late Pleistocene.' She explains all about the displacement of mousterian culture by the aurignacian, but in a pop song. Oh, it's very catchy! Or maybe a lower primate like yourself prefers the Justin Bieber cover, because I'm pretty sure he did a version of that song, too. I'll bet philistines like you and Mindy just <u>love</u> Justin Bieber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up you stupid loser!\u201d snapped Jenna. \u201cGawd Edith, you're such a bitch just cuz you're jealous of us for being popular, and having boyfriends, and being on the cheerleader squad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes!\u201d beamed Edith sarcastically. \u201cI'm secretly dying to trade away my ability to do long division in exchange for a polyester skirt riding up my thigh. Because you're so right: my life would just be pure bliss if only I could be an illiterate icon of ignorance and indiscriminate promiscuity \u2026 just like you, Mindy, and that vapid Paris Hilton imposter you both slavishly take orders from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear to god, I'm going to kick your ass you stupid fat nerd freak!\u201d growled Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d Edith said calmly. \u201cAnd your threat of brute violence makes a clever rejoinder to my comparing you to a primitive, prehistoric dullard because why \u2026 ?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Trapped under the heavy, blubbery weight of Ronald's chubby out of shape body, Rebecca had worked up quite a sweat in her rush to get to school. Thick, wet armpit stains dripped down the sides of her size XXL t-shirt \u2013 a faded yellow garment with the words \u201cParticle Physics gives me a hadron\u201d spread out across the front in yellow print. Rebecca didn't get the joke, but the shirt was one of the only clean looking things she could find to wear in Ronald's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing her glasses back up the sides of her greasy, oily nose, Rebecca spotted her old body in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no, she thought. It looked like Ronald was talking to those two obnoxious weird girls: Penelope and Edith. Please don't spoil my reputation by hanging with the likes of them, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca hurried up, waddling as fast as her clumsy, corpulent body could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached her old body, Rebecca could see the weird geek girls disengaging with disgust from discussion with her old body and now walking straight towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Ronald!\u201d Penelope said warmly, while batting her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh dear god, Rebecca thought with horror. This beanpole goth wannabe has a crush on me now! Ewww.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d Rebecca muttered back in reply, still focused on reaching Ronald in her old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou checking out the queen of mean?\u201d laughed Edith, gesturing backwards at Ronald in Rebecca's body. \u201cThe princess of pain, duchess of depravity, our demonic La Belle Dame sans Merci?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d said Rebecca. She didn't get what Edith was saying, but she knew it wasn't complimentary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecky Ward turned over a new leaf,\u201d explained Penelope, still blushing and giggling when she spoke to Rebecca in Ronald's body. \u201cThat's why she's dressed like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca burned with rage gazing at the mismatched array of clothing Ronald had clad her beautiful body in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRebecca's wardrobe comes courtesy of Goodwill and the K-Mart Corporation,\u201d said Edith in a dramatic stage whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll kill him,\u201d hissed Rebecca angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope grinned with delight, and Edith actually giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're going to murder the president of the society for the historical reenactment of the movie Clueless?\u201d gasped Edith in mock horror. \u201cBetter get in line, Ronald. Half the school wants to see that promiscuous tart get finally get her comeuppance. The day she dies the murder suspects will include every girl who lost a boyfriend to her, the pallbearers will be comprised of the entire football team, and the coffin will have to be shaped like the letter Y.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope burst into snorts of laughter. Rebecca frowned, still not getting it yet recognizing she was the butt of the joke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't let her get under you skin, Ronald,\u201d said Edith. \u201cIn a few short years, we'll all be college graduates and poor little Rebecca Ward will be spritzing perfume in the cosmetics aisle of some discount department store, slaving away for minimum wage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca fumed silently in Ronald's bloated, sweaty body.  Furious, she stomped away from the nerd girls and went to confront the slimy toad currently ruining her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, good morning,\u201d Ronald said to her with a weak smile. He tugged nervously at the fabric of his long, pink skirt. \u201cI see you, uh, got to school all right today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell did you do to my body?\u201d demanded Rebecca. \u201cHow can you go out in public dressed like that? Even the nerdettes are making fun of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Ronald said glumly, staring down awkwardly at his new breasts. \u201cI really tried hard to be nice to them. Usually I get along okay with Edith and Penelope, but today \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen you stupid, fat blob of grease,\u201d Rebecca said, shaking her own chubby finger at the thin, beautiful body that once belonged to her. \u201cAs long as you're me, you are NOT friends with those two lame misfits! And another thing: after school today, I'm going home with you and I'm going to hand select your outfits for the rest of the week. Plus, I'm laying down some other laws. No going outside without makeup \u2013 and that nasty lipstick stain ring around your mouth right now does not count as a makeup, by the way. And you're learning how to style hair tonight, too. No arguments!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute, Rebecca,\u201d interrupted Ronald. \u201cI'm doing the best I can, and \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't call me 'Rebecca' any more, you slimy toad,\u201d hissed Rebecca with an angry whisper. \u201cYou're Rebecca Ward now. Geesh! Start acting like it. You've got a reputation to maintain. You can't go around acting like a happy, dumb nerd boy anymore. Get a clue!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d said Ronald, frowning and trying to collect his thoughts. Everything he'd done this morning had turned out wrong. Maybe he should start following Rebecca's advice. \u201cYou're Ronald and I'm Rebecca. I promise I'll try to behave more like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d snapped Rebecca. \u201cNow your locker is # 327. I wrote down the combination for you on this scrap of paper. Here's your class schedule too. Don't be a brainiac in class! You're me now, okay? So just sit quiet, look bored, and if a teacher asks you anything just say, 'I don't know.' But don't be a nerd in my body, please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll try,\u201d said Ronald. \u201cThanks for all this. I guess I should write down your locker number, combination, and class schedule too. That was very thoughtful of Reb- \u2026 I mean, Ronald.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't be nice,\u201d hissed Rebecca. \u201cThis isn't second grade Sunday School. You don't have to say please and thank you all the time. Sheesh! Act like I would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d said Ronald thoughtfully. \u201cMaybe we shouldn't be talking. I probably shouldn't be seen associating with you, uh, 'Ronald.' I hope you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's the first smart thing you've done yet,\u201d grumbled Rebecca. \u201cI'll see you after school. Don't forget: you're Rebecca Ward now.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Glancing down at his schedule, he saw the first class of the day would be Remedial General Science. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald groaned. He was a science whiz! He should be in Intermediate Chemistry this year, not Remedial General Science. And as per Rebecca's orders, he was supposed to sit quietly in glance and pretend to be a brain-dead bimbo. The indignity of it all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, girlfriend!\u201d chirped a friendly voice from the locker on the left. \u201cRebecca, you look terrible. What's wrong, girlfriend? Do you need to talk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald looked up and lost his breath gazing closely into the sweet, soulful eyes of Emily Butler. Her soft brown eyes showed genuine care and concern as she smiled sympathetically at Ronald. Standing so close to Emily, Ronald was intoxicated by the ambrosial fragrance of her perfume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm, uh, I'm just not myself today,\u201d Ronald stuttered, clumsily dropping his book bag and spilling textbooks all over the floor of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me help,\u201d Emily said supportively. \u201cWhat's going on, girlfriend? Your hair is a mess, your clothes are all yuck, and your makeup \u2026 uh \u2026 the less said about that, the better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm just not me right now,\u201d Ronald repeated, feeling apprehensive and twitchy being in such close proximity to one of Rebecca's beautiful best friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRebecca, you can't go to class looking like this,\u201d Emily said, bending over and whispering in Ronald's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of her warm breath in his ear and on the side of his neck sent shivers of delight down Ronald's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's skip class,\u201d Emily suggested. \u201cI'll give you a total makeover, and you can tell me all your troubles. Unburden yourself, girlfriend! What are BFFs for, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald had never skipped class in his life. In fact, he'd never even stayed home from school while genuinely ill before. His attendance record was spotlessly perfect \u2026 up until this point in time. And he had to admit, it was very seductive, the thought of cutting class to spend some close, intimate time with a beautiful girl who wanted to run her fingers through his hair and touch his face and body (even if all Emily was interested in was primping and beautifying Ronald).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd maybe Ronald even could unburden himself to Emily? The real Rebecca was proving to be mean, nasty, and downright unpleasant about their current role reversal. Emily on the other hand seemed warm and sympathetic. Perhaps Ronald could explain what had happened? Maybe Emily would even have an idea to help switch Ronald and Rebecca back to normal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald fidgeted silently, staring at the glossy polish on the tips of his fingernails. Should he skip school and go with Emily \u2026 or should he scamper off to class like a good, responsible student?</span></div></div>",

I'm really proud of you, sweetie. You clean up so nicely when you want to. Maybe you'll be asking a girl out on a date today at school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca tried not to burst out laughing at the thought of fat, nerdy, shy Ronald Dwebble asking out a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy little man is growing up,\u201d said Ronald's mother. \u201cI'm sorry to embarrass you, honey.

She still thought the overweight, social recluse was an ugly, pathetic geek. But at the same time, Rebecca was now starting to see first-hand some of the silent, hidden pain Ronald must live with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no fun being him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing Ronald's heavy book bag, Rebecca heaved a sigh and began trudging out the door. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the way to math class, Rebecca found her mind wandering as she plodded through the school hallways with Ronald's chubby, clumsy body. Although she'd never in a million years admit it, she was actually enjoying checking out all the pretty girls at school. Most of these were girls she'd been friends with just yesterday. Now she found them attractive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing and shaking her head to clear these alien thoughts from her mind, Rebecca failed to notice Jeff Harris, one of the popular jocks at school, sneak up from behind. Without warning, Jeff put his foot out in front of Rebecca's path causing her to tumble head over heels, splatting face first into the hard tile floor of the school hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful there, fat ass!\u201d laughed Jeff, kicking Rebecca in her over-sized behind. \u201cYou're such a loser, Dwebble. Can't you even walk down the hall without embarrassing yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff laughed, kicked Rebecca once more, and sauntered away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all Rebecca could do to restrain herself from bursting out into tears. She'd dated Jess Harris a couple of times, and always thought he was just a handsome, nice, friendly person. Now that she had been transformed into a fat, male nerd though, the popular school athlete had nothing but scorn and ridicule for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScooping up her books, Rebecca quickly hurried off into math class, managing to get into Ronald's seat just seconds before the bell rang. The teacher, a white haired old spinster ironically named Miss Young, was just passing out exams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit, thought Rebecca. There is absolutely <u>no way</u> she was going to be able to pass a test in Ronald Dwebble's advanced math class! She wasn't a nerd like him. This was the last thing she needed today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, Rebecca sighed and started in on the exam, figuring she had no real alternative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gazed at the first question: Find a polynomial with integer coefficients that has the following zeros:<i> - 1/3, 2, 3 + i.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiece of cake, she thought, quickly scribbling down the correct answer. Must be a fluke or something. Maybe Miss Young threw in that one just to give everyone an easy question to start off with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext question: Factor <i>f(x) = x<sup>3</sup> + 2x<sup>2</sup> + 14x</i> completely over the complex numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, no sweat! Rebecca had the problem solved in her head almost faster than she could write it down on paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next? Find all vertical and horizontal asymptotes for the graph of the following function and then graph the function \u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, Rebecca had whizzed her way through the entire six-page test, confident she had easily earned an A if not an A+ on the exam. And on top of it all, she still had another fifteen minutes left before the bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first person in class to complete the test, she handed her paper into Miss Young, then took her seat again and started daydreaming about cute girls. Maybe it was a good thing she'd asked out Penelope earlier. She was sorta cute, thought Rebecca. And more importantly, Penelope was smart and the two of them shared so many interests. </span></div></div>",

I won't mess with you and your friend again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith neither words nor fanfare, Karl simply released Jeff and then walked over to help Rebecca to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other students in the hall erupted into a chorus of cheers and applause as Jeff cravenly beat a hasty retreat down the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you all right, Ronald?\u201d asked Karl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I think I'm fine,\u201d Rebecca said, dusting herself off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis strange new kid has a lot of guts, she thought. He doesn't look that strong or tough, but clearly he works out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feminine part of Rebecca was powerfully attracted to Karl now, in a romantic hero worship kind of way.

She had changed clothes and was now wearing a dark burgundy dress and a pair of matching flats. Her long, limp hair had actually been done up about the back of her head and neck in an attractive, sweeping style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of Rebecca thought, what a geek! This is obviously her first date <u>ever</u>, and I've been on like dozens of dates with dozens of guys way hotter than Ronald Dwebble. What a pathetic loser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a different part of Rebecca's mind was going through a metamorphosis \u2026 not exactly part of the magical transformation that had resulted in her disgusting, fat, male body. Rather it was more of a transformation of personal growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the one day Rebecca had spent struggling to live the lonely life of a social outcast in high school was already teaching her something about sympathy for others \u2026 and something about empathy for a sad little lonely geek girl who'd never been asked out on a date before, and now stood here nervously worrying and dreaming about how her very first date would go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca had the power to be a selfish jerk here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rebecca also had the power to do something truly selfless. She could go on this date with Penelope and try to make the poor girl's first ever date a memorable, magical experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for the first time in her life, Rebecca thought doing something nice for someone else \u2013 with no expectation of reward \u2013 was the right thing to do. Rebecca Ward, the Ice Princess, felt her heart melt with pity and affection for this poor girl's hopes and dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't believe I'm really going to do this,\u201d she whispered to herself, as she approached her blushing, fidgety date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Ronald!\u201d beamed Penelope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor girl was practically bursting at the seams with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPenelope, you look beautiful,\u201d Rebecca said, taking Penelope's right hand and gently kissing it. \u201cI've really been looking forward to seeing you all day. Let's go somewhere nice. I thought dinner and a movie, followed by a walk in the park at sunset. I promise, it'll be a good restaurant though. Nothing cheap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, anything is fine!\u201d giggled Penelope. Her face was shining with radiant delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca smiled, feeling a bit of enjoyment at bringing a ray of light into this girl's normally dim and dull world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. We need to go someplace special,\u201d said Rebecca. \u201cAfter all, you're a very special person to me, Penelope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope gazed with adoration in Rebecca's eyes. The girl was blinking rapidly, struggling not to cry tears of joy over how romantic and gentlemanly her secret crush was behaving.</span></div></div>",

But without even consciously thinking about it, she'd managed to dress Ronald's body in much more fashionable, trendy style than his ordinary messy, sloppy manner. That was a good thing, at least. It turned out Ronald cleaned up pretty nicely. Sure, he could drop a couple pounds. But nobody was perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the thing that looked wrong now in Rebecca's new reflected image was her body language. She could tell that she was still carrying herself with her old characteristic dainty, petite mannerisms. The result was that Ronald in the mirror looked like something of a metrosexual \u2013 neat, tidy, and clean with all the subtle gestures and posture of a homosexual man (or, in Rebecca's case, a heterosexual teenage girl).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGawd, I hate this,\u201d pouted Rebecca, grimacing in frustration at the mirror. \u201cI miss being a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the moment, she was firmly stuck with the reality of the situation: she was Ronald Dwebble and he was Rebecca Ward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd nothing Rebecca could think of would change that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully Ronald was right when he intimated there was some way for them to undo this transformation. In the meantime, all that Rebecca could do was leave it in the capable hands (and brain) of Ronald. He might be a social outcast and loser supreme, but he was smart. If anyone could think up the means to reverse a body swap, it would be Ronald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying her best to resist the subconscious urge to mince and move femininely, Rebecca hefted Ronald's heavy book bag and began the long trek to school.</span></div></div>",

He was simply a caretaker for her body. Ronald resolved to keep a low profile and strive to simply blend in with the crowd at school. That should be the safest course of action. <br>\r\nWhile bashfully averting his eyes, Ronald stripped out of the skimpy negligee and panties Rebecca had worn to bed last night. He then groped about in her underwear drawer (a prospect that normally would both aroused and embarrassed him) before pulling out a pair of lime green cotton granny panties from the far back of the drawer. These would be the best to wear, he thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the panties up onto his smooth, soft legs, Ronald tugged to get them properly fitted to cover his large, curvy, round hips and behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Ronald pulled out a random bra from Rebecca's dresser. He wasn't sure it was important to match the bra with the panties, but figured such things were fairly trivial. He struggled for a few moments with the stiff, lacy purple garment, but finally managed to get it securely fitted over his firm, perky breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's weird, thought Ronald gazing down at his feminine chest. He'd always thought the role of a bra was to restrain and secure a woman's breasts. And yet with the bra on, Ronald's new female assets seemed even bigger and more jiggle than before. Somehow this garment was padded or something to enhance the size of Ronald's boobs and even make his cleavage more pronounced than ever. He had to admit, it was a pleasing sight \u2013 one that would have pleased him far more had he still been a teenage boy! But he now felt himself hoping Rebecca wouldn't be angry with him for choosing a bra that drew too much attention to her former breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClearly, there's a lot I still need to learn about women and their clothing,\u201d Ronald said aloud to himself.<br>\r\nStill bashfully worrying and fretting over his breasts, Ronald opted to dress himself in modest, reserved clothing. As a boy, Ronald had been a simple t-shirts and jeans kind of guy. So he dug through Rebecca's clothes hoping to find something similar. He managed to find a plain, light gray t-shirt made of some soft, girlish fabric. He put it on, but chose not to pair it with jeans. Everything Rebecca owned seemed too tight and revealing \u2013 skinny jeans, joggings, leggings, and super short shorts.<br>\r\nExasperated, Ronald finally gave up and put on the longest skirt he could find in Rebecca's closet: a dark pink garment that came down to mid-calf on his new body. <br>\r\nThe skirt left him feeling cold, drafty, and exposed around the legs though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Ronald found a pair of opaque, hot pink tights and worked them up onto his feet and legs. He then found a pair of black and white, Converse Chuck Taylors and put them on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood enough,\u201d Ronald said to himself, finally checking out his reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in the mirror, however, looked all wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I not doing right?\u201d Ronald wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed a pink, button down cardigan sweater and slid his arms into it. Did that help? Not really. Maybe he needed to do something with his hair? Ronald hurriedly brushed his long, golden blonde locks, slicked it all straight back, and tied it into a loosely limp ponytail. Still not right! Maybe he needed makeup? Girls like Rebecca were always wearing makeup. Timidly, Ronald reached for a random tube of lipstick and began smearing his lips with a coat of bright, bold, ruby red gloss. Again, back to the mirror \u2013 again, still not right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I give up!\u201d Ronald said in exasperation. \u201cThis will just have to be close enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald made sure to grab Rebecca's school bag full of books before heading out the door. He definitely didn't want to embarrass her by forgetting to bring her homework or study materials for class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Ronald himself, Rebecca owned her own car \u2013 a sporty little red convertible. So while Rebecca was trudging to school on foot in Ronald's body right now, Ronald got to enjoy the new experience of driving himself to school. He made absolutely certain not to speed or do anything foolish. He didn't want Rebecca getting a ticket.<br>\r\nArriving at the high school's parking lot, Ronald got out of the car and had to adjust his tights and skirt a bit, in a most unladylike fashion. At the other end of the parking lot, Ronald spotted two other teens \u2013 a pair of social misfits named Edith and Penelope. As a guy, Ronald had enjoyed a passing acquaintance with the two. He was lab partners with Edith again this year, and he and Penelope were in the audiovisual club together and had done some behind-the-scenes tech work on sound and lighting for school plays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald wasn't exactly friends with either girl, but had enough of a casual association with both to say hello in the school halls.<br>\r\nNow disguised in the body of popular Rebecca Ward, Ronald skipped up to Edith and Penelope and greeted the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, guys!\u201d he chirped in Rebecca's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith and Penelope stopped dead in their tracks, staring long and hard at Ronald without speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope, a tall skinny girl with a pale complexion made worse by her choice of all black clothing, forced herself to smile politely and nod quietly at Ronald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith, a short chubby girl with thick glasses and hair dyed an unnatural neon green girl, stared with her jaw dropped wide for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you today, Li'l Miss Prom Queen?\u201d Edith asked. \u201cSince when do you deign to grace the dregs of high school society outcasts with your stylish presence?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope said nothing but quietly began to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonald blushed with embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I'm sorry if I haven't been that nice to you in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cBut bygones are bygones, right? I just thought \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou? Thought?\u201d laughed Edith. \u201cThat's one for the history books, Penelope! Our pretty pink cheerleader princess here just had her very first thought. Stop the presses! Rebecca Ward's brain develops a thought \u2013 details during the 11 o'clock news.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I probably deserved that,\u201d admitted Ronald ruefully. Normally, he rather enjoyed chemistry class with Edith's caustic, biting sense of humor constantly aimed at the popular kids in class. This morning though, it was all directed right at him. \u201cBut now, I'm \u2026 uh \u2026 I'm turning over a new leaf and trying to be a new person. I'm sorry about everything that I've done in the past. I hope you and Penelope can forgive me. I assure you, I really am a changed ma- ... a changed girl. I'm a whole new person now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood for you,\u201d Penelope said quietly, still struggling not to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why you let a pack of hyperactive, color-blind, four year olds dress you this morning?\u201d asked Edith. \u201cSheesh, at least the old you had style \u2013 vapid, shallow, superficial style \u2026 but style nonetheless. What are you now: the Ugly Betty Barbie Doll? Ooo, I love your makeup Rebecca! Tell me: is it maybelline or lipstick by the Joker?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEdith, come on. Let's just go,\u201d giggled Penelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way,\u201d said Edith. \u201cThis Lindsey Lohan wannabe here has made our lives an absolutely miserable living hell since middle school. And now she suddenly has a change of heart and wants to play friendly? What happened \u2013 did your little bimbo friends all desert you, and now you have no one to be snooty and arrogant with? Or were you visited last night by the ghostly spirits of prom queens past, present, and future and given visions of why you must change your simpleminded, superficial ways? Is that why you want to play at this little game of Let's Patronize the Freaks and Geeks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about her,\u201d Penelope said, still struggling not to snort with uncontrollable laughter. \u201cWe like the new you, Rebecca. We really do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope now forcibly dragged her shorter friend away, leaving a stunned Ronald standing alone in the parking lot, scratching his head and wondering what he had done wrong. A brilliant but friendly nerd like himself in the body of a beautiful, popular girl \u2013 he should have the best of both worlds right now!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rebecca had an own car. Even being in a poor family his parents had made it able for him to get a driver\u2019s license. So Ronald had a license but no car. So this has changed for the better now and he was driving in his new car to school\u2026.<br>\r\nArriving there he entered the girl\u2019s locker room in excitement. For the start he sat on a bench and watched all the girls getting naked: Most of them were skinny like he is now!

He especially hated the teachers because they had all the power. While at his desk, he started to drift in and out of consciousness until he finally blacked out. Unbeknownst to him, a figure is going to give him the power he desired by making him one of his teachers by swapping his body and life with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly wake up. He felt like he was sitting in a chair and not a bed. He was able to look around and see bright light and a classroom that looks like the  photography teachers room. \"Why the fuck am I at school?\" He thinks to himself . Long brown strands of hair fall in front of his  eyes. \"Ooph. What was that feeling?\" He thought as a kicking sensation just hit his bladder. He  notices  that he  was now sitting at Mrs. Alvarez desk in her classroom. He looked at the clock on the wall. \"Its 2:30. School just let out 5 minutes ago.\" He realized. \"Wait isnt Mrs. Alvarez.... Oh Shit!\" <br>\r\nHe looked down and were shocked at what he saw. He  saw two swollen and milk filled presumably DD cup boobs hanging of his chest, and they were laying on top of a big pregnant belly. He remembered that she said that she was about 18 weeks pregnant on the first day of the year. She was about 34 weeks along last week. He was now in the body of  the pregnant photo teacher. The 32 year old, 34 week pregnant photography teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a hard time getting up with alll of the weight in the front. He was not used to a heavy pregnant belly. His feet were swollen. He gets a good look at his new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[URL=http://s1175.photobucket.com/user/bfine2525/media/Pregnant/20160125_121 450-ANIMATION_zps5is2ao7f.gif.html][IMG]<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i1175.photobucket.com/albums/r625/bfine2525/Pregnant/20160125_121450-ANIMATION_zps5is2ao7f.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://i1175.photobucket.com/albums/r625...</a>[/IMG][/URL]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waddled down to the bathroom because of the constant kicks to the bladder. The thought of having to actually give birth in a few weeos scared him considering that he was now in his pregnant photography teachers body. This body felt so different compared to his skinny 15 year old body. He had to endure his first awkward experience going to the bathroom but was able to almost naturally remember how to go to the bathroom as a 32 year old pregnant woman. He was able to get another good look at the brand new body that he was forced into for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[URL=http://s1175.photobucket.com/user/bfine2525/media/Pregnant/20160125_123 0440_zpslyj6bauq.jpg.html][IMG]<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i1175.photobucket.com/albums/r625/bfine2525/Pregnant/20160125_1230440_zpslyj6bauq.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i1175.photobucket.com/albums/r625...</a>[/IMG][/URL]<br>\r\nChristian waddled back slowly, because of his new pregnant belly. He was still not used to being a pregnant woman. The feelings were so foreign to him. The constant kicking, the extra weight in the front on the small dainty frame, the not having his male part anymore. He got back to her desk and sat down very carefully because he was afraid he would hurt whatever is inside this mountain of a belly. He naturally puts his hand on his belly and begins to rub it pretty good. He snapped out of the trance and realized that Mrs. Alvarez must have a car and be able to drive here somehow. The thought of that made him try to get up slowly from the comfortable chair. He was slowly but surely able to get up from the chair and rest one hand on his big belly. He searched around and found Mrs. Alvarez purse. She had keys in it and he took them out and waddled slowy out of the classroom and out of the building. He had to stop for a second because of a very forceful kick from inside. She was able to get out and waddled towards the only car left in the high school parking lot. It was a pretty nice car that did not look like something a normal art teacher could afford. She got in and had to move the seat back a bit in order for her to reach the pedal because of the belly. Memories kicked in due to the permanentness od the spell that his mom had cast on him when he was suddenly put into Mrs. Alvarez pregnant body and life as a teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drives to a house that she suddenly remebers even though \"Miles\" has no clue. She arrives at Mrs. Alvarez or rather her house that she will have to live in because of the whole body swap situation. She gets out of the car nd waddles into the family style house. Most of Mrs. Alvarez life memories are coming back, having twin brothers, getting a teaching degree for art and photography, meeting her husband Dan, getting married, and finally getting pregnant, and now is 34 weeks pregnant with a baby girl that she has not decided a name on yet. She waddles in to what looks like a living room and set her stuff down. She then sits down and puts her feet on the couch and slowly but surely takes a nap<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristian slowly starts to wake up. He thinks that the whole being Mrs. Alvarez was all a very realistic and strange dream. He couldnt really have switched his slim and newly 16 year old body and life with Mrs. Alvarez 32 year old, 34 week pregnant body and life as a high school art teacher. \"Wait how did I know that she was 34 weeks pregnant?\" He thought to himself as he slowly opened his eyes. He was looking up as he was laying on a couch of some sort with a blanket laying on top of him. He noticed that where he was looked nothing like his house. It just seemed too modern for his family. He again felt a similar kick to the bladder \" Oh no. Please tell me I am not her still. I dont want to be a pregnant woman.\" Long brown strands of hair fell in his face again. He finally pulled of the blanket and saw what he ultimately dreaded. He was still in Mrs. Alvarez's body and he was in her house now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled to get up and had to use the couch for support. He waddled into the kitchen to look for somwthing to eat because the baby in his or rather her belly kept kicking and her stomach growled. She made her self the weirdest of snakc because of cravings. She remembered that she had already gained 40 pounds because of the pregnancy. She looked at her belly and said, \"Man, you sure make your mamma pack on the pounds.\" She giggled at herself and somehow forgot about formely being a 16 year old kid and her new life as Mrs Alvarez kicked in to her subconscious.</span></div></div>",

Unbeknownst to him an unknown figure heard him and decided to put him in the body of an obese woman to show him thr struggles. Jason went home because of a massive headache and passed out on his bed. He blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason slowly woke up. The room looked completley different as he saw a ton of refrigerators. He was laying in a gigantic bed. Long black strands fell in front of his eyes. He tried to lift himself off of the bed but instantly fell backward as he felt a ton of weight on his body. He was just barely able to lift his much heavier arm and was shocked when he pulled off the covers. He saw two gigantic boobs sag nearly to the mountain of fat that was his stomach.

Okay, so he hadn't gotten the best grades in math last year, but he never thought he'd be put in an extra help class with Georgia Willis!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Georgia Willis was a girl in Dan's school with down syndrome. People always told him it was mean that he hated her, but he didn't care. They didn't have classes with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Retard bitch,\" Dan muttered, and nearly jumped out of his skin when somebody behind him said, \"What did you just say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Dan turned around. Standing behind him was Mrs. Corter, his math teacher. She was a strict old lady who hated Dan and loved Georgia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I- I didn't say anything,\" Dan exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Don't lie to me! I heard what you said!\" shouted Mrs. Corter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It-it won't happen again!\" Dan pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I don't believe you. Your problem, Daniel, is that you can't see through the eyes of others. You don't know what it's like to be Georgia and face what she faces every day. I'm about to change that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Suddenly, everything went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   *****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Dan woke up in a cold sweat. A dream, it was just a dream. Anyway, there was only a week left in the school year and then Dan would never have to deal with Georgia Willis again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Climbing out of bed, something felt wrong, but he didn't know what. He didn't figure out what it was until seeing himself in the mirror. He almost screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121024053033/americanhorrorstory/images/thumb/f/f5/Addie.png/210px-Addie.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Why was he in Georgia's body? He looked around. It seemed like he was in a child's room. Why was he in her room?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It wasn't a dream, he realized, it was a reality. Somehow, Mrs. Corter had put him in the body of Georgia!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Probably with a friend. It was the same fight they had gotten into a million times, Lana wanted to go out, to some function with her office colleagues, and Jackson wanted to stay in that night. When he finally relented, he was mad that they were going to be late because she was taking forever getting ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You just don't understand how hard it is to be a woman!\" Lana shouted. \"I can't just throw on an old shirt with a stain on it and just go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Complain, complain, complain is all you do! It can't be that hard!\" Jackson shouted back.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThe fight went on, they said some things they'd both regret, and she was gone. But this morning, Jackson's doorbell had rung.

He tried calling Lana, but no answer, same as it was for the last few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he mused, he almost didn't notice himself pick up one of the shoes again and start to slip it onto his foot.

He quickly put the other heel onto his other foot. He wiggled his toes, which tingled as the shoes snugly encased his feet. \"Okay, that's enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to take off the shoe, but found that it was stuck to his foot.

He looked around his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was a light lavender, and the pillows and sheets on the bed matched. The room had a bed, a dresser with a TV sitting on top of it, and a small pile of DVDs, a closet, and a vanity with a mirror. Jackson looked down at his body, noticing that it was much smaller, and he was wearing a black nightgown. Not only that, but he had breasts, which he grabbed at, before grabbing at his crotch, finding that part of his anatomy had been replaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no!\" he sighed as he put his hands over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fingernails were longer and had a french tip design, and his toes were perfectly pedicured and matched the design of his fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson walked over to the vanity and looked into the mirror, seeing a blonde woman. She didn't look like him, and definitely didn't look like Lana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who am I?\" Jackson asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door to the room was thrown open and another woman, looking similar in age to whoever Jackson was now, poked her head in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! We're gonna be late!\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Late?\" Jackson asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he started thinking about who this woman was or what was going on, his mind was suddenly flooded with memories.

For sure this wasn\u2019t his room. He even realized that it was not his house! So it was not his hair, not his voice and not his bedroom\u2026.<br>\r\nHe inspected the room more closer and found that the wands were not white but had a kind of light lavender color\u2026. Not bad but definitely not his style!<br>\r\nThe room had a table with a computer on it and some what you would call vanity table\u2026.<br>\r\nShocked Jackson looked at his body and found out that he was wearing a black nightie, omg\u2026<br>\r\nHe found that he had breasts and grabbing between his legs, he found nothing what could be considered as male there\u2026.<br>\r\n\u201cno please not this\u201d His fingernails were nicely done and Jackson took the risk to use the mirror of the vanity table to get confirmation what was already obvious he somehow became a girl! A blonde young woman of maybe 16 looked back at him!<br>\r\n\u201cWho I am?\u201d was the question of the moment. The unanswered question so far.<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opened and a woman of maybe 40+ came in and told Jackson to speed up, it is time for school.<br>\r\nSchool, oh no, Jackson somehow turned into a school girl overnight\u2026.<br>\r\nHe had to realize that he was Sandra now, a cheerleader and school girl from the neighborhood\u2026<br>\r\nDamn, how and why this is happening?<br>\r\nJackson must find it out and maybe he can contact Lana\u2026<br>\r\nBut Sandra\u2019s mother was pushing her into\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
