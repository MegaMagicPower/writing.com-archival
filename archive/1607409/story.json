He was dressed in a pair of running shorts, a sweat-stained T-shirt and his extremely well-worn sneakers. He had just finished a rough practice with the lacrosse team he coached for the college. Not so many years ago, he had been the star of the same school's lacrosse team. After he got a degree and graduated, his old coach accepted a new job and the school was more than happy to hire a former star player as the new coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge, who stood six foot and four inches, looked around the lab, which was evidently empty, except for a strange machine surrounded by a clutter of parts and tools. The entire setting looked like a process interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had texted ahead to inform his brother he wanted to stop by to take him out to eat. Although they were far different in looks and temperament, they had a good relationship. George had even helped pull strings to get Henry the post as a graduate research assistant. They hadn't seen each other in about a week. During a brief phone call, Henry had said he had made an amazing discovery that he would be ready to share soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge looked around, somewhat irritated, to find the lab empty with no sign of his brother. While he waited, he moved closer to the confusing assembly of cables, wires and other equipment that trailed toward a complex control panel. From the ceiling near the center of the room descended a strange-looking dome. Some exposed wires and cables dangled from the dome, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured it was better that his brother had the brains. Looking around at the confusing mess, he realized he wouldn't know where to begin to assemble whatever the strange device might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he continued to wait, he noticed something tiny and pale scurrying among some of the haphazardly discarded tools. He walked closer and reached for a screwdriver, which the tiny creature had sprinted toward to avoid his approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he picked up the screwdriver, however, he no longer saw the strange little bug. He stretched out his hand and put the tool down on a nearby table, failing to see the tiny form that dropped from the screwdriver and fell to the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided he had waited long enough and pulled out his phone to call his brother. Somewhere nearby, but totally unheard by George, a phone rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not a soul knew that he had found Dr. Eric Braysen's amazing experiment, namely a fully functional shrink ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had told George that he was close to a real breakthrough, but he had never shared the nature of the experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry found it difficult to discuss because the capacity of the machine greatly excited him. He had always been fascinated with size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the reasons came flooding back to him. Although the giant above him was his own brother, he forgot that and just lost himself in the size and power of the huge creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand dropped down to his crotch. But, before he got started, he heard a phone ring. His phone, which apparently had been shrunk along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The shadow from the huge shoe could have eclipsed a city block. The shadow slowly extended across the floor toward George's bug-sized sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry turned and fled from the ominous shadow, racing as fast as his legs, now no thicker than a piece of thread, could carry him. His recently exploded cock still leaked the last of the cum from the orgasm he had achieved comparing himself to the unbelievable change in scale between himself and his older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the shoe dropped back onto the floor, Henry heard the thunderous impact only an instant before the shockwave of displaced air ripped into him. The shrunken man screamed like a banshee as he was tossed like a piece of flotsam across the tiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge grunted in aggravation having missed the scurrying insect. He had lost sight of and interest in the insect. He continued walking toward the door of his brother's lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Henry tried to stand, but his head spun. He sank back into a crouching position and screamed hoarsely. \"George, don't go!\" Henry pleaded. \"I need help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brother opened the door and exited. Henry defied the dizziness from his near miss and ran across the floor, only to watch as the monolithic door settled into its frame with a thunderous crash. In despair, he came to a halt, gazing up at the impossible door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was alone, smaller than a bug, and lost on the floor of his laboratory. He had only himself to blame. He had let himself get detoured by the overwhelming experience of jerking off in the presence of a titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he needed to get serious and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
