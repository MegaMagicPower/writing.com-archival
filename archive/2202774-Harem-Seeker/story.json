            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tEventually, after some thought, he decided to claim the ladies of Ranma 1/2 as his.  Putting on an open vest, sweatpants, and some boots, he went to work.  He flicked through the multiverse like it was a cell phone, deciding on a world that was almost completely canon, save for one or two extremely minor decisions that allowed it to deviate from the Prime reality.  He decended down into the world, landing in the middle of Nerima.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn the middle of a battle, apparently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Get back here with those panties, ya pervert!\" screamed a voice.  The villain looked, and smiled when he saw Ranma Saotome, in girl form, chasing Happosai around, the latter carrying a bag of underwear.  Not far behind Ranma, in a rare show of unity, was Akane Tendo, Ukyo Kuonji, the Chinese Amazon Shampoo, and Kodachi Kuno, all of them blushing and visibly furious with the little pervert.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain took the time to admire each lady.  Ranma herself was gorgeous, and up close he could see what Tatewaki Kuno always called her a tigress.  Her muscular body moved like flowing as she leaped around after Happosai.  Plus, her breasts were wonderful, bouncing free of a bra as she ran after the old pervert.  Akane wasn't as graceful as the others, but she had a stout strength, with amazing abs.  Shampoo was as buxom as Ranma, with an ample posterior as well.  Ukyo was looking more buxom than usual, the villain realizing, to his delight, that she bound her breasts.  And Kodachi, despite her laugh, had a curvy gymnast's body, fluid and gorgeous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked forward to breeding all five women.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe started out simply, reaching out with his powers and deleting Ranma's male form from existence, as well as her curse.  Everyone would remember that she had been male, but there would be no way to change her back under any circumstances.  Just to be safe, he gave her an immunity to Jusenkyo curses.  Which is when things got amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNow, to retain one's humanity while being overpowered as fuck, one has to make some sacrifices.  Such as suppressing cosmic awareness which might make you too existential to appreciate physical pleasures.  Which is why, while distracted by Ranma, he didn't notice Happosai leaping towards him and bouncing off of his face.  Which is when Akane's thrown hammer and Shampoo's thrown bonbori mace struck him in the face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe wasn't hurt, obviously.  But it was surprising enough that he fell over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Aiyah!\" Shampoo cried out in distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"CIVILIAN DOWN!\" Ukyo shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Damned old pervert!  GET BACK HERE AND APOLOGIZE TO THIS GUY!\" Ranma shouted, running off as the other girls came up to him to check on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You okay, sir?\" Akane asked, looking ashamed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Fine, fine,\" the villain said.  He grinned up at them, a dazzling, perfect smile to go with his muscular body and silvery, shoulder-length, deliberately Sephiroth-esque hair.  (He didn't care how silly it looked.  He was going villain so he was allowed to make eccentric fashion decisions.)  To his satisfaction, all four women blushed at his bare chest.  \"I'm more surprised than anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Shirtless man must be martial artist to take hit like that and just be 'surprised,'\" Shampoo said, smiling.  The Amazon found herself wanting to nuzzle up against the villain's abs and was cursing what she felt was a betrayal of Ranma's love.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I've dabbled,\" the villain said.  He reached into their minds with his powers and increased their attraction towards him.  \"Mainly to keep in shape.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Keep in VERY good shape,\" Ukyo said.  She was feeling flustered by this handsome man and wasn't sure why.  It was Ranma she wanted... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKodachi, squirming to hide her arousal and wishing she wore something more covering than a leotard, smiled charmingly.  \"You are a gentleman, sir, to excuse these ill-born brutes for their actions,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShampoo and Akane glared at Kodachi, who ignored them.  The villain tsked.  \"Really?\" he said, reaching into Kodachi's mind.  \"You don't like them?  You strike me as the type who likes tacos as much as she does sausages.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKodachi blushed, she and the other four getting the innuendo immediately.  Kodachi glanced over and found herself starting to appreciate Akane, Shampoo, and Ukyo more than she realized.  Why had she not seen their beauty before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAkane, meanwhile, was wondering why she didn't feel the urge to clobber this guy for the perverted remark.  It was baffling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So what was all that about, anyway?\" the villain asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The old pervert stole our panties,\" Ukyo muttered, embarrassed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Shame.  Old fart like that doesn't deserve to have such treasures,\" the villain said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"We wouldn't mind if you stole them, though,\" Akane said.  Almost immediately, the other three women agreed.  And then they all realized what they said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...We go now,\" Shampoo said, blushing bright red.  \"We go chase Airen, help kill old pervert.\"  Akane, Ukyo, and Kodachi all nodded quickly, dashing off when Shampoo did, wondering what the hell was wrong with them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain smiled.  Things were proceeding nicely...</span></div></div>",

Only the Tendos, Ranma herself, Genma and Nodaka, Cologne, Happosai, and his other three would-be fiancees would remember that Ranma had been a guy.  They just wouldn't remember what he looked like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n////////<br>\r\nThat evening...<br>\r\n////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRanma grumbled as she came home that night.  She shook her head in frustration, taking off her shoes as she came in and calling out the traditional greeting.  When no one answered, she began to look around for everyone.  She found Kasumi first, greeting her politely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Welcome home, Ranma!\" Kasumi said, the beautiful young woman hard at work in the kitchen.  \"Sorry I didn't come out to greet you, I need to pay attention to this sauce.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRanma nodded.  \"No worries,\" she said.  \"Whatcha makin'?   It smells good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Pumpkin soup, actually,\" Kasumi said.  \"I found the recipe online.  It looked interesting, so I figured I'd give it a try.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Pumpkin, huh?\" Ranma said, looking into the pot.  \"Looks nasty, but it smells good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKasumi giggled.  \"Yes, it does look rather 'Akane-esque' in appearance.  Just give it time, it will smooth out.  I hope you'll try it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"If you're making it, it'll turn out great,\" Ranma said.  \"Pumpkin's not my favorite, but I don't hate it.  Pops and I ate some wild ones on the road while training.\"  She thought about it, and frowned.  \"I hope they were wild ones.  He said they were... Wouldn't put it past the old bastard to steal...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKasumi patted her shoulder reassuringly.  \"I'm sure it will work out.  Why not change back and get ready for dinner?  I'm making beef teriyaki and riceballs with cheese tonight,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRanma smiled.  \"Sounds good,\" she said.  \"Anyone else in yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Akane is on the roof,\" Kasumi said.  \"She seems very deep in thought, but she isn't telling anyone why.  Nabiki is in her room finishing off her homework.  Our fathers are off plotting yet another doomed-to-fail scheme to try and get you and  Akane to grow up and stop fighting long enough to marry.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRanma quirked an eyebrow.  \"You have mastered the art of polite snarking, haven't you?\" she said, leaning against the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKasumi sighed.  \"Even my patience has limits.  I love you, Ranma, and I always will.  Akane too.  But both of you have egos the size of Happosai's opinion of himself.  And you keep arguing over the same old things.\"  A sassy smirk crossed her face.  \"One would almost think you were an old married couple already.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRanma rolled her eyes.  \"Funny,\" she said.  She knew Kasumi was right, she just didn't know how to work around Akane's damned temper... Ah well.  For another day, she supposed.  She headed to the bathroom and stripped down, filling a bath bucket with hot water as she stepped into the shower.  She dumped it on herself... and nothing happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe froze, an expression of horror locked on her face.  She stayed there for a long moment, going over EVERYTHING that happened today.  And as she did, she realized something even more frightening - she couldn't think of herself as a guy.  She couldn't even imagine herself as a male.  Drying off and quickly getting dressed, she ran back down to the kitchen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKasumi was surprised to see her still female.  \"Decided not to change?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Tried.  Failed,\" Ranma said, visibly shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKasumi understsood her fear.  \"Again?\" she said sadly.  What could it be this time? she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Kasumi, I have a very important question and I need to you answer me in as much detail as possible,\" Ranma said.  \"What do I look like as a guy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKasumi blinked.  \"An odd question,\" she said.  \"You...\" She trailed off, an expression of growing horror on her face as she realized that she could only ever Ranma being a girl.  She knew it was wrong, but in every memory of Ranma she had, she was always a short, feisty red-headed woman.  \"Oh no...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm getting everyone,\" Ranma said.  \"I'm being attacked again.  And if you can't remember, I have a bad feeling none of the others will remember me as a guy either...\" </span></div></div>",

She tried to lose him at first, flash stepping from building to building.  When it became apparent she wasn't going to lose her tail, she stopped on a rooftop, scowling.  \"You can stop trying to hide yourself.  You give off greater power than a Mega level.  There's no way I couldn't sense you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Stealth was never my strong point anyway,\" the villain said, appearing before her.  \"You wouldn't believe how badly I suck at Metal Gear Solid.\"  He wore black shorts and an open Hawaiian shirt, showing off his abs.  His hair was shoulder length and fluttered dramatically in the wind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon thought he looked silly.  \"You've gone to all this trouble to pursue me.  State your business,\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I want to capture you, brainwash you, and turn you into my happy, pampered sex slave for all eternity,\" the villain said casually.  After a moment's thought, he added, \"Fat and happy pampered sex slave.  I'm into fat chicks.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon's jaw dropped.  \"That's... wow... I appreciate the honesty, if nothing else,\" she said, flabbergasted at the man's audacity.  The villain bowed.  Renamon shook her head, clearing it.  \"But if you seriously think you can take me as your slave, you're wrong.  I serve none save Rika.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'll take her along too,\" the villain said, shocking Renamon.  \"With how big I want you to get, you'll need a feeder when I'm not doing it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon growled.  \"Your intention is clear,\" she said.  \"I will not let you near Rika.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe man's smile turned dark.  \"You said it yourself, foxface,\" he said.  \"I am radiating more power than a Mega level Digimon.  And I will tell you now that I am mightier than even the mightiest of Megas.  What chance could you possibly have?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"A fool's chance, perhaps,\" Renamon said.  \"All I know is that I must try.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You'll fail,\" the man said.  Before Renamon could even through up a defense, he charged her, surrounding himself in a massive aura of energy.  She braced herself as he collided with her... and vanished, disappearing the moment he touched her.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t\"What the...\" Renamon said, looking around in confusion.  \"Where did he go?\"  She looked around, frowning worriedly.  She couldn't sense him at all.  The only thing left of him was trace blue sparks in the air.  She put her hands on her hips, trying to decide her next move... and her stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Better get something to eat,\" she said.  \"I'm starving all of a sudden.\"  She started to walk home.  As she did, though, a smile came to the fox's face and she began to skip, humming to herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFrom where he watched as Renamon succumbed to his power, the man grinned.</span></div></div>",

Especially not with the spell he weaved on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe threat of such a shameless pervert seemed far away in Renamon's mind. She should have been far more on edge, especially with a threat to Rika's safety right before her and yet...the growling in her stomach rose, rumbles almost making her feel reverbs in her middle. A grimace finding its way on the yellow and white fox's face as her three-clawed hand grasped at her abdomen softly, a groan escaping under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More dire than I expected...I need food and fast...\" She muttered, leaping deftly back to ground level, albeit doing her best to stay out of sight and out of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe all-powerful pervert easily followed, instantly finding himself leaning up against a wall in a tight alley, seated atop a closed dumpster as he looked out on the bustling streets. Street vendors and trucks with food shipments alike all present and ripe for the taking. And by his will alone, he could even give the poor, starved vixen a helping hand; not a soul was the wiser to the fox making off in desperation with hot plates of takoyaki, with boxes of pre-wrapped sweet breads and entire bundles of vegetables tied up in red bands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet no matter how much Renamon took, her feverish feeding didn't fill the void burning in her middle. Just as he'd planned of course. The extra-dimensional traveler taking in the sight of Renamon's temperance wearing down in real time before him as entire balls of takoyaki vanished into her maw. As whole loaves of bread went from disappearing in a few bites to practically being eaten whole. Every bite, of course, only added more and more to Renamon's frame--he did warn her he liked his girls big! And he was going to have her bigger and bigger and bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why...why am I still so hungry?!\" Renamon growled as she feverishly shoveled a handful of cheap convenience store riceballs into her mouth, bits of tacky rice smearing around the edges of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villain had to hold down his chuckles; this was too easy! He really could just get any thing his way now, couldn't he? He could even see the poor, hapless yellow fox growing bit by bit before his eyes, fur and flesh bulging outwards as her cravings continued. She couldn't help herself, her burning hunger overtaking all other priorities in her mind. She didn't even seem to notice her developing bust making itself known from under the ruffle of white fur, growing by at least a whole cup size every few seconds. Her ass thickening atop a pair of creamy thighs coated in lemony yellow fur while her gut kept on pushing forwards. her arms thickening up as even her face could--if he looked carefully--be seen getting ever so slightly plumper and rounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn't stop, of course. Not unless the lascivious man willed it and he certainly wasn't feeling charitable towards her, right now. Just how big could she get if he left her like this...?</span></div></div>",

For a brief moment, even wondering if he overdid it. A brief moment. However, he could hardly complain as the figure before him settled itself into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon's breasts, once seemingly hidden or non-existent, became enormous spheres of white fur and flesh tantalizingly jiggling atop her form. The weighty motions sending ripples through her growing rolls of stomach fat that pushed outwards and further towards the ground. So enormous was her bust, those pillow-thick arms of hers were wobbling up against the delightful mounds every time more food was shoved into her ravenous maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs looked more and more like enormous pillars of fat, the flesh above and below her knees looking as if stacked together, propping up her wide hips and enormous, shuddering backside as yellow furred buttocks began to weightily wobble and slap together, crashing and heaving like mounds of flan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the digimon herself was less than enthralled with her newfound blobby figure, yet she was unable to stop. An enormous plastic cup full of custard was vanishing rapidly past her fat face, as the faintest bits of cold chocolate dessert matted the edges of her muzzle before she began reflexively lapping it all off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why...why am I still so hungry?!\" She growled past a thickened, chubby paw shoveling sweet bean jam buns into her mouth, her already plush cheeks puffing up full of food before swallowing it all down. Her free paw grasping at her upper belly before sliding up under her enormous jugs, propping them up as they wobbled weightily back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bravado was quickly escaping from the enterprising dimensional traveler's face as he looked on, biting down on his lip as he began to fidget ever so slightly. This was the exact thing he'd dreamed of for so long, only experienced vicariously in fantasy and fanart until now and here it was, unfolding before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer titanic body was slow and lumbering in all the right ways, letting him hang back to drink in every last curve of Renamon's borderline blobby body shuddering, heaving and crashing. He began to gently rub his legs together, watching as he could hardly hold himself together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe <i>needed</i> her, <i>now</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo ravage that enormous, fat body and make her his! To push himself up against every inch and explore her curves to the fullest...knowing he could make her even bigger whenever he wanted and just do it again and again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could even see her, just out the corner of his eye, squeezing her elephantine form into a street where no one else seemed to be following (if only because he'd left the people nearby ever so blissfully unaware of her.) If he wanted to claim her, here and now, he'd be hard-pressed to find a better chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, he could always make his own chances.

Groaning, she squeezed herself into an alley, her once graceful steps now heavy and plodding.  Her legs were thick pillars of furry fat, her belly a vast apron of doughy flesh that hung down to her knees, tightly packed with food.  Her breasts, once A-cup and hidden under her fur and neckfluff, had ballooned out and were now larger than her head, thick, puffy nipples showing through.  Her hips were now wide, swaying with every movement, her ass thick and huge, the cheeks clapping together with every movement.  Her arms now were so thick they had 'wings' of fat on them, and her neck had ballooned out into a thick double-chin.  Her every movement set her body jiggling, and her stomach made loud glorping and gurgling noises as it struggled to digest the vast amount of food she had injested.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe fox Digimon groaned, fondling her flabby body, squeezing her belly rolls, hefting her blubbersome breasts, even squeezing her own ass.  Every movement of her body was labored, even her great strength doing little to prevent herself from tiring out.  Every part of her felt heavy, and her mouth and chins were covered in sauce remnants from her meals.  And for some reason, despite panting heavily, her fat chest weighing down her lungs, she felt fantastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why does this feel so good?\" Renamon moaned, shaking her heavy belly and belching.  \"BBWWAAAAARRRRP!!  Ogh... So heavy...\" She licked her lips, clearing them of food as best she could.  She squeezed her flab again, confused.  \"I should be scared... But instead I just feel great...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I can make you feel even better,\" the villain said, teleporting near her, unable to resist her any longer.  Before Renamon could protest, he began to massage her heavily bloated belly, the fox Digimon groaning in pleasure as his gentle kneading and squeezing of her bellyfat helped her digestion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oooogh...\" she groaned blissfully, leaning up against the alley wall.  \"That feels... UUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRPPP!!!  That feels so good... BWAOOORRP!!\"  Heavy belches escaped her throat as the villain sunk his hands deep within her bellyfat, massaging her aching stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain himself was almost drooling with lust.  Her fat-laden flesh felt so soft to the touch, her fur silky smooth.  This was so much better than the fanart, because it was real.  She was here, and he could touch her, do what he wanted with her.  \"Mmmmph, so beautiful...\" he said, his cock fully erect and hard as a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon blushed, looking at the man.  Truthfully, he wasn't that bad-looking, now that she thought of it.  And his bellyrubs made her feel so good...  \"Why?\" she asked.  \"Why me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Because you're beautiful.  I've always lusted after you, wanted to see you fat,\" the villain said, grinning.  He leaned in and gave her a kiss, not caring about the sauce on her chins.  He wiped his mouth clean of the sauce after pulling away, grinning wider when he saw Renamon blushing.  \"I meant every single word I said.  I want to make you my fat, pampered pet for all eternity.  Eternal youth, immortality, and all the food you can eat...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon had no idea why she was considering it.  She should be striking him.  But (mainly because of the villain's mental manipulation) she was starting to like his idea more and more.  \"...What about Rika and her family?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Rika's also on my list.  Her family and your friends will be taken care of, if I decide not to take them.  And don't worry about Digimon threats.  I am considering capturing and enslaving your entire race,\" the villain said, reaching into her mind and changing how she felt about what he said.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t\"You're certainly ambitious,\" Renamon said, chuckling.  \"Are you certain you can handle that many slaves and harem girls?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You have no idea what I'm capable of, my dear,\" the villain said.  \"But I want you to be my first.  First among my harem girls, worshipped and adored by all of them.  The ideal woman, with the ideal body that I am just BARELY holding myself back from ravishing right now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon bit her lip.  Even without his mental manipulation, she could feel the adoration and love coming off of this man.  And the promise of being loved and pampered forever was strangely appealing.  To her shock, she found that she was wet too, the fur of her pussy matted with growing need, tingling with desire.  She made her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Then don't hold back, Master,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain's eyes widened.  \"Did you just say...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I haven't felt this good before,\" Renamon almost cooed.  \"I want you, Master.  I want to be yours.  Take me right here.  Make my fat body shake.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain couldn't be more aroused if he tried.  He had WON.  Renamon was HIS now.  And now he could claim his prize, enjoy her in so many ways...</span></div></div>",

She landed with a thud, surprised at her soft landing, and grinned when she realized what was happening.  With a gesture, the villain made his clothes disappear, and spread Renamon's thick, flabby legs, letting his hands wander all over her thick thighs and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Amazing...\" he said softly as he fondled her softness.  The plush, springy feel of her fat belly along with her thick, fluffy fur made her feel like a giant plush toy.  He saw Renamon grinning up at him, and grinned back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Enjoying yourself, Master?\" she teased, flicking an ear, the effect adorable on her plump face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Very much so,\" the villain said, kissing where her navel was, teasingly poking a finger into it and making her moan with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon didn't know why she was enjoying this so much, being treated like a plaything, stuffed to the point where her stomach hurts and made ridiculously fat.  But she felt so good.  And feeling her master enjoy her body was turning her on more and more.  She desperately wanted to feel his cock inside her now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUnable to restrain himself anymore, he lifted up her belly, letting it rest against his body, and reached underneath it, feeling between her thick thighs until he found her pussy.  Now, he'd never admit this aloud, but the villain was actually a virgin.  This the first time he'd felt a woman's cunt, stroking his fingers along the fat-filled folds, making Renamon moan in pleasure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA woman's pussy, he thought, his mind clouded with lust.  Grunting, he stepped forward, using his cosmically-enhanced strength to hold her gut out of the way while he thrust his rock hard member into her cunt.  There was a brief resistance as her hymen tore, Renamon wincing in sudden pain, but that was replaced by sheer pleasure as her master began to thrust in and out of her, her blubbersome body shaking as she was fucked, her cunt filled to the brim by his member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUnconsciously, the man had increased the size of his cock to fill her pussy completely.  He also was rewriting her mind so that he would be the only man capable of getting her off.  He wanted Renamon to be his and his alone, although he'd let other harem girls play with her.  And oh, how good it felt to be wrapped up in that warm, wet cunt.  He thrust in and out of her, his hips slamming against hers, making her many rolls of fat wobble pleasantly, her flabby breasts boucning up and down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon moaned in delight, fondling her thick, flabby breasts and tweaking her nipples.  She couldn't believe how good sex felt.  She'd heard Rika watching porn sometimes when she thought her mother was gone, and seen her playing with herself, but had never done so.  She also knew the basics of human reproduction, and that sex was a part of it.  Now, with her master's cock filling her up, she knew she could never get enough.  She would be master's gloriously fat slut forever.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain shivered in lust, thrusting harder and faster into Renamon's eager cunt, her massive body wobbling back and forth.  He spanked her massive ass, making her yelp in pleasure, the feel of his body wrapped up in her soft, furry fat sending him into raptures of pleasure.  Already he could feel his release building up, like a growing pressure in a firehose.  \"Hnngh... Renamon... Gonna cum...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon was near her climax too, both former virgins on the verge of release because of their inexperience.  Moaning, Renamon begged, \"Do it!  Master, shoot your seed inside me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEncouraged, the villain thrust hard, finally letting go.  A torrent of hot cum shot into Renamon's pussy and into her womb, a warmth filling Renamon as she hit her climax at the same time, her cunt clenching around his cock and gushing fluids as she yowled in bliss, a feral sound.  The two lovers, panting happily, still mounted in each other, rested as they slowly came down from their orgasmic highs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Confession time,\" the villain said, deciding to be honest.  \"This was my first time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon grinned.  \"Mine too.  But... really?  The first time you've ever been with a woman?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain nodded.  \"Yep.  And I'm glad you were my first,\" he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon blushed warmly, proud and honored to be the one to take her master's virginity.  A part of her realized how insane it was to think this, but the hypnotized part of her mind, overwhelming more and more of her senses, shushed that voice.  It would never speak up again, silenced by the newfound love she had for the man who was her owner.</span></div></div>",

Renamon luxuriated in her new, gluttonous fatness, savoring each treat as it slid down her throat, not caring if she got cream or frosting around her lips.  Occasionally, she would let out a belch, savoring the warmth in her belly and womb.

Reaching out with his powers, he did a little creative banking, creating a perfect bribe.  Creating a disguise for himself, he also reached out to contact Kimihito's parents via a created cell phone.  To his dismay, they easily proved willing to sell the house, saying that their 'useless son' could just find an apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe funneled more money into his account in this world, robbing some rich businessmen who had more money than they'd ever need.  He teleported directly to Kimihito's house, finding the door unlocked.  Frowning, he went inside, finding Kimihito on the phone screaming at his parents.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...But where am I supposed to go?!\" he asked.  \"Damn it, you can't just sell our house out from under me!  Mom? Dad?  Hello?\" Receiving no answer, he gave up, slamming the phone down.  \"Oh God...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Am I interrupting something?\" the villain said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Yes, actually,\" Kimihito said.  \"I have to find an apartment to move into.  My parents sold our house out from under me without giving me a chance to find somewhere else to live.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I know,\" the villain said.  \"They sold it to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito looked up angrily.  \"You!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm sorry, son,\" the villain said, using a Southern American accent even as he spoke perfect Japanese.  \"They didn't tell me you was living here until after the deal had been made.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito snarled.  \"Well, little good that does me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain sighed, thinking up a fake name.  \"Mr. Kurusu, my name is Phillip Theodore Richman.  You can call me Phil,\" he said.  \"I am prepared to make amends for this by offering you five times the amount of money I gave your parents, and help you move into a new house.  A better, bigger one than this.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito blinked.  \"...You certainly have a lot of money to throw around,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I run a pharmaceutical company,\" the villain said.  \"Started makin' a fortune and a half when Reagan started letting us go for-profit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah, that'd do it,\" Kimihito muttered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The point is,\" the villain said, \"I am not completely heartless.  Its unfair that this was sprung on y'all.  I can have you in a new home, with a big bank account to spend, within the next couple days.  And your parents don't have to know about any of it, since the account will be in your name.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito frowned, looking around his childhood home for a long moment... and nodded.  \"Sure.  Fuck them, and fuck this place,\" Kimihito said, shaking the villain's hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt took two days to set everything up, but Kimihito and his possessions were moved out of the house and into a larger home several miles away from the house.  The villain bought some furniture and some food to refill the place, settling himself in.  It was a fairly modest home, but he only needed to keep it that way at first.  Once Ms. Smith belonged to him, then he could get away with messing with space/time.  </span></div></div>",

He picked himself out of the crater, snapping his fingers.  In a flash, he was wearing jeans, a biker jacket with spiked shoulder pads, the words 'Trouble Man' emblazoned on the back in bright, fiery red.  He made a real electric guitar appear and began playing it, singing the full song 'The Trouble Man,' a song long associated with Darkstalkers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe LOVED this series!  Sexy babes, cool monsters, it had it all!  Such a shame Capcom neglected it.  Ah well.  He wouldn't.  He even had a plan.  He'd picked a close-to-canon reality where Morrigan had convinced Lilith to become her sister instead of absorbing her, so the Aenslands were an obvious target.  Alternatively, there was Felicia and her pride of catgirls.  That one would be a little trickier, as he didn't want to leave the orphans she took care of without a denmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...He could always just have her eat them and absorb their souls into her body.  He liked vore and fat girls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEh, something to consider.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother idea he had was to simply start a fight with one of the Darkstalkers, lure them out one by one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was this particularly delicious idea... Demitri Maximoff, a powerful vampire, had a technique called the Midnight Bliss.  It turned men into women, and women into weaker versions of themselves, leaving them vulnerable to being drained of blood and life energy, reverting back to normal in an explosion.  He could attack Demitri, and turn the Midnight Bliss back on Demitri himself.  And then, once he was a sexy female, he could have her make the Midnight Bliss transformations permanent and use them on all the Darkstalker men, giving him MORE options for his harem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, this was gonna be a fun trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BABY I'M THE TROUBLE MAN!\" he finished, cackling wildly, startling a group of sleeping bats which took to the sky in fright, unintentionally creating the perfect scary effect as they flew past the full moon's light.  </span></div></div>",

In fact, he's such a fan of the Sonic series that he also enjoyed the Archie comic, throughout all of its storylines both bad and good, and even the IDW comic as well!  He also watched Sonic Boom, because it was hilarious.  No matter the game, he played it or watched a Let's Play of it.  Hell, there were even some decent genderbends of the males. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, he didn't feel like shifting through multiple variants to get everyone.  So he found one that combined elements of every game, show, and comic...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, there we go.  The world, currently, was recovering from the events of Sonic Forces.  Neo Metal Sonic had been defeated.  Sonic was an independent agent who worked with the Freedom Fighters frequently, and Sally's team more than once.  Amy and Knuckles were the leaders and coordinators of the various Freedom Fighter groups, while Sally's people were known more as the Royal Knights, an individual Freedom Fighter group.  Freedom Fighter groups from before and after the reboot of the Archie comic were there, along with Sticks, who defended an island that Sonic, Amy, Tails, and Knuckles liked to vacation on from time to time, and Tangle and Whisper were recent recruits into the greater Freedom Fighters organization.  Sonic and Tails' parents from before the reboot were in this timeline, which meant he had MILFs to collect...  Eggman had his Egg Bosses, as well as reluctant allies in the Dark Legion, led by Lien-Da, and Dr. Starline as his direct assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaaand there was Eggman planning to use a robotic zombification plague.  That had to go.  With a quick snap of his fingers, he erased the roboticization virus and made Eggman and his minions forget they were ever working on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, he could work with this.  Now.  Who to add to his harem first?  There were some obvious choices, but perhaps he could test the waters with someone less well known...</span></div></div>",

The crystal resembled a pure white Chaos Emerald.  But something about it was able to hold Rouge's attention.  Already sensitive to the presence of treasure, Rouge leaned foward, her robe falling to reveal one of her ample breasts.  \"Incredible...\" she said softly, entranced by the beauty of the gem.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRichman continued.  \"Ah believe in the basic goodness of people.  That's why ah will let the Merah Diamond be put on public display for all to view and enjoy.  ah will also donate a substantial amount of rings to the Station Square Museum, so that they may be funded for years t'come!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRouge wiped away a bit of drool.  \"Okay,\" she said softly.  \"Calm down, Rouge... Something about this doesn't add up.  Why would anyone let such a pretty... so very pretty...\" Rouge shook her head.  \"A gorgeous gem like that just be put on display?  This doesn't feel right...\" She stared at the gem some more.  \"...But I won't know if its a trap or not unless I go...\" Rouge was conflicted.  Her survival instinct was flaring up at the same time as her greedy need for gems was.  \"So pretty...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFrom the shadows of her apartment, the villain, having discarded his 'Richman' disguise after legitimately making the payments (he was a villain, not a scumbag), watched carefully, to see if Rouge would take the bait...</span></div></div>",

Slowly, carefully, she made her way into the display area for the Merah Gem, pausing just outside the range of the lights in the room.  She pulled out some powder and blew on it, creating a cloud that revealed the criss-crossing security lasers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Heh, same as last time,\" Rouge said.

No sign of security, no sign of a rival coming in, no sign of one of the Doctor's machines... Everything was going perfectly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tToo perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer hand hesitated over the gem for a long moment.  Every instinct of hers was screaming at her to leave, to abandon the gem.  It wasn't worth it.  But a gem worth so many rings... So very, very shiny...  Her greed won out over her common sense, and her hand closed around the Merah Gem, pulling it out of the glass case.  At which point a bright light flashed, blinding her, and her body felt oddly light, a tingling shooting through her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Damn it, damn it, DAMN IT!\" she shouted.  \"It WAS a trap!\" <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tWhen her vision cleared, she was in her usual outfit of a black, cleavage-exposing leotard with a heart-shaped top, with white boots and gloves with heart-shaped highlights.  She was also sitting on the lap of Phil T. Richman, albeit a much handsomer looking version of him, with a muscular body, anime-esque short silver hair, and a more neatly trimmed goatee.  Glancing around, she found herself in a lavish penthouse, one that made her apartment look like a poor person's apartment by comparison.  Platinum lined the walls and furniture, all of it made of rich mahogony or oak, the curtains and Phil's clothing, an open vest and shorts, made of silk.  And the gem was still in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Um...\" Rouge managed after a moment.  \"Hi?\" She grinned nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Hello yourself, beautiful,\" Phil said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm guessing you're a sorcerer of some kind,\" Rouge tried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Try traveling cosmic pervert,\" Phil said, casually leaning back on the couch they were on.  \"Here to collect beautiful women and add them to my harem.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That's... intimidating...\" Rouge conceded.  She wanted to get off of his lap and try to get away.  His arms weren't holding her, and there seemed to be nothing tying her down.  Except she found her body unwilling to cooperate.  \"...I can't seem to leave.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh, that's the affects of the Merah Gem I created,\" Phil said.  \"It subtly alters your mind to make you want to be with me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I see...\" Rouge said.  The more she thought about it, the more she thought that her captor was indeed rather attractive... which was odd for her, since she wasn't into humans.  \"So basically...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You're mine.  Your body has accepted it.  Your mind will follow soon enough,\" Phil said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRouge whimpered a little.  She tried to think of a way out of this, but increasingly she found her thoughts fighting back against her desires. Why leave? she found herself thinking.  I'm right where I need to be, at my Master's side.  \"I just realized,\" Rouge said, mainly to distract herself, \"Merah is just Harem backwards, isn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Correct,\" Phil said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The entire thing was just bait for me, wasn't it?\" Rouge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Indeed.  And yes, you can keep the gem, and no, my real name's not Phil,\" the villain said.  \"I haven't decided on what I want to be called yet.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRouge chuckled weakly.  \"Believe it or not, I'm kinda glad for that.  Being enslaved by a villain named Phil T. Richman would destroy any credibility I had...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain laughed.  </span></div></div>",

All I ask is unquestioning obedience...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRouge gulped nervously.  It sounded good, and her body was starting to get warm with desire from being near him.

All the women on this planet, if I so choose.  And yes, I can pleasure all of them regularly,\" he said, grinning wickedly.

But that part was being overwhelmed by the part that flat out wanted to belong to this man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain grinned, cupping her chin.  \"You really like using your mouth,\" he said.  \"But I can think of a better use for it.\"  He set Rouge down between his legs, putting her right in view of his erection, which was bulging out the sweatpants he was wearing.  Because Mobians were only half as tall as humans, Rouge was in a perfect position for a blowjob.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRouge swallowed hard, unable to tear her eyes from the villain's cock.  Slowly, almost reverently, she pulled down his sweatpants, his massive sword of an erection and huge, heavy balls popping free.  Far too big for a Mobian usually, which is why Rouge never flirted with humans seriously, but somehow she knew that this massive dick could fit her pussy anyway.  She licked her lips, staring at it.  \"It's beautiful...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No more words,\" the villain said, pleased with her reaction but getting a little anxious.  \"Suck.  And use those amazing breasts of yours, too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOf course, she thought, grinning lustfully and pulling down her heart-shaped top.  Her immense bosom popped free, her nipples firm with arousal.  Cooing, she wrapped her boobs around his dick, taking his cockhead into her mouth as well.  The meaty, manly flavor made Rouge moan in lust, the bat feeling herself get wet as she rubbed her breasts up and down on the man's thick length, swallowing his cock as she began to bob her head up and down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Mmm, yeah...\" the villain said, licking his lips.  \"You work the shaft...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA thrill of warmth filled her, and she eagerly rubbed his massive member between her breasts, suckling and slurping his cock lovingly.  She kissed his shaft, feeling it quiver with pleasure as her soft, plush breasts rubbed over it.  She expertly swirled her tongue around his shaft, his thick length completely engulfed by her warm mouth and soft breasts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain moaned softly.  \"Goddamn... You're an eager little cocksucker, ain'tcha?  Your boobs and mouth are amazing.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRouge fluttered her wings happily, slurping her master's cock lewdly.  She lowered her head completely down onto it, feeling it curve down her gullet as she deep throated him, licking at his balls.  The manly flavor of him was addicting, and she found herself wanting more and more.  She eagerly sucked her master's cock, wanting to taste his cream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain grunted, grabbing her head and jamming it down on his cock, making her take his cock up to the hilt.  He shot out his load, his cum load so thick that her cheeks bulged out.  \"SWALLOW IT!\" he commmanded.  Like a good slut, Rouge complied, gulping down her master's creamy, hot seed, savoring the flavor of his babygoo.  She moaned, gulping down as much as possible, the surges of cum so thick that some came out her nose.  He held her down on his cock the entire time, not letting her up until he was completely drained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce he was done, he let her withdraw.  She licked her lips, grinning up at her Master.  Any pretense of resistance was gone, Rouge fully under the man's control.  She teasingly opened her mouth, showing the leftovers of his cum on her tongue, and swallowed it.  \"Was I good, Master?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain grinned, patting her head affectionately.  \"You did splendidly, my dear,\" he said.  \"I'll have to make use of that mouth more in the future.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRouge giggled happily.  Master was pleased with her!  Maybe he'd reward her soon...</span></div></div>",

Gesturing, he made a 'grid' of sorts out of the multiverse.  Moving it around like he was using a cell phone screen, flicking with his fingers, he eventually came across something surprising.  A nexus of worlds, all connected to Disney.  The world of Kingdom Hearts was loosely connected to these worlds, as were the worlds of Marvel and Star Wars.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd of course, the Nexus was in the same triple-circle Mickey Mouse head shape.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain shook his head, shaking his head.

So he looked for settings where the differences from canon were superficial (they chose something else for lunch one day, for example).  He found an acceptable variant world rather quickly.  He started to enter the Nexus... and bounced off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...What the fuck,\" the villain said, looking confused.  He pressed on the Disney Nexus's surface, feeling powerful resistence.  \"...You dare,\" he growled, feeling outraged.

I WON'T!\" With a final flaring punch, he tore a hole in the Nexus.  Working his fingers into it, he roared, yanking open a tearing a massive hole in the Nexus and stepping through.  He fired his power at the hole, cauterizing it and locking it open.  \"Mine...\" he growled, looking towards the worlds.  He took a moment to calm himself down, and coughed.  \"Okay.  Let's do this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDeciding to leave Star Wars, Kingdom Hearts, and Marvel alone for now, he decided towards the primary Disney Nexus.

The villain chuckled.  \"Well, I didn't really think that would work.  Does anyone here know OF Xena?\" As he watched, an older man came out of the crowd, frowning at him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Xena saved our village from bandits that were extorting food from us,\" he said.  \"What do you want with her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"To kidnap her, her friend Gabrielle, and I think that Callisto woman from this world and make them my sex slaves,\" the villain said, smiling pleasantly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSome of the villagers laughed.  The old man, however, frowned.  \"...You have great ambition, my good man,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh, there's nothing good about me,\" the villain said, smirking.  \"Now.  Where's Xena?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Not here,\" the old man said.  \"We don't keep in contact.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"All right, fair enough,\" the villain said.  \"Do you have any idea where she might be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What makes you think you could beat her?\" a brash young man said.  \"She's magnificent.  A woman among women, and one of the few I'd admit to being better than a man in battle.\" A woman who was with him, most likely his girlfriend, shoved him playfully. He ignored it.  \"Only the gods could face her and win, and even that's questionable.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I am a god,\" the villain said, his eyes glowing.  \"I'm the God of Lust.  And I'm not leaving this world without my prizes.\" The people backed off from him, suddenly worried.  The villain laughed, and got off his horse.  \"I'm not gonna kill or cripple anyone, don't worry.  But I will be doing enough damage to leave a message.  Get word to Xena.  I'm quite literally coming for her butt.  And the rest of her beautiful body too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd then he charged, proceeding the beat the crap out of everyone in the village.</span></div></div>",
