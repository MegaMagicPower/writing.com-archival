The view was perfect and unspoiled aside from the massive atomic warhead just off the coast. It hadn't gone off in all the years you'd lived here but the damn thing was leaking even more radioactive poison into the surrounding waters. That couldn't be good for the wildlife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the water here was probably cleaner and safer than up in Sawtooth Shores. The wildlife there made this place look like a 5 star resort, even with your crappy scrapheap of a trailer serving as the only local landmark that would probably give you tetanus just by looking at it. You took a long sip from your freshly opened can of beer and lowered your hat to keep the sun out of your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a good chunk of the atmosphere gone due to a natural disaster or some sort of mad scientist bullshit the sunlight in most parts around here tended to be even more brutal than elsewhere. But hey, its a home, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crumple up the can and throw it at the gathering pile of trash collecting on the shore and reach down to grab a fresh one from your six pack. Unfortunately, that was the last beer you had out here, if you wanted a new one you'd have to go inside and grab one from the ice box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swear that if your buddy Daniel didn't have the skills to keep that piece of crap running you would toss his lazy ass out, but deep down you know you could never do that. The two of you didn't always get along, but you were partners in the scavenging business and relied on each other for survival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like there were many other people living out here these days. You sigh as you get up and head inside to check the ice box, knowing Daniel that last six pack you got stored could still be all there or almost gone. You hadn't seen him drinking before he crashed in his hammock last night, so maybe there were a few beers left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you head inside you check your mailbox, surprised to find a letter addressed to you sitting on the bottom. The last time anyone bothered to send a message out to these parts was when you accumulated that 50 Cap tab down at that bar in the Brownsand settlement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tear open the dusty envelope and sit down on a dirty bean bag chair in front of your makeshift table. \"Well I'll be damned... its from Taylor. That old bastard finally passed on right after he found a fresh vein of that Glowing Ore crap out in the Dustbox region outside of Scrap City.\" you say in amazement as you read on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since he didn't name anyone in his will the whole place is up for grabs and they're handing out shares to former employees... huh.\" You sit the envelope down and think for a few moments about what you just read. You had spent a good 5-7 years working for Taylor and were close friends for a time but you didn't expect he'd remember you after living out here for a decade or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scavenging business had been a little slow lately and this almost seemed too good to be true. You read the letter once more and tried to calculate how long it would take you to get to Scrap City. \"I don't have the money to hire transport there but they may really be offering something worthwhile if I show up before the others get there.\" you say as you stuff the letter in your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour days of working around the quarry and hanging out with Taylor flashed in your mind. \"Hmmm... I'll do it. If I set out today I could probably make it in a week on foot or just a few days if I can hitch a ride with a caravan.\" you say excitedly as you put the note in your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much you had to barter with but you quickly picked up a few bits of junk to trade to help fund your journey. \"Hey man, what's with the racket? I'm sleeping here.\" Daniel called as he rolled over in his hammock and pulled a torn piece of clothing over his head. \"I'm setting out for Scrap City and taking in this weeks haul early, want to come with me?\" you ask as you stuff some of the junk into a pocket on your backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm cool. We still got a months worth of water in storage and some food stashed in the ice box. I'll be fine while you're gone, but if you're going all the way to Scrap City make sure you bring back some decent beer this time. That piss water we got on our last trip out there wasn't worth half of what we paid for it.\" he replied as he scratched his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, I might even bring us back some whiskey if this little errand provides me with some good cash.\" you say as you walk back to the ice box. \"Awesome, last time I had some of that good shit was about five years ago...\" Daniel muttered as he began falling back asleep. Since he was out of it you decided to take the remaining beer with you as it would make a good trade if you needed it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Roll a D6 and add X Beers to your inventory, where X is the number you rolled.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting the beer and some water and food rations in your pack you head out the door and begin walking to the nearby settlement of Shady Wood Park. Once there you could gather supplies for your journey. After walking for about two hours you come to a small collection of shacks on the edge of a dying forest surrounded by a chain-link fence and a lone guard tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe settlement was small, only about 7 houses and a bazaar, but its location next to the forest and heavy traffic from people passing through on their way to Brownsand meant that the little town was well protected. You waved to the sniper up in the guard tower who quickly returned the favor to welcome you to town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there you spent about an hour talking to people around town and exchanging goods to prepare for your journey. Soon, you were ready to set out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You gain $100. You gain 5 Caps.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnvironment: Wasteland, Urban</span></div></div>",

As such it took quite a bit of effort to get a leaving caravan to trust you enough to allow you to accompany them to Scrap City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair warning, I like the folks at Shady Woods Park. They always take care of our crew and keep us running when we pass through, they're good people. You seemed to be friends with them, but we didn't even know you until you walked up to our caravan this morning. You seem alright, but if you cause any trouble we'll leave you tired to a rock for the bugs to pick apart, understood?\" the lead caravaner asked from his mount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, I'm just hoping for an uneventful journey like the rest of you.\" you reply quickly, trying to ease the tension a bit. The man only laughs as he turns around to face you. \"I don't know where you're from, but out here in this wasteland there are monsters that eat people left and right, not to mention bandits. If you're expecting an uneventful ride give me back that little horse I lent you and walk back to town. You'll die out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a bit offended at his words but just let it pass. Pissing him off would just delay your journey and make things harder. You've managed to survive out here before, something he wasn't aware of so you just decided to forget it and keep an eye out for danger. It had been about 3 hours since you left Shady Wood Park and the afternoon sun was murder. If not for the shade provided by the other caravaners this would have been unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group passed by a Sand Hornet shortly after lunchtime and everyone was a quick enough shot that the only injury was an unlucky man who had been slow on the trigger. He could've lost his hand and judging by his screaming wish he had, but the group doctor was skilled enough to save it. You yourself had a close call when one of the buggers nearly got you in the eye, though your skill with the revolver you had bought back in Shady Woods Park kept you safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead caravaner even complemented you on your shooting and allowed you to eat dinner with him and his men after leaving you to eat your lunch by yourself. \"You handled yourself pretty good out there today, guess you're not a bad addition to this group after all.\" he said as he looked over to the setting sun. \"Thanks, a lucky shot is what saved me though.\" you reply as you take a sip of water from your canteen. \"Luck... skill... its all the same. Let's set up camp for the night here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a mostly uneventful first day you fell asleep and relaxed near the wreckage of an old airplane the had fallen from the air years ago. By the next morning you were back on the road and making good time. Nothing really exciting happened that day and it wasn't long before you were once again resting under the stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you set off on the morning of day three you asked how long it would be before you got to Scrap City. \"About a day, little less probably.\" one of the caravaners replied as you passed a burnt out gas station singed by a powerful explosion. As you got further down the road a single shot rang out and one of the caravaners fell off his horse as a bullet ripped through his neck. \"Bandits!\" yelled the lead caravaner as they returned fire on the gas station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group scattered when a grenade landed on the road and nearly blew away one of the riders. A single man yelled out as bullets tore through the gas station and two more people, a man and a woman, came running out guns blazing. Both were killed almost instantly, but not before one of them manage to hit another caravaner in the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spread out, surround them on all sides!\" The lead caravaner yelled as the group closed in on the gas station. Suddenly, bullets flew out from a boarded up window and struck the lead caravaner off his horse. \"Damn it, they hit Paul!\" one of the other caravaners screamed as a second grenade flew out of the window and land at his feet. There was almost no time to react, but you knew you had to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnvironment: Wasteland, Ruins</span></div></div>",

You had seen this model of grenade before and knew it was entirely computerized in nature... as well as the fact that a simple magnetic pulse was all it took to disrupt the inner timer mechanism. Without a second to spare you tossed the device next to the grenade and hopped off your horse to properly attend to the deadly explosive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore shots rang out as the other caravaners rode up past the gas station window to finish off the last of the bandits inside. You hardly noticed, however, as you pried open the grenades outer shell to disarm the explosive mechanism completely. After a few tense seconds a soft tick signaled that the thing was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, you just saved my life...\" the lead caravaner said as he slowly got to his feet while clutching his bleeding side. \"You gonna be okay?\" you asked as you tossed the disarmed grenade away. \"Yeah, we got a Military Stimpak saved up that I can use to fix this, I'll be good as new within the hour.\" he replied as he slowly got back on his horse and reached into a pouch on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the young man who had been riding next to you came running up yelling \"PA!\" at the top of his lungs. \"Relax son, I'll be okay, this here wastelander just saved my life. Disarmed the damn thing if you can believe it.\" the head caravaner replied as he jabbed his bleeding side with some kind of drug injector. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment he bled even more heavily as bits of the bullet that hit him poured out of his gun wound before it slowly began to fuse shut. In minutes a small scar would be the only sign of his near fatal injury. \"Here, take this!\" he called out as he tossed you an item he had retrieved from a pouch as he rode by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, thanks!\" you call back quickly as you look down at the tightly wrapped wad of dollar bills in your hand.

Take a break while we get everyone back in gear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief burial for the dead and lunch the caravan was back on the searing hot pavement on the road to Scrap City. With no more delays the group quickly arrived at the Neon Sunset Inn for a quick resupply. \"We'll only be here for about ten or fifteen minutes.\" the lead caravaner warned as he dismounted his horse and walked inside the door to the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have some time to kill before you continue to Scrap City, what do you want to do?</span></div></div>",

We need to get Paul to Scrap City as soon as we can so he can rest and heal up at Doc Sancho's place.\" One of the caravan members replied as he lit a cigarette. \"Don't worry though, we'll pass a few decent merchants on our way there if you want to stick with us a little longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head and remain silent until the city finally starts coming into view. Instead of heading straight to the Bluebrick Hotel like you planned you followed the caravaners to a small bazaar area made up of makeshift cloth tents, piled cinder blocks, old tires and rusty scrap metal. Nearby were settlers attending to a small garden and cooking something in a large metal pot. There was even a blacksmith smelting the scrap into useful tools and items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doc is a little further ahead, but everything you might need is here. Thanks again for saving my dad.\" the young caravaner says as you climb off your loaned horse and wave goodbye. Once they disappear behind a building you then turn your attention to the many open shops in this small market. You wanted to check them all, but it was almost sunset and getting later by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really didn't want to be walking around after dark so you quickly decided to check out one store before heading on your way.</span></div></div>",

NO! They got my pa!\" yelled the caravaner who had been riding next to you. Both you and him lined up shots at the window as you rode past and sent enough bullets flying to tear one of the boards clean off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud thump was heard from the inside as the bandit began choking on his own blood. One of you had scored a direct hit to his lung. As the silence slowly returned the caravan surrounded the building and a few brave souls stepped inside to check the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rigged shotgun nearly tore one of the men's heads off, but his partner was quick enough to push him out of the way that the blast only knocked an empty box off a nearby shelf.

With a well rested body and a eager desire to finally reach the city you head out and get back on the road almost immediately. As the lights on the neon Sunset Inn faded into the distance the early morning sun began to shine its warm rays over the barren wasteland before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of walking you headed off to the side of the road and have a short rest before it got to the hottest part of the day. After finding a rock that provided a decent amount of shade at the foot of a small hill you sat down to rest for a bit. Unfortunately, the peace and quiet was soon disturbed by the sound of gunshot ringing through the air as a woman screamed in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking you got up and pulled out your revolver, ready to deal with any trouble that came your way. As you slowly climb to the top of the hill to get a better look at the source of the disturbance a second shot rings out below you. Taking cover behind a rock you peer out at a small wooden cabin below where two armed thugs had a family at gunpoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks of it the family had a mother, a father, and three children who were crying over a dead dog lying on the ground whimpering. It was clear from the blood running down its chest that it had been shot and was slowly dying as the kids crowded around it. The mother and father quickly pull their children away as one of the thugs finishes it off with a point blank shot to the head with his SMG.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the last time we tell you, get those fuckin' hands up and lean back against the wall.\" the female sounding thug said as she raised her shotgun at the children who were now cowering next to their mother. If you didn't do something quick things were sure to get messy... the only question is what exactly do you plan to do...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnvironment: Urban, Wasteland</span></div></div>",

The bullet misses her head but connects with her spine at the base of her neck and sends her tumbling forward as the shotgun falls out of her hands. The male thug is distracted by this just long enough for the father to tackle him to the ground and keep him pinned as he fires off several rounds from his SMG.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thug eventually gets the upper hand and tosses him to the ground, but before he gets a chance to execute him you fire off another round that nails the back of the man's skull. The thug lets out a slight grunt as his brains spill out onto the father's pants and collapses on top of his SMG. Both of the attackers were now dead and the family was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waste no time in heading down to check up on them and are surprise when the father levels the SMG at you when you approach. \"Hold it, don't come any closer!\" he shouts in a gruff tone as he takes a step in front of his family. \"Who are you? Why did you kill those people... are you here to rob us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put both of your hands up to show that you're not a threat, but he doesn't take the gun off of you. \"I'm just a scavenger, I saw that you were being attacked so I helped. I'm on my way to Scrap City.\" you say calmly as you take a step forward. The man keeps the gun pointed at you for a few more seconds before lowering it and walking a bit closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make any sudden moves, me and my family were being accosted by thugs from the Crimson Peaks loan office. It's a small group of lone sharks, but we owed just enough money that they tried to collect it in blood to make an example of us. Those people you shot had been on us since we left Scrap City, I can't tell you how happy I am that you showed up.\" the father says as he reaches out to shake your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard of those scumbags.\" you reply as you shake the man's hand. \"But those guys are way small time, they won't follow you past the Neon Sunset Inn, much less Shady Oaks Park. I come from around there myself, if you head out now you could be in a nice safe motel room in just a few hours.\" The man's eyes light up when you mention this. \"Really? So we are close... we were staying in this run down cabin but if you could give us directions I can't tell you how grateful I'd be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and give him some directions while the mother takes the children inside to gather their supplies. In an hour the family is ready to head out and you are ready to get on with your journey. \"Thank you so much, stranger. I can't afford to give you much but please accept this.\" the father says as he hands you a small bag of supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\nAdd $25 plus 1 Wasteland Herbs, 1 Bag Of Batteries and 1 Charmed Necklace to your inventory.<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank him, but are surprised when he also hands you the keys to a car. \"What are these for?\" you ask with a puzzled look. \"When my family left the city I used almost every dime I had to gas up a small car that I have parked around back. It's almost out of fuel, but it should help you get to Scrap City quicker. With the Neon Sunset Inn so close my family won't have any trouble getting there on foot. Thanks again for everything.\" the man says as he shakes your hand one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and wave as they disappear around the side of the hill and head around to the back of the cabin to check out your new ride. It was a small jeep-like vehicle covered in rust and faded paint, but looks didn't matter if it ran smoothly. After a few turns of the key the little vehicle hums to life and you pull out onto the highway once again while kicking up a huge cloud of dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours pass slowly as you cruise along the broken stretches of highway with the wind blowing across your face. The gas tank does finally run dry as you come across the outskirts of Scrap City, though a short walk at this point was a minor inconvenience at worst. You abandon the car on the side of the road and head off into the city alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long you come across the Bluebrick Hotel which was run by an old friend of yours. After checking in and talking for a few minutes you head to your room and retire for the rest of the day. When tomorrow came you would be ready for it, but for now you were lost in a deep relaxing sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCongratulations, you've reached the end of chapter 1!

You take a deep breath to steady your nerves as you slowly and carefully make your way down the hillside. You could still hear them talking, that was probably a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take cover behind a dried up bush just in time to avoid one of the catching you and try to line up a shot from behind the tangle of pale brown branches in front of you. It was hard to get a good shot, but you did as best you could and aimed at the man who was a few feet closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a single shot rings out just seconds before you can pull the trigger and the father falls back against the cabin as a trail of blood paints the side, The mother and her children both scream, but their voices are quickly cut off by SMG fire. You are too late to save them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft groan of despair escapes your lips as the revolver falls from your hands and silently impacts a pile of sand below your feet. The thugs begin to search the cabin having not noticed your presence and are quickly on their way shortly after. All you can do is hold your breath as they silently pass by on their trip to the other side of the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong after you are sure they have left you retrieve your revolver and solemnly put it away. You take a few minutes to dump the bodies of the family in a nearby ditch with their dog and cover them with a thin layer of sand. It isn't much, but it was already an hour or so before sunset and you needed to make your way to the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk alone all throughout the night and sigh with relief as the lights of Scrap City finally come into view. You waste no time in heading to the Bluebrick Hotel and check in for the night. Since the place was run by an old friend you got the room for free, which was a small comfort after the day you've had.

I noticed this little incident from the top of that hill and would like to offer my services.\" you reply with your hands raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman laughs as she lowers her gun a bit and spits on the ground. \"Look honey, we got this covered and we don't intend to share our pay with a little gnat like you, so why don't you just screw off and take a hike back over that hill before I cramp this little old shotgun up your ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin and let out a light chuckle, hoping it would ease the tension a bit. \"Look, I'm not trying to muscle in on your job here, but you look like you could use some assistance.

The place wasn't too fancy, yet still a lot nicer than most other homes outside of the larger settlements. You set your stuff aside, strip to your underwear and lay back on the large circular bed while you wait for the bartender to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she promised she appeared in the doorway with her already loose shirt unbuttoned even farther than it had been when she had been at the bar. Her black bra had been clearly visible earlier, but now her skirt was low enough to confirm that she was wearing a matching pair of panties as well. \"You ready for this, lover?\" she asked as she struck a sexy pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come get yourself a piece, baby.\" you reply with that sexy smile returning to your face. The bartender, unable to contain her excitement further, unbuttons the last part of her shirt and casually tosses it aside followed by her skirt. The last think she does before jumping into bed with you is kick out her heels and lick her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see if you're as good as you think you are.\" she whispers into your ear before give you a sudden tongue kiss. \"Let's find out.\" you reply as you put a hand around her waist and pull her under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of intense lovemaking you both talk for a few minutes and drift off to sleep. The rest of the night is spent with you both sleeping soundly in each others arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\nFlip a coin and call it.

Aside from a few old trailers, houses and a run down series of boxcars on a rusty railroad track most of the town was safely tucked away in a wide cave mouth just under the cliff that gave the town its name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outcropping of rock from the cliff connected all the way to the side of the opposite hill, proving a nice bit of sturdy shelter for everyone in town. The chain-link fences and gates near both ends of the town were all the security this fortified little place needed. Hell, it was probably one of the safest places in the entire wasteland. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked through the open gate past a guard in leather armor that was dyed blue in places to show his authority as a member of the town police force. He tipped his hat as hat as you passed and welcomed you to town. From there you made your way over to the mouth of the cave as it looked like that was were most of the businesses were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrands of lights hung from the ceiling powered by an unseen generator and a big sign hanging over the archway of the cave between two buildings advertised many services that could be found ahead. Lined up were a few buildings that were easily recognized as bars, stores and even a small clinic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat caught your eye, however, was a small set of metal stairs leading deeper into the cave lit up a pink sign hanging overhead that read \"Diamond Moon Strip Club\" in big neon letters. At the end of the stairs about forty feet below was a thin metal door and a guy in a suit and sunglass with a sour look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been on the road all day and could use some entertainment, but it might also be a good idea to resupply before you head out tomorrow. What'll it be?</span></div></div>",

The inside of the trailer was small, but not cramped due to the owner knocking down several walls to make the kitchen, living room and one of the bedrooms into one big area lined with couches and tables. There was even a small spot where patrons could play pool near the sealed off back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked down a short hallway past a door leading to the restroom and took a seat in the kitchen area where a pile of crates and old doors had been turned into a counter of sorts.

If you want a shot yourself I'll just tack an extra five on your bill.\" she says as she opens the cabinet and takes out a bottle and two shot glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You lose $50.

You wrap an arm around Cherry and admire her tan lines as she wiggles out of her panties. \"Don't keep me waiting now.\" she says seductively as she lays down on the bed and rubs your back with her foot. \"Oh, will this work better if I take my clothes off too?\" you joke as you stand up and begin taking off your outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice bod for a waster.\" Cherry says as she licks her lips. \"You ready now?\" You grin and climb into bed with a look of hungry lust in your eyes. \"You cost me a pretty penny, now lets see if you're worth the money or just talk...\" you say as you embrace her and run your hand through her hair. \"Let's find out honey.\" Cherry says aggressively as she pulls you closer and buries your head in her cleavage. Seems she was tired of talking and ready for action.</span></div></div>",

She seems surprised at you taking the initiative but doesn't protest so you continue. You run your fingers over her nether regions and softly bite down on her ear as she lets out a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you like that, huh? Then you'll love this...\" you smirk as you grab her naked breast with your other hand and perform a few tricks with your fingers as she lets out another moan. \"Here's something I learned from a bar girl during a one night stand up in Brownsand.\" you whisper softly as you work your magic on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherry could do little more than groan in pleasure as you taught her a few new tricks she could use on her next client. \"He'll be a lucky guy... or gal.\" you think to yourself as Cherry rubs your back and begs you not to stop. The teasing and playing goes on for about twenty minutes or so before you decide to go in for the big finish. You pull Cherry close and she nearly screams in ecstasy as she orgasms in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was fun... but I'm not done just yet.\" you say as you give her a few seconds to recover and then go all out. She orgasms a second time as she shouts your name, shortly followed by yourself as you put a hand on the bed to steady yourself. \"Oh... oh my god... damn... that... that was the best I'd had in a long time... maybe years...\" Cherry whispers as she falls back onto the pillows propped up against the back end of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, your welcome honey...\" you say as you let out a gasp. Truth be told that little encounter took a lot out of you, but not quite as much as Cherry judging by her panting and sweat. You take a moment to look over her fine body and heaving breasts as you roll over next to her and pull the covers up to your chest. \"That... was nice!\" you say contentedly as you lay back and relax for a few minutes while Cherry shivers and lets out one last satisfied moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost half an hour of kicking back next to your recent lover you get up and go to put your clothes when you notice that Cherry is sound asleep. \"Wow, that must have taken a lot out of her.\" you whisper quietly to yourself. \"I knew I was pretty good at this, but not that good. Maybe I should have charged her...\" Suddenly a thought crosses your mind. With her out of it like this you could easily loot the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you couldn't take anything too big like a bottle of whiskey or the nice radio sitting on the desk, but there had to be something small and valuable to nab around here somewhere. After taking a moment to look over your surroundings you notice a small silver lock box sitting on the desk next to the radio. That might have something in it, but you have no time to hunt for a key. To get inside you'd have to improvise.</span></div></div>",

You glance back at Cherry to make sure she's still asleep and then carefully jiggled the thin tip of the switchblade inside the narrow keyhole. After several tense minutes you finally heard a soft click as the inner mechanism popped open the hinges. \"There we go.\" you say slyly as you put the switchblade away and pull the lid open to see what you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside were a few loose bills placed in a neat stack along with some exotic condoms and a small white paper bag. After opening the bag you realized it was STD meds and pocketed it just in case you picked up something nasty down the road. With a smile you then scooped up the fancy rubbers and cash and tucked them away. After sneaking one last glance at the sleeping Cherry you then closed the lock box shut and walked back over to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You gain $250, 2 French Ticklers and 1 Discreet Prescription.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few minutes to make sure your recent acquisitions were safely tucked away and secured on your person you gently nudged Cherry awake while sitting on the edge of the bed. She yawned softly and rubbed her eyes as she sat up, which was surprisingly adorable. \"Shit, how long was I out? Sorry about that.\" she replied as she tossed aside the covers and climbed out of bed to retrieve her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few minutes, don't worry. I almost didn't notice, though I did enjoy the view.\" you answer as you lean back and rest your hands on the soft rolled up blanket. Cherry giggles and straightens her bra before walking over and kissing you on the cheek. \"Thanks for that, now lets go check out before they start worryin' about you and send someone back here. Of course, feel free to come back any time it strikes your fancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and open the door for her after making sure you didn't misplace anything. She wrapped her arm around yours and smiled as you both walked back into the main lobby. \"Here we are, go ahead and check my number one customer out.\" she says as the woman behind the counter gets your stuff. \"Damn, its rare to hear Cherry say something like that. What did you two get up to?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin and check your stuff to make sure it was all here. \"Oh, you know. Kinky stuff. Handcuffs, whips, blowtorches... I think a chicken or two may have been involved.\" you reply with a laugh and are surprised to see this manages to get a grin out of a few of the nearby guards. \"Anyway, I should hit the road. Big day tomorrow, lots of traveling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say goodbye to Cherry and wink as she blows you a kiss. \"Take care, I'll try to visit the next time I pass through.\" you call back before heading out and going to the Boxa Nova Hotel. This little vacation had been just what you needed and you were looking forward to getting a good nights sleep before your big trip tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a restful night you wake up early enough to help your new caravan friends get packed up before you get back on the road. The day goes by surprisingly fast as your mounts scurry under the vast blue sky. The biggest obstacle to get through was the late afternoon heat, which was something to be thankful for, all things considered. By sundown you could see Scrap City coming up in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dropping you off near the outer edge of the city your new friends parted ways and wished you luck on your journey. You waved goodbye as they disappeared behind a crumbling building and headed further down the street past the outskirts. It wasn't long before you came to the Bluebrick Hotel, which was run by an old friend of yours. After a short greeting you retired to a free room and climbed into bed. You didn't have a partner to share it with this time but if tomorrow was as good as today had been you wouldn't complain, that's for sure</span></div></div>",

Oh well, you got laid and you'd likely arrive in Scrap City by tomorrow evening, that's a pretty good outcome all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relax a bit and smile once Cherry wakes up from her little nap. \"Don't worry, it's still tonight. Of course, I wouldn't blame you for sleeping until morning after an experience like that.\" you say playfully as she rubs her eyes. She smiles back as she puts an arm around you. \"I'm a pretty light sleeper lover, besides I probably still have some more clients to see tonight. Of course, you could always pay for another round. I wouldn't complain.\" she replies with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both laugh and chat for a few minutes while you get dressed and then head back out to the front desk to check out. \"Seriously though, thanks for that.\" Cherry says as you collect your stuff. \"It's been far too long since I got a chance to enjoy myself like that.

You have a nice night and be sure to visit us again.\" she replies as you wave to Jim and then head out the main door. Tonight was definitely fun, but you still had a big trip tomorrow, better get some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving back at the Boxa Nova Hotel you head up to the room where your new traveling buddies were staying and soon drift off to peaceful sleep. The next morning you wake up just before noon to find your new friends preparing to head off and quickly join them as they get back on the road and leave Kniferock point behind. For hours you travel in the burning midday sun but just when you felt like you were going to die of heatstroke a distant cityline appeared on the horizon. You were finally here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few words of farewell upon reaching the city limits you parted ways with your new friends and headed into Scrap City alone with the bright hues of the setting sun wrapping the sky in the cool air of night. After a short time walking down city streets dotted with dim lights and trashcan fires you came to a large building that towered over most others in the immediate area. It was the Bluebrick Hotel, a place ran by an old friend who would offer you a free room during your stay in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking in and having a brief chat with your old friend you head up to your room for a much needed stay in a cozy bedroom and soon drift off to sleep.

Apparently, this wasn't the first time someone was stupid enough to kill themselves through misuse of a sexbot in this town. Ah well, there are worse ways to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning your new caravan friends can't find you and are forced to leave town by themselves. They would never learn your ultimate fate, but that was probably for the best. It's just a shame that you'll never make it to Scrap City and see what your boss would have given you now. So ends your story... on a pile of trash covered in used condoms and discarded beer bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You lose all hit points and die.]</span></div></div>",

It would have been nice to join one of them, but it had been a while since you traveled on the main roads and felt that bandit and raider attacks were too much of a risk. Luckily, you had picked up many survival skills during your time as a wastelander and knew how to properly navigate the wilderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaying off the roads would delay your arrival by a few days, but if you cut across some of the more rural stretches of land you'd be able to arrive a lot sooner than navigating around them would take. Normally, this would be extremely dangerous, but significantly less so to someone like you who knew how to live off the land and make a proper camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take one last look at Shady Wood Park and begin hiking down the broken road as the sun climbed across the sky. Once you passed your first landmark and were sure you were on the right path you stepped off the road and began climbing over a small hillside that led to a field of burnt trees and shriveled bushes. It had been a little over an hour since you set out, but if you managed to keep up a good pace you'd have a nice spot to sleep before night came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the sun began setting you came to a run down cobblestone shack at the foot of a large cliffside overlook. You had learned about it from a wastelander back in Shady Wood Park in exchange for one of your water bottles. Just as he had said, it had broken windows and no door, but was a safe enough place to spend the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step inside the tiny room and take a quick look around as you wipe a bead of sweat from your brow. The place was fairly basic, no furniture save for a torn and faded red rug, a single wooden chair with a loose leg and a dirty mattress covered with a thin dusty sheet. In the far corner was a large piece of wooden fencing that you guess was to serve as a makeshift door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a seat on the mattress and put your equipment on the floor while you took a swig of water from a clear plastic bottle. \"I'll spend the night here and head out early tomorrow.\" you say to yourself as you enjoy a brief supper and dose off to the sounds of bugs buzzing around outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning comes quickly enough and you get up just as the sun begins peeking through the tiny windows on the east side of the tiny house. You decide to skip breakfast in favor of getting back on the road as soon as possible, only to discover a loose floorboard when you accidentally pull over a corner of the red rug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the board out and discover a small secret stash hidden underneath. There wasn't much there, just a few trinkets and junk stored away from prying eyes. Still, you never know what might come in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You find 1 Pornographic Magazine, 1 Absinthe, 1 Go Outside Monthly, 1 Workin' Indoors and 2 Handful Of Scrap. You may add any number of these items to your inventory.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter securing the board back into place you pull away the wooden fencing and head out into the cool morning air. \"It'll start getting hot again in a few hours. I should get moving.\" you note as you look up at the endless sky slowly losing its orange hue in favor of a much softer blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking all morning you come to a large forest area where the trees actually still had a bit of green to them, even if most of it was moss and giant fungus splotches growing on the rotted bark. You could cut through the forest to save time or head around it and take a path leading up the nearby hillside.</span></div></div>",

With a deep breath you take a seat for a few minutes to rest and enjoy some peace and tranquility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I better plan out my next move while I'm here...\" you think to yourself as you look towards the bottom of the hillside. In the distance you could see the highway looping around near the base of the hill next to this one. If you weren't mistaken there was a small rest stop located just a few miles up the road that might have some good stuff for trade. The area surrounding it was pretty civilized too, with few bandits and highwaymen to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, there was a fork in the path just before you got to the bottom that looped around the hill towards the west.

After carefully stepping around a large Sand Hornet nest you were back on the road. The asphalt was scorching hot at this time of the day, but it would be worth it if this trading post had some good stuff for sale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked you were sure to keep a hand on your revolver just in case you did run into some kind of cutthroat. They were pretty rare in these parts, but experience taught you that even civilized places can have unexpected danger. Fortunately, the short trip was uneventful and in just under two hours you were walking up to a small outpost on the side of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was pretty small, just a few tents, a small storage house and a large market stand with a few shelves of merchandise and a thin metal roof covering it. Aside from a few military types in heavy armor there were a few workers moving stuff around or fixing things up at a nearby table as well as a clerk watching over the stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a big smile as you walk up and takes a sip of her soda. \"Hello traveler, welcome to the Silverpine Outpost. I'm Sally, what can we do for you today?\" she greets you with an excitement that wasn't too common in most places. You wave and rest your hand on the counter as you pause to catch your breath a bit. \"Hi, I'm just passing through on my way to Scrap City. Can I see what you have for trade?\" you reply to her as you look over the various goods lining the shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, we've got lots of stuff, though I should warn you that we only take Caps for most of it.\" Sally says as she gets out a clipboard and looks over it. \"Most of our recent acquisitions come from a big merchant company out in the Dustbox region and they prefer using Caps as currency. We do have some local products we can still accept cash for though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, let me have a look.\" you say as you get out your money. \"I know I've got at least a few Caps on me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(2) Wasteland Herbs  20$<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(3) Tribal Tea 11$<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(2) Pack Of Cigarettes 24$<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(2) Morphine 37$<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(5) Moonshine 14$<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneakers 28$<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiss Army Knife 35$<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(3) Handful Of Scrap 8$<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(2) Absinthe 2c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasteland Martini 3c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(4) Aspirin 1c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(2) Steroids 2c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(5) Condom 1c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(2) Anti-Venom 1c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(3) Roasted Meat Chunk 1c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(2) Grilled Steak 2c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotorcycle Helmet 3c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh Heels 3c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky Rabbit's Foot 2c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(3) Bag Of Batteries 1c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(4) Soap 1c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your business is concluded you are about to leave but Sally stops you as you turn around. \"Hey, are you alone? I thought you were part of a caravan or something but if you're heading out by yourself you must not be waiting for anyone, huh? You shouldn't leave here without someone else, especially for the stretch of road up ahead.\" she warns you in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a smile and flash your revolver. \"Thanks for the concern, but I've got plenty of protection. I'm gonna be heading back offroad in another mile or so anyway. Is there something I should watch out for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally gets a worried look on her face as looks up at the sky. \"It'll be getting dark before too long and we've been getting reports of Nightcrawlers swarming in the passage up ahead. Word is they're pretty bad this season, nearly wiped out an entire caravan that got too close to their nests. Even if you could handle a couple the rest would swarm you before you could get away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned as you looked up at the sun beginning its slow descent west. Camping in the wastes was hard enough without worrying about these things grabbing you in the night. Sleeping near the road would be suicide if any gangs were in the area, which left you few options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suggest?\" you finally ask as you walk back over to talk to Sally. She looks over at the workers and guards and then checks her clipboard again. \"Well, let's see. We have a driver free for the next several hours and a few guardsmen who could give you an escort. It would be a little expensive, but you would be a lot safer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown again as you think over your options. Maybe you could convince them to help you out? If not you'd have a pretty big problem on your hands.</span></div></div>",

After several minutes of shrewd negotiating you finally managed to work out a deal with the Silverpine Outpost driver and were soon on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy was decked out in some pretty nice combat armor and wore aviator sunglasses and a bandanna around his shaggy light brown hair. He had introduced himself as Kyle right before you left the Outpost but hadn't said too much since you got on the road, though he did bob his head a bit to a CD he had playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I see the pass coming up ahead.\" you say as the jeep rounds a corner past a large rock sprayed with faded graffiti. \"Yep, we'll have to be pretty quiet once we get up ahead.\" Kyle replies as he lights up a cigarette and checks to make sure his assault rifle has a fresh mag. \"It'll be sundown in another hour and them Nightcrawlers won't take too kindly to any noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head as Kyle turns off the music and slows the vehicle down a bit. \"Don't forget, you promised me half of any loot we find on our way through as part of our deal. I ain't expecting to get much out of this little errand, but I'd like to at least recover my buddy Rob's body from the wreck.\" he says as he exhales a ring of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I didn't know you lost any friends to these things, I'm sorry.\" you say as you check your revolver to make sure its fully loaded. Kyle smiles and toss you a spare box of revolver ammo. \"There are a few rounds left in there for your revolver, be sure to load it if you haven't already. We don't want to be taking any chances with these things. The plan is to get in and get out quick as we can, but you never know out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank Kyle and put the spare bullets in a spot where you'd have easy access to them in a pinch. After a few more minutes of driving you reach the passage and bask in the cool shade of the towering rock walls. The place wasn't as narrow as you had expected but still pretty creepy. A few dens, burrows and bone piles could be seen just off the road, most animals but also a few that looked distinctly human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle raises a finger to his lips and and whispers to keep your voice down until you're back out in the open. Up ahead near a large cavern opening was the remains of a massacre spread out from the road all the way to the mouth of the cave. Dead horses, half eaten bodies, bags and boxes strewn about and a large trail of blood leading deeper inside the nearby rock tunnels. This was the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we'll only have a half hour or so at the most to grab stuff so lets secure what we can to the jeep and then collect some smaller stuff.\" Kyle whispers as he shuts off the engine and opens the door. You nod your head and follow him up to the ruined caravan, revolver ready to draw at the first sign of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Kyle to find and secure Rob's body, which had been almost torn to shreds along with both his children. As for Rob's poor wife all you managed to recover was her severed head. \"Jesus, I'm sorry Kyle. I don't thing we'll be able to find any more of them.\" you say as you step over a severed arm clutching a kitchen knife. Kyle merely nods his head and covers the remains with a sheet before tossing them in the back seat of the jeep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That takes care of the personal stuff. We still got about ten minutes to grab what we can. Hurry up and let's get the fuck out of this godforsaken place.\" he replies as he grabs a duffel bag from behind his seat.

These hoof prints indicate that at least two of the horses fled inside, which means most of their supplies are likely to be in good condition. Don't worry, I know how to be careful.\" you reply as Kyle shakes his head and lets out a week laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, its your funeral. I'm staying by our ticket out of here and booking it at the first sign of noise. If you can't make it back without any new friends I'll be forced to leave you. We clear?\" he replies as he stuffs a small first aid kit into his duffel bag. You turn and give him a thumbs up along with a confident smile. He merely rolls his eyes and resumes scavenging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the cavern was dark, but you dared not risk any sort of light. With night fast approaching you'd need to focus on the areas that were still lit up by beams of light peering in through cracks and the mouth of the cavern itself. Even in the dim interior of the rocky room ahead you could make out a few slender shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems I've found the Nightcrawlers...\" you think to yourself as you step over a puddle of water and grab a stalactite for support as you crossed over a jagged pile of rubble. You had seen these nasty creatures before during your mining days, though you had only directly encountered them twice. They were large worm-like lizards with eight legs, clawed hands and large jaws lined with sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKilling one or two was no big deal if you knew their weaknesses, even a dozen would be manageable with soon good backup, but taking on a whole nest with just a revolver? Suicide. You were far too deep inside now to run if they woke up and with Kyle leaving at the first sign of noise you wouldn't have any form of escape even if you did somehow make it back outside. To survive this you would have to be quick and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a small sigh of relief when you see a headless horse carcass propped up against a boulder up ahead. In front of the horse remains was a mangled man in a cowboy hat who had large chunks torn from his body. It was a grisly sight, but the saddle bags strapped to the horse proved you had made the right decision in coming inside to loot supplies. With a few careful steps you passed a slumbering Nightcrawler and bent down to check what the saddle bags contained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to basic goods like books and socks was a bit of advanced tech and some chemicals stored in tiny vials. You take some of the more valuable stuff and look over the exotic remaining loot to see if you could figure out what was worth taking. After a few minutes you pack up what you can and prepare to head back out to meet up with Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If you have the Drug Crafter perk you may add 2 Steroids and 2 LSD to your inventory.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If you have the Explosive Crafter perk you may add 3 TNT and 1 Homemade Bomb to your inventory.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Add 2 Bitter Root, 3 Condoms, 1 Silencer, 1 Lab Coat, 1 Stylish Sunglasses, 1 Wasteland Herbs and 5 Junk to your inventory.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way out you carefully step over another sleeping Nightcrawler and gently step down from a small cliff onto the lower floor of the cave that led outside. You grin as you step back into the warm air and notice Kyle securing the last of his loot in the back seat of the jeep. You wait a few seconds for him to turn around and then hold up a few of the items you found on the dead horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. I thought you couldn't do it... I thought for sure I'll be pulling outta that mess alone and leaving you to the Nightcrawlers. That was some damn impressive work you pulled off.\" Kyle says in an impressed tone as he starts yo the jeep. \"Now hop in and lets get out of here. I still gotta drop you off at Scrap City before I can head back with my haul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and get inside as a few noises echo from the caves. \"Nice timing...\" Kyle mumbles as he pulls away from the ruined caravan and speeds down the road. It is already dark by the time you reach Scrap City, but the rest of the trip was smooth and uneventful. \"Take care of yourself and thanks for helping me out back there. It was damn good working with ya.\" Kyle calls as he lights up a smoke and drives off into the night. \"See ya!\" you call back as you turn to look over the sprawling metropolis in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you didn't have anyway to carry or transport the excess goods you found at the caravan wreck you had to work out a deal with Kyle on the way here. He offered you a flat one hundred dollars for your share but when you pointed out that a lot of it was near mint condition stuff taken from the cave he agreed to throw in a little extra. Just as well, honestly, as you had no use for half the stuff you found, though you did keep a few of the more practical goods for your journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You gain $125.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you wanted to hit the town after finally arriving you were exhausted from everything you had done today and headed straight for the Bluebrick Hotel to get a good nights rest.

After saying your goodbyes to Kyle and wishing him luck you headed over to the Bluebrick Hotel. An old friend of yours ran the place and gave you a free room to stay at during your time in the city. You thanked him and retired to your bed for the night, exhausted from your long journey. As you drifted off to sleep you thought of the next phase of your trip and about what future rewards fate would have in store for you.</span></div></div>",

You hadn't talked much with them since you negotiated terms about an hour ago, but you had learned that their names were Brie and Alexander. They were both seasoned mercs and had known each other for roughly a year now since they both joined up with the Silverpine Outpost around the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky was getting a bit darker and from the looks of things your two bodyguards were looking to go around the outer edge of the pass to avoid the Nightcrawler nests. You didn't like the idea of camping for the night, but it was probably your best option at this point. Traveling around in the dark could be dangerous in an area like this and camping too close to the city would probably get all your throats slit in your sleep by bandits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll more for about another hour, then find a spot to make camp.\" Alexander called back to you as he looked over the towering stone that made up the passage. \"If we keep moving we'll be able to cut around the pass in the morning and make to Scrap City tomorrow.\" You nodded your head to show you understood and put a hand on your revolver as you looked over the surrounding open wastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't a lot of cover in this area, which would make it hard to find a good camping spot. Brie had what looked like a small tarp on her back which would make a decent tent, though that was about it. None of you even had any good sleeping bags. What bothered you the most wasn't the discomfort though, it was the danger. Nightcrawlers loved to hunt in packs, but some were solitary enough to catch prey on their own. If one found its way to your camp in the night you'd be in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a modest supper at the base of a crumbling cliff you all decided it was a good time to begin looking for a campsite. You had about an hour of daylight left and would need to find someplace safe and secure. Alexander suggested that you move up ahead along the passage to find a snug little corner at the base of the cliffside. Brie liked the idea, but was concerned about stumbling across a small Nightcrawler nest and suggested they find a spot further out away from the passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't think either option sounded particularly great, but both mercs looked at you to be the tiebreaker. Alexander had a point that the rock wall would give great protection, though Bries concerns over stray Nightcrawlers was extremely valid. Staying out in the open would eliminate the Nightcrawler danger, but the group would be sitting ducks if some other form of trouble came across them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith night fast approaching you'd have to made a decision soon...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After spending several minutes walking along the jagged side of the rocky passage you came across a small vein of Glowing Ore that had been embedded into the face of the rock at some point in the past. Normally, you would smile at your good fortune, but part of the deal you struck with the mercs was relinquishing all valuables the group finds to them. You sigh as Alexander pulls a pick from his belt and chips a few chucks of the ore free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I told you this was the best choice!\" he says happily as he splits his small fortune with his friend. \"Yeah, good call Alex.\" Brie replies as she packs away her share of the tiny greenish rocks. You fold your arms and wait for them to get done celebrating when she tosses you a spare chunk of the ore. \"Huh? What's this for?\" you ask as you catch the tiny rock. \"Me and Alex just made a thousand dollars easily, more than enough to cover this trip. I figure you might need some cash once you get to Scrap City, it's a bad place to be broke.\" she replies with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You gain 1 Glowing Ore.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank her as you pocket the valuable little space stone and continue onward as the sun sets in the night sky. Thankfully, it doesn't take long to find a nice little bend in the rock formation that gave you perfect cover from both the weather and any random rock slides. It almost seemed too good to be true but there it was. \"There. That's the spot!\" Alexander said happily as he walked under the smooth rock and set his supplies down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice find.\" Brie says as she walks over and sets her own pack down right beside his. \"We found this place just in time. I'll get a fire going while you guys set up camp.\" You and Alexander both nod your heads in unison as he begins taking some supplies out of his pack. The three of you then get to work making your new little home a little more livable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were all done a nice sizzling fire was cracking and popping in the cold inky blackness of the night and a nice warm blanket was spread out over the hard ground. The thing was old and tattered, but it would make a nice comfortable bed for the evening. Brie even had a long folded up pillow you could all use packed away, which was a nice bonus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything nicely put into place Alexander pulled out an old bottle of scotch from his pack and poured everyone a drink. There was only about half a bottle left, so it went quickly, but it was a nice taste of luxury you hadn't expected. You all spent the next several hours talking about what you would do with your newfound wealth and what you hoped the future held as you got ready for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night went by peacefully for the first few hours, not so much as a peep from any vermin or insects... but at about three in the morning disaster struck. A loud scream shook you out of your tranquil sleep and you immediately went for your gun. The voice was immediately familiar, it was Brie screaming her lungs out as something skittering just beyond the long extinguished campfire menaced her in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck! FUCK! I can't see!\" you shouted as you raised the revolver in the pitch blackness of the morning as another scream broke out from slightly further away. Immediately, a spark of light erupted from a tiny lighter as Alexander got out of bed. \"I'll light the campfire! Help Brie, goddamn it!\" he yelled as he rushed over and ignited the ashy remains of the once roaring flame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fire off a shot in the night sky, hoping to either scare off or at least get a better look at your target. No such luck. You dashed past the fire Alexander was making and tried to follow the screaming. In all this darkness it was hard to find your mark, but a loud gasp of pain clued you in to where Brie was. You knew you couldn't hope to properly hit whatever monster had caught Brie without risking a fatal shot on her so you grab a heavy rock on the ground and ran over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hiss passed the lips of a hungry Nightcrawler as it loosened its grip on its potential prey and lashed out at you from void. A quick shot gave you a brief look at its hungry face and Brie's shaking form mere feet away. You quickly nailed the creature with a follow up shot that took off a nice chunk of its head. The thing feel to the ground with a thud as you rushed over to Brie with your rock and revolver still in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to ask if she was okay when you heard more skittering legs coming closer. You were surrounded...</span></div></div>",

You pulled the trigger twice on your revolver and felt slightly relieved as the beast collapsed to the dirt mere inches from your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie was moaning softly as the others went in for the kill and you rushed over to defend her. You had maybe one bullet left in the chamber and no time to reload so you waited for the creatures to make their move first. A final shot rang out before you clicked on an empty chamber... and one more Nightcrawler hit the dirt on the edge of your vision. You eyes were a bit more adjusted to the darkness now and aided by the growing light of the campfire flame... hopefully, it would be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me...\" Brie cried out in a weakened voiced as the two remaining Nightcrawlers closed in on their prey. \"Shit, this isn't gonna be fun.\" you groan as make a desperate swing with your revolver. To your surprise it grazes the body of the nearest crawler causes it to hiss aggressively at you. Without missing a beat you then follow up with the rock in your other hand and bash the bastard's brains in. It sinks to the ground and twitches as you finish it off with a stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fresh scream then escapes Brie's lips as the last Nightcrawler bites down on her hand. You immediately rush over to help swing for the crawler's head. Unfortunately, it let's go of brie at the last second and pounces on you. The surprise attack knocks you off your feet and sends your revolver rolling off into the dirt. The thing attempts to rip out your throat, but you manage to shove your rock into its mouth and throw it off before it can slash or bite you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to get Brie to her feet while the Nightcralwer writhes on the ground. Then a single burst of gunfire cuts through the night and sends streaks of gooey mutant insides splattering over the nearby rocks and ground. Alexander said nothing as he moved over to you as quick as he was able in the dim light. \"We're over here, Brie's hurt!\" you call out to him as he nearly trips on a tall rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brie, oh my god, I'm so sorry...\" Alexander blurts out as he get his partner back on her feet and you move back over to the campsite. Brie was just barely conscious and had lost a lot of blood from two separate bite wounds on her left hand and arm. That was probably for the best, however, as Nightcrawler saliva, while mildly venomous on it's own, was filled with deadly bacteria and germs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you both stretch her out over the makeshift bed Alexander begins sobbing as he finally sees the damage done to his friend in the light of the fresh campfire. Her fingers were already red, swollen and puffy and the skin around the bite wounds was slowly becoming discolored and bruised. \"We've gotta take off the hand...\" Alex choked out finally as he pulled a hatchet out and sterilized it with the last few sips of scotch in the bottle you all enjoyed earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll hold her down and keep her steady.\" you replied in as comforting a tone as you could manage. Alexander only nodded his head as he wiped away his tears and laid out her arm over a fresh cloth. Thankfully, Brie had passed out from shock, blood loss, trauma or all three and wouldn't be awake for this. With a few careful yet swift whacks her hand and the damaged part of her arm as severed about seven inches below the elbow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resulting wound was the cauterized with a spare log from the fire and bandaged. It wasn't pretty in the slightest, but it would do until she could get proper medical treatment and probably let her keep most of her arm. You quickly disposed of the now purplish-red hand away from the camp as Alexander watched over his sleeping friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of you managed to get anymore sleep that morning, but that was the least of your worries. Brie woke up to Alexander applying a fresh bandage on her stump and broke down in tears as he held her close. There was little you could do but watch and pack up camp as Alex got Brie ready to finish the last mile of this little road trip. By noon you were all packed and ready to head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all my fault. If I had just listened to Brie she'd be okay right now. We'd all be okay.\" Alexander moaned as he wiped some fresh tears from his eyes. \"You don't know that.\" you replied as you looked out across the winding edge of the passage. \"If we hadn't camped there we might have all died. You could have saved Brie's life with your choice.\" Alex lets out a bitter laugh as he gathers up his supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm a real hero. I'm glad you sided with me.\" he replies in a darkly sarcastic tone. At this point Brie gets to her feet and walks over with an upset look on her face. \"Hey Alex, you know that's not fair!\" she says in an upset yet calm tone. \"We survived the night and got a good haul. Once we sell off this Glowing Ore I'll be able to afford any surgery or medicine I might still need... maybe even get a prosthetic augmentation. I've had my eye on a certain model for a while now.\" She then finishes by giving a soft laugh and putting her good hand on Alex's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks up at her and you can't tell if he smiles or frowns. \"Heh, I guess we could go that.\" he finally replies back as you walk ahead to give them a little space. \"A cyber arm might come in handy during our next job. I always thought the ones with the retractable blades were pretty cool... it'd definitely make you look like a badass. Well, more of a badass...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both share a laugh as you begin heading around the other end of the rocky passage back towards the road. As unpleasant as this little detour was, it didn't delay you by much. In another hour or two you'd be back on the road and it in the next five to seven hours you should finally arrive at Scrap City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, just over six hours later you were moving along the outskirts of the city under the early evening sky. You were glad you managed to make it before nightfall, another night of camping might have just sent you off the deep end, Nightcrawlers or not. You slow your pace a little as you allow your companions to catch up and gather near a rusted fence running along the side of the road leading out of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the help, I don't think I could have made it without you.\" you say as you dig out the piece of Glowing Ore they gave you the other day. \"I've got plenty of cash, if you need this to help pay medical bills go ahead and take it.\" They both exchange glances and smile as Brie folds your hand over it. \"That's sweet of you to offer, but we'll be fine. We both got a plenty big haul, besides I want to thank you for saving my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give them both a smile and wave goodbye as you each head down separate streets. \"Take care of yourselves.\" you call out. \"Hey, we're a couple of seasoned mercs, give us some credit, waster!\" Brie calls back playfully as Alexander lets out one last little chuckle. Even after everything that happened you feel like those two will be alright, especially with their newfound riches. Speaking of which, you had your own fortune to seek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short stroll to a towering building located deeper inside the city you breathe a sigh of relief and head inside. An old friend of yours ran this place, the Bluebrick Hotel, and would set you up with a free room while you prepared for the next leg of your journey. As much as you wanted to chat and catch up you were exhausted and immediately crashed in your snug hotel bed for the night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You gave Alexander a shrug and a nod to Brie. \"Alright, we'll go find a spot out in the wastes.\" you say as you point towards the western skyline. \"Let's just hurry up, we'll be in deep shit if we get stuck out in the open without any light.\" Alexander let's out a soft groan as Brie gives you a smile and a wink. \" I see our new friend here is more than just a pretty face.\" she replies as she takes the lead and you all begin marching away from the side of the passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of walking you noticed a small structure sticking out of a wispy sand dune about two or three hundred feet away. It was hard to make out in the dim light, but it might just be what you were all looking for. \"Nice find.\" Brie replies in a somewhat flirty sounding tone as you all begin walking over to it. \"Let's see what we got.\" Alexander replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get closer it becomes clear that the object is a ransacked wooden wagon, a somewhat uncommon sight in this part of the wasteland due to the scarcity of horses and other critters that could pull them. It looked like it had been out here for years, maybe even decades judging from its chipped wooden frame and faded torn cloth. The wheels were made of metal but had long since rusted and the only signs of its former inhabitants were sun bleached bones strewn about in the surrounding area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh, talk about a nasty bandit attack.\" Brie said suddenly to break the eerie silence. \"Just look at the arrows sticking out of this thing, whoever did this nailed the driver right in the left temple from the looks of it.\" In the fading light to was a bit hard to spot but it soon became apparent that Brie was right as you got closer. A lone skeleton stood at the helm of this once noble vessel, reigns still in hand and a thin broken arrow point out of his cracked skull. Lovely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep an eye out.\" Alexander warned as he scanned the nearby surroundings for movement. \"This looks like it happened a while back, but the people who did it could still be in the area. We'll have to set up camp here, it'll be too dark to move in another half hour, if that. At least we'll have some decent cover in that thing once we throw the tarp over it. No sleeping on the ground tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Alex.\" Brie teased playfully as she pulled an arrow from the wagon's side. \"No way the asshole's that did this are still around, the nearest road is over a mile away from here. They'd have a pretty long walk if they wanted to come back, let's just get the camp set up and eat... I'm starving.\" Alexander merely rolled his eyes and started unpacking. \"Give me a hand with this, will you?\" he calls to you as he begins making a campfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over and help him set up a proper campsite while Brie pulls the rest of the arrows out of your temporary home and gets the tarp set up. It didn't fully cover the destroyed roof of the wagon, but it would be good enough for a single night as long as it didn't rain or a sandstorm started kicking up. At the very least, it was better than sleeping on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all enjoy a quick supper as you tell stories about what you planned to do once you reached Scrap City and have a quick look around the area before settling in. As you are looking around you and Brie stumble upon a small metal box uncovered by the sand near a small skull that resemble that of a young child or teenager. Gruesome, but you were never one to trun away free supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie picks it up and brings it over to Alexander, who had better experience with locks than she did. It took him almost an hour to get the thing open, though the click of the rusted lock brought a quick smile to everyone's faces. You let out a sigh as he flips it open to reveal several magazines stacked inside, which counted as loot that you had offered to the mercs as part of your deal. You didn't expect to find much stuff so close to the city so it seemed like a smart offer, but now you felt like kicking yourself for not haggling better terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enjoy the leftover food as Brie and Alexander divide up their shares of the bounty. \"Here, you should take these.\" Alex says with a smile as he hands you a small stack of the magazines. \"Are you sure? I promised to turn over stuff like this to you guys until we got to Scrap City as part of our deal.\" you reply in a somewhat confused tone. He laughs and holds up his own stack of magazines. \"Don't worry, me and Brie found plenty of duplicates and thought you might enjoy having some reading material for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give him a smile as you put the gifts away for safekeeping. \"Thanks, it's been about two or three years since I had some fresh books to read. These'll definitely be good to have during my down time while I'm in the city, you guys are pretty awesome traveling companions.\" you reply. Brie and Alex both smile as they put away their own stacks and head over to the wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, you wouldn't mind joining us in bed tonight, would you cutie?\" Brie asks as she climbs into the back of the wagon. The suddenness of the proposal surprises you and catches you off guard. Despite the flirty tone she took earlier you figured she was just messin' around or trying to be polite for you agreeing with her... you hadn't expected her to be serious. \"You don't mean you want me to accompany you by having a threesome, do you?\" you reply in a slightly awkward tone. Subtlety was out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes, I reckon we do.\" Brie says with a sweet laugh. \"We got this comfy little shelter instead of the hard ground, why not enjoy ourselves a little?\" she replies as take a swig of water. \"It's cool with me.\" Alexander replies as he puts an arm around his friend. \"It's been a while since I had a threesome, I wouldn't mind some double action for the night. Of course, it's cool if you wanna pass, we ain't gonna be insulted or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your chin as you glance over at the magazines the two gave you earlier. As nice as it would be to chill and get in some light reading before bed it wasn't every day you were offered a threesome by two reasonably attractive mercs in a dirty old wagon. It wouldn't be boring to just read a little, but it wouldn't be nearly as exciting as getting intimate with your new friends either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You may choose to have sex or not. If you do flip a coin. If the result is tails you get the Sprained Groin STD and -1 to your Speech skill for the next 3 pages.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll all is said and done the three of you drift off to peaceful sleep in the back of the wagon and rest for several hours. Unfortunately, by the time you wake up you find yourselves in a bit of a pickle. A man with a thick bushy beard and eyepatch is watching you intently as you slowly open your eyes. Immediately, he smiles and waves with his free hand as his other hand clenches a makeshift spear made from a pair of knives attached to a broom handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' sunshine. I didn't wake you did I?\" he says with a laugh as a few of his buddies approached from outside. You stayed calm as they pulled down the tarp and sat up slowly as the bright morning sun washed over the wagon. \"No screaming? No begging? Not even a little whimpering? You must be a seasoned waster, huh?\" the man asks in a friendly tone as his crew share chuckles among themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you what?\" you say evenly as you lowered your hand onto your revolver hidden beneath the covers of the fallen tarp. There were about a dozen guys surrounding you, all carrying melee weapons like baseball bats, golf clubs and crowbars. Easy to take out with your fully loaded revolver, but you'd only get half before the others would descend upon you... and that's if you managed six headshots in about three seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just your loot, friend.\" the leader says as he stands up and hops off the wagon. \"I'm Draco of the Slick 69s, you're not on our current shitlist so you can go if you hand over all of your valuables. Resist and we'll have to kill you, might even use a couple of you afterwards... got a few here into that shit. But you cooperate, you walk. You have my word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around at the various gang members smirking and grinning at you. Most only wore leather jackets, t-shirts and vests, though a few had some basic armor. Metal pads, kevlar vests and one guy who was wearing an old gas mask with broken lenses. All easy enough to take down, but you were still outnumbered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should choose your next actions very carefully.</span></div></div>",

We run shit out here, now hand over your goods or we'll start smashing your soft goods.\" he threatens as he leans on the front of the wagon. \"You want to be the next asshole I run through with the end of this spear? If not, I suggest you wipe that smile off your face and wake your two buddies up, I doubt they'll wanna sleep through this shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he finishes the words you pull out your revolver and level it at his chest. \"A gunshot'll wake them up pretty fast, so unless you wanna be today's alarm clock I suggest you and your crew fuck off before I get pissed and ventilate some of that smugness out a couple of new assholes for you.\" you reply as he grits his teeth and withdraws his spear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck? What kind of psycho sleeps with their weapon like that?\" Draco growls as he followers look at each other nervously. \"I'm guessing you're just a petty street gang from the city, then?\" you reply in a confident tone as you keep the barrel of you gun leveled right at his chest. \"You're clearly only been out here a short time or you'd know that people who don't prepare end up dead. Am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco attempts to regain some of his composure as he grins wickedly. \"Ha! You got us, I guess! No point in hiding it then, we aren't bandits... the Slick 69s are a street gang from the Old Town section of Scrap City. My brother Demon got caught with one of our leader's girls and I took the fall for him. Me and my group here were exiled until we can scrape together the funds to pay off my little brother's crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... I see. So you're just a bunch of street thugs then.\" you reply. \"Tell you what, leave now and I won't call for reinforcements and fuck your little band of misfits up until they can't walk straight. Sound good?\" Before Draco can answer you then fire a round into the sky and give him a nasty sneer. \"Oops, there goes the warning shot, MY crew will be here within minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" Alexander says as he shoots up out of bed as Brie yells out in surprise. \"You may have us surrounded, but my guys can hold yours off easy until the back up gets here. Better run.\" you taunt as Alexander looks around in shock. \"Who the hell are these assholes?!\" he demands furiously as he looks over to where his and Brie's supplies were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KILL THEM!!!\" Draco suddenly screams as you rush to your feet and fire your revolver. Two shots hit him square in the chest as Brie goes for her gun. \"They killed the boss, fuck em' up!\" comes the scream from one of the Slick 69s as he swings at you with a nailboard. \"Shit, get your guns!\" you shout as you blow the guy away anong with another behind him who was advancing towards Brie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, I'll help you hold them off, grab our guns Brie!\" Alexander calls as he catches the lead pipe one of the gang members swings at his face and punches the guy in the throat, disarming him in the process. The others close in as you fire off another bullet into the face of a woman who was about a second away from stabbing Brie with her machete. \"Cover her!\" Alexander shouts as he hops off the side of the wagon to engage the remaining fighters as they close in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, there's too many for you to handle!\" You call as you rush over and shoot a guy that was about to bat Alex aside with his sledgehammer. Two skinny young twins rush in as he backs up against the wagon and swing their weapons. He catches the first on his pipe and kicks him away but the second manages to swing his sickle in the opening and aim it right at Alex's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the trigger on your gun again, but it clicks on an empty chamber. \"Fuck, I'm out!\" you curse as the edge of the blade cuts through the flesh along Alexander's face. He screams in pain and rage as he then cave in the skull of the sickle guy with one mighty blow of his pipe, twisting it in a curve near the end. \"Alex!\" Brie screams in horror as she opens fire with her shotgun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of heads pop like watermelons as the buckshot finds its mark and you hop down to grab a melee weapon. The others circle around the wagon towards Alexander as Brie rushes over, firing another shot into the face of the guy in the (now mangled) gas mask. She tosses him his rifle as you pick up a dropped crowbar and smack the teeth out of a fat guy with a bunch of tattoos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last few remaining enemies attempt to muster a desperate last stand, but with Alex and Brie both fully armed they go down in seconds in a misty spray of red as their bullet riddled bodies hit the dirt. As the last guy, a blonde man with a mohawk, falls you lean back against the wagon for support and take a deep breath. \"Fuck, that was pretty close... you guys okay?\" you call in between pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horrified gasp from Brie quickly answers you question as you remember the hit Alex took form the guy with the sickle. You turn around to find Brie in tears as blood pours down Alexander's face. \"Is it bad?\" he asks weakly as she slumps to the ground against the side of the wagon. The hit bad been nonlethal, but the damage it did was still severe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long thin gash ran from the base of Alex's right cheek all the way through his eyebrow, stopping right at the base of his forehead. More concerning, however, was the ruined eye leaking long streaks of red down the side of his face. From the looks of things it had been sliced clean through the pupil and outer half of the eye. Not a pretty sight, even to a harden wastelander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie begins crying softly as she bends down to hug Alexander. \"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... it's all my fault, I should have known better than to try camping out here. We should have stayed at the passage.\" she mumbles between sobs as you rest your hand on the wagon and toss your crowbar aside. If only you had an extra bullet in the chamber this might not have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou help Brie lay Alexander down on the floor of the wagon as she digs some medical supplies out to treat his wounds. After cleaning up and bandaging the eye as best as she could you help her and Alex pack up. It was already morning and you'd be stuck out here again if you didn't get a move on back to the passage and get back on the highway. Luckily, Alexander was a tough mercenary and had no trouble keeping up pace with you and Brie as you found your way back onto the highway.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You spend about an hour talking to passing caravans and traders before giving up on finding a group that you could accompany. Everyone either had no room or didn't feel like playing escort to someone with so little to offer to make it worthwhile. Ah well, you'd been out in the wasteland before and knew how to handle yourself when things got dangerous. So long as you had your revolver and packed supplies you'd do okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only major downside was the fact that you didn't have a mount and would have to walk the entire way on foot. There were a few shortcuts to be found that could make your journey faster, but you didn't feel like taking the risk of going offroad. You knew most of the highway pretty well from your past journeys and had a good idea of where you could stop to rest and what places to avoid. Your trip would probably take an extra day or two, but it was a small price to pay to make sure you arrived in one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun beat down on you as the afternoon passed by and you stopped to take a short rest in the shade of a crumbling billboard. You wiped a bead of sweat from your brow and took a quick sip of water while leaning against the base of a large rock. You were making good progress so far, if you kept this up you could still arrive in Scrap City and get back on schedule without any additional delays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were good and rested you got back onto the scorching hot blacktop of the highway and continued onward past the ruins of a roadside tollbooth. After about an hour on the road you came to your first real pit stop at the base of a large hill with a water tower on top. Trading Post 15, named after the route it was located on. The place was pretty small, but it had a trader and a small rest area for travelers to stay out. You could even rent a bed in the old barn out back if you had the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young woman with a blonde ponytail smiles and waves to you as you walk off the road towards the main building. The place had once been a farmhouse until the roof collapsed and half the upper flood gave away during the end of the world. Luckily, the current residents knew how to fix things up and managed to salvage most of the rubble to make a nice little shack and wall around the garage, which is where they stored most of their supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and wave back to the woman as a guard in leather armor opens the little wooden gate for you and welcomes you to the settlement. \"Hey, I think I seen you here before, you that scaver who trades junk out near Shady Woods Park?\" he asks as you step inside and move over to the shade. You nod your head and take a sip of water as he closes the gate back and locks it shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the rules, then. Don't steal, don't cause trouble and don't get piss drunk and break something. We just had a caravan pass through a week back full of rowdy drunkards, damn near tore a hole in the wall. We still sell booze, but Lucy knocked the price up a bit. She's in the garage if you want to trade.\" he replies as he moves back to his post. You thank him and head over to the open garage door where the woman you saw waving at you had set up a small table and some shelves lined with goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy, partner.\" she says with a smile as she notices you walk in. \"I believe I saw you walking up the road a few minutes ago, you on your way to Scrap City by yourself?\" You grin as you pull out your revolver and give the cylinder a spin. \"Yep, don't worry about me, I know these roads pretty well.\" you reply. Lucy folds her arms as you put your weapon away and looks you over. \"I don't doubt it, I've seen you stop by before, but the roads are pretty dangerous these days. Just had a bandit attack a few miles up the road a month back, killed five armed guards and about ten merchants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head as you let out a sigh. \"Yeah, I heard about that from a man in Shady Woods Park, stripped the bodies bare and just left them. Bastards even shot up the dogs, the kids and a couple of the horses. We could use more order on these roads, I hear some folks are even talking about starting up a united militia. We sure could use one.\" you reply as Lucy nods her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of silence Lucy pulls out a small metal box and unlocks it with a key. \"I just got a fresh shipment of goods from one of the passing caravans, got plenty of food, booze and junk. I'll also buy any spare supplies you feel like selling.\" she says with a smile as you look over the shelves. She had a lot of merch for such a small settlement, definitely a few things you could use on the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a lot of cash, but it can't hurt to take a look.\" you say as you dig out your money and count it up. \"Show me what you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==============<br>\r\nCan Of Beer (4) $16<br>\r\nMoonshine (2) $33<br>\r\nRoasted Meat Chunk (3) $8<br>\r\nThe Forgotten Dead $12<br>\r\nNinja Boy And Gadget Girl $11<br>\r\nAn Encyclopedia Of Wildlife Vol XXXI $38<br>\r\n==============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter perusing her wares you chat for a few minutes about the local news and caravan routes. \"You know, it'll be getting dark before long and I hear there's a huge nightcrawler infestation somewhere along the road.\" Lucy says as she rests her hands on the counter. \"Why don't you stay the night? It's safer than camping and I'll give you a good rate. Scrap City is still a few days away if you're moving on foot, so it'll be good to a have a peaceful nights rest. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance out the window at the beams of light reflected by the sun and growing shadows stretching across the nearby landscape. You had three or four more hours of light, which could be spent traveling, but Lucy had a point. Without much in the way of camping supplies and no practical shelter for miles it would be pretty dangerous to spend the night out in the wasteland. After a few moments of thought you make your decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright, I guess I'll stay for the evening.\" you say cheerfully as you hand Lucy a ten dollar bill. She smiles and hands you a red ticket with a small logo scrawled on it. \"Thank you. Just take that over to the barn and the guard will let you inside. Take any spot you want, but don't bother the other guests. Have a good sleep.\" she replies as you pocket the ticket and head back outside. \"You too.\" you call back on your way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still fairly early, but after such a long time walking in the hot sun you decided to just find a nice spot to chill for the rest of the day. You walk up the hill a shot ways to a man in leather armor standing guard over a faded barn with chipped paint and a few patched holes on the side. \"Ticket please.\" he requests as you walk over. You pull out the ticket and show it to him, after which he pulls open the door for you. \"Thank you, please enjoy your stay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and then head inside into the relative coolness of the barn. The place wasn't huge, but it was pretty cozy by wasteland standards. Most of the lower stalls had been stripped for materials to build dividing walls between six fairly large living areas. One was a sort of lobby or living room, with a few folding chairs and a small bookshelf stocked with old magazines. The other five were living quarters each stocked with a dresser, a footlocker, a mattress with a straw stuffed pillow, a table and a chair. Pretty basic, but you get what you pay for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding your way to an unclaimed bed you secured your belongings in the footlocker and dresser and headed back out into the living area to meet with some of the other guests. There weren't many other people here at the moment, just a few workers on their way to a new job, a mother and her son heading towards the city to start a better life and an older man on his way to visit his sister at a settlement further down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had several hours to talk and exchange stories with the others as the sun slowly sets over the distant horizon. By the light of a small lantern you continued talking for around an hour in the dark before everyone decided to pack it in for the night and headed off to bed. The mattress and straw pillow weren't super comfy, but still better than trying to sleep outside and you managed to sleep peacefully during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you awoke to thin beams of sunlight crawling along your face through tiny holes in the far wall. With a yawn you quickly pack up your belongs and go to check out before it gets too late. On your way out of the barn you eye catches the bookshelf where about a dozen magazines were stacked neatly in a pile. You could easily steal one on your way out since no one else was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You may add 1 Go Outside Monthly, 1 Workin' Indoors, 1 High Rollers Digest, 1 Doctor Bags And Pill Bottles, 1 Ninja Boy And Gadget Girl, or 1 The Forgotten Dead to your inventory. If your Stealth skill is 3 or higher you may also take 1 of the other magazines listed above as well.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head out in the warm early morning sun and check out with Lucy before heading back onto the road, hoping to put a few miles behind you before it gets too hot out. Luckily, the steep cliffsides on either side of the highway gave you a good amount of shade for an hour or so before you came back out into an open area that stretched for miles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next several hours pass by uneventfully as you move down the cracked and broken highway past the collapsed ruins of houses, trailers and shacks. Most were good for little more than firewood these days, but a few homes were still standing and looked tempting in the hot afternoon sun. Even if there was nothing to loot at least you could rest for a half hour or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter coming across a trailer home with a broken front door you decided it was just as good a place to stop as any and head up through the remains of the front yard past a rusted lawnmower and a few charred boards that looked like the remains of a dog house. Not the most inviting place, but that was what you had your revolver for. After peeking into the darkened interior through the thin cracks of a boarded up window you head over to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a single powerful tug you managed to pull it free of its hinges and stepped into a murky hallway that stunk of mildew and rotting wood. You had your revolver drawn in one hand and your lighter in the other to see your way around. Behind you were two doors, one that appeared to lead to a closet and one that led to what was likely a bedroom. In front of you was another door that probably led to a bathroom or perhaps another bedroom. Beyond that was what appeared to be a darkened kitchen at the very end of the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check the closet first, which was empty save for the tattered remains of an old coat, some rusted hangers and a magazine filled cardboard box that had fallen apart completely due to some sort of water leak. Bummer. After closing the door back you headed through the door behind you into what was indeed a bedroom, or at least the remains of one. Raggedy curtains hung from the windows like moss around the nailed plywood and scrap lumber. Aside from a dirty mattress, an empty dresser and a broken television set the room was another bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as you move through another door frame that lead into a small bathroom that was connect to the hallway. After checking the medicine cabinets you came up with some spare medications and a bit of spare change. Not a whole lot, but enough to make the trip inside worth it. You pocket the loot and do a quick sweep of the rest of the room to see if they was anything else hidden nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You gain 2 Unlabeled Bottle Of Pills and $3. If your Stealth skill is 3 or higher you also find a sealed drug stash in the back of the toilet tank and gain 2 Aspirin and 1 Premium Eye Drops.] <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this side of the house clear you step back out into the hallway and head into the kitchen. There was a little more light here and in the nearby living room but you stilled needed the lighter to make your way past an overturned chair in the middle of the floor. You seriously doubted that there was anything in the fridge, cabinets or microwave but checked anyway to make sure before moving on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If your Stealth skill is 2 or higher you notice a magazine stuck under some empty spice bottles. It's a bit faded, but still readable to be worth taking. You gain 1 Workin' Indoors.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe living room was easy to search, just some broken furniture, a hollowed out television with a nest of bugs inside and a ceiling fan hanging from torn wires. Nothing of value whatsoever. Connected to the living room was a tiny hallway with two additional doors inside. One led into a side room and the other led to a room on the opposite side of the house. You checked the side room first and found yourself in some sort of small rec room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from a pool table and a couch was a large stack of boxes. Most contained things like old video games, board games, comics and books. Most of the goods were too damaged to be useful, but you managed to salvage a decent haul after about half an hour of careful searching. Once you were sure you found everything you headed through the door to the final room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You gain 1 Ninja Boy And Gadget Girl, 1 Guns And Gold: New Roads, 1 Pristine Cross Book and 1 Dice.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last room was another bedroom with the windows barricaded by the bed, mattress, dresser and a chair in addition to the boards nailed over the outside. Seems like whoever lived here really wanted to keep something out. Despite being a little disturbed you searched the room, including a small closet along the side wall. You found some more money, but little else. After doing one final sweep you pocket your findings and head back to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You gain $16. If your Science skill is 3 or higher you noticed that an old VCR in the closet has a loose back and a hollowed out interior. After moving some of the inner parts aside you find another money stash hidden inside and gain an additional $45.] <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you head back out into the cooling wasteland air you notice the western sky turning a soft orangish pink on the far horizon. It would be getting dark out soon and you were pretty far from the next settlement. You rub your chin as you look back at the house and then to the road. Up ahead was a small burned out woods that could serve as a decent makeshift campsite if you knew how to set it up. Otherwise, it looked like you might be spending the night inside this worn down old home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You figured that setting up a proper camping spot would be better than staying in a rundown house that could be infested with vermin. Sleeping on the ground under the starts would be be better than waking up to find a rat or snake gnawing on you for disturbing its nesting area. The last thing you needed was to catch some disease and end up bedridden for weeks while everyone else makes a claim to your old boss' fortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou settle into a small clearing near a large rock and roll out a thin blanket over the ground under a tall tree with moss growing along the side. You recognized from the strong odor that this particular species of moss grew a natural insect repellent and was safe to expose to human skin, quite the lucky find. You take a few chunks free and place them around the edges of your blanket before throwing a thin sheet over a broken tree branch. It wasn't pretty, but you now had a decent shelter to sleep in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gathering some spare wood to make a campfire you roast up a small supper and soon fell asleep in your makeshift tent. A few animals scurried past your campsite in the darkness, but kept their distance due to the smell of the moss masking your scent. By the time morning arrived you had gotten a full nights sleep without so much as a stray scorpion pestering you. After taking a half hour to pack up your supplies you headed back out onto the highway to continue your journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day passed quickly and you soon found yourself at an old toll booth as evening set in. It wasn't very comfortable, but it was sturdy and secure enough to make a good spot to rest. Once again nothing bothered you and the morning came with a wave of warmness just like the previous night. You yawned and set out again in the early hours as light slowly returned to the world. By this point you were about halfway to Scrap City and still making good progress as far as you could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt about an hour after noon, just when the heat was starting to get unbearable, you came across a large caravan bus parked along the side of the road near an empty parking lot that sat in front of a collapsed general store. You smiled and waved to the traders as you walked up and took a free seat on a ring of folding chairs situated around a table. In exchange for letting them have all of the salvage from the store they agreed to let you have a free bottle of water and a snack while you took a break under a shady tarp they had set up over the roof of their bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven that the long destroyed store was likely only good for scrap and maybe a few food items you figured it was a pretty good deal. Even if you wanted to fight them over it you were far too tired from walking to turn down their offer. For the next few hours you all talked and exchanged stories with each other. As it turned out, they had just made a big delivery of Glowing Ore in Scrap City and were heading out towards Brownsand to spend the huge stash of Caps they got in trade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of them even offered to trade some spare supplies they had for cash to help fund the rest of their journey. As awesome as their caravan bus was, it needed fuel like any other vehicle and gas was in pretty short supply with so few people still able to make it. You didn't have a huge amount of cash yourself, but experience told it was better to be broke and supplied over rich and unprepared. After everyone finished their lunch a few guys lugged out some boxes from the trunk of the bus and began placing items from inside them onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====================<br>\r\n(8) Can Of Beer $9<br>\r\n(2) Anti-Venom $15<br>\r\n(5) Pack Of Cigarettes $10<br>\r\n(3) Condom $12<br>\r\n(2) Guns And Bullets Without The Bullshit $7<br>\r\n(3) Go Outside Monthly $6<br>\r\n(4) Workin' Indoors $6<br>\r\nAn Encyclopedia Of Wildlife Vol XXXI $41<br>\r\nStylish Sunglasses $43<br>\r\nFingerless Gloves $32<br>\r\nSwiss Army Knife $57<br>\r\n====================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter packing things back up a few guys came back from the ruined store and turned over their findings to the lead caravaneer - a few bits of scrap, canned food and some salvageable electrical parts. Just as you thought, a bunch of useless junk. You waved goodbye as the crew packed up their gear and began driving off down the highway into the distance. With renewed stamina you headed off in the opposite direction towards Scrap City and your own fortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs night fell once again you set up a small bed in an abandoned RV that veered off the road and crashed into a tree some time in the past. Anything of value had already been looted long ago, but the place was still intact enough to be a passable shelter during what would likely be the last night of your journey before reaching Scrap City. It had been a good while since you had a chance to visit and you dreamed of seeing the massive settlement once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got out of bed the next morning you noticed a small lizard crawling along the burned husk of a nearby tree and put a round through its head from the door of the RV. Smiling at your good fortune you lit up a small fire and began roasting the sizable amount of meat you got off of it. After enjoying your modest breakfast you downed a fresh gulp of water and got back on the road. If you hurried you should at least make the outskirts of the city by nightfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou headed off the main highway for about a mile to avoid a roaming pack of wild mutant hounds that had taken down some sort of larger creature and were feasting on its carcass while some of their other members patrolled through the wrecked cars and trucks in search of more prey. You had seen a few mutant hound attacks in the past and they could get pretty vicious. That was actually a small settlement near Brownsand made up of farming families that lost a couple kids to a pack passing through the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, mutant hounds were very nomadic creatures and rarely stayed in one place for long before moving on in search of greener pastures. The only time they settled down was during the mating season or on the rare occasion they found a place with abundant prey and minimal larger predators to serve as a threat to the pack. If you avoided them and moved out of their temporary territory you should be find. These things were ruthless, but also smart enough to not attack stronger prey and risk losing members in a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour after your detour you headed back onto the main highway to get a move on since you were now behind schedule and didn't want to be caught outside in the dark again. The outskirts of Scrap City were probably more dangerous than the wasteland due to bandits, thugs, gangs and even slavers roaming around in search of easy marks. The only safe place to sleep at night would be with a caravan... and even then there was no guarantee that one of the bolder groups might attempt an attack anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at the position of sun and figured you had about six to eight hours of daylight left, plenty of time if you hurried but dangerous if you ran into another detour so close to the city. There was a small settlement you could stay at nearby, but it was about four or five miles off the main highway. There was no way you'd get to Scrap City today if you stopped there for the night, but it would be a lot safer and free if you didn't mind staying in the common house instead of the motel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked you weighed your two options and came to a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun began to set just as you walked into town and most of the residents were heading inside for the night. The place wasn't huge but it still had a good amount of people for what was basically just a speed bump on the way to Scrap City. Most were farmers who grew crows in what little fertile dirt they could find and raised mutant animals for meat and labor. A few others dealt in minor repair work or scavenging, but that was about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man with a scoped hunting rifle waved to you as you entered through the small wooden gateway at the bottom of the hill the small settlement was built on. It was a bit of a hike to get to the main buildings, but it was good exorcise. The motel had been there since before the end of the wood along with most of the various houses while the common house had been built roughly twenty years ago as part of some sort of housing initiative by the mayor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place wasn't very fancy, though it was sturdy and spacious, which was a pretty deal considering it was free. The motel would be a lot cleaner and far more comfortable... if you didn't mind paying for a room. You took a moment to rest as you looked over each building. It would be nice to stay in a relatively clean bedroom for a change. Of course, saving your money for later was probably the smart move in this situation... and the common house probably had a few interesting people to talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would consider camping out if not for the lack of open space due to the jagged rocks and cliff side of the surrounding area... and you doubted that any of the farmers would be happy to find you sleeping in their gardens or animal pens. For all of its charm and peaceful atmosphere this little village was a bit clostraphobic. Ah well, you'll be at Scrap City tomorrow and won't need to worry about finding a spot to sleep for much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will you spend the night?</span></div></div>",

You head into the main lobby and greet an older man who was sitting behind a desk. He offers you an empty room on the second floor with a nice view of the town for twenty bucks a night. It was a bit pricier than you had hoped, but you could afford that for just one night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hand him the money and he gives you a key with the number 06 on it. \"It's at the end of the walkway on the second floor, second door from the right. Can't miss it. Enjoy your stay.\" the man replies as he pockets your cash and begins filing some documents. You thank him and head back outside to where the staircase to the second floor was. The steps creaked a bit as you walked over them and you wondered how much longer this place would last before something would collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the rooms themselves seemed to be in much better condition. Aside from a thick layer of dust on the windows, some cracks and a bit of peeling paint you'd barely be able to tell that they endured the end of the world with very little damage. \"Guess that's one of the perks of being in such a remote and guarded place.\" you chuckle to yourself as you walk over to the door with your key number and unlock it. \"They just need to maintain their steps a bit better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as a cool breeze from an air conditioning unit washed over you and stepped inside your temporary residence. You flicked a nearby light switch and a tiny overhead light bulb illuminated the small room with a dim glow. It seems old Wendell finally got their generators working properly again. Those things ran on specialized power cells and could probably keep this place juiced up for a thousand years if it needed to. One day you'd have to ask him where he found those things and get some for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would have to wait for another day, however, as you were on a tight schedule as it is and intended to get some rest before heading out tomorrow morning. Still, it was every day you got to enjoy a bit of electricity and some comfy furniture. You place your gear at the foot of your bed and begin having a look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you noticed was a refrigerator in the corner near a microwave and a small broken oven. The fridge was was clearly powered as it had a thick steel lock on the side with a money slot. If you wanted some grub during your stay it looks like you'd have to pay for it. You didn't like the thought of spending more money, but it would be great to have some supper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You may pay $10 to the machine. If you do you find 2 Beers, 1 Purified Water and 1 Roasted Meat Chunk. You may add any of these items to your inventory. If your Science skill is 4 or higher you may access these items at no cost.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking out the fridge you head into the bathroom. Next to a surprisingly clean toilet seat was a sink and a medicine cabinet. Inside the cabinet were a few bottles of medicine, some empty boxes, a toothbrush and a small bottle of what seemed to be a few drops of mouth wash. There were also a few stay mystery pills with no label or bottle to identify them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You gain 1 Aspirin. If you have the Drug Crafter Perk you also manage to make a stronger drug as well. Roll a D6. If the result is 1-2 you gain 1 Steroids, if the result is 3-4 you gain 1 3-Way, if the result is 5-6 you gain 1 Stonewall.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both the kitchen and bathroom out of the way you head back into the main bedroom and investigate the shelves and tables. There wasn't a whole lot here aside from some empty wrappers, some loose change and a couple worn out magazines that where falling apart from being read so much over the years. You figure that the motel wouldn't mind if you took some of this junk with you on your way out and put a few new items next to the rest of your gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You gain $2, 1 Ninja Boy And Gadget Girl and 1 Guns And Bullets Without The Bullshit.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the entire area fully explored you decide to hop on the bed and get a few good hours of rest. Tomorrow would be a big day and you wanted to be fresh for your arrival in Scrap City. After a few minutes of relaxing on the soft sheets you dozed off and slept for about nine or ten hours before the sound of insects buzzing around outside woke you up. You yawned as you got up and gathered your things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny swarm of mutant flies picking at what appeared to be a dead lizard flew off as you opened the door and walked out into the warm early morning sun. You let out a sigh as you closed the door back and sealed off the refreshing air flowing from inside. You almost considered paying for another night, but knew getting on the road would be the best thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter turning in your key at the check out desk you headed back out into the town as the various farmers and scavengers got ready to go about their day. It really was a nice little place to visit, but a much larger settlement was waiting for you and you didn't wan to get stuck out during the hottest part of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of your journey went smoothly. After stopping to take a rest in the shade of a wrecked cargo truck you got back onto the main road and continued until you reached your destination. Scrap City came into view just as the sun began its descent over the horizon and you breathed a sigh of relief that you could avoid another day of camping out in the wastes. It had been a while since your last visit but you knew the streets pretty well and headed for a big building called the Bluebrick Hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn old friend of yours ran the place and was happy to give you a free room during your stay in the city. You thanked him and headed off to your new luxury suite to catch another night of rest before preparing for the next leg of your journey. For now though, you were just happy to not be camping outside again.</span></div></div>",

The next phase of your journey would lead you through some pretty dangerous areas and blowing your supply money on frivolous things would likely end up getting you killed. \"Ah well.\" you say with a sigh as you head over to the entrance to the common house. \"It's just one more night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded to the guard standing out front and turned in your weapons for the night. It make you feel uneasy to give up your revolver for the night, but ever since some jackass shot and killed a resident over a dispute a few years back the guards confiscate anything bigger than a butter knife from people staying at the common house. You figured it was probably for the best but it was still annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your gear stored away in a locked chest for the evening you headed through the main door into the interior. The place really wasn't much to look on the outside and the inside was no better. The whole building was just a bunch of salvaged house pieces taken from destroyed homes all nailed and duct taped together to form one large empty square room with a high ceiling and some mattresses. That was about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered if maybe it wasn't too late to stay at the motel and walked over to a free mattress next to a little wooden end table. The place only had four tiny windows on each of its sides along with a few cracks in the ceiling that let in a few tiny strands of light, which made it almost too dark to see during the evening. If not for a few lamps placed about on a few of the tables the whole place would be pitch black come night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretched out on your mattress and most of the other folks gathered around an older woman in the far corner playing a guitar and singing. \"In the pines... in the pines... where the sun never shines...\" A light chuckle escaped your lips as you smirked and stared up at the ceiling. The lyrics were pretty funny given your current situation, sitting in a darkened room on a dirty mattress. \"At least I'm not camping.\" you say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again.\" came an unexpected reply from behind you. You turned around to see a young woman with a thin scar on her cheek sitting on the mattress behind yours. She was wearing a greasy mechanic jumpsuit and had short unkempt hair. It was a bit hard to tell but she also appeared to have tan skin and green eyes along with a few splotches of grease on her cheeks and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you come from?\" you asked in a surprised tone. You didn't see her when you walked in and hadn't noticed anyone behind you until she spoke up. The young woman grins and she leans in a bit closer to get a better look at you. \"I snuck in through the side with the loose paneling. It was a tight squeeze, but I don't like giving up my switchblade around a bunch of strangers. The name's Kara, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and introduce yourself, telling her about your trip to Scrap City. Upon hearing the city's name she perks up and listens closely to the details you give her. \"Wow, so you've actually been there before?\" she asks with the awestruck tone of an excited child. \"My pa is from out near the Dustbox region past the city, I've never been out there but I hear Scrap City is amazing! They got things like working computers and vehicles, and even big buildings called casinos where you can gamble and drink and have sex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh as you give her some more details about the place and where you intended to stay at, a big hotel called the Bluebrick. She listens intently as you talk about your previous trips to the city. Most visits were about business, but you've been to a few of the bars and clubs as well. You even lived there for a eight months during one of your longer jobs, but that was several years ago during your youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smiles as she glances over to a duffel bag sitting near the edge of her mattress. \"Hey, you can handle yourself pretty well out there in the wasteland if you're able to travel alone like this, right? Any chance you could give me an escort to the city? I'm bored to tears out here in hicksville. I've already read all the magazines a hundred times and can't even get a good whiskey or tequila most of the time. I'll pay you a hundred bucks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow and you think it over. Scrap City was pretty close now and most of the danger was past at this point, but you could still run into trouble. You doubted this kid had spent even one day out in the wastes, not exactly an asset and maybe even a liability. On the other hand, she was offering you some good money for what would be at most a day of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what.\" you finally reply. \"I'll sleep on it and give you my answer in the morning.\" Kara gives you a smile as she pulls a few bills out of a pocket on her suit and holds them up. \"Remember, I'm offering you a hundred bucks, cash. It's most of my savings... but I've always dreaming of going to Scrap City even since dad died. You might be the only chance I'll have for the next several years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the she stuffs the bills down her neckline and pulls her duffel bag onto her lap. \"Anyway, something to think about. Now do you want to do some trading at least? I make some pretty good cash collecting and repairing stuff. I got some choice items that are hard to come by out here.\" she offers as she unzips the bag and takes out a few items. You glance over at the people  listening to the signing woman and sigh. \"Sure, I guess. I got nothin' better to do right now anyway. Show me what you got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=============<br>\r\n(3) Beer $7<br>\r\nCherry Liquor $107<br>\r\n(2) Premium Eye Drops  $18<br>\r\nDiscreet Prescription $31<br>\r\n(4) Swag Bag $25<br>\r\n(3) Magic Brownie $36<br>\r\n(3) LSD $47<br>\r\nPheromone Extract $42<br>\r\n(2) Tribal Tea $16<br>\r\n(3) Cigarette Pack $19<br>\r\n(5) Condom $12<br>\r\n(2) New People New Passions $23<br>\r\nWorkin' Indoors $18<br>\r\nHigh Rollers Digest $21<br>\r\nFrilly Panties $39<br>\r\nSneakers $33<br>\r\nLacy Bra $35<br>\r\n=============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look over her wares but you notice that a lot of these items are contraband in most areas. You weren't sure about what the local laws were, but chances are at least some of this stuff was illegal. You play it cool as you look over everything and don't voice any concern until you are done. Just as Kara goes to pack everything back up you confront her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may ask, where do you get this stuff exactly?\" you say in a reserved tone. Kara shrugs as she packs up the stuff into the duffel bag. \"All over. Some I get from traders, some I get as payment from work, some I make myself. What does it matter, anyway?\" she replies in a somewhat agitated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown and lean back to give her some space, but make sure not to take your eyes off of her. \"I'm not entirely sure what the laws are here...\" you begin. \"...but I'm pretty sure that certain types of drugs are illegal. I noticed that you were selling marijuana products and a few other questionable substances. You could get in big trouble if someone catches you dealing that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara freezes as she tries to read your expression. \"Alright then, yeah. Not all of the stuff I sell is legal... why do you think I snuck in past the guards? I don't make a lot of money doing work around here, sometimes it takes months for something to break down and I don't always get cash for fixing it. Some of what I got here was payment from work and some I make myself when I can get the supplies. One of the farmers here sells me good pot on the cheap, for example.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath as you let Kara continue. \"Look, I sell a product some people want and will pay good cash and supplies for. I'm not some big bad wastelander like you, I can't make a living just fixing stuff, not here. If I make it to Scrap City things might be different... I...\" she trails off as another resident walks by and sits down on their own mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just... help me get to Scrap City... or don't... I don't care just as long as you don't get me in trouble. Thanks for taking a look at my stuff... we can talk more tomorrow.\" she finishes as she zips up the duffel bag and uses it as a pillow. In just a few minutes she is sound asleep and you are left to think alone in the dark. After a few more minutes pass the woman with the guitar turns in for the night along with most of her crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou worry that Kara might do something desperate like stick a knife in your throat during your sleep, she did mention having a switchblade. Of course, it was unlikely she'd get away with that with so many people surrounding you. Even if no one woke up or caught her she'd still leave a tone of evidence behind, along with several people who saw you both talking. Reasoning that she couldn't possibly kill everyone in the common house you stretch out on your mattress and fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow would come soon enough, but you also have a big decision to make before you leave...</span></div></div>",

After enjoying a quick breakfast Kara stirs from her peaceful slumber and let's out a yawn. \"Good morning.\" you say with a smile as she begins stretching and rubbing her eyes. \"Mornin'. Have you made you decision yet?\" she asks in a hopeful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and turn to face her as you made sure your belongings were all packed up and ready to go. \"Yes, as a matter of fact I have. Go ahead and say your goodbyes to everyone, I'll be waiting for you here. I'm leaving in an hour though, so you better make sure you have everything ready cause I'm not heading back any time soon.\" you reply as she grins in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! Thank you! I'll go sell off my shack and get my gear ready, watch my stuff here, I'll be back in a jiffy.\" Kara says as she heads out through the main door, nearly knocking off some a chubby guy in the process. Your thoughts turn to the journey ahead as you look over at her duffel bag. She seemed like a resourceful person, but the big city wasn't like out here. It had many unique dangers to face, especially if you wandered into the wrong part of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well.\" you say as you relax on the mattress. \"If she can survive out here in the wastes she'll probably be alright, I'll just need to make sure she properly understands how things work.\" After about twenty minutes pass you see Kara walk back inside carrying a large backpack on her shoulders. She smiles as she walks over and grabs her duffel bag with her free hand after placing her switchblade in her back pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready? I pawned off most of my old junk and bought some extra clothes and supplies. I also got plenty of cash to cover at least two or three months worth of rent. I'll all ready to start my new life, so let's go!\" she says excitedly as get up off the comfy bed and grab your own stuff. \"Got everything? I ain't coming back just cause you forgot something... you sure you didn't leave anything behind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods her head and pats her backpack. \"Everything I could sell off is gone and I double checked to make sure I didn't leave any essentials behind. Let's hit the road!\" she replies as he begins heading to the door. You chuckle as you follow behind and reclaim your weapons from the guard at the door. After Kara waves one last goodbye to some of her buddies you both head down towards the crumbing highway to finish the next leg of your journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the sun heating up the asphalt you made good time and didn't run into any trouble as you neared the city limits. Kara gasped in awe at the lit up lights shining in the dim cloudy haze of the setting sun. Even though you had visited this place many times before you still were impressed at how much electricity and other luxuries Scrap City had on offer. Hopefully, Kara would have a good life here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, it's getting dark. We really don't want to get caught out here during the night, tons of lowlifes and scumbags prowl around looking for easy marks.\" you warn Kara as you quicken you pace a bit. \"In fact, we need to go over some simple rules for living in the city that you'll need to learn if you want to survive and stay out of trouble...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent the next several minutes explaining to Kara what types of places to avoid and how to find work as you walked past the crumbling buildings of the outskirts. She seemed a bit distracted but nodded her head as she listen to show you that he heard what you were saying. You invite her to the Bluebrick, but she turns you down saying she heard about a nice cheap place run by a retired merchant from some of the travelers that passed through her town a while back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hands you a few bills and you wish her luck as you part ways near a crowded intersection lined with market stalls and food stands. You wave at each other as she disappears behind a tall gray building and continue onwards to your own destination. The air was starting to get cool now, but you were close to your current goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You gain $100.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you head inside the Bluebrick hotel and chat with an old friend of yours who ran the place. After spending a few minutes catching up you excused yourself to a free room he had offered you and head to bed. After such a long day it was good to have a proper bed for a change instead of a mattress or sleeping bad. You yawned as you fell asleeping, think ahead to what the future had in store for you.</span></div></div>",

You hated leaving her alone without any sort of goodbye, but you knew this was for the best. Even if she could handle herself out in the wasteland she'll only be a liability on the road. You could handle bandits, but if they captured her as a hostage or forced you to cover her in a firefight? Not good. You didn't even want to think about what could happen to her once she actually got to the city...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter retrieving your weapons from the guard and taking one final look at the serene little settlement you headed back down to the broken pavement of the crumbling road to finish up your journey. Things were quiet in the early morning as light slowly returned to the wasted world around you. You hated to rush, but you wanted to be long gone before Kara woke up, otherwise she might try to follow you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours the sun began heating things up again and you took a small break in the shade of a large jagged rock off to the side of the highway. You were making excellent time and should arrive at Scrap City before the day was out, especially if you kept up a good pace. With a sigh you downed a fresh gulp of water and stepped back onto the burning hot pavement. It sucked to have to move during the hottest part of the day, though it was better than heading off road and risking running into outlaws or raiders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt just a few hours past noon you came across a strange woman heading west with some sort of reptilian bird bird creature that looked like a mix between an ostrich, a raptor and a frilled lizard. On its back was a large knapsack filled with clinking bottles and around its neck was a thin rope leash. The woman smiled and waved to you as you stepped off the highway onto the little dirt road she was traveling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there stranger, need a bit of booze for the road?\" she says in a cheerfully yet slightly slurred voice. \"I'm on my way to a big new bar that just open up about two or three miles down the road, but I got some extra hooch I can part with if you got the cash.\" She draws her rifle as she talks and points it further down the road as she softly swayed side to side. You think it might be a good idea to buy some of her product just to keep her from hurting herself in some sort of drunken accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, is the bar gonna have any booze by the time you get there...?\" you whisper under your breath as she tugs her bird thing closer and opens the knapsack. Inside were several bottles filled with various types of booze. Most of it was just beer and moonshine, though she had some high quality stuff too. \"Alright, alright. I guess I can take a look.\" you reply as you walk over to inspect a few bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================<br>\r\n(8) Beer $5<br>\r\n(3) Champagne $19<br>\r\n(6) Moonshine $22<br>\r\n(2) Absinthe $24<br>\r\n(3) Cherry Liquor $73<br>\r\n(2) Waster Flask $30<br>\r\n==================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wishing the woman luck in making her delivery safely (she'd probably need it) you get back on the main road and head further north towards your destination. After several more hours of tiring travel you reach the outskirts of Scrap City just as the sun began to set. \"Finally here.\" you say happily as you begin walking down the streets towards a familiar building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the Bluebrick hotel and greet an old friend of yours who ran the place. After explaining your situation he agreed to give you a free temporary room during your stay in the city, which you retired to almost immediately after thanking him.

You climb out of bed with a yawn and head outside while the others are still sleeping soundly, it was lucky that you woke up before anyone else, especial Kara, or there could have been trouble. After reclaiming your weapons from the guard you tell him about the products you had seen being sold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, we're fairly lax here compared to most parts, but drug abuse is a big problem around here. We've lost a lot of good workers and guards to addictions, overdoses and just plain laziness... this is very serious...\" he replies as he pulls out a tiny notepad and writes something down with a small chewed pencil. \"Please wait right here while I grab a few guards and alert the mayor, if the suspect moves or attempts confrontation just yell and we'll come running.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head as the guy walks over to a pale white building cracked with age and filled with broken windows and dusty old furniture. In a few minutes an older gentleman with a graying mustache and receding hairline showed up flanked with three men and one woman carrying rifles. The mayor greets you warmly and tells you to wait with him outside as two of the guards head in to confront Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head again as the guard from before puts a hand on your shoulder and tells you that you did the right thing. As you hear some angry yelling and shouting inside you aren't so sure. About a minute later the male and female guards walk back out, the woman holding the duffel bag and the man holding Kara herself. She glares at you as the guards escort her to the center of town as several people look on in curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor asks you to join him and the others to give testament on Kara's conviction. You walk into the center of town alongside the guards while Kara has her hands and feet bound with rope. It's clear from her face that she's struggling not to cry or unleash a torrent of obscenities at the mayor and guards as they dig through her duffel bag. Two more guards soon show up with a thin wooden table and place it down just a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor walks over as the guards empty the duffel bag onto the table and begin sorting everything. Apparently Kara had a few extra goodies she hadn't shown you last night, nothing super hard like Neon, but still highly illegal. This was worse than you thought. As a small crowd gathers the mayor raises his arms and calls for order, causing everyone to fall silent save for a few whispers and gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Kara, you stand accused of heavy narcotic dealing, including the intent to distribute outlawed chemical substances to regular buyers, is this correct?\" he asks as he turns to face her. She frowns and nods her head. \"Yeah. I was holding half of that stuff for my regular customers, the other stuff I offered to the new arrival.\" The mayor shakes his head as he gestures for you to step forward and reads the notepad the guard from earlier hands him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wastelander, this woman offered you illegal drugs during the last night, is that correct?\" he asks as he adjusts his glasses. You nod solemnly. \"Yes sir, that is correct.\" The crowd begins talking a little louder as the mayor let's out a sigh and nods towards one of the guards who brought out the table. The man draws a long machete and walks over to the table. Kara is freed from her bonds and has her left hand placed upon the table, held in place by the female guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were warned in the past about this once before, yes?\" the mayor asks as he steps forward. \"I'm afraid we can't give you another warning this time. Normally, the punishment for selling illegal products is one finger per pound of contraband, however, in light of this being only your second offense and your admission of guilt your punishment will be a single finger and a fine. I'm sorry, miss Kara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get it over with...\" Kara replies as one of the guards cleans the blade with disinfectant and then raises it over his head. She winces as the razor edge comes down on her left pinky finger, severing it clean with a single blow. A soft moan escapes her lips as a stream of blood spurts off from the tiny stump, but nothing more. The wound is then bandaged as two of the guards confiscate Kara's items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she is able to stand again she is escorted over to the white building and disappears inside. The mayor asks the crown to please disburse before turning to you with a faint smile. \"Thank you for reporting this to us, I know it can be hard to follow the law sometimes but justice was done here, our town thanks you for that.\" he says as he hands you a few bills rolled up with a small tie and heads over to join his guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You gain $200.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait a few minutes for Kara to come back out with her empty duffel bag and watch her walk over to what you assume is her house. You shake your head and are just about to leave when she comes back out and shouts at you. \"Why the fuck did you do that?!\" she asks angrily as she walks over to you. \"I told you that I needed to sell that stuff to make a living, now I can't risk it because losing any more fingers means I won't be able to do any mechanical work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug your shoulders as you look her in the eyes. \"I'm sorry, but the law is the law. I could have gotten in trouble for not reporting you.\" you reply. This only seems to make Kara more angry as she throws her duffel bag to the ground. \"Bullshit! You knew you'd get a nice fat reward for turning me in, didn't you?! How much did they give you? A hundred? Two hundred? Five hundred? Well, I hope it was worth it because now I'm almost broke, out of products to sell and missing a goddamn finger you asshole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns away for a moment before grabbing her duffel bag off the ground and glaring at you. \"Can you at least take me with you to Scrap City with you? There's no way I can make a living here and I'll die if I head out into the wasteland alone and unarmed... can you at least do this for me? And before you ask... no, I can't pay you now, I lost almost all of my money and need what I have left to rent a room and try to fix my life. This purely to show me that you're not a complete shitbag, well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few moments to think it over. Not getting paid hardly made it worth the risk, but after costing her so much it seemed like a pretty scumy thing to do to just abandon her with almost nothing. What will you do?</span></div></div>",

Why the hell would you even think you could get another cent out of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you fold your arms and look out at the horizon. \"It's about a full day's walk to the city and the wasteland is filled with bandits, rapists, mutants and much worse.

The money is yours you greedy shitbag, get me to the city, I give you my last fifty dollars... and then we part ways, hopefully to never see each other again. Is that okay, asshole?\" she says as she begins walking past you towards the highway. You smirk at your superior negotiating skills and follow behind her at a close pace. \"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both walk for several miles without incident. Around noon Kara nearly disturbs a Rattle Viper nest, but you manage to point it out before she could get too close. It's clear from her expression that she's grateful that you probably saved her life, but she refused to say thank you for it, or even speak at all. This was fine with you, however, as it meant you'd have a nice peaceful trip without her making a bunch of noise on the way or bugging you about what the city would be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the evening sky began to settle in you came upon the outskirts of Scrap City lit up like a christmas tree underneath a swarm of fireflies. It was so beautiful that Kara momentarily forgot her hatred for you and ran ahead to cover the last mile as quickly as possible. You picked up the pace to a jog as you followed her past a few abandoned tents and ruined building frames, not quite enough to catch up but enough to keep her in your sights so she couldn't try and sneak away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara stopped in front of a long street stretching from a nearby pile of rubble all the way to a tall building in the distance. She waited a few minutes for you to catch up and then pulled a few bills out of her cleavage. \"Here shithead, my last few dollars.

Ah well, she had to learn what life is like in the big city, but you taught her that lesson firsthand.

Most of the buildings were still standing, but several residences and businesses were fashioned together from scrap materials and spare junk. Rusty pipes, clotheslines, draped clothes and cobbled together wooden supports dotted the landscape in front of you along with several cleared out lots filled with tents, camps and even a few trailer homes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost striking of all was the huge number of people walking across makeshift bridges, climbing ladders and generally going about their day without a care in the world. It wasn't like out in the wasteland where you could go days or even weeks without finding another soul... this was an urban jungle filled to the brim with everything from sunday school teachers to hardened criminals. It was a sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh you tear your eyes away from the dusty window and begin getting dressed for the day. After doing your best to make yourself look presentable in the cracked bathroom mirror you grab your stuff and head downstairs to meet up with your friend Dalton.

The road ahead had once been a busy city street in the world before, now it was a crumbling pathway covered in dust with dozens of tiny stands and kiosks set up along either side. If money wasn't one of your top concerns right now you'd probably ask Shelly to go on ahead while you check out a grill stand or clothing vendor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh well, you'd have time for tourism after finding out what your old boss left for you in his will.

To your right were a couple round wooden tables and a jukebox and dartboard near the far corner. Finally, right in front of you was a long polished counter table that looked unusually clean by normal standards with a burly man with a thick handlebar mustache standing behind it polishing a glass with a rag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ike, we're here to see Dalton.

Pick your poison, I believe Shel offered you a free drink on here tab right?

You are about to turn the knob on the right side door when it suddenly swings open and a man with blond hair and a business suit storms out with reddened cheeks and a sour look on his face. He brushes past you without so much as an \"excuse me\" and disappears down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess the business negotiations didn't go his way.\" you whisper to yourself as you step into the tiny office room. Dalton was sitting on one of two sofas on each side of a glass end table with his hands folded and his head bowed. He left out a sigh and barely noticed you as you sat down on the sofa opposite from him and leaned back on the comfortable leather. \"Who was that?\" you finally ask to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one, nobody.\" Dalton replies as he pours himself a glass of whiskey, emptying the bottle in the process. \"Just some idiot who thinks he's entitled to my hotel just because his daddy owns a chain of them out near Brownsand. Wanted me to part with the Bluebrick for only 1000 Caps, can you believe it? I told him that most folks in this city don't even use Caps and he acted like I was turning away a loaded bank vault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, sounds like a real asshole.\" you say as you put your hands behind your head. \"I don't suppose he mentioned any work opportunities on his way out?\" Dalton took a sip of his drink and shook his head. \"I'm sorry, but no. Good paying jobs are hard to come by these days. Most people either own family business, run caravans out in the wastes or go scavenging. With the population rising higher each year its getting harder for people in this city to find steady jobs. Anyway, did you get what you needed for your journey yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head and lean forward. \"Nah, that's kinda why I came here. I couldn't find any work and I don't want to waste any more time travelling all over the city job hunting. I need to gather up some cash in the next couple of days or I might as well head back home.\" Dalton sighs as he takes another sip of his whiskey. \"I'd love to give you a lone, but most of my spare cash is invested in different assets right now. Pulling funding on my business operation could cause me a lot of trouble in keeping the Bluebrick afloat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't worry about it.\" you reply as look up at the ceiling. \"I know you'd give me the cash if you could, I'll just have to figure something out. I just need an idea.\" Both you and Dalton are silent for a few seconds as Dalton gets a contemplative look on his face. He seemed to be deep in thought about something, but you had no idea what. \"I think I might know a place that can help you...\" he finally says as he finishes off his glass of whiskey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Well, I'm all ears then...\" you say with a slight smile. \"At this point I'd probably be thankful for a job picking up trash in the streets.\" Dalton grins and puts his hands on his knees. \"I was talking to a client the other day about expanding his own businesses into Scrap City, he runs caravans, you see. Anyway, he mentioned that he was planning on shipping in some supplies to his private warehouse near the northwestern slums. That's a bad part of town, but it also means he'll need security, workers willing to haul his supplies and so on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes light up a bit when you realize what Dalton was getting at. \"In other words...\" he continues. \"My client needs wastelanders like you who can do some heavy lifting and aren't afraid to get your hands dirty. Most of the work would likely be freelance and high paying for the risks involved, sounds like just your kind of job, right? I can't promise anything, but if you head over and tell them Dalton sent you I'm sure they could find something for you to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and get back on your feet. \"Alright, thanks! That sounds perfect!\" you say excitedly. \"I just need to earn enough to be able to afford supplies and travel, a couple days work at most.\" Dalton smiles as he leans back on the couch and and kicks his feet up. \"Glad to be of help old friend. Just be sure you toss some of that loot you get my way the time time you come to the city.\" he says with a laugh. You shake hands and wish each other luck in your endeavors before heading back down to the bar to say goodbye to Shelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asks you to walk her back to the Bluebrick, which you agree to since it was right along the way to the warehouse district. After thanking you she hands you a few bills before heading inside. \"You take care of yourself out there, that region you're headed to is known for its hostility and danger. I'd hate to hear that an old friend of Dalton's had something bad happen to them out there.\" You thank her for the concern and wave goodbye before heading off alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You gain $20.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes about half an hour to get to the warehouse district on foot and the overhead sun was starting to really warm up the pavement. You'd be thankful to get back inside a building, even one with air conditioning. Not only was the humid weather a pain to deal with you didn't like the looks of the local area. Most of the taller buildings in this part of the city where collapsed with rubble and debris piling in the streets along with the rusted out frames of long forgotten vehicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if navigating though this place over busted cars and stacked dumpsters wasn't bad enough there was a distinct unfriendliness to the local inhabitants. Most looked like penniless bums and street punks, but a few wore jackets, bandanas and motorcycle helmets. The relative lack of police or guards also made the place a haven for drug dealers, prostitutes, gangs, thugs and other nasty types of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe a sigh of relief when you come up to a wide open space past the crumbling buildings and blasted open sewers. Before you was relatively clear road stretching around several large buildings protected by chain-link fences and a few small guard outposts. Of the few people walking around most were wearing hard hats or mercenary fatigues. This was the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are just about to head up to the front gates when a voice calls out to you from a nearby building with broken windows. \"Hey, hey general badass! Over here!\" You keep your hand on your revolver and head over to investigate when a man with red hair and  a short beard steps out with his arms raised. He was wearing a grimy trench coat and black aviator sunglasses. \"Hey, don't shoot! I'm unarmed over here!\" he says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep your hand on your gun as he slowly walks over to you. \"Woah easy, I know this place is a shithole, but I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm just a scout looking for tough characters such as yourself. Can I put my arms down now?\" he asks with a slightly nervous tone. \"I just want to offer you some work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell him not to do anything funny and lean against a car as he lowers his arms and introduces himself. \"Okay, thanks. I'm Lyle, Lyle The Liar... its a, uh, bad nickname I know, but I swear I'm being straight with you. I'm just here to meet tough guys and gals and get them some high paying work. Are you interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown and glance at the warehouses before turning back to Lyle. \"So you find mercenary types that pass through here and get them to work for you, what if I say no?\" you ask. Lyle laughs and gives you a smile. \"Nothing, geez. We're not gonna force you to work with us, just make the offer. You can split any time you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause a moment and look him over. \"Is the work dirty?\" you ask. Lyle grins. \"Sometimes.\"</span></div></div>",

Just don't try to fuck me.\" Lyle smiles a bit wider and folds his arms. \"Good, that's the spirit! That's what I like to hear!\" he replies in his own enthusiastic tone. \"Just follow me, I'll take you to your new job site.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Lyle over to a manhole cover and watch him climb down inside. You didn't like the idea of crawling around an ancient underground passage filled with muck and grime, but the thought of a big payday kept you going. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? To your surprise the place was actually fairly well lit by glowing fungus on the walls and narrow cracks and holes in the ceiling. There wasn't even any nasty water pooling around your ankles or swarms of bugs buzzing around your head, another pleasant surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure these old tunnels are safe?\" you ask as Lyle pushes aside a splintered old cabinet and begins moving down a tight passageway off to the side. \"Sure thing. Just follow me and we're be at our destination in about ten to fifteen minutes.\" he replies from the middle of the passage. \"Just don't lag behind, it can be dangerous if you head off down one of the wrong tunnels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly a minute in complete darkness you crawl back out into the light of a wide sewer station with a steel grate pouring in afternoon sunlight about ten feet above your head. \"Sorry about the tight squeeze, we don't like normal folks just barging into our business here. I don't get paid if I let people off the streets follow me back.\" Lyle says as you get back on your feet. \"No problem, I know how busybodies like to ruin everyone's fun these days.\" you reply as you dust off your knees. \"How much further?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much, just stay close for this part up ahead.\" Lyle replies as he opens a metal door leading into a new tunnel. You follow him past a few skeletons caught in sprung bear traps and head through a blasted hole in the wall leading to an adjacent tunnel to get around a collapsed truck smashed through the road overhead. \"Funny, I was just at a bar called the Bear Trap.\" you say with a small laugh. \"Cool place.\" Lyle responds as he shoves aside a few garbage bags concealing spike traps on the floor. \"Lost my virginity in the park behind that place. Follow my lead here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle carefully navigates past several more traps and and turns a corner. \"It's just up here, be careful.\" he whispers as he steps over a pressure plate. It was much darker here than most of the other tunnels and a lot more dangerous so you decided to stick close to Lyle as he showed you the way. Unfortunately, your foot manages to graze a pressure plate that releases a large sack of concrete which swings right at your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You lose 1 Hit Point. If your Traps skill is 2 or higher or your Endurance skill is 4 or higher you lose 0 Hit Points instead.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! Sorry!\" Lyle shouts as he rushes over to help you get to your feet. \"I must have missed one, I thought I had this route perfectly memorized.\" You grab his hand and stumble back to your feet with a groan. \"It's fine. It only grazed me. If I hadn't leaned back it could have smashed my ribs though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyle lets out a sigh and turns to continue forward. \"We're just about there, don't hurt yourself now.\" You laugh and rub your side where the bag had hit you. \"Wasn't planning on it.\" you reply as you follow him to another metal door. \"One more tunnel to go.\" Lyle says as he opens the door for you. \"After you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk the final stretch into wherever Lyle was taking you a small footlocker half buried in the rubble catches your eye off to the side. It had some sort of electronic password lock that had a small number pad on the upper right side of the lid. \"Oh, that? Don't bother, I've tried to get that damn thing open at least a dozen times already...\" Lyle says when he notices you looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I give it a try?\" you ask as you head over to inspect it. Lyle lets out a laugh as he shakes his head. \"I'll give you a couple minutes before I leave you down here. The exit ladder is right around the corner up ahead, see you in a few.\" he replies as he disappears behind a pile of rubble. You pull the footlocker free of the rubble and examine the lock more closely. You'd need to either reset the number pad or pry the lock open somehow, which would take some extreme force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If your Science skill is 4 or higher, your Melee skill is 4 or higher or if you have the Lucky perk you successfully manage to open the box. Inside is 2 Pornographic Magazines, 1 Lacy Bra, 1 High Heels, 2 Bags Of Batteries, 1 Electric Massager, $100 and 5 Caps. You may add any of these items to your inventory.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you are done screwing around with the footlocker you run up ahead to meet back up with Lyle, who was smoking a cigarette and leaning against the ladder to the surface. \"Ready?\" he asks as he stubs out the cigarette on the wall and tosses it on the ground. \"Yeah, I'm eager to see where you've taken me.\" you reply as Lyle begins climbing up the ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never thought that you'd be so happy to be out in the blazing sun again, but after about twenty minutes of traveling through dark smelly sewer tunnels it was a nice change of pace. \"Oh damn, that's pretty bright.\" you say as you hold up your hand to keep the brightness out of your eyes. It was kind of hard to see at the moment as your eyes where still adjusting to your surroundings, but behind you was a large wall made from concrete and sheet metal stack in between some of the collapsed buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you couldn't see much else with a ruined store of some kind blocking your view from the street ahead. \"Welcome to Old Town, this is where we part ways.\" Lyle said as he began climbing back down into the manhole you'd just came from. \"Wait, what about your boss? You said you were offering me some work?\" you reply in confusion as Lyle stops and laughs. \"Of course, this is Old Town! Tons of high rollers and shady businessmen needing people to run jobs for them. Just head up to the bounty board in the center of the plaza near the old statehouse or pay a visit to Wormwood Alley. Good luck to ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say a word in protest he was gone down the manhole and headed back to his street corner to find more talent for his bosses. Truth be told you had heard a few nasty rumors of Old Town, but if this place had the cash to go with its shady businesses and gangsters you didn't much care. \"Guess I'll see what kind of action this place has.\" you say to yourself as you step out from behind the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat unfolded before you was a sight unlike anything you had seen in the wastes. Unlike the rest of Scrap City that you had seen before Old Town was a marvel of wide open clean streets and outdoor gardens. Most of the inner buildings were surprisingly intact compared to the ones lining the wall which encircled the place. The only way in or out that you could see where thin bridges set up at a few checkpoints that were suspended over the wall and connected to nearby buildings. The place even had a few vehicles driving down some of the main roads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so impressed that you hardly knew what to check out first, then you remembered what Lyle had said to you before you left. If you wanted to earn some quick money you'd need to meet with some of the big players and run some jobs. Where are you headed to first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided that sight seeing would have to wait until you got some work done, business before pleasure and all that. After taking a few minutes to walk down the street and have a quick look around you approach a man in a suit and fedora wielding a machine gun. \"Yo muscles, you some kind of security force? Where can I find the statehouse plaza?\" you ask while the guy pauses to look over over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You a merc? Otherwise, you best get the fuck outta here. Old Town isn't a place for poor people or tourists... and the guys in charge don't like being bothered unless its about business.\" he replies as he tightens his grip on his gun. You give the guy a smile to ease the tension. \"Lyle sent me. Lyle The Liar? Said there was work to be had, otherwise I wouldn't be here.\" The man's expression softens a bit upon hearing this and he lowers his gun to his side. He nods as if he understands why you're here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see. Sorry for the rude welcoming, me and my boys have been busy dealing with a lot of punks these past few weeks, the Scrap City militia has been cracking down harder on the drug and sex trades in recent years and making things harder for the bosses. I'm glad we got someone willing to do some work visiting us instead of another deadbeat debtor or prissy asshole. You're looking for the bounty board, right? Just follow the street behind me past the greenhouses, it'll lead you through the bar and casino area all the way to Old Town Park. The bounty board is right in the center, can't miss it.\" the man says as he points off to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, thanks.\" you reply as you begin walking off. \"Just stay away from the Sapphire Dancer, that place is shady as all fuck.\" the man calls after you as you begin walking down the street he pointed out. You nod in affirmative and wave goodbye. As you passed by the greenhouses you noticed a few armed guards and took a peak inside one of the doorways while a gardener was talking to a woman in a lab coat. You could make out cannabis, poppy and even pink leaf plants growing inside, showing while most of the local drugs come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should stop and ask if I can run some packages for them?\" you think to yourself as you head further into town. \"Drug runners probably make a lot of cash but it would be a pain sneaking that shit past some of the checkpoints that have been set up. Not to mention the risk of some junkie asshole stabbing you to get his fix or steal your stash. Still, it' definitely  worth considering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the greenhouses fade from sight behind bars, casinos and whore houses you start to notice more people walking around. Some are dressed in fancy suits and dresses, some are wearing torn rags and rubbing their arms, some are geared up like that mobster guy you met before and some were dressed in tight and revealing clothing... almost no one here looked like a wastelander or mercenary, which made you feel like you stuck out like a sore thumb. No one said anything to you though, so you ignored it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place sure is strange.\" you note as the park finally comes into view up ahead. It wasn't anything super fancy but it was impressive by wasteland standards. It addition to a few leafy trees and moderately healthy looking grass were a few benches, gazebos and even the remains of a stone statue right in front of the statehouse. Just in front of the statue was a large wooden billboard covered in graffiti and pinned with various notes and photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be it.\" you say to yourself. \"Now I just need to find some high paying work and get back on the road. If I'm lucky there'll be a few quick jobs I can do with a decent payout. I'll need a lot to get where I'm going and I can't afford to waste any more time screwing around with little jobs anymore, I need a serious payday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked up to the board and noticed a man in a leather jacket and football helmet was reading to himself near the lower right corner along with a woman in combat fatigues looking at a poster she had pulled off from a spot in the middle. Not wanting to cause trouble you took to the open spot near the left side and began studying the various notes and posters. Several of the bounties had great pay but required a time investment you couldn't give while others were just small time jobs with low pay. After about twenty minutes you had found only three offers that seemed feasible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull each of the flyers off of the wall and give them another quick read while you decided which one seemed like the option:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHELP WANTED!!!! SLAVE TRANSPORT - Hey mercs, have I got a job for you. Okay, see, we got lots of sensitive cargo we picked up from a small farming settlement up north near Sawtooth and were need help transporting it ASAP. No vehicle needed or any type of mount... we got that covered. What we need is a seasoned guard who can keep the marks secure and alive until they reach the drop off. We got buyers close by so it isn't far, the problem is that the damn guards got a tip off from someone and they have several checkpoints on alert for slaves. We'll pay top dollar for each person you can get our buyers, just don't let too many die or you'll get nothing. Nobody, not even bandits will pay for dead bodies and I don't like dealing with cannibals. For details hit up Rocksalt and Mr. Pepper at the Black Moon. Peace out. - Rocksalt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunner Desperately Needed - Look, I'm in some deep shit so I'll make this quick. I'm Dr. Bowen and I work with Al's boys at the northside greenhouse on fifth street. We had a great harvest this year but lost two of our runners to a bust outside the city. We need a skilled runner that can deliver a special package to a very valuable client and I can't trust any rookies with this job. If we don't get moving soon we could lose the package and one of our best customers. If you can do this please contact me or anyone working at the fifth street greenhouse as soon as you can. Thanks. - Dr. Bowen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoorman Requested - We need a new doorman (or hell, doorwoman, I ain't picky) to run security at the front of the Sapphire Dancer club and casino. You'll need to know how to door pat downs, searches and general security checks. Real basic shit, this isn't rocket science. You'll stand at the door from sundown to sunrise. No mouthing off to guests or visitors unless they cause trouble, you lose your temper and start throwing insults or punches and we'll make you wish you had taken a job as a professional asswiper. This job only requires basic patience, politeness and alertness. Experience preferred, but we'll take what we can get. Job includes a hefty paycheck, no commitment and free drinks during your break. See the casino manager for details. - Sapphire Dancer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a moment to consider the pros and cons of each job you decided to go with...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You pocket the notice after memorizing the directions and headed back towards the casino district. Apparently this place was near one of the shadier parts of the town, but still close enough to the main road that thugs and drunks were only a minor problem. \"I wonder why such a place would offer this much for a simple security job, surely they have some bouncers and hired guns watching the place?\" you muse as you pass by a woman wearing nothing but pasties and a red thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well, with pay this good I should be able to finish up in just a few days.\" After heading down the main road you come to a long line up of casinos stretching down the right side of the road all the way towards a small motel on the far end near an intersection. The left side was mostly bars, restaurants and pawn shops along with a few empty lots and collapses buildings. You could see now why security was so important to these guys, being so close to bad side of town likely made them a popular target for troublemakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked by several of the smaller casinos until you came to a large platinum building with blue flags and lights mounted along the front. A lot of the paint was worn away and faded, some of the lights were broken and the flags were tattered and covered in dust and grime, but it was still the most impressive looking building around. You took a moment to take it all in and then headed over to a tall bald black man in a tuxedo and sunglasses standing near the front doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you, kid?\" he asks in a gruff voice as he nods at a man in a top hat who flashes a VIP pass. \"Hello my good man, I'm here about the security position. Is the job still open?.\" you ask as the man folds his arms and lowers his sunglasses. \"You? Ha, you barely come up to my neck... this is a serious job with good pay. If you want to work here you'll need more experience than just watching a few caravans.\" he replies with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle it. Don't judge a book by its cover and all that.\" you reply as the man looks a bit impressed. \"Alright kid, go ahead and talk to the manager. Just remember, this ain't a job for lightweights or slackers, you don't pull your weight or keep your guard up you won't last long.\" he says as he lets out a sigh and digs a keycard out of his pocket. \"Take this and head on in, the boss is in the upstairs office at the end of the right hall. Tell him Roy sent you and he'll set you up. Best of luck to ya kid, you'll need it in this town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give him a smile and pocket the keycard. \"Thank you Roy, I'll get that squared away now.\" you reply as you open the door and head inside. A pleasant wave of coolness from some sort of air conditioner system washed over you as you step into the main lobby and your ears began ringing with loud casino music playing over the loudspeakers. As impressive as the outside was, the inside had it beat by a long shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs nice as it would be to stay and enjoy yourself a little you knew the job would just be harder if you allowed yourself to get used to the comfort and luxury surrounding you, not to mention how much money you could lose gambling. You sighed and head up a large staircase after showing another guard your keycard. As you wall down a short hallway you come to a large wooden door flanked by two more men in tuxedos. \"Can we help you?\" one of them asks as he looks you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy sent me.\" you reply as you hand over the keycard. After giving you a nod the man swipes it and opens the door for you. \"You got a couple minutes, don't take too long. The boss is a busy man.\" the other guard replies as his partner shuts the door behind you. In front of you was a well furnished office with fancy leather furniture, a tiger skin rug and even a large window overlooking the main floor of the casino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anything or take another step a swivel chair spun around with a bored looking blond guy smoking a cigar smiling as his two female body guards stepped to either side of his desk. Each of the women had high powered assault rifles and were wearing beautiful dresses while the bossman himself was decked out in an exquisite pinstripe suit and tie. You kept your cool but it was hard to hide the fact that you were a little impressed at his set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in and have a seat?\" he says suddenly as he pours himself a glass of scotch. \"I trust you're here about the job listing on the bounty board?\" You are surprised he instantly figured out where you were here but did as you were told and took a seat in the big leather chair in front of the desk. \"Yes sir, I'm here for the security job.\" you reply once you've sat down. The man blows a smoke ring as takes a sip of his drink as his two guards look you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good. It's about time we filled that position.\" he says after a brief silence. \"Old Roy is good at what he does but we've been understaffed for a few months now. He's had to deal with all the troublemakers by himself these past few weeks and it's getting harder and harder to convince him to work overtime.\" The boss rubs his eyes as he takes another sip of his drink and spins around to look out the window at the casino floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look like much, but I'll give you a shot. You'll do a half-day today and then come in tomorrow at nine and work until eleven at night with Roy out front. While working with us you'll be set up at a free room at the Starlight Motel just down the road, it ain't great but it covers the three daily meals and utilities. We'll also need at least a three day commitment to make it worth the cost, sound good?\" he says as he lays out the terms and spins back around to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give him a smile and reach out to shake his hand. \"It's a deal boss, three days sounds like just what I need.\" you reply as he slides over a piece of paper. On it was his official seal and signature. \"Very well.\" he says. \"Take that sheet of paper downstairs and take it to the clerk near the exchange windows, she'll get you your gear and show you where the locker room is. Don't disappoint me out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shaking hands and pocketing the paper you wave goodbye to your new boss and pick up your keycard from the guards on the way out. Before doing anything else you check in with the clerk and pick up your equipment. Once you had everything secured in your locker you change into your tuxedo and equipped your concealed baton and a snub nosed revolver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[All Body, Hands and Feet equipment is removed. Your Tuxedo gives you +1 to your Speech and Stealth skills for as long as it is worn.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were ready you then headed back outside to stand guard with Roy, who was searching a woman in a tattered jacket. \"Alright, you're clean. Go on in.\" he says as she picks up her purse and follows her boyfriend inside. Roy smiles slightly when he notices you and leans up against the wall. \"So you got approved, huh? Guess I shouldn't complain about the extra help. Just do as I tell you and you'll do fine rookie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head and take up a spot on the other side of the doors. The warm air was bothersome, but you'd be used to it again some enough. The roof of the casino provided some nice shade as well, probably the hardest part of doing this job wouldn't be the heat, but the long hours and boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright kid, we got some people coming up.\" Roy calls over as a group of greaser types roll up in a motorized cart. \"These guys are members of the Slick 69s, a local gang. They've caused us some trouble in the past, but most of them don't bother us. Search them and stay polite, even if they start acting rude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of the bunch comes up to you and sneers as his cronies fall in line behind him. \"Haven't seen you here before, you the new guard dog protectin' your master's bones?\" he says with a laugh as his buddies chuckle. You nod your head and give him a smile. \"Yes sir, I'll need to pat you and your boys down before you can go in. I'll also need you to hand over any weapons while you're on the premises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader gives you a sour look. \"I'll hand over my weapons, but you don't need to get all grab assy with me. What, you think I'm smugglin' a bomb in these pants? Well, I guess I kinda am...\" he replies with a laugh as his friends chuckle again. You cross your arms and try to look tough. \"I'm sorry, but your associates have caused us trouble in the past. If you have a problem with being searched you'll need to take it up with the boss and your fellow gang members.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader gives you a glare and the hands over his switchblade and 9mm handgun. \"Alright, fine. Me and my boys are just here for a good time. We'll get this shit sorted out so you better just let us in next time.\" he says as he puts his hands on the wall. After checking him and his entourage for weapons and contraband you open the door for them. \"Thank you for your cooperation, sir. Have a good time.\" you say as they disappear one by one inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job keeping your cool rookie.\" Roy compliments as the door closes. \"Some of those guys like starting shit, but staying polite usually gets them to follow the rules. Don't be afraid to get rough if you get attacked first though. ONLY if you get attacked first.\" You nod your head and lean against the wall as the next few gamblers approach. Maybe this job would be pretty easy after all.</span></div></div>",

When she still ignores you you grab her arm and prevent her from opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, get off me fucker!\" she yells as she tries to pull herself free. \"Sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave immediately.\" you say as she digs inside her jacket and swings at you with a switchblade. You yell \"SHIT!\" as the blade narrowly misses cutting open you neck and pull out your baton. The woman glares at you and swings the switchblade again, this time aiming for your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If your Melee skill is 2 or higher you manage to block the attack, otherwise it slice you across the chest and you lose 1 hit point.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, stop!\" you shout as you smack her across the face, sending blood flying from her nose and down her face. To your shock she doesn't even react to the blow and makes another quick swing for your heart, slashing open your tuxedo and drawing a small amount of blood. \"Holy fuck...\" you gasp as you stumble back and give her another good smack across the face, sending several of her teeth flying. Still, she does not even slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is about to strike again when Roy delivers a sharp blow to the back of her neck, which makes a loud crunching sound. The woman makes a sickening gargling sound as she falls forward onto her own weapon, which pierces her left lung. A pool of blood begins surrounding her as she twitches and then falls silent. \"Jesus Christ...\" you mutter as you pull your hand away from your chest injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wound wasn't deep but it stung like a bitch and the palm of your hand was now smeared with blood. \"Looks like she only managed to wing ya.\" Roy says as he looks at your torn tuxedo. \"We'll have to get you a new one for tomorrow, don't worry, this won't come out of your pay or anything. Boss knows a woman who can repair this stuff on the cheap, it's a common enough hazard on the job after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown as you wipe away the blood from your chest before it stains your tuxedo and look down at the dead woman. \"That was some real shit, drugs?\" you ask as Roy shakes his head and pulls the body off to the side. \"Most likely. Drugs are one of Old Town's biggest industries and virtually all the local gangs employ runners and dealers. Last incident like this happened about two months back, lost a good man to a couple of tweakers who tried to rip the guy apart. Now you see why we get a big paycheck.\" he replies as he get back to his post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the rest of the night is uneventful and you are soon able to check out for some well deserved sleep. After saying goodbye to Roy you head over to the Starlight Motel and talk to the manager who shows your your temporary room. It was small and just had the basics, but the bed wasn't half bad, which was the most important part. After a night of mostly sound sleep you headed back to the Sapphire Dancer for your next shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new tuxedo was a bit more loose fitting, but it was still better than one with a giant hole in the chest. You wave to Roy as you take up your position on the other side of the doors and the day begins. At around noon a nervous guy in a brown suit and hat walks up with a briefcase. \"Can I go in, please?\" in asks in an apprehensive tone as he looks around. \"Sure, but you're not a regular so I'll need to search you. Also hand over any weapons you may be carrying.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy frowns but does as he is told. After checking the briefcase and patting him down you find no weapons aside from a simple straight razor and a pair of brass knuckles. \"Can I go in now?\" he asks again. You feel like he is hiding something but aren't sure what so you decide to pat him down again. \"Alright sir, let me just give one moment to make sure you're clean.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If your Stealth skill is 3 or higher you manage to find and confiscate a toothbrush shank before having him escorted off the premises. If not, then he manages to sneak it inside where another guard catches him trying to stab a waitress in the leg and you receive 1 Demerit.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater than day a trio of women approach you claiming to be VIPs, but when you ask them for their passes they get angry and claim that they forgot them at home. You tell them that they can't enter as a VIP without a pass and two leave in frustration while the third woman stays behind to argue. After several minutes it becomes clear that she won't be leaving anytime soon without a good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If your Speech skill is 3 or higher you manage to successfully convince her to go home for the day without causing any more trouble. If not she presents you with a fake pass and runs inside while you're distracted. By the time you catch up with her she is causing a disruption on stage and interrupting some strippers that are trying to dance. After the guards finally pull her out the door she has broken several bottles of wine and assaulted an actual VIP, giving him a black eye. You receive 2 Demerits.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the excitement of the last few hours you were pleased that the early evening visitors were mostly quiet and well-behaved. That all changed about forty minutes before your shift was over when a woman in a leather jacket and sunglasses walked up alongside a man in a tattered white shirt and headband. The woman was holding a wooden bat wrapped in barbed wire and the guy had a kitchen knife with the Slick 69 logo painted on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and my boyfriend are going in. We aren't here to take any shit after the hassle you've caused our boys over the last few days, let us in or I start swinging.\" the woman growls as she stops in front of you. You cross your arms and try to look intimidating yet friendly, hard as that was. \"You folks are welcome, but we gotta search you. You'll also need to turn over all your weapons, including that bat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman laughs as she slings her weapon over her shoulder and spits at your feet. \"No, fuck you. We run this town and we came here to enjoy ourselves, not play around with some jackass rent-a-cop. Open that door for us or we fucking break it down.\" she replies as her companion drags a finger across his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If your Speech skill is or you have the Intimidating Presence perk you manage to convince them to back off without a fight and they leave. If not they attack you and cause some damage to the front of the casino. You and Roy managed to fend them off without killing them but suffer some nasty hits during the fight. The duo angrily run off swearing revenge and Roy excuses you from work a half an hour early. You lose 1 hit point and receive 1 Demerit.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enjoy a lukewarm meal in your apartment and head to bed early so you'll be fresh for your second full day. Amazingly, things mostly went smooth with only a few minor complaints from guests and an incident with a guy trying to convince you to let him sell his wares near the casino entrance. You told him that the boss didn't want any outside business happening right at his doorstep, but he refused to leave even as you searched other visitors and opened the door for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, at around noon you grew tired of the guy harassing passersby and asking them if they wanted to buy some canned meat or magazines. You walk over to him and ask what it'll take for him to leave peacefully without causing a ruckus. The man smiles and opens his trench coat so that you could see the various goods he had for sale. \"Just buy a hundred bucks worth of merch and I'll hock my goodies on another street corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If you have a Moonsine or Wasteland Martini you can give it to him as a bribe to leave. If not you must buy at least $100 worth of goods from his shop. If your Speech skill is 4 or higher you only need to buy $50 worth of goods instead. If you don't meet any of these requirements you are forced to chase him off just as a senior guard comes to check on you and receive a lecture for moving away from your post. Even when Roy explains the situation he gives you a demerit.

You nod and check to make sure your baton and gun were ready and easily accessible. All you have to do is make it through today and you'd have the funds to cover the rest of your trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Roy talk a bit as the usual bums and gambling addicts show up for their daily fleecing and keep an eye out for anyone looking suspicious. About an hour before noon a woman in a thong, pasties and fancy headdress walks up with a worried frown on her face. She looked to be about ten seconds from crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ma'am. I think I've seen you before, do you work here?\" you ask as her eyes fall on you. She seems hesitant to respond and takes a deep breath before replying. \"Yeah, I lost my I.D. in a fire last night. My apartment complex suffered a drug lab explosion and half of my room was burnt, including my savings. I barely had time to get out with my outfit before my bed caught fire.\" she says in an exhausted tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's pretty shitty...\" you say in a comforting tone. Roy shakes his head as he lets out a sigh. \"I know you, Silva right? I can let you in but you'll need to stop by the clerk and pick up a new I.D.\" he replies solemnly. Silva cringes and folds her hands together. \"I know, but those cost $25, right? I just lost all my money and need to find a new place to stay, I can't really afford that... please, can't you talk to someone about this? I can't live on the street... I just kicked a nasty drug addition and I'm still suffering from withdraws...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy frowns as he goes to open the door for her. \"I'm sorry Sil, I wish I could help ya but the boss is really cracking down on spending right now, I doubt he'd be happy if I started asking for free shit and I really need money myself right now. This job is all I have.\" he says as Silva struggles to retain her composure. \"It's alright.\" she says finally as she walks over to the door. \"I'll manage somehow, I always have before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You may choose to give Silva any amount of your own money to help her out.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If you give her $1 to $25 she thanks you profusely before heading inside.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If you give her $26 to $50 she is so relieved that she gives you a hug and improves your mood, you gain +1 to your Speech skill for the next 3 pages.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If you give her $51 or more she breaks down crying and tells you that you probably saved her life. The day ahead doesn't seem so intimidating to you anymore now, you get +1 to your Speech skill and +1 to your Endurance skill for the next 3 pages.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day wears on slowly as more gamblers head inside. Some argue a bit or try to score freebies but you've gotten used to dealing with the whiners and scam artists. Roy smiles as a wealthy woman in a blue evening gown heads inside and turns to face you. \"It's gonna be a shame to see you go, rookie. It hasn't been all sunshine and roses these past few days but it was great to have the help. I'm gonna miss having another watchdog guarding my ass out here with the crazies and troublemakers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give him a grin as you gaze at the pink and orange sky overhead. \"It was great workin' with ya Roy.\" you reply as you lean back against the wall of the casino. \"I might have to take up some more work here on my way back home after I get done with my business trip. I just hope I made the right choice coming out here, I sunk a good bit of funds on this little vacation of mine... I'd hate for it to just be some wild goose chase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy laughs and you both talk for a few minutes as the light of the setting sun fades into the inky black night sky. The whole street was lit up now with rival casinos and everything from pawn shops to restaurants turning on the signs and lights in the hope of attracting customers. It was all so bright and distracting you didn't even notice the group of figures approaching the front door until they were only a few yards away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy shoots you a cautious glance as he finishes up a story about a friend of his who got robbed downtown and you silenty turn around to greet the new arrivals. It was the Slick 69's again, including the man and woman from before and the guy you met on your first day. There was about a dozen of them in all and most had sour looks painted on their faces while the rest gave you a death glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew by this point that trouble was coming but decided to keep up the polite and welcoming facade in the hopes of maybe talking them down and avoiding a conflict. \"Good evening ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Sapphire Dancer.\" you say as you casually slip your hand onto the handle of your revolver. \"Before you all head in I'll need you to ask you to leave your weapons at the door and submit to a quick search.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall guy in sunglasses, a red bandana and spike studded leather jacket stepped up and cracked his knuckles. No doubt this guy was the leader. With a quick wave of his hand the rest of the crew drew knives, clubs, chains and a few guns as well. Things were starting to look more than a little grim. You tightened your grip on your revolver as you waited for the guy to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly a minute of smug smirking he did just that. \"Good evening, little pups. I'm Johnny Napalm, the leader of this little posse. Now you wanna tell me why you been mistreating my guys whenever they show up to have a good time? Hell, there's no way you guys will stay in business with such shitty practices driving away paying customers.\" Both you and Roy stayed silent as Johnny lit up a cigarette and leaned against a support pillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Roy decided to speak up just as Johnny exhaled a puff of smoke. \"You should have reigned your boys in more, we lost two guards to conflicts started by the Slick 69's in the past and have even had to repair damages from vandalism done by your crew and the junkies you sell drugs to. If you don't want to get searched every time you come here you should behave yourselves better and no piss off the boss so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny laughs along with his crew as lowers his sunglasses. \"Well shit partner, all you had to do was ask! Tell you what, you let us in right now and we'll all be on our best behavior, scout's honor.\" he says with a big grin as a few of his thugs chuckle. \"Yeah, you tell these punks, Johnny!\" the woman from before yelled as her boyfriend cheered his boss on. You didn't like the way things were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I can't just let you in after all the trouble you caused... but I can have a talk with the boss about it.\" Roy said in a steady tone as he leaned back against the wall. \"In fact, my partner here only has a little under an hour of their shift left. If you're patient we can have this whole thing sorted out with no bloodshed, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny smiled and then frowned as he stubbed out his cigarette and drew a 9mm pistol from his jacket. \"Afraid not, we came here to party, not wait around. We were thinking of just a little gambling and drinking, maybe a rape or two to put your little club in its place, but now? I think we'll just bust down the fuckin' door and shoot the place up for shits and giggles, what do you say to t-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could react Roy had drawn his own gun and put one right through the back of Johnny's throat before he could get another word out. His entire gang stood in stunned silent for a moment as their leader's body fell to the cold ground with a thud before opening fire and beginning their assault. Roy managed to pick off two more, one with a hatchet and one with a handgun before taking two slugs from a .32 revolver in his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drew your own weapon and put another gangster down just as they aimed their gun at Roy and then dunked behind a nearby support pillar just as they returned fire. Glass shattered behind you as Roy made a mad dash inside to get help while you popped out the other side of the pillar to cap a guy on the edge running up with a machete. Nearly half of the assailants were dead, but they were rushing your position as their buddies provided support fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to take out two guys running at you with melee weapons, one of which was the guy who had threaten you back on your first day. You had to admit, seeing his shocked face as two revolver rounds punctured his lungs and heart was pretty satisfying. Unfortunately, just as you finished up a quick reload with some spare bullets the couple from the other day managed to get close enough to knock the gun out of your hand with a bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly withdrew your baton as the woman swung her bat at your face and her boyfriend attempted to run you through with a kitchen knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If your Melee skill is 4 or higher you avoid any serious wounds and managed to hold your own in the fight. If not, they manage a few devastating hits that leave you reeling. You lose 2 hit points.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for the boyfriend to slip up and beat him over the head when he lunges forward, grabbing his knife in the process and planting it in his neck. \"Oh no! Phil!\" the woman cries out in shock and grief as he slumps against the nearby pillar and slides to the ground. You take advantage of this and slice open the woman's belly while she is caught off guard and then smash her skull into paste with her own bat as soon as she falls to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp as you wipe a bit of sweat and blood from your face and go to retrieve your revolver from the ground. Just as you go to raise it you see a very pissed off looking man aiming a sawn-off shotgun at your chest. You freeze when you realize you won't be able to get off a shot in time just as a hail of gunfire cuts the man down along with a few of his buddies that were standing behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god, it's about time...\" you say exasperatedly as you slump to the ground and catch your breath. The few remaining Slick 69's flee as fresh guards dressed in tuxedos arrive on the scene wielding machine guns and rifles. The main door was completely shot to hell but at least you were alive...  </span></div></div>",

You got there just in time.\" you reply as you head into the locker room to change out of your messy clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You regain all of your Head, Body and Feet items and removed your Tuxedo.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning yourself up a bit one of the guards excuses you to go head over to the clinic to make sure you were okay. You thank them as you put your normal clothes back on and head back out onto the main floor. By the time you walk across the room to the back hallway you noticed that most of the people had moved backed to gambling away their money on slots, roulette and poker. You shook your head as you opened a door with a large red cross on it and stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was fairly clean for a wasteland medic station, aside from some dust, a little crime and faded bloodstains everything was nice and shiny. A woman with grey hair up in a bun scribbled something down on her clipboard as she got up from her desk to greet you. \"Ah, another one. Let's see what the damage is, follow me.\" she says as she walks over to a chair and asks you to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running some tests she concludes that you're in good enough condition to be moving around and have no life threatening injuries, which means that any fixing up you want done comes out of your own pocket. On the plus side you do get a company discount since you haven't officially finished your three days until you see the boss and collect your payment. Yay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You may pay $20.

You head over to a clean white mattress when you notice Roy sitting up in a bed near the corner of the room. \"Shit, are okay?\" you ask as you sit down on the side facing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, kid? I thought for sure you'd died in that bloodbath! Damn, you don't look like you got a scratch on you... hell, I'm impressed. Real impressed.\" Roy replies with a pained smile. \"I took some lead out there, came within an inch of having my kidney popped and narrowly avoided a puncture wound to by intestines. I'm lucky to be alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh as you lean back a bit. \"I'm glad you made it, I nearly died myself. If not for the back up arriving when they did I'd have a face that looks like swiss cheese  right about now. One of those gangster thugs had a sawn off shotgun leveled right at my head when he got mowed down. Another second and I'd been laying in the pile of bodies outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy shakes his head as he clutches his side. \"Damn, sounds like we both lucked out big time. Heh. Maybe we should hit the tables before we go home tonight.\" he replies through pained gasps. You grin and let him continue as the doctor walks over to you. \"The pain is the worst part, you'll get used to it kid. I'm glad I was wrong about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head as the doctor gives you your test results and are relied to find that you have no broken bones, internal bleeding or other serious injury. \"Thanks, doc. I'll see you around Roy. You should definitely ask the boss for a promotion for this.\" you say as you get up and head for the door. \"Ha ha, will do, kid. Will do.\" Roy calls back as the door shuts behind you. It was nice to see that at least a few things went right tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a breath and then head back up the stairs to the main office to collect your hard earned money. The bossman was smoking a cigar and sipping on booze as he was last time you met up with him while looking out at the guards returning to their posts on the casino floor. After a minute of reflection on the nights events he turns to face you with a satisfied grin. You simply nod your head and sit back in your chair as he digs your cash out of his suit and puts it on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did great work out there tonight. Those assholes were harassing us for months until you show up and take half of the crew out in one night. Shame about the door, but it's like they say... if you want to make an omelette... ha ha. Anyway, he's your dough.\" he says as he stacks a small pile of bills on the table. You quickly scoop it up and begin counting as the boss pours you a drink. You now have enough money to fund your trip and even have a little extra in spending cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You gain $200 minus $25 for each Demerit you acquired while on guard duty. If you gave money to Silva you lose 1 Demerit.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let a satisfied smile spread across your lips as you tucked the money away and stood to leave only for the boss to hold his hand up and stop you. \"Just one sec before you head out, okay? I know you just wanted the three day job, but I got another task that needs dealing with... you could always use more spending money, right?\" he says as he folds his hands on the table. His lady bodyguards give you piercing glances as you sit back down and cross your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll hear you out on this offer, but I've already wasted enough time in this city. I wouldn't be able to work more than another day at the most.\" you reply as you take a sip of your drink. The boss nods in appreciation. \"Good. Good. This job won't take long at all. I just need someone to look into what happened to one of my girls. She hasn't shown up for work in almost a week and I think something might have happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and rub your eyes. \"Let me guess. You want me to track her down and bring her back here, right?\" you asked as you take another sip of your drink. The boss frowns as he exhales a puff of smoke. \"It's a bit more complicated than that, she owes me a debt and I don't think she'd have the courage to skip town. Personally, I think she might be a corpse by now, but who cares? All I want is the money. If you find her, great, bring her here and I'll pay you a little extra... but the cash is your number one priority.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought over the job this guy was proposing. This would likely require some detective work but you could get it wrapped up tonight if you did a little investigating. Of course, you didn't have a lot of time to waste either... getting started on a job could greatly delay you even more if things go poorly. You didn't really need the money but a little extra cash was always good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boss seems to sense your hesitation and gives you a reassuring laugh. \"Hey, don't worry if you can't do it. You already fulfilled your contract and are free to go at anytime. I can always get someone else to do this but I know you'll get results, that's why I'm offering you hard cash. If you'd rather head off with a lighter coin purse I'm sure I can find a replacement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few more moments to think as you relax in your chair.</span></div></div>",

The boss grins upon hearing these words and takes out a few bills to hand to you. \"Good, good. That's what I like to hear, you're a real go getter kid. Here's a bit up front to handle any minor expenses you run into on the job. You'll get the rest when you complete your assignment, sound good?\" he replies. You nod your head and pocket the cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You gain $50.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you sir, I'll head out as soon as you give me the details.\" you say as he lights up a fresh cigar. He smiles and offers you one, but you decline. \"I'll get right to the point so you can get moving.\" he says as he swings his chair around to grab a folder from a nearby filing cabinet. \"Just give me a second to find Jenny's profile... ah, here it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boss opens a folder on his desk and hands you a picture of a young woman who looked to be in her late twenties. She had black hair tied up into a short pony tail, green piercing eyes, tan skin and a tiny scar near her lower lip. She wasn't particularly busty compared to most of the other girls you've seen working here, but she still looked to be a cup size or two above the average woman. It was hard to tell in the photo, but she also appeared to be wearing some sort of sleek leather jacket with a tank top underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty sexy, boss.\" you note as you try to memorize as many details as you can. \"This our missing girl?\" The boss nods and blows a ring of smoke as he organizes the other papers in the folder. After giving you a minute to become familiar with your target he hands you a bio and a small folder paper with a directions to a street address on it. \"Here's all of her info that I can share.\" the boss says as you fold the directions up and put them away before reading the profile. The boss continues talking as you do your research.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name: Jenny Garland. Sex: Female. Blood Type: O- Age: Unknown. Living Relatives: Unknown. Our girl Jenny here has a contract with my casino that covers her debt owed for past goods and services rendered by the Sapphire Dancer. In short, she owns me a bundle and has tried to get out of it in the past. She hasn't ever tried to skip town, but she has met with many shady characters during her time with us. She's probably dead, but that isn't what's important. What I want is simple: her stash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow as you look up from the biography. \"Her stash? Is she some kind of druggie?\" you ask. The boss laughs along with his bodyguards as he hands you a small note with a code on it. \"No, her addictions were of a different kind. She's an augment junkie, addicted to getting expensive cybernetic upgrades and hoarding tech. Like I said, she's probably gone but there is a small chance I can still get her goods. It won't cover her entire debt but it looks like the best I'll get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as you take the code and put it away. \"I see, this is just a simple retrieval job then.\" you reply. The boss frowns and blows another smoke ring while handing you a small photo with a small electronic device on it. \"No quite. The stash is your main priority, but I what that girl back if at all possible. She still owes me a lot and may have gotten mixed up with some bad people in this town. I'll pay you for the stash, but if you can recover her, dead or alive, or at least bring back this cyber implant I'll give you a hefty bonus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the photo of the tiny machine before handing it back. \"That augmentation? It's valuable?\" you ask. The boss nods as he takes a long drag on his cigar. \"It's worth fifty times what I paid you tonight, maybe more. It's an ultra rare charisma booster model, worth thousands on the blackmarket scene. I don't care if you trace it all the way to the biggest kingpin in the city, you get it back for me and I make it rain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you get up and stretch your arms. \"Get the stash, get the girl if possible and return here with the gadget for a massive payday... I think I got.\" you say as you head for the door. \"See you later tonight, hopefully.\" The boss smiles upon hearing this and tells you not to disappoint him. With that you step out of through the shattered front door and walk off into the night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cool night air blew gently across your skin as you walked down the nearly deserted street to the address you were given. It was a pleasant change from the afternoon heat and crowds of deadbeats and druggies walking about, but the atmosphere was a little creepy under the big crescent moon hanging overhead. Still, you had your gear back and were more than a match for any random punks that tried messing with you, which was a pretty big confidence booster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little over twenty minutes of walking you came to a long desert street dotted with rusted out cars, trucks and a hallowed out bus serving as a sort of makeshift fence on the far intersection. This place was a lot less polished than most of what you'd see so far in Old Town and was clearly some sort of slum where the less fortunate residents lived. The only positive thing you could think to say was that most of the buildings were still standing and relatively intact at least, though most had boarded up windows and locked doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check the address again and head over to a large apartment building with a few lights visible through the front windows. The place had clearly seen better days but looked to have some regular maintenance and running electricity, which was more than could be said for most of its neighbors. You walk up a few stone steps to the front door and knock once before entering. Assuming it was okay to come inside you step into a short hallway with raggedy olive green carpet covering the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the far end was a big guy in a tank top sitting in a comically small metal folding chair in front of a stairwell who looked you over as you approached. As you got closer you noticed a large baseball bat studded with nuts and bolts propped up against the wall behind him. The guy honestly looked pretty intimidating, but you were here on business and determined to get inside by any means necessary. He pulls a toothpick out of his mouth and folds his arms as you go to address him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If your Speech skill is 2 or higher you manage to bluff your way past him by claiming to be a city investigator here to collect payment from the owner in exchange for covering up a crime. If not you have to pay him a small bribe. You lose $10.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith muscles taken care of you quickly head up the stairwell to the fifth floor where Jenny's room was located. The smell of mildew was strong even in the hallway but you knew the quicker you searched the room the soon you could leave this place. After carefully stepping over a discarded syringe and some festering trash bags you come to room 504 and gently knock on the door so as not to disturb anyone. It was pretty late and the last thing you need was to cause a scene and attract unwanted attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jenny doesn't answer the door you draw your revolver and carefully turn the knob. To your surprise the door slid open without so much as a squeak from the hinges. Not missing a beat you walked into the tiny 3 room apartment and checked to see if anyone was here. It was hard navigating past all of the piles and stacks of junk but you managed to avoid knocking anything over as you did a quick sweep of the main room, bedroom and bathroom. Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you knew the coast was clear you immediately began looking for the safe she had hidden somewhere. After nearly an hour of carefully moving around boxes, paintings and shelves you found it under a pile of dirty clothes in the bathroom tub. \"Ugh, are you kidding me...?\" you groan in frustration as you pinch your nose and try typing in the code the boss gave you. Unfortunately, it was incorrect and locked the handle in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If your Science skill is 3 or higher or you have the Explosive Crafter perk you managed to pop the lock open. Inside were some loose bills and a few scrawled notes. You gain $235 and 3 Clues.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter inspecting the safe you head over to the PC sitting on a desk in the main room next to a towering stack of old tapes, CDs video cards and DVDs. Working personal computers were a rare luxury in the wasteland and this model appeared to be both advanced and in good shape. You remembered hearing from a courier a while back that some of the biggest settlements have even managed to restore working internet for their richer citizens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was exciting to think that you might get a chance to see such an amazing feature firsthand but you were quickly left with disappointment when you booted the thing up and found everything still offline. It made since as Scrap City, despite being one of the largest settlements in the region, was still pretty small compared to some of the ones in the far east. \"Maybe in a decade for so.\" you say solemnly as you look over the files on the desktop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the password your boss gave you had worked this time. After reading over the documents you download all of the information onto a connected USB drive and remove it from the computer. You had seen some pretty cool info and knew it would fetch a high price to the right buyer, but the boss would probably ask to keep it. Oh well, you still had more work to do anyway. You grab a few intact magazines from a nearby stack and continue your work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You gain 2 Workin' Indoors, 1 Doctor Bags And Pill Bottles and 3 Clues.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting all you can from the computer you head to the bathroom to take a leak and maybe find some more useful stuff. Aside from some rusty pipes, a tub full of old laundry and a safe there wasn't really a lot to look for in here. The medicine cabinet was empty, the mirror didn't have a false back like you'd hoped and the walls didn't conceal anything but maybe some mold and grime. Still, you take a few minutes to search and make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If your Stealth skill is 2 or higher you manage to uncover a small metal box hidden in the back tank of the toilet. Inside is Jenny's medicine stash and a personal note to pick up some more supplies. You gain 1 Aspirin, 2 Unlabeled Bottle Of Pills and 1 Clue.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the bathroom taken care of you move on to the bedroom. There should definitely be some nice stuff in here. You search all of the drawers, the closet and the shelves. You mostly just find things like worn out clothes, discarded computer junk and old magazines but there are a few cool things you take notice of as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You gain 1 Guns And Bullets Without The Bullshit, 1 Ninja Boy And Gadget Girl, 1 Leopard Print Thong and 1 Clue.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If your Sex skill is 3 or higher you notice a highly suspicious looking shoebox near the back of the closet labeled \"SPARE PARTS\" and open it to find a nice little stash of \"entertainment\" items. You gain 2 Condoms, 1 New People New Passions, 1 Exotic Tastes, 1 More Than Just Butt Stuff, 1 Discreet Prescription, 1 Electric Massager and 2 Bag Of Batteries.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If your Melee skill is 3 or higher you manage to break the lock off of a footlocker under the bed and find several receipts and order forms from various local tech stores and pawn shops. You gain 3 Clues.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If you have the Lucky perk you accidentally stumble near the closet and pull down several tattered old clothes... revealing a rare outfit tucked away behind a large coat. You gain 1 Hazmat Suit.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after searching all over the bed room you do a final sweep of the main room to see if you may have missed anything. You move around anything that isn't nailed down and keep an eye out for anything that may be hidden or suspicious looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If your Stealth skill is 4 or higher you notice a small wooden box duct taped to the underside of a table near the couch and open it up. Inside you find several personal notes and a log of fees paid to a shady sounding individual along with a distinctive looking signature on one of the papers. You gain 5 Clues.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If your Traps skill is 2 or higher you notice that a lot of notes make reference to augments commonly seen on assassins and hitmen such as retractable blades and bomb dischargers. While Jenny seems mostly uninterested in these types of augments it does shed some light on where who she may have visited recently. You gain 2 Clues.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If you have the Master Chef perk you notice that Jenny has several expensive spices sitting in her cabinet and check the bottles. Instead of ingredients you find chemicals typically used in human augmentation and trace amounts of unidentified drugs. One of the bottles even has a short list of recent transactions done on behalf of a drug dealer with associations with several local thugs. Very interesting. You gain 3 Clues.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're sure you've found everything you possibly can you add all the information you've uncovered and see if you can uncover a lead. It was clear that Jenny was indeed trying to skip town to avoid paying her debt, but she's been so busy it's hard to pin where she might be at now. After leaving the room you head downstairs to the guard and ask him a few questions about some of the names and places you learned about. He begrudgingly tells you what little he knows and offers to give you some directions for a little cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You may pay $100. If you do you gain 3 Clues.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of your resources exhausted you head back out into the night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After assembling all of your clues and going over everything you found you noticed a few names kept coming up over and over. Apparently Jenny was working with some slavers sometime before she disappeared, quite recently too if the dates are to be believed. What an augment junkie would want to do with those scumbags wasn't clear, but her trips to a local pawn shop just outside the slums made a little more sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral sources indicated that she bought most of her tech from this little store, including a few of her augments, quite impressive for such a small business. You had a feeling in your gut that this place was probably a front for something and probably heavily guarded, but with no other leads you'd have to head into the lion's den and hope for the best. After checking to make sure your revolver was loaded and ready for action you headed off to your next destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fairly short walk, a little under fifteen minutes when you came to a slightly more lively neighborhood make up of poor folks and street bums huddled around barrel fires and sleeping on worn mattresses in tattered tents. Most people were in bed trying to get a decent amount of sleep but there were a few vagrants and drifters sitting around talking and sipping on cups of cheap water. There were a few different stores to be found and you didn't feel like wasting the time it would take to visit them all so you headed over to a few men in grimy shirts and baseball hats and asked for directions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey seemed a bit distant at first but once you got to talking a man with a rag hat perked up and told you that he knew the place you were looking for. You are about to ask him to tell you where it is when he grins with a mouth full of crooked teeth and holds out his hand. Seems he wasn't interested in helping without a small kickback. You sigh and look the man over, he was clearly desperate and in need of the cash so it'd be hard to convince him to part with the info for free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If your Speech skill is 3 or higher you managed to convince the man that you are broke. If not you must pay him a small amount to get him to cough up the directions. You lose $25.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dealing with the men you wished them all luck and headed off down the street to the intersection and headed left down a cracked road lit up with dim streetlights. You kept an eye out for a placed called \"New Machines\" like it had said on the notes you had and found and breathe a sigh of relief when you come across a small brick building with a lit up interior. It was still open at least, that was probably a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently pushed the front door open and the soft ding of a bell drew the attention of the elderly shopkeeper reading a magazine near the back counter. \"Oh, welcome! I'll be right with you!\" he says as he marks his spot gets up from his chair to meet you. You give him a smile as he shakes your hand and escorts you over to the counter. \"Did you come here looking for something in particular or would you like to see some of our new items we just picked up from a trade caravan?\" he says excitedly as you look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place may have been small but it was clear from the shelves and stacks of gadgets that this little old man had a deep knowledge of technology and was likely a professional when it came to repair and maintenance of things like computers and robotics. \"Wow, so many mechanical doodads and gizmos. You must be a real master when it comes to tech stuff. I take it this is a specialty store?\" you asked in an impressed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man gives you a grin as he gestures to all of the spare parts lining his counter and stands back so that you can get a good look. \"Why yes stranger, I've been working with machines my whole life. You hear about that plane that they got working up in Brownsand a few decades back? My daddy had a direct hand in that, him and his crew. I don't mean to brag, but when it comes to vehicles, computers or augments you couldn't be in better hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at the mention of augments but try not to give away why you came here as the man holds up a fancy tool and begins listing its various features. You politely listen for a few minutes as the old man shows you some of his more popular items like miniature gun cleaning stations and food sanitizers before walking over to a shelf and pretending to be interested in something. When the shop owner walks over to ask if you found something you casually step back and pretend to think for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... you mentioned augments, didn't you? I've heard of those... quite expensive but supposed to be well worth the money.\" you say as the pawn owner raises an eyebrow. \"I've had a few friends who got augmented, but it was never my thing. Bit of a waste of hard earned cash, if you ask me.\" you finish as you turn around to look at the front door. You could tell the guy who ran this place knew his stuff and would hate to lose a potential customer... especially one interested in something as expensive as augments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man quickly grabs your hand and turns you back around. \"Now now, I can assure you that augments are well worth the steep price, provided you get them from a proper medical professional such as myself. Is there any chance I could talk you into seeing what I have on offer? I just got a fresh shipment of top of the line goods from my supplier, excellent hardware I assure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown and pretend to be disinterested for a moment before turning to the door and back again. \"Well, alright... I suppose it couldn't hurt to look.\" you say with a fake sigh. The man lights up upon hearing this and begins escorting you to the back door behind the counter. \"Ah yes, that's the spirit young one! Just follow me, I promise you won't be disappointed!\" he says as he unlocks the door and ushers you into a small back room styled like a medical clinic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe asks you to have a seat while he hands you a clipboard listing all of the available augmentations he has available. You look over the list and wonder if maybe you should get an augment after all. The procedure didn't take long at all and you'd still have plenty of time to catch up to jenny. The choice is yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If your Science skill is 5 you manage to impress the pawn owner so much with your knowledge of augmentation and robotics that he discounts all of his Augments by $100 for a one-time exclusive offer.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================<br>\r\nNeural Reflex Enhancer $250<br>\r\nCyber Eye $250<br>\r\nDetoxifier Module $300<br>\r\nSteel Knuckles $250<br>\r\nRefined Grip $250<br>\r\nFoot Guards $250<br>\r\nGel Muscle Infusion $500<br>\r\n=================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking over the various augments and deciding if cybernetic enhancement is something you're interested in you get up from the chair and follow the old man back out into the main room of the pawn shop. \"Before I go there is one more thing I'd like to talk about, if you don't mind?\" you ask as the man goes back to reading his magazine. He looks up for a moment, sighs, and then puts the magazine back down before turning his attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, what do you need to know? Want to learn more about augmentation technology?\" he asks in a somewhat hopeful tone as you stretch your arms. \"No thanks, I've learned plenty about augmentation for today. I know its late and we're both probably a little tired but I just had a few questions before I head home. First, do you know anything about a woman named Jenny Garland?\" you reply as the man rubs his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... Jenny? Yes... I may have had a customer with that name... or maybe it was a Judy? Julie? Anyway, why do you need this information? I'm not in the habit of disclosing personal info on my clients you know...\" he says in a hesitant tone as if he's trying to hide something. You try not to grin as you think over your response. This guy definitely knows where she went, you just need to get the information out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry if I appear nosy.\" you reply as you give him a smile. \"You see, Jenny was a friend of mine... a close friend... and I think she might be in trouble. She's been missing for days and I just got word some casino thugs are after her.\" The old man grimaces as he puts his hand over his mouth. \"Oh... oh no, I thought she'd have more time. Her old boss must really want to collect on her debt... which is why he sent you here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can react the pawn owner pulls a silenced pistol from under his coat and levels it at your chest. \"Fuck.\" you think to yourself when you realize how careless it was to lower your guard. \"This guy is protecting her... but that also means he helped her escape.\" You put up your hands as the guy takes a step back and leans on his counter, never moving the gun an inch as he stares you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave now. Jenny has already left. Your boss won't get his money and I don't care if he comes after me. If you go now I'll let you live, but forget about finding that girl. She's gone.\" he says in a worried tone. It was clear he was putting on a brave face to disguise his fear, but that could work to your advantage. \"Easy now.\" you say as you take a few steps towards the door and think up your next response.</span></div></div>",

We worked together at the Sapphire Dancer casino, she was a stripper and I was one of the guards.\" you say as you take a few more steps back. The man's expression softens slightly as you force yourself to cry a few fake tears. \"I... I'm glad she's safe, honestly... I just... I never got a chance to say goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man frowns as he looks you over. From what you could tell he was buying your lie and struggling to keep his gun on you. For all of his tech knowledge this guy was clearly a big softie at heart. \"I-I'll go.\" you say with a sniffle. \"Just let her know I'll miss her if you see her again.\" The man lowers his gun and curses under his breath. You frowns at you once again before putting the guy away and apologizes. \"I'm sorry kid... it's just... Jenny has some bad people after her, I didn't want to take chances. She's lucky to have someone who cares for her like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and wipe your eyes as he continues. \"Jenny made an appointment with a group of slavers, horrible villains, to ship herself out of town in one of their undercover transports. She leaves tonight, youngster, I doubt you'll be in time to catch her... but I can give you directions.\" He pulls out a piece of paper and gives you an address near the far side of Old Town by the wall. \"I'll warn you now, these people don't like visitors unless they're on business. Watch yourself and... good luck youngster. Tell her goodbye for me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give the man a hug, pocket the directions and bid him farewell as you head back out onto the streets. It was still a few hours until dawn, but the place jenny was at was pretty far away so you didn't waste any time heading out. Even if she wasn't there she couldn't have gotten far, you'd track her down no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rounding a corner you paused for a brief moment to catch your breath. All this walking was a real pain in the ass, though it would hopefully be worth it. You look up at a train yard surrounded by a rusted chain-link fence with a few wooden shacks set up on the dead grass and gravel. This looked like the place the pawn broker had described, you just hoped you weren't too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head on up to the open gates and nodded to the guardsman in leather armor as you walked over. \"Welcome stranger, most of our stock is spoken for at the moment but we're still accepting appointments. No lookie loos, however. If you wanna see the goods and don't have an appointment you'll have to cough up some cash.\" he says in a gruff tone as he lights up a smoke. You frown as you look up at the main building. You really didn't want to waste any more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[If your Speech skill is 3 or higher you manage to convince the man that you're here on business. If not you begrudgingly hand over $50 as insurance of your good behavior.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, go ahead in.\" the man says as he hands you a small red badge. \"Keep that on you at all times and don't cause trouble. If you behave like an ass you'll find yourself in a cage or in the ground. Looking is fine, but don't manhandle the merchandise or pester the guards unless you plan on buying. Lastly, don't forget to check back with me and hand in your badge before leaving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head as you pin the badge to a free spot on your clothes and walk past the gate. Only a few guards were up and about at this hour, along with a couple slaves cowering in cages or holding pens. As a guard with a rifle walks by on his way to the security outpost you ask for a few directions and describe Jenny to him. \"Oh, that hot little number? Yeah, she's spoken for I'm afraid, but she hasn't shipped out yet. Maybe you can convince the boss to sell her to you. Just head inside the station and look for the guy in the sunglasses and red suit. Can't fuckin' miss him\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank the guard and head inside. The interior of the station was connected to a short tunnel leading through the rubble wall surround Old Town, making it clear how most of the slavers moved their product. You walk past a row of cages filled with crying brats and weeping adults and head up a wooden walkway leading to a platform where a guy matching the guards description was talking to a woman in an army helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dismissing her you walked over and introduced yourself. \"Hi, I'm looking for a girl you agreed to transport named Jenny. Any chance I could see her?\" you ask as the guy shakes your hand. \"That augmented chick with the cyber parts? I dunno, friend. Our company may deal in slavery, but we tend to keep our word. We promised to get her out of the city, going back on that deal wouldn't be good for business once folks found out about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and mention the Sapphire Dancer along with the reason why you were sent out here in the first place, causing the guy's expression to light up. \"Old DeWitt wants the girl for a debt, then? Alright, maybe we can work something out, but here's the rub. If we turn this girl over to you we need a guarantee she won't us any problems in the future for selling her out.\" he says as he checks his clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think anyone would hear from her again the way my boss was talking.\" you reply with a smirk. The guys grins and pulls a key out of his pocket. \"Sounds good, got the key right here... now we just need to settle on expenses. What are you offering for her?\" It takes a moment of bartering but you soon convince the guy to part with her in exchange for a cut of your pay. You both shake hands again and he hands you the key to her cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's being kept in the back, I'll send word not to load her container with the others. Unfortunately, our next shipment is scheduled for departure and leaves in the next half hour. You have until then to get miss Jenny out of here, otherwise my boss will come for her and load her up himself. Just because I can't be reasoned with doesn't mean he's willing to risk his business reputation. Remember: get her out in the next thirty minutes or just leave her. If you get caught I'll deny everything, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath, thank the slaver captain and head off to finally claim your prize. All your all-night ordeal it felt good to finally be so close to your target. After distracting a guard near the door to the back rooms you sneak in and carefully creep down a short hallway pass several small rooms. You turn around a corner and silently unlock the door you had been told about. As soon as the lock was free you closed the door behind you and relocked it in case a guard came by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there? Is it time for me to leave yet?\" came a soft whisper from a nearby shipping crate as a young woman pulled aside the lid and got out. \"Ah, there you are! Jenny, I presume?\" you exclaim as you turn to give her a friendly smile. \"I'm here on behalf of Morgan DeWitt, your old boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman standing before you had a glowing blue cybernetic eye, short hair, a thin scar near her forehead and was wearing a mechanic jumpsuit. Aside from that, everything matched the photo you had seen perfectly, this was definitely your girl. \"Oh no... what did you find me?\" Jenny asked as she took a step back. \"Relax, I'm not going to hurt you, I just need your stash.\" you reply in a comforting tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-My stash, you mean by cybernetics stash?\" Jenny asked as she backed up against the wall. \"Most of it's gone now, I sold it to afford this... please, just let me go. Tell you boss I'm dead.\" You frown as you put a hand on your revolver. \"I'm terribly sorry, but I was already promised a big payday for this job.\" you reply. Jenny glares at you as she bites her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright... how about this. I saved up a little money to help start a new life with, if you'll let me alone and tell your boss I'm dead I'll give it to you in addition to the location of my stash, deal?\" she offers with a hopeful look. \"You can still get your big reward for getting what my boss really wants and I get to walk away. The stash is what he cares about, not me. Just let me go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think it over as you lean up against the wall. The boss really did make it clear that the stash was all he wanted, you'd still get your money even if most of it was gone. However, he also made it clear that he wanted the girl, alive if possible, delivered to him as well if you wanted a big fat juicy bonus. Either way, your future would have a lost of cash in it. You looked Jenny in the face and gave her a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a deal, honey. Give me your savings and the location of your stash and I'll let you leave.\" you reply happily. Jenny breathes a sigh of relief and thanks you as she takes out a tiny leather pouch out of her pocket and tosses it to you. \"It sucks I'm broke now, but i can make due. Everything is in there, the money and the password to my stash, which I hid in a dumpster near my apartment. You got what you wanted, now please go. They'll be coming for me any minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You gain $300 and 10 Caps]</span></div></div>",

You still have a lot of ground to cover and you've already wasted over a week just getting the funds to move past Scrap City. As much as you'd like to take your time, it wasn't luxury you currently had. Life was harsh in the wasteland and it was first come first serve even in the more civilized parts. The last thing you needed was to find out that this whole big adventure was for nothing because you arrived a day or two late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou headed over to the Starlight Motel for one last night in Old Town and got up early the next day to find a way back to the Bluebrick. Your best bet was to head back to the tunnel that Lyle used to get you here in the first place. On your way back to the edge of the debris wall where you came in you come across a strange old woman in a fortuneteller outfit sitting at a small booth on the side of the street. She looked to be about 80 or 90 years old and was staring intently at a crystal ball despite appearing to be completely blind in both eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youuu young traveler...\" she suddenly speaks as you pass by. \"Yesss, you who have come a place of sin and vice... come to meee...\" A cool breeze blows by as she says the words and you feel yourself stopping in place right in front of her. Who was this old woman and why does she seem so... alien? \"I'm not that young.\" you reply as you turn to face her. \"But I'm not even half as old as you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman laughs as she pulls out a deck of Tarot cards and begins shuffling them. \"Will you one day be as old as I? Will you ever be rich? Marry? Have kids? Find true happiness? I know. I know all about youuuuu... your past... your present... your futureee...\" she wheezes through her raspy laughs as you start feeling uneasy. \"I can tell some. Not all. But for a priceee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to read my fortune?\" you ask as you lean over and put your hands on the booth. The woman grins as she finishes shuffling the cards and spreads them out on the table in front of the crystal ball. \"For a mere $30 I'll let you pick 3 cards and divine your future. What do you say? Do you want a bit of foresight... or do you want the future to remain a mysteryyy...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the dusty old cards and then to the grinning old woman. Can she really tell you about the future or was this some kind of trick?</span></div></div>",

Ha ha haaa... very well, young one. I bid you great fortune on your journey.\" she replies, never losing her smile or sounding disappointed in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Farewell, then.\" you answer back as you turn towards the sidewalk ahead and continue onward to the entrance to the sewer. You mostly remember the way back to the main city but got lost for a few hours along the way and sprang more than a few traps, most of which were fairly harmless while others were deadly enough to have almost claimed your life several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You lose 3 hit points. If your Traps skill is 3 or higher you lose 1 hit point instead.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter so much time down in the dark it took your eyes several minutes to adjust to the afternoon sunlight shining through the skeletal buildings surrounding you. This was definitely where you met Lyle though, and it fairly easy to make your way back to the Bluebrick Hotel with your newfound and hard earned wealth. You wave to Dalton on your way up to your room and begin getting everything ready for the next big leg of your journey.

In order to gather feedback I've decided to do a short \"open beta\" type of test and open this interactive for a brief time to readers. Because this interactive RPG is nowhere near finished expect dead ends to stories, outdated stats and effects and references to mechanics that haven't been implemented yet. This is purely for testing and feedback purposes. As such, please DO NOT rate, review or add chapters to this interactive. I have a set storyline in mind and will DELETE ADDITIONS ON SIGHT. I'm sorry in advance but that's just how this works. If you have any questions or comments please don't hesitate to send them. I'd like suggestions too but I can't make any promises. This period of \"open beta\" will last until April 1st 2020 after which Wasted will return to being private until chapter 1 is finished. Please take a moment to read what I've made so far, make a character and enjoy the story. Thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n!!!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world may have been destroyed, but that's no reason you can't party!

(Addiction Chances already at 1 are not affected.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen done your character sheet should look something like this:<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nName: Steve<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReputation: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkills<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScience: 4<br>\r\nNature: 2<br>\r\nSpeech: 7<br>\r\nGuns: 5<br>\r\nMelee: 3<br>\r\nStealth: 4<br>\r\nEndurence: 8<br>\r\nSex: 9<br>\r\nImmunity: 4<br>\r\nTraps: 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky<br>\r\nSex Appeal<br>\r\nDoctor<br>\r\nMaster Chef<br>\r\nDrug Crafter<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow To Play<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis interactive is already completed and is meant to be played like a game. Once you have your character sheet done take another piece of paper and make a stats sheet and write down the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHit Points: Your health, when its all gone you die and have to restart the chapter from the beginning. You start with 5 hit points that can only be restored by certain events in the story itself. When you die and begin a volume again you restart at 3 points instead of the starting 5. So if you make it to chapter 4 at 1 hit point and die you restart chapter 4 with 3 hit points. There are ways to increase your maximum hit points in the story, but dying starts you off with only 3 even if you have a maximum of ten available, so keep an eye out for chances to recover your hit points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoney: Below your hit points write Cash, Caps and Glowing Ore. You start out penniless and broke, but as you move along you'll gain some money that you can spend. Cash is common, caps are uncommon and Glowing Ore is rare. Make sure you keep track of what you have at all times since money changes often. (Money also carries over from chapter to chapter so be careful how much you spend. If you blow all your money early on you might not have what you need to buy stuff in later chapters...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItems: This one is simple and easy. Just use the rest of the page to write down any items you receive while reading. Many items are similar so make sure you also spell them correctly. It would suck if you have to restart due to accidentally mistaking one item for another. One last note, you only need to keep track of items the story specifically tells you to. Important story items will be kept track of by the interactive itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen done your stats page should look like this:<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nCharacter name<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHit Points: 5<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoney<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCash: $0<br>\r\nCaps: 0c<br>\r\nGlowing Ore: 0 GO<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItems<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you have everything that you need and all that is left to explain how to move through story. Each page of the story will be read like a normal interactive with two important additions to take notice of, the environment and instructions. The environment mostly only affects certain perks and is just for aesthetic affect otherwise. The instructions will be written [like this] and tell you what you need to do during each page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to \"normal choices\" that anyone can select are special choices that you need certain skills or perks to use. For example if a choice says [Speech 4] you need a Speech skill of 4 to choose it. If a choice says [Master Chef] you'll need that perk to use it. Many choices also have additional requirements such as [$50] which means you need to pay $50 cash for that option. [5c] means you need 5 Caps and [1 GO] means you need 1 Glowing Ore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are also Reputation choices, which require a certain level of Reputation to select. Choices like [Rep 6+] require a positive Reputation of 6 or higher to select while choices like [Rep -3] require a negative Reputation of -3 or more. Your good (or bad) name can bring with it a lot of perks... or drawbacks so make your decisions carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the are special \"double choices\" that are easier to pass than normal choices. All the player needs to do to accept the choice is EITHER requirement listed. So if you encounter a choice that says [Sex Appeal / $50] you just need the Sex Appeal perk or $50 to pick that option. Simple enough? Good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShopping<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat good is money if you can't spend it? At several points during the story the reader may buy items if they have the money. No two shopkeepers are alike so its important to carefully see what they have to sell. When a shop is available to purchase from it will be marked like this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan Of Beer (2) $10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlowing Ore $100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cost of an item will be displayed after its name as seen above. If an item has a number after its name (as seen above) it is to show how many of those items the shop has left to sell. Once the items are gone the shop is sold out and if an item doesn't have a number next to its name its the last one so you should consider buying it if you really need it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now ready to begin the game.
