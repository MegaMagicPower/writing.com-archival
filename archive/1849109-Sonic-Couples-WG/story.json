Sally said one arm around Sonic and the other holding a dusty old lamp. Sonic was holding Sally as he whizzed through the forest, back to knothole village. They had found the lamp abandoned in a lifeless part of the forest, under some tangled bushes. <br>\r\n'Aw come on, Sal, let me have my fun.' The blue hedgehog said, as they zoomed into the village. He halted in front of their hut. Recently the two had gotten married, and shared the same place. <br>\r\nHowever, even though now Knothole was peaceful and no longer under the threat of Robotnik, they were still going through difficult times. The village, along with several others, was suffering a severe drought, and as a result, it was almost impossible to farm, and there was barely any food to eat.<br>\r\n'Well, I'll admit it does need a bit of polishing.' The squirrel/chipmunk hybrid held the golden lamp up to the sun to examine it. Sonic stepped back a little to admire his wife's beauty. She wasn't the curviest or bustiest Mobian alive, but he still couldn't get enough of her body. And though her beauty wasn't what you would call traditional, he still found her absolutely gorgeous. 'Hey, Sal, have I ever told you, you look hot?' Sonic asked, putting an arm around her.<br>\r\n'Only a thousand times.' Sally replied, lowering the lamp and smiling back at him. The two embraced and began passionately kissing each other. Sonic managed to hold Sally up and, while kissing her, stumbled through the door of their hut and onto their bed. Sally was just pulling her vest off when the couple was startled by a knock on the door. <br>\r\n'Um, sorry to uh, interrupt your uh, fun, but there's something you guys need to see.' The villager looked serious, but his cheeks were flushing due to the embarrassing situation he just walked in on.<br>\r\n'Oh, no, this is...This...oh, no...' Sally was speechless. In front of her, a huge garden, which was once Knothole's only food source, was absolutely marauded. What plants were ready to be harvested were gone, and what was not yet fully-grown was uprooted and torn apart. Several villagers were searching around for what little was left, but there was close to nothing. <br>\r\n'Wh-Who...how...?' Rotor, who was standing next to her, sighed, rubbing his head. 'It was probably some of Robotnik's old robots...' Sally was devastated. Almost ten years after defeating him, he was still causing them so much grief. How on earth could her village survive though this? 'H-How much food is left in storage?' She asked quietly, almost not wanting to hear the answer. <br>\r\n'Well, we've got about a couple weeks' worth of food left for the entire village.' The walrus replied. 'But with this weather, it'll take much more than that to grow back enough to keep up.'<br>\r\n'Looks like we'll have to get everything out of the forest from here on out.' Sonic said, after being surprisingly quiet for so long. 'But that won't be a problem, I can find more than enough for everyone to eat faster than you can say-' <br>\r\n'Everything in the forest is poisonous, Sonic.' Sally sighed, walking back towards the hut. 'I need some time to myself to think about what to do.'<br>\r\nAs soon as she was in her hut and had shut the door behind her, Sally burst into tears. What do I do now? She thought. How am I going to keep everyone from starving to death, I've already rationed food enough as it is, I can't have everyone eat even less....Oh, this is my fault somehow, I know it! She wiped off her eye. She glanced over at her nightstand and saw the lamp she'd left there. <br>\r\n'Oh, I could really use a genie right about now...' She mumbled, picking up the lamp. In spite of herself, she began rubbing off some of the dust. Then, to her surprise, it started glowing. 'Oh my gosh-' Sally stumbled backwards, still holding the lamp. She ran outside and saw Sonic talking to a group of villagers.<br>\r\n'Sonic, Sonic! Look at this!' She showed him the glowing lamp. He blinked and took it from her. 'No way....did you-' 'Yes!' Now the villagers saw the lamp and gasped. 'Could that be...?'  'Is it really?' 'It's not possible!'<br>\r\nSilently, Sonic rubbed the lamp some more, and it began glowing brighter. Excitedly, he began rubbing it against his arm, when it have a blinding flash of light and shot in the air. It burst into a colorful cloud in the air, and then, a large Lion's head, sporting a turban, emerged from this cloud. All the Mobians could only stare and catch flies in their mouth.<br>\r\n'I am the Genie of the Lamp.' The lion's head declared loudly. Now much of Knothole village, attracted by the loud noise, came running to see what was going on. 'For setting me free, you shall be granted one wish, but choose carefully...' The lion's head lowered a little and narrowed its eyes. 'For whatever you wish will require a great personal sacrifice on your part.'<br>\r\nThe two leaders we stunned. 'What do we wish for?' 'I know.' Sally stood up a bit straight. 'I wish for all this famine to end, I want Knothole restored to the glory it once was, maybe even something better!' She lowered her head. 'Please, I'm willing to give anything...' 'Your wish is granted, but at a price.' the genie replied. 'That price is your beauty.'  'M-My what?' Sally blinked, not sure she heard him correctly. <br>\r\n'The state of a leader reflects the state of their subjects. A ruler with a great girth gives the impression that their subjects also enjoy a healthy, profitable lifestyle. So, to improve your village's condition, you must gain as much weight as possible.' Sally began to speak, but was interrupted by the genie. 'The only way to save you village, is to sacrifice your beauty and gain as much weight as possible. Be the fattest woman you can be.' And with that, the genie disappeared into another bright cloud and floated away.<br>\r\nChapter Two<br>\r\n'Come on, Sally, you said you'd give anything...' 'Sonic, I can't make a pig of myself while everyone starves.' The two were in their hut again; Sally was sitting up on her bed, Sonic standing next to her. <br>\r\n'Look, the villagers were more than happy to share a bunch of their food, the least you can do is eat what you were given.' He held up his arm towards the other side of the hut. The villagers had given Sally plenty of food alright. Enough to fill up half of the place, barely leaving room to walk. Mainly anything that wasn't fruits and vegetables, in hopes of Sally gaining as much weight as possible. <br>\r\n'Sonic, there has to be more than enough to feed the village for two days! I can't eat all of this-' 'Not in one sitting.' 'You're jabbering me to live on this stuff?!' 'Well, how else are you supposed to get big enough to save the village?' Sally began to argue back, but then sighed. After a minute of silence, she walked to the table. <br>\r\n'Well, anything for the village, I guess...' She looked around. 'What on earth do I eat...?' 'Here' Sonic held up a large plate of biscuits. 'It'll be easy to work your way through these.' <br>\r\nSally sighed and sat herself down. Sonic placed the plate in front of her. She began to reach for one when Sonic stopped her. 'Wait, you know what these need?' 'Sonic, what are you-' Sonic became a blue blur, speeding through the food and biscuits. When he stopped, the biscuits all had butter on them, which was now melted from moving so fast. Sally glared at him. <br>\r\n'You're not helping.' she muttered, glaring at her husband. 'Hey, butter is nothing but fat, just trying to help.' Sonic said with a grin. Sally sighed again and took a biscuit. 'Well...down the hatch.' <br>\r\nBeing hesitant to start becoming fat after being slender her whole life, Sally went through the biscuits slowly. She took as small bites as possible and chewed them for ridiculous amounts of time before finally swallowing them. They were rather large, so it only took about five of them for her to feel full. <br>\r\n'Alright, I'm finished.' Sally began getting up, but Sonic put his hands on her shoulders to force her down. 'No, eat.' He said, getting slightly impatient. 'Knothole's counting on it.'<br>\r\n'But...but...' Sally sighed and bit into another biscuit. Now they didn't taste as good, and soon her stomach began to hurt. She wanted to stop, but she kept herself going with mental images of Knothole as it used to be. Ten biscuits down, she had to pause in order not to puke all over the table. But she still forced each one down, one after the other. After a little over twenty, she sat back in her chair and groaned. Her stomach, which was flat and even had a bit of muscle to it, was now round and beginning to stick out.<br>\r\n'I feel like I'm going to burst!' moaned Sally, putting a hand on her aching belly. In front of her, only one more biscuit remained. Sonic picked it up and held it in front of her.<br>\r\n'Come on, Sal, you've only got one more to go...' Sonic said teasingly, waving the biscuit in front of her. She looked as if she was about to vomit.<br>\r\n'Oh, I feel awful...I'm going to bed.' she mumbled, struggling out of her chair. Sonic was about to start teasing her with the biscuit again, but decided against it and dug into it himself. She glanced over at Sally, who was already passed out in bed. Sonic observed her again. She was lying on her back, with her stomach hanging out on top. Before he went to bed, he put a heating pad on it, to help her feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(my addition) Sonic then began to ponder about what he should cook for her in the morning for her breakfast given the situation the meal's portions would have to be both gut-busting massive, and as fattening as Lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Here is were you come in this story has gone with out a follow up for more than 6 years. Please make it a good and lengthy one it disserves as much.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy Rose was an oridinary pink hedgehog, she also happened to be the biggest fan of the mightiest hero on the planet of Mobius, Sonic the hedgehog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf corse she was not literally his Biggest fan, but as the oxymoron suggests she was the most obsessed one. She had constant daydreams and the kind you get sleeping at night. About her and Sonic getting married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was obviously her life long dream, yet whenever she tried to have Sonic, even do so little as go out on a date with her, he would not only refuse but run away. (If it was not because she was stalking him then it was another adventure to stop eggman.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently Amy was just finishing up her standard low carb lunch that she would eat to keep her weight down on the 2nd story outdoor section of her favorite caf\u00e9, all she had to do now was wait for the waitress to give her the bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw Sonic standing around in the side alley beneath her, Amy was happy to find the advantage she had this time of the fact that he had his back to her and was unaware of her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she was about to do as she typically does she would've yelled out his name and made a break for it to hug him... when all of a sudden she was taken back by something...(and this time it wasn't an unexpected abduction by Eggman) Sonic was then approached by Shadow who for some reason was wearing a jacket and sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy assumed they were about to fight again, and so she crossed her eyes and just as she was reaching for the tiny cylindrical device she kept attached to the back of her belt that would expand into her signature hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just about to stand up out her chair, thinking that if she could save Sonic, he would finally respect her enough to ask her out, but then something completely different then what she had expected happened... Shadow opened his jacket and pulled out some kind of girly magazine, Sonic handed over a small bundle of cash and the 2 exchanged the items. They then proceeded to leave the alley by walking away slowly into the opposite ends of it. Shadow went to the end that would approach the street entrance to the caf\u00e9, Sonic went further away from Any without even looking back unaware that she saw the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy while being taken back by the whole thing, the waitress who was a Purple hedgehog with long brown hair, then came and gave Amy the bill. Amy had to be told that the bill had arrived by the waitress 3 times before she snapped out of it and paid the appropriate cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then proceeded to leave being very shocked at Sonic's behavior, was immediately replaced by anger when Shadow passed her by, without even saying hi, Amy Naturally Proceeded to grab him and pin him against the side alley wall of the caf\u00e9, \"What the hell was that Shadow? Who the hell does Sonic think he is buying such a thing from you when he has a girl like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow was unfazed and told her in a very uncaring tone, \"He bought it because your the wrong kind of girl.\" This made Amy even angrier and she was about to give him a taste of her hammer, when Shadow suddenly pulled out from his still open jacket a spare copy of the magazine and shoved it into Amy's Face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's wrath was stayed again because this time she couldn't believe what she was seeing. \"This is the kind of girl he wants.\" Shadow told her in the same tone. \"You won't find this anywhere but the internet. It's custom published by me under a fake name and it makes me enough to get by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was staring at something she never thought would ever be made, a magazine devoted to fat women in various Linguine and swimsuits, as well ads on WG supplements/powders, hunger stimulants and very fattening cooking recipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy found the idea that Sonic could be into fat women incomprehensible. Yet she could not look away, and released shadow from her grip and held it in both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow then proceeded to walk away, as he then told her, \"You can have it for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then got mad at him and asked \"Why would I even want such a thing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow then stopped and turned back enough to look at her from the side, and asked, \"You do want to be his girlfriend don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Amy blush and she then stared back at the cover of the magazine, as shadow proceeded to walk away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then made up her mind at what she easily considered to be the craziest idea she ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would get as fat as she can as fast as she possibly can just to try and win over Sonic's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then put the magazine in her shopping bag she had been carrying around all day... and proceed to walk home... </span></div></div>",

Besides takeout is faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter performing some calculations regarding the caloric intake of certain foods and their prices, she realized that the amount of food she would have to order to become an SSBBW would bankrupt her if she took it too fast. Amy Cursed her skinny wallet, \"UGH! Why does the one thing about themselves that everyone wants to be fat, have to be my biggest roadblock on getting fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then saw this little tidbit of advice from an article of the magazine. \"Ladies, if you are going start a journey of weight gain the first thing you need to do is weigh yourself right now to get a starting point and be sure to make a chart to document your expansion. It is essential for those who wish to improve themselves by literally expanding their horizons.\" This made Amy regret all the times she ate food that she thought tasted terrible just to keep her weight down it stung her even worse that she now knew that she did it all for nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy deiced to comply and so she walked into her bathroom stripped down to her underwear and stepped on her scale it was a digital model and took a few seconds to get results Amy tried to stay as still as she could as she thought of a day where her belly would be to big for  her to see past it and read the numbers even if she was sucking her gut in, as Sonic was feeding her making her endlessly get fatter and fatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale gave a beeping sound to snap It read, \"95 pounds\" Amy's height was 4' 6\" (4 feet 6 inches) giving her a Body mass index of 18 (the same as her age) according to the chart from the magazine. Amy was upset she then set a goal weight for herself at 210 pounds (the highest available weight on that particular chart) she decided it would be when she had a BMI of 25 (4' 6\" 210 pounds) that she would make a romantic advance on Sonic he wouldn't be able to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she didn't have to worry about competition she figured that Sonic would be to scared of ridicule should he reveal his fetish and fat girls were in short supply as every single woman in the city of Knothole was obsessed with staying skinny. \"I wonder if Sonic marrying me the fattest girl on Mobius would change that...\" Amy thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she decided to worry about that later and focus on her own belly. She then put her clothes back on and went to the kitchen grabbed the yellow phone book and examined her magazine for the cheapest restaurants that made deliveries she could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough she was able to narrow it down to 3 choices.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a cold rainy night, and Shadow was resting, under a tree just big enough to keep him dry. He laid there in complete silence. That is until the thunder storm started.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe was jolted awake by the sound of a BOOM hitting the tree above him, as he looked up to check if the tree was on fire, Shadow saw a branch that was hit by the volt, come falling down. Shadow tried to get up as fast as he could, but the branch knocked him unconscious.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen Shadow awoke he was in a nice bedroom, an unfamiliar one, but a bedroom nonetheless. He tried to get up from the bed but found that to be impossible as he had a great sensation of pain coming from his legs. \"Urgh!!\" shadow muttered as he tried to inspect the damage only to find both of his legs broken and encased in their own separate casts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made him panic a bit as he searched the room to see why he was here and not a hospital. Then he saw a framed picture standing on a dresser beside the door, it was a picture of himself. one that looked as if it had been taken last month in one of Eggman's bases. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oddest thing about it was that it's frame was a pink heart. \"I guess this room doesn't belong to Eggman then.\" he thought to himself. This calmed him down a bit.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJust then the door opened, and in came Rouge the Bat, she slowly walked up to Shadow's bed and said, \"Oh good your awake! Anything I can get you, you took a pretty big hit\". Shadow responded, \"I am kinda hungry\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge then left but quickly returned with... \"I had it made just for you.\" Rouge walked into the room, carrying a platter, with a huge pepperoni pizza on it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Thank you Rouge.\" Shadow said as he took a slice. He bit into it. \"This is really good pizza Rouge! There's a flavor in here I can't make out though.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh, that's a secret ingredient.\" Rouge winked. (The secret is weight gain powder but Shadow doesn't know that yet) Then Shadow felt felt his legs, as the pain killers Rouge gave him started to wear off. He cringed at the feel of it. \"Oh, sorry.\"  Rouge then gave him some more pain killers pills with a glass of milk. \"Just eat. It'll take your mind off your injury.\" Shadow didn't want to do as she recommended. Dismissed this after he felt a sensation of overwhelming hunger as if he hadn't eaten in a week. This made him eat a few pieces after which he could feel the pain killers begin to work, and he started to feel fairly good, if a bit tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, he had finished the pizza, but something was odd. He didn't feel full. Instead, he still felt a bit... hungry. \"I just ate an entire pizza. Why aren't I full?\" The black hedgehog was wondering this, when he noticed that rouge was next to the bed. She was had one of her hands on her chin, she was also smiling with her mouth closed and her eyes half open. Shadow then realized that he must have been so into the pizza that he hadn't noticed that she was still here.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Enjoy your meal Shadow?\" She walked over, and with a smile on her face. She put her hand on Shadow's belly and began rubbing it, drawing his attention to something that horrified him. There was a noticeable gut on him. Before eating that pizza, he was normal except for his legs and yet it looks like he gained twenty pounds in the past meal! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise Rouge closed her eyes puckered her lips and gave his fat belly a kiss. This made it grumble and Shadow blush. \"Don't worry big guy, I'm having another one made for you right now.\"  As Rouge gave this reassurance her tail was wagging as if it belonged to a happy dog and not a bat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also walking out of the room while swaying her hips side to side. This made shadow realize that Rouge was in love with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rouge I *URRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP*\" He didn't even feel the belch coming! It just came out.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Nice one Shadow.\" Rouge laughed. This made him blush bright red. Because he only wanted to ask why she was fattening him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge soon returned with another Pizza only it was much bigger than the first one. \"Eat up Shadow.\" Said Rouge seductively. \"When you are finished, tell me cause I have a lot more food if you would like to eat and I don't want it to go to waste.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow decided to not to disappoint her, and he continued to eat the pizza, he then finished it and he called for Rouge. \"Can you...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge then gave Shadow some chicken and mashed potatoes, she didn't even let him finish his sentence. Shadow continued to eat, he could literally feel his belly getting bigger, and when he was finished eating it, and Shadow felt as if he now weighed much more, and began to feel very drowsy. Rouge simply patted his belly and asked him if he enjoyed his food. And as he fell asleep. He could almost feel the soothing sensation of Rouge kissing him on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Shadow woke up he found...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rouge's streak at pulling off amazing jewel heists, had lately began to falter. She had just returned to her apartment (with a elaborately decorated interior made from stolen jewels.) after a frankly disastrous heist. Not only did she fail to secure her prize, she almost got caught by the police. Despite the fact that she was carrying nothing other than her usual gear, flying back to her hideout felt oddly more labor intensive than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rouge did not have time to think about this, for as soon as she entered through the moonlight window that she left open before setting off on the heist, she immediately walked over to the living room couch next to the kitchen, and passed out asleep on to it from nothing more than sheer exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Rouge was still quite groggy, as she could only think of, \"making herself beautiful/ready\" for the day. She took off her heist gear, the black rubber jumpsuit with white boots and put aside the glass cutting tools, she then put on a pink bathrobe and promptly began to eat her breakfast. 2 slices of Buttered Toast, 2 Waffles, 4 slices of Bacon, and a glass of apple juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing, she went into the bathroom to brush her teeth and weigh herself as she normally did... but something about the number that the scale sent back to her seemed... wrong... It read that her weight was 10 pounds heavier than what she was familiar with. (110 pounds=normal, now it reads her weight as 120.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be right! It must be broken... I'll...\" before Rouge could finish her train of thought as to possible explanations, she heard her cell phone ring. Caller I.D. displayed that it was Shadow, Rouge having romantic feelings for him, picks up the phone, despite the fact that she could count the number of times Shadow called her on 1 hand, she was too tired to attempt to flirt with him, especially not over the phone, and because of this she told him, \"Shadow... now is not a good time for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately she was interrupted by an outburst of words from Shadow that immediately terrified her. \"ROUGE!! YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF THERE RIGHT NOW!! THE POLICE KNOW WHERE YOU ARE!! THEY'LL BE THERE IN ABOUT 2 MINUTES!!\" Rouge immediately realized that she will have to worry about her possible weight problem later as this obviously took a bigger priority. \"HOW?!...\" She Thought... then she suddenly remembered a detail that she had not noticed at the time from exhaustion and panic after tripping the alarm at the museum, she heard that she dropped something. At the time she dismissed it to be a metal file but when she reexamined the tools she took off only minutes ago she realized the keys to the front door of her apartment were not there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith horror Rouge knew that mistake allowed the police to track her down. \"I...\" She stammered too horrified to move, Shadow must have heard/sensed her panic over the phone so he told her, \"GRAB WHAT YOU CAN!! I'M GONNA USE CHAOS CONTROL!!\" Rouge with as much haste as possible, grabbed the items that could be used for DNA testing if they were found by the police, her tooth brush, the jumpsuit, the dirty dishes, and the clothes on her back. Shadow then teleported into her living room holding the green Chaos Emerald, and after briefly blushing after seeing what she was wearing (despite all his attempts to conceal it.) He Grabbed Rouge with his free hand, arm wrapped around her Rouge couldn't help but blush at this as they teleported to Shadow's Hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the old Egg Carrier 1 from Sonic Adventure 1, the 2 of them were on the outer deck behind the structure that housed the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they were safe they stared at each other for a second both blushing before stepping and looking away from each other in the usual awkward fashion that this type of event plays out. The awkward feeling quickly disappeared as Rouge noticed the horrible stench of low tide and soon realized that the place was filthy with seaweed, barnacles and even a few seagull's nests in the platforms above them. \"Sorry I suppose the mess is to be expected. This place has spent the last 5 years drifting on the ocean.\" Shadow remarked and pointed out the mass of robots working to clean it. All of them and the ship simply abandoned by Eggman for failing him, \"They've managed to clean up most of the filth since I reactivated this place 6 months ago, but it's still disgusting... at least on the outside... The interiors in the stern of the ship are all nice and clean.\" Rouge struggled whether to find this situation to be repugnant or inviting as she could've considered this to be her first date with Shadow, unfortunately, the current atmosphere was the worst possible place for it, but she still expressed gratitude that it was better than going to jail (though not by much she secretly thought.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge then noticed a strong wind, it was a draft of cold air that made her silently question the location of the ship, \"Oh right... you see... right now we're 10,000 feet above the surface of the ocean.\" Fearing that the next wind could blow off her bathrobe and reveal the purple lingerie underneath it, Rouge immediately handed the dishes and jumpsuit to Shadow and proceeded to run to the nearest door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swimming pool area was what she found herself in, unfortunately she could not relax in it, for she had not brought a bathing suit with her, and the pool itself was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow then came inside, \"I gave your gear to a maintenance robot to be put in storage.\"  He then noticed that she was eying the swimming pool,  \"You should be glad it's no longer full of lobsters and plankton stinking up the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge turned around and asked him, \"Shadow why would anyone turn this old piece of junk into their hideout?\" Rouge had never been to the egg carrier before, but she had heard the story of it's downfall, and seen pictures of it in it's prime. When she was working with Eggman, and as luck would have it, met Shadow. \"After we and the others defeated Emerl, and the Metal Overlord before that. I came to realize that the various hideouts we used over time were only running mate solutions at evading trouble. So, when I learned of this thing, I went to find it thinking the fact that it is both mobile and forgotten by Eggman would make it an ideal base of operations. Unlike the other hideouts that were only good for their namesake. This one can do just about anything for people like us, and even if it is a bit of an attention grabber, we can hide it just about anywhere where there are no cities or people, the clouds, bottom of the ocean, perhaps even outer space if we're lucky and I can fix and upgrade it well enough to do all that.\" Rouge couldn't help but marvel at the brilliance of this choice. Alas the 5 years adrift and neglected have not been kind to it, still she did realize it was easier to fix and cleanup an old place than build a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The past 6 months have been nothing but a restoration job for me, The robots help and I do what I can to gather materials they can't make themselves. But still, the vast emptiness of this place can make a guy feel rather...\" Shadow was obviously struggling to find the right word, as he was always better at expressing his ideas than his emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lonely?\" Rouge suddenly slipped that word out of her lips, that made the 2 of them blush. And the empty swimming pool smelling of chlorine didn't help steer the conversation to something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of empty, Rouge then heard her stomach growling. Shadow noticed this. \"I... guess you haven't had breakfast yet. Perhaps those dishes were from last night?\" Rouge felt too embarrassed to tell him that they were not. It was 10:30am so she merely wrote off her hunger to a form of jet-lag associated with teleporting to the other side of the continent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge then began to struggle to decide what to do next, her belly told her it needed a bite to eat, but her brain told her she needed a change of clothes, and her still aching feet told her to find where her a new bedroom to rest in before anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then faced Shadow the both of them still blushing and told him in a tone expressing embarrassment, \"I... I think I'll go find...\"</span></div></div>",

Over to Silver as used his telekinesis to 'hand' her an entire roasted turkey. <i>(Author's note: I felt like adding that in because thanksgiving is coming up so shut up.) </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to help you relax after all we have been through.\" Silver reassured her, the expression on his face conveyed a notion of sincerity. He then proceeded to take off the dark blue apron he wore, and carrying a small dish of corn on the cob with mashed potatoes and gravy for himself. He did all this hands free due to his telekinetic powers. Blaze was eying the turkey and had both hands on her belly. Now quite taunt with a meal worthy of a fest of 2 people. Yet Blaze's fire powers sped up the early stages of digestion so that this was not noticeable to her. For it was sticking out but not far enough to be labeled a, \"potbelly.\" Her expression bore that of a minor degree of concern equally balanced with that of gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was indeed grateful at Silver's affection, for the ordeals of the latest adventure <i>(not the events of Sonic 06 due to time travel that neither would remember and because that game is way to terrible to be cannon here)</i> was a particularly exhausting one. At it's conclusion they began dating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... all this for me?\" Blaze asked reluctantly already feeling moderately stuffed. \"Yes... but... you don't have to eat it all just... eat as much as you can.\" Silver stated vaguely in an attempt to keep her suspicions low. Prior to the above mentioned fish sandwich Blaze had also eaten an 8 ounce beef steak and drank a wide glass of whole milk. Another was standing next to her incase she needed it for the turkey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All... alright if you insist.\" Blaze then tore of a drum stick and began to consume the meat Silver was lucky as she ate with her eyes closed and her free hand on her taunt belly. Lucky for he was blushing very much so. This desire of Silver's began 1 week prior on the day after their ordeal ended. They woke up at about noon, and they had a breakfast that was actually lunch at a seafood place that Blaze was picked herself. Silver ordered a small fried clam strip platter where Blaze more hungry than usual ordered a large plate of fish and chips. Silver couldn't help but blush and silently marvel at how hot Blaze looked as she ate the massive dish with a haste that somewhat disregarded the concept of table manners. It was lucky for Blaze that the food was ordered to go, so as no one but Silver saw her outburst of gluttony. And lucky for Silver that she was simply too tired to notice his revelry. He had been fostering that hunger ever since hoping to see it again but so far without success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH!!! SO GOOD!!\" Blaze moaned as she proceeded to eat the turkey one handful of meat at a time. Silver had long finished his own meal and was too preoccupied with the display before him to make anything else. There was an occasional belching from Blaze as she struggled to eat more, and more, and even more. To Silver's amazement, Blaze was able to finish the turkey. Bones picked clean of any and all meat, she proceed to tell him, \"Silver... you really outdid yourself this time!*\" Blaze told him this with her eyes still closed. She was holding her belly with both hands it was now distended enough to look like she was 4 months pregnant. Blaze then let out a very big and loud bleach as she was too deep in a food coma to notice that she just gained 5 pounds from one meal. She then asked, \"Can I have some more milk Silver? I'm so thirsty...\" Silver had apparently put too much spices on  the meat. Blushing so red his face looked like he had severe sunburn. He picked up the glass with his real hand and used the other to hold up her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blaze drank it she effectively gained a 6th pound. When the glass was empty she then licked her own muzzle clean of the remnants and fell into a food coma induced sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver wanted to kiss her so bad but ultimately decided against it for fear that it would wake her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal Blaze just had was effectively supper, and it was that time of year when the sun would set at 4:30pm it was now 6:30pm as Silver began to think about what she would be fed for breakfast tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

She puffed a bit as her plump little hands pressed firmly against her bulging love handles. She never understood why Scourge wanted her to gain all this weight. She looked fantastic before. She could match toe to toe against Sally Acorn and the other Freedom Fighters but now? Look at her. She's gigantic! She moves her tubby fingers and let's them sink into her plump large belly. Her fingers can feel how soft her midsection has become with the constant eat outs and binges she had to endure for Scourge's plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally sure, baby. In fact you look great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cocky green hedgehog shows a toothy grin to his plump girlfriend. He can see how her additional weight has accumulated around her thighs, hips and calves. He can see how much her black pants stretch tightly against her portly legs. They looked like tightly packed hams packed in a skin tight wrap. He can see how her huge ass curves outward revealing a slightly fatter tail. He moves a gloved hand and squeezes her large love handle with two fingers and just feels it sink into her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona readjusts her black tank-top as she felt it ride up against her fat breasts. She wasn't that comfortable in her normal clothing. They were so tiny compared to now. She looks down at her tout fingers and wiggles them as they stretch tightly on her black gloves. She sighs a bit but smiles as she does notice Scourge checking her body out. She's gotta admit that ever since she's gained this additional weight Scourge has become a little more frisky with her. He would occasionally squeeze her fat ass and thick love handles. He would occasionally jiggle her tubby belly causing it to quiver with every jolt he caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welll...fine. Once this is over though I'm going on a strict diet to get back my amazing figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona moved her chunky arms behind her head and gave him a wink. She forms a smile as her double chin jiggles a bit with her facial movements. Scourge could only wink back at his fatty girlfriend and couldn't help to find her face to be more adorable with the extra chub around it. Particularly he likes how her cheeks plumped up like little balloons. He does remember a few times where he's left her some kisses and how soft and warm they felt against his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure baby-cakes? I think you could do fine like that for a while longer. I mean there's no rush. We still got a few days to go before we do this mission. Besides...I think the Destructix are enjoying themselves as well. You've been a little more jolly as of late too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jolly? You mean like in the spirit of Christmas jolly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves her stocky arms and grabs onto her huge belly lifting it up under her plump hands. She lets go and lets her belly bounce in front of her. She looks down to see her red furred belly tremor against her thighs as it slowly comes to a stop. She moves her hands down and feels her tightly packed legs as her pants groan to maintain themselves on her. She blushes a bit as she stands back up straight so she doesn't burst out of her stretched tight black pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...dear...um...Scourge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pouts while looking at him as her cheeks emphasize her expression. Her porky thick hands starts rubbing her voluminous red furred belly. Her stomach gurgles loudly as if it had been awaken rudely from its slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get something to eat? I'm getting rather hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona could only look at him as her sausage thick fingers softly rubs around the center of her belly letting them sink into her tubby belly to show off how soft she's become. She's gotta admit though that being able to eat more and eat anything she wants has been rather pleasurable. Sure her figure took a hit but this is for Scourge and maybe a bit for herself. She doesn't have to worry about exercising for right now and doesn't have to maintain her body like she normally does. She smirks to herself as she starts to get excited at the idea of gaining a little more weight in order to highlight her more voluptuous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want me to starve Scourgey-boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all sweet-cheeks. I'll get right on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the speedy green hedgehog speeds off he lifts up his red shades and kisses his fat girlfriend. His fingers move feeling her chunky ass in his hands and squeezes them firmly. Fiona only blushes and returns the kiss with a passion. There was just something about that hedgehog that just gets her in the right spot. Scourge holds onto the kiss as his hands work their way around and softly squeezes on the base of her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you can be so hot sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScourge only smirks and speeds off as Fiona stands there with her hands on her hips but with a deep red blush on her creamy yellow muzzle and face. She turns and waddles as her body jiggles to her movement.<br>\r\n_____________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Here is where the original text ends, and it is now up to you to decide where it goes from here.</i></span></div></div>",

Burgers, cakes, ice cream, all the foods she had denied herself in her foolish desire to stay thin for Jet, but now she can eat whatever she wanted and not regret it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached for the phone again...</span></div></div>",

For the last week, there had been nothing for Wave to do. She, Jet and Storm haven\u2019t been out on any jobs for a while, so there was no need for her to do maintenance work on the airboards, and Storm was away at some convention for a month, leaving just Jet living there as well and he was always too busy of late to bother with her; and so, unable to think of something to do, Wave, had simply sat on the team's couch, eating chips and cookies while watching T.V for a week now.<br>\r\nWhile a week of lazing about and eating junk food had been all Wave had done, it had only resulted in a gain ten pounds with it barely making any noticeable changes to her figure. Wave herself haven\u2019t even noticed it, yet alone anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment, Jet came into the room. he spotted Wave, sitting in the same spot as he saw her earlier in the day and the previous others.<br>\r\n\u201cStill glued to the TV I see\u201d Jet said, his words finally getting Wave\u2019s attention that he was in the room. Wave looked at him. Clearly he was on his way out again, but she couldn\u2019t care less about where he was going knowing that the green hawk was clearly about to complain about her activity.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so what if I am?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wave, you can't just sit there!\" Jet said, \u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing but watch TV all week. Instead of just sitting there and eating up our snack supply, why don\u2019t you actually get up off you butt and do something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave stopped, a chip inches away from her crumb covered beak and gave Jet a steely stare, \"Oh yeah? Well you don\u2019t see me complain about wherever it is you go to. So shut up and leave me alone!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright fine then,\u201d Jet said, knowing it was best not to push Wave\u2019s temper when she this mad and quickly left, leaving Wave alone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whenever she and Jet talk, he would complain about how she's been doing nothing and eating junkfood and soon they would be arguing and soon after Jet would leave, either in a foul mood or in one case a black eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave just couldn't understand why Jet was making such a big deal out of this.
