A long couple of months' Summer Vacation, then your new life at college will begin! Muttering a non-committal response to your cute, blonde friend, you head after her as she tugged at your sleeve, joining her at the main queue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Carnival has come to town. Again! For as long as you can remember, this has been a summer tradition. When you were a kid, alongside Casey for pretty much each of your visits, it had seemed novel and exciting. Not anymore! \"Really Casey? Aren't you a bit old for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you love it really!\" She giggles at you, wrinkling her nose in such an adorable way that it makes you wonder why the two of you haven't hooked up already. \"Some of the other guys will be there. <i>Jessica</i> will be there too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mention of the super-hot Jessica makes your stomach clench a little, as it usually does. \"Ha, yeah, whatever,\" you reply nonchalantly, though the smirk on your blonde friend's face is more than a little infuriating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough when you go through the main entrance, you see several of the other guys from school; technically, your former school, now that you've graduated! Greeting and fist bumping several of the other guys from your basketball team, you try to be cool around Jessica, who gives you a brief hello. There's still time to get with her...imagine what a conquest that would be...laying Jessica Hope...the hottest girl you've ever met...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair, you could have pretty much any pick of girls. Being on the basketball team, athletic and good-looking, getting girls had always come easily for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group of you naturally begin to split off, with a sense of nostalgia and inevitably to the different arcades and rides, a new, unusual-looking tent catches your eye. Noticing that Jessica is standing right next to you and also staring at it curiously, you use this as an opportunity to impress her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha...those Fortune Teller tents...what a waste of money! I mean, how <i>stupid</i> do they think people are - to actually pay for that crap? Look what it's called: 'Find Your Destiny With The Mystical Goddess Sasha'... Ha!\" You tell her with a disdainful chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving you a withering look and arched eyebrow, you know instantly it was the wrong thing to say. \"Well, I think it's cool, actually. None of the other guys have the guts to actually go there. Risk finding out about their futures. Like, guys are really just scared little kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, it doesn't scare me,\" you retort, feeling your heart race around this gorgeous girl. \"I mean, I could...go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Well, let me know how you get on!\" She beams at you, which is enough to convince you that you're actually going through with this. Grinning at her before heading towards the pale blue, mysterious looking tent, you are greeted by a very striking yet pompous woman who could be aged anything between 20 and 30....but it's hard to tell as she has a certain wisdom about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, boy. You are here to have your destiny read...to have your fortune told...to find out what awaits you in these dark and uncertain times...<i>yes</i>?\" The woman peers at you, speaking in a foreign accent that was difficult to distinguish. \"My name is Goddess Sasha,\" she adds, rather needlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yeah, I guess...\" You mutter disinterestedly. \"How long will this take...and it's free, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on a chair opposite you, behind a desk covered with blue satin, along with various orbs and unusual objects, she stares at you, clearly unimpressed. \"Goddess Sasha requires a tribute. If you want your future read, explained and articulated to you in the most enlightened way possible, then there is no need to ask about such existential concepts such as time..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell is she going on about?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're Goddess Sasha, but you refer to yourself in the third person? And can you speak in plain English? How much money and how long will this thing take?\" You reply in a sardonic tone sitting down reluctantly on the chair directly opposite her, feeling the need to ridicule this fraud. She's probably made loads of money out of gullible idiots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ethereal-looking yet admittedly beautiful woman glares at you, shaking her head slowly from side to side. \"I decide upon a monetary convenience that is based upon my subject's willingness to respect and believe....respect and believe the ancient ways and the ancient mysticism that I invoke. For you...\" She looks you up and down in disdain. \"One hundred US dollars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hundred...a hundred dollars! That's...that's...!\" You splutter at her, taken aback. One dollar...maybe even two would be sufficient for this crappy service, surely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a weak, spineless man...\" She tells you in a disapproving tone. \"Not even willing to pay me or show me respect.\" Bafflingly, Goddess Sasha proceeds to put both bare feet up on her table, forcing you to stare directly at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Feet</i>...you hate feet! It's always been the one thing that you simply could not stand. As if she could know that you detested them THIS much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost pulling away in disgust, it takes a concerted effort not to yell out in protest. \"You're a nut job! Charging me a <i>hundred</i> dollars...then putting your disgusting bare feet on the table in front of me...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologise to Goddess Sasha, then I will forgive you, boy. I will allow you to have your fortune read for a...reduced price... All you have to do is admit that you have been disrespectful to Goddess Sasha, then you will have my forgiveness and we can begin the procedure,\" She tells you this completely calmly, though there is a certain menace about her. Her bare feet, several toes of which are adorned with toe rings, each ankle sporting an anklet wiggle in front of you, as though she's expecting you to surrender your pride, just so you can have your fortune told...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it,\" you snarl at her. \"You are a fraud. A FRAUD! Standing to your feet and glaring at her, you feel genuinely enraged and full of scorn. \"You're nothing but a con artist! Getting teenagers like me to pay you good money for some magic mumbo-jumbo bullshit?! You don't have any fucking powers, you loon! I'm gonna tell everyone that you are a weirdo, who puts her feet in front of their customers' faces. Seriously, get a proper job, you idiot! And no fucking way are you getting a cent out of me!\" With that you glare at her while she continues to stare at you, slowly spreading her toes and shaking her head from side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you will curse the day that you showed disrespect to <i>Goddess Sasha</i>. I have created personal hells that your worst possible fears could not even begin to equate to!\" The striking woman's eyebrows raise and a fury seems to sparkle inside of her eyes. \"You, Ethan Price, will be subjected to all manners of humiliation and degradation! You will wish that you begged and kissed Goddess Sasha's feet, rather than spoke with such disharmony and ingratitude!\" With that, she suddenly produces a handful of what seems to be glittery powder and throws it directly at you, making you cough and splutter, clawing at your eyes in frustrated surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...you fucking bitch!\" You yell, finally getting rid of the dust so that you can rough her up a bit, to tell that she's a woman! However, Goddess Sasha is gone. Totally gone. Instead, there is a small orb, almost like a magic eight ball, in that it has some writing on the outside of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Welcome to your hell.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words send shivers down your spine but anger soon takes over. Who the hell does she think she is? Throwing some powder crap in your face then somehow getting away before you could confront her. Still, at least you don't have to pay her anything! As you turn around and leave the way you came in, another thought crosses your mind. She knew your name! Well, that is weird, you have to admit. Still, it doesn't mean anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the tent, you nearly walk right into someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?\" You say in total surprise at the person in front of you...</span></div></div>",

She is from your school, but to be honest you never wanted anything to do with the freak. She now is staring directly back at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I know you.... You're from my school... Ummm.... <i>Daisy</i>?\" you say, looking at the gothic girl dressed in black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's <i>Destiny</i>, Ethan... And what the hell have you done?\" she says sternly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? What have I done? What the hell are you talking about\" you reply aggressively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pissed off Goddess Sasha, and now we are both in her world... Her <i>Abyss</i>!\" she says in fear, but with a slight undertone of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her world? What is wrong with you... Wait, you actually think she has powers?\" you ask jokingly, unable to believe this crazy freak actually seems to think you're in a different world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl explains... \"Can't you feel it? This world is now...different! Yes, there are still people here...you're still at The Carnival, but she's changed it. Goddess Sasha has changed everything! Yes, she has powers... Ethan, this is not the carnival you came from before you entered her tent...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around you, and to your horror she is right. What the hell happened? You start to wonder. \"Well if that's the case, why are you here? How do you know this? Are you in on this shit too?\" you say, half-scared half-pissed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be the only person here that knows what's going on. I have powers of my own, but they are no where near as strong as Goddess Sasha. She is hundreds of years old and more powerful than you could possibly imagine. It seems she has brought me and others here to break you Ethan\" Destiny says in a whisper, leaning forwards close to your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To break me? What do you mean?\" you ask shakily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You disrespected her, didn't you? Ethan, Goddess Sasha is not one to disrespect, especially if your a male. She comes from medieval times, when males hunted witches and tried to kill them. She does not tolerate disrespect. I'm afraid your only way out of this may be to....well, I'll put it bluntly.... bow down at her <i>feet</i> and become her slave for eternity...\" she says awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At her <i>feet</i>?\" You remember her putting her feet up in front of you and you cringe. The idea of being at Goddess Sasha's - or anyone for that matter, even Jessica's feet - made you feel a little sick to the stomach. \"Her slave for eternity? That is NOT going to happen Destiny!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to have a problem with feet Ethan, if that is the case, I would watch out because she will definitely know this. Goddess Sasha has this power, this skill to absorb what's inside your mind and create a new world based on it. Your fears will be realised and used against you! She would love nothing more than to humble you and have you kneel and willingly worship the one thing you detest... The ultimate symbol of submission and defeat. Ethan, I may be your only hope through this. You need to trust me, or we will both be stuck in this world forever!\" Destiny says with a certainly that chills you to the bone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do? Do you trust her and hope she can help you out of this? Or do you push her aside and deal with this yourself? After all, if she has powers too, how do you know she isn't trying to break you like Goddess Sasha apparently is?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This girl thinks you're in some fantasy world concocted by an evil Goddess that is hundreds of years old, yet looks like she is your age? You look around and see people laughing and playing, no different from the carnival before you went in that tent. You look back to Destiny to tell her your decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, look, I have nothing against you Daisy, bu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-it's Destiny!\" she interrupts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I have nothing against you\", you continue. \"But I'm not into this wierd mystical voodoo shit okay? So just leave me alone, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and start to walk away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan, you're making a big mistake\", Destiny yells out to you. You ignore her and keep walking. \"Ethan wait, fine, I'll let you go, but let me just say one more thing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop... If hearing her out will mean she will drop this crap, then so be it. You turn to face her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do hate feet, don't you?\" she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her confused. \"Well, yeah but it's not strange to hate feet, hell, most people do! It would be more strange if I had a fetish for them, that would be really messed up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if I'm right, Goddess Sasha will want to make you develop a foot fetish so you spend the rest of your life worshipping the one thing you hate. But it is VERY important you don't worship her feet. If.... If you do happen to find yourself attracted to feet, know that... You... You can have mine,\" Destiny says, motioning down at her Gothic boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only imagine her pale sweaty feet inside those Gothic boots, and the thought makes you sick to your stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is disgusting! No.... Just... Just no! Goodbye\", you say, turning and walking to the park to find your friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look around, you can't seem to see anybody you know...

Seeing it as a good way to get a laugh, you walk up to the lady that seems to be running the attraction. She had silver hair and an innocent look in her eyes. She soon notices your approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, welcome to Bunny's mansion of control. Just you going in big boy?\" She asks with a flutter of her eyes. You take a quick look down at her name tag before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just me miss... Bunny.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's <b>Goddess</b> Bunny, but I'll spare you the titles this time. That will be twenty dollars for one.\" She says before you hand her the money. \"Well, if you're going in, you'll need this.\" She says as she straps some sort of digital watch to your wrist. It seems frozen at 60:00, implying some sort of countdown timer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this for?\" You ask, confused at the odd gizmo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how long you have to get out. Once you step in there, the doors will shut behind you and get locked, and it's up to you to find the key. You have one hour, find the key and get out before this clock runs out. Do it in the first thirty minutes and you'll get a <i>special</i> prize from me.\" With the purr in her voice at the end there, you can only assume that this prize involves a happy ending for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if I dont do it in before an hour passes?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say you don't want that to happen. By the way, beware the traps and monsters you'll find in there.\" She says, making you chuckle as you expect the traps to just be puffs of air in your face, and some underpaid intern in a costume acting like a monster. You begin to head inside. \"Good luck.\" You hear her say from behind you. You walk in, and like she said, the doors behind you close and lock and the timer on your watch starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Figuring that they wouldn't just leave it on a table with a sign that says \"Key Here --&gt;\", you start exploring the place to try and find where they'd hidden it. As you began to look around the main hall, you quickly notice how much bigger this place looked inside than it was on the outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was huge. Outside this place looked no bigger than a fishing shack, yet this hall alone looked big enough to hold one of those inside with room to spare. Must be some kind of trick, whether it was a trick to make the outside look smaller or the inside look bigger is beyond you right now. What really caught your eye was the artwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecorating the walls of the room were portrait after portrait with a rather unusual theme, foot worship. In each picture there was some poor bastard in a compromising position kissing or licking at a woman's feet. Some even had collars or cock cages on. Upon closer inspection though, you notice some familiar faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize that phoney fortune teller as the woman being worshipped in several of the portraits. Some of the others had Bunny from out front as the woman in charge. The last woman you saw was some hot blonde chick that you wouldn't mind visiting next. Perhaps this place doubles as their home, and these portraits depict the poor souls that couldn't get out in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of your trance, you remember that you're being timed and that you just spent three minutes just admiring art. You notice two sets of stairs, one going up and one going down, as well as a large door leading on to the rest of this floor. Well, time's of the essence. Which way should you go?</span></div></div>",

You then see a large hallway with branching halls and doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like out in the main room, the walls of this hall are covered in portraits of the three ladies and their conquests. Just how many poor souls have walked these halls before you? How many couldn't do what you are trying to do? Do you even have a chance at surviving this, let alone winning the grand prize? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you can't be thinking like that right now. You needed to find that key and get the fuck out of here before you faced the same fate as these guys, maybe worse. Negative thinking was only going to play you into their hands. You are down to fifty five minutes now, so you needed to start looking if you ever wanted to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem was, there were a lot more rooms than you were expecting. There were about two dozen doors in this main hallway alone. You still had the side halls and the up and downstairs to search. It could take the full hour just to go through half of this floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then occurs to you that there could be even more than just three floors. If their trickery could hide the true size of this place on the inside, then who knows how many floors this place could have that you couldn't see.

You quickly check the pillowcase and under the bed, being the only two possible options to hide anything, but no luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the room and go into the next one. Same deal as before, mostly empty save a bed, cum-stained sheets, no key. Same with the next two rooms. Was every room down here going to be like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened down here? Was there just some bitchin' orgy that you weren't told about? Or was this where those three you saw upstairs took their victims from the portraits? Either way, you were in a pickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a lot of rooms here. If you explored every room down here, even if they were all like this, you would eat up all of your time.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as you open the door, something hits you in the back of the head. You keel over onto your knees before flopping yo the floor completely. As your vision fades, you see a pair of feet standing before you. After that, you quickly black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your consciousness returns, your groggily arise and begin to observe your surroundings. You see that you are standing in a room you don't recall from your previous exploration. Before you can fully question where you were or who slugged you, more of the lights turn on. Now you see a man, bound by straps and hanging from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to call out to him, when you feel your wrist vibrate. Checking it, you see the watch that Bunny gave you, only instead of the countdown clock, you see the hostess herself staring at you on a screen. \"Hello Ethan.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bunny? How do you know my name? What's going on here? Where am I? Who is he?\" You ask rapid fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down sweetie. I told you, I'm a goddess, so of course I know your name. You are currently in my little fun room. I want to play a game with you.\" She answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about <b>him</b>?\" You ask, gesturing to the man who was beginning to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Rob. He's an office worker who will also be participating in our game. Like you, he hates feet and has a smug superiority complex towards women, so some of his coworkers decided to bring him to us to show him his true place at womens' feet.\" She explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?!\" Rob calls out, apparently having heard her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush now Robbie, you'll want to hear the rules of this little game too.\" She says, silencing him. \"Now then, beneath Rob, you'll notice some of my... pets.\" You both look directly underneath where Rob is hanging and you both nearly vomit at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a vat full of feet. Yet somehow, despite being without bodies, they are still wriggling around, sweating up a storm. \"Once this call ends, Rob will be lowered into that vat, where he will then be forced to sniff, taste, and hump feet until he's a worthless little footboy, whether he wants to or not.\" Before Rob can curse her out,  she continues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Robbie, you can be saved. That's where Ethan here comes in.\" She continues, turning back to you. \"All you need to do is hit that button over there.\" At that word, another light flicks on, showing a button as promised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it also showed another nauseating sight. More feet like the ones beneath Rob, only these ones are as long as the average human is tall. There were about half a dozen of them, and they stood between you and the button. \"All you have to do is get past my pets and hit the button before Rob enters the vat. Be careful though, they are feeling really friendly today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder at what that could mean. \"Oh, and don't forget that you're still on the clock Ethan. Exit's over there for you.\" She motions over to an open door. \"Good luck.\" With that, she flicks off and the watch's display returns to the clock, now showing that you have about 45 minutes left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word, once the call ends, Rob begins to be lowered into the vat. \"Oh shit! Listen man, I don't know you, but you sound like my kinda guy. Help me out here, please. I don't want to be the foot toy to some of the bitches back at my work. Please.\" Rob begs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're torn. Being a foot hater yourself, you wouldn't want to subject this man to that. But, to save him, you'll have to go through your own foot suffering. Plus, you don't have time to waste. You have to find this key and escape the mansion before the clock runs out. Do you really want to go through this Saw shit for this guy you don't know?</span></div></div>",

No, you were right first time, actually. Now, you must be the muggle who has bravely fought through the mansion and is here to claim his reward!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell is going on? Hermione from Harry Potter is one of your absolute major crushes. How could this crappy carnival have managed to get Emma Watson to take part in this Haunted House experience?! No...no, surely she must be a very good lookalike...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cocks her head to one side, eyes shining brightly and an amused expression on her face. \"Well, it's all rather simple really. All you need to do is pop along over here and watch me take off this dreadfully annoying gown. Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLookalike or not, it's totally uncanny! She looks exactly as she did in Deathly Hallows Part 2 - the final Harry Potter film. Your feet moving before you even decide to, \"Hermione\" giggles at your uncertainty. \"Don't be so shy...I mean, I know I'm a rather loquacious sort and all, but a little enthusiasm would certainly not go amiss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I mean...\" <i>Come on Ethan, this is a fantasy come true!</i> \"I mean, sure.

Maybe you're still dreaming? No, this feels real, for sure! Slipping off the wizarding gown is like cutting a hot knife through butter.

This is actually <i>better</i> than your fantasies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...I mean...what is. Are you really Hermione?\" You finally blurt out, confused but getting increasingly turned-on and light headed by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pouts at you sympathetically, seeing that you're struggling with the situation. \"Oh dear, not the brightest spark are we! OK, tell you what - let me show you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the beautiful eighteen year old whips out a wand from under her pillow, fixing you with a confident stare. \"<i>Wingardium Leviosa!</i>\" To your amazement, her wizarding robes suddenly float in the air and hang their suspended. Moments later and with a chuckle, they drop to the floor. \"Well, that was an easy one. You know that I've got tons more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouth hanging open in disbelief, you have a sudden thought. <i>This is all connected to Goddess Sasha...! </i> The dawning realisation would set in more fully, if were not that you were standing before Hermione Granger in her lingerie!

This one is still mostly empty with another door, but now, there's a glass wall splitting the room in two. On the other side of the wall, you see another man standing there. Before you could ask any questions, the door behind you slams shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour watch vibrates once again and you raise it up to see Bunny giving you a smug grin. \"Hello again Ethan. I see you chose survival of the fittest. Tough break for Rob then.\" She says, making you wince again as you are reminded of the state you left the poor guy in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here Bunny? I played your game, so why am I still trapped?\" You ask, getting a bit frustrated. She giggles a bit at how you try to act like you're in control here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I ever say that there was only one game for you Ethan? I still have plenty of fun to have with you.\" She explains. You groan as you realize how screwed you are if this goes too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's this next 'game' of yours? Also who's this guy? Does he hate feet too?\" You ask, gesturing to the other man in his half of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite the opposite, in fact. Meet James. He's from the same office building as Rob, only he absolutely loves feet. When he heard of three goddesses that loved to dominate men with their feet, he actively sought us out and practically begged us to let him worship our feet. Since then, he's become our favorite little boytoy pet. He loves us and we love him.\" She explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for the game...\" She pauses while two more of her larger \"pets\" emerge from the wall, one on each side of the glass. They are held still by two metal poles coming out of the holes they came from. You cringe as you see them wiggle their toes at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are absolutely caked in dirt, sweat, grass stains, and you aren't even sure what else. \"You and James are going to have a little foot cleaning competition. Underneath the room you are standing in is another vat of my pets like the one you doomed Rob to stew in.\" She starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, we each have to clean the foot in our room. Winner gets to leave, loser gets dropped.\" You say in a deadpan tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're half right. Those are what will happen to <i>you</i> if you win or lose, but James has a different set of incentives.\" This perks up his ears as he listens in to what's being said. \"If he wins, he gets free access to my whole body to do as he pleases for an hour, but if he loses, he isn't allowed to touch any of our feet for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis elation at fooling around with Bunny quickly dies down at the idea of being without their feet. To you, those should be switched, but you supposed that a foot freak like him would see things differently. \"By the way, no wash rags. So you'll both be tongue cleaning your feet. Have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are wincing at the idea of licking that giant foot, James dives right in and gets licking. Not only do you not want to end up like poor Rob, you also want to get out of here as fast as you can. With great hesitation, you walk up to your foot and begin to lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho wins?</span></div></div>",

While the foot freak practically salivates and moans away as he laps away at the - admittedly shapely and well-arched, it must be said - giant bare sole in front of him. You meanwhile can only manage a tentative lick at the time, grimacing and spitting out in disgust the various bits of dirt and grime that get caught up in your tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that this is a hopeless situation, you glare across at James, who is already approximately halfway through successfully cleaning Bunny's 'pet'. \"Hey, loser! Stop licking already, or I'll punch you square in the face!\" You snarl at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallows thickly before turning his head to you. He has an excited look about him despite his generally unkempt look; he is every bit the pathetic foot slave Bunny told you! There is something about him that tells you he is so grateful to be the property of Bunny and the other 'Goddesses'.  Although he looks a little frightened of you, he shrugs and dives right back to the foot and he worshipfully licks with renewed vigour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" You shout angrily at him. \"You fucking foot freak! Stop NOW! Stop and lick this stupid pet instead...\" You stand back and gesture at the huge foot with teasing, wiggling toes, still barely cleaned at this point. \"You're a stupid little beta male who should let ME win! Come and lick this foot so you can twice as much pathetic satisfaction, you loser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pauses again but doesn't have the nerve to actually say anything. So, you decide to take matters into your own hands. Moving towards him, fist raised, he cringes and cowers before you but then suddenly smiles. \"What, what is it, you freak?\" You glare before feeling a sharp pain in the back of your head, forcing you to crash face down to the floor. Rolling onto your back, you look up to see another of Bunny's pets - a tanned, soft-looking sole tapping its toes playfully against the ground before scampering away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No touching, boys!\" Comes Bunny's bratty voice over a speaker. \"If make any more physical OR verbal threats, Ethan, then James wins automatically!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck! </i>This stupid foot dweeb is going to beat you! You could name ANY other sport and you'd own him! Sighing in defeat, you crawl over to the huge, almost gloating sole that you have failed to make any sort of impression on, and give it a pitifully small lick on the heel, grimacing again as you taste a clod of earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames meanwhile is nearly done. Probably with a boner in his pants, he expertly fondles his tongue in between each of the long toes - each one a forearm in height. His constant moaning and whimpers of \"thank you, Goddesses!\" is not only off-putting but pathetic to listen to, while you  drop down in disgruntlement to a sitting position, arms folded in disgust as you finally give up on licking the disgustingly long bare sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunny appears a minute or so later, a smug look about her as she walks over to inspect both of her pets. With James', she nods with approval and pats him on the head patronisingly, whispering a \"Good boy!\" in his ear while he drops to the floor in exhaustion. As she sidles over to yours, she tuts, frowning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, Ethan. Looks like you've lost! James' pet is COMPLETELY clean! Yours is still so dirty...poor thing!\" She pouts at her pet before turning back to you, standing imperiously over you as you continue to sit on the floor, sulking. \"Well, as you've lost, you need to be punished. As I'm feeling...<i>benevolent</i> today...I'll let you choose!\" She lets out a girlish giggle while playing with her ash-coloured hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? More of your stupid pets?\" You glare up at her, still picking bits of dirt out of your tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Bunny's eyes shine with unrelenting excitement as she continues. \"Well, there are two choices, Ethan. Option 1 is that you lick clean TEN...that's right...TEN of my lovely big pets.... Or, or the second option is a total surprise....what's it gonna be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouth hanging open, the idea of having to clean 10 of those vile creatures makes you nearly heave.

So easily confused! No. Licking ten of my pets is your PUNISHMENT for GIVING UP so easily!\" She says in a chiding tone, cocking her head to one side. \"Had you tried your best and lost valiantly, well then you would've been dropped into the vat already. No, no no; licking my ten pets clean is just a little punishment for you BEFORE you get dropped into a beautiful bevy of my darling pets!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel nauseous...so agreeing to lick the of her pets is just a punishment before being dropped into a vat, like what you saw happen to that guy Rob...?! There's no way you can....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts trail off as Bunny giggles. \"Tell you what, if you do a REALLY good job...and I mean, each pet being sparkling new and fully satisfied....well, then I'll let you have...<i>this</i>...\" She suddenly bends down, turning her ass around slowly and expertly. \"Of course, you'll have to go after my slave here hour's up....but let's just say, clean my gorgeous pets for me, accept being dropped down below to more of my darlings afterwards...then, THEN, you can have your hour! In fact, yes - you have an hour maximum to clean my pets, accept your time with my smaller pets below, then get a piece of this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour?! A whole hour with this beautiful if crazy girl! Nearly salivating and stiffening immediately at the thought of what you could do with her perfect breasts, pert ass...incredible mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, let's get on with the challenge...\" You practically stammer, while Bunny giggles at how quick your change in heart has been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darlings!\" She calls out...you can come out now!\" The gorgeous girl giggles again, as her huge pets suddenly appear, almost as though teleporting in the room, each planted on the ground before swivelling around so that there massive soles are in full view, all in a line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heady, putrid stench of cheesy feet is almost overwhelming! Choking, spluttering, you try to best to get some oxygen from the other side of the room. One of these things reeks but ten....!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, this really is the weirdest place...surely, surely this can't be right...more than just carnival tricks. Remember those weird paintings...Goddess Sasha...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts evaporate when Bunny beckons at James, her slave crawling excitedly after her as she heads out of the room. Turning around, she grins at you. \"Don't worry, stud...I doubt my slave here will get very far. He's gonna start at my feet and work his way up....so an hour at my toes, right?!\" She giggles as James lets out a small, weak murmur of assent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell if you're ever going to become a bitch boy loser like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on your massive objective, you sigh with resentment and trepidation as you gaze at Bunny's pets. Each bare sole is simply gigantic - each one nearly the same height as you! They are various shades - some paler, some slightly wider, some with toes a bit longer...one thing is a constant though, they all stink and are absolutely filthy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you manage to complete cleaning them, or do you give up during the process?</span></div></div>",

Staring at it with revulsion, you notice the perfect shape and arches - if you were into feet, then this would be admittedly attractive. But you're most certainly not! Bunny's pet wiggles its toes, as if to taunt you, the peachy-coloured sole covered in dirt and who-knows-what! Shuddering at the rich, salty flavour, not to mention that this is such a bizarre situation, you swallow thickly, absorbing clumps of earth, grime... It truly is disgusting! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, get through this, survive the vat of Bunny's smaller pets and you get to do whatever you want with her....for a whole fucking hour! That will surely be worth all of this torture! Then again, this is seriously grim, you muse as you brush your teeth against the skin of Bunny's first of ten pets. Sliding and dragging your tongue all over the enormous creature, you let out a small moan of frustration - certainly not pleasure! This is gonna take forever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, it seems like at least fifteen solid minutes of licking before you are finally done with Bunny's first pet. You actually have to stand on your tiptoes, grabbing each giant toe with both hands as you remove the endless toe jam between each one. The amount of sweat runs down your throat, like you're drinking a hot, salty beverage. You step away, inspecting your work, when you are met with a gentle pat on the head from the pet's huge, very flexible big toe. <i>Patronising or what!</i> You give it a sardonic grin before moving onto the next. This one is much darker in colour, a dark brown with a pinkish tint to it. Initially, you find the dirt harder to locate but you find it soon enough. Another eternity later, and you're done with the second pet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo down, <i>eight to go!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing for breath, you bend down panting, after another casual pat of your head from the dark pet. \"You're welcome...\" You mutter through gritted teeth before moving on. The third and fourth pets are both pretty similar; maybe they're twins, you wonder momentarily after standing stony faced at your head being patted by the latter. After completing the fifth, you quietly congratulate yourself for making it halfway through!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a small break, using your teeth to try scraping away some of the gunk and slime from Goddess Bunny's pets. The taste of them, although all subtly different from one another, is actually not as awful as you first thought. Under the dirt, the huge pets taste sharp, cheddary but not <i>totally</i> disgusting! The next few pets, you make short work of. Wow, you must be about as quick as James now! Cursing yourself for comparing you to that pathetic loser, you shrug it off as you finally, finally are done. Stepping back, all 100 toes wiggle at you, their bare skin glowing and glistening with your saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, you are suddenly dropped through the floor. Crying out from the sudden sensation of it, you don't have a second to readjust. In a split-second, you find yourself being fastened with straps to the ceiling by much smaller pets of Bunny's - all regular foot-sized! Your wrist vibrates, tilting your head you see Bunny's pretty face appear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job...! Hehe, you'd make a great assistant to my pets, you know,\" She giggles at you. \"Anyway, I'm done with my slave now. He never made it past my feet, <i>obviously</i>...but he had fun for an hour! I even let him jerk off with my feet in his face...as he's been <i>such</i> a good boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....so I get lowered into your pets...\" You gulp and grimace a little as you look straight down to see the writhing mass of what appears to be a hundred regular-sizes pets of Bunny's. Yes, this is pretty much the exact same setup that the guy Rob was in! Maybe he had a deal similar to Bunny's... Ignoring that thought, you turn back to Bunny on your watch. \"Then...when this is done...I get a whole hour with you...right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, don't you worry, Ethan. You'll get a chance to try and get past my feet. But honestly, don't feel so bad about it if you don't! My feet will be all you'll ever need!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna bend you over backwards....teach you a fucking lesson,\" you growl at her. How dare she suggest that you'll be easily turned into a snivelling slave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolls her eyes. \"Oh, puh-lease! For that little comment, I've added another stipulation. If my pets are a bit too much for you, scream '<i>I quit!'</i> If you do that, you'll get to stop the fun with my little pets. But you won't get me. Don't scream <i>'I quit'</i>, then the deal is still on. Anyway, bye-bye for now!\" She giggles as you find yourself beginning to be lowered down directly into the vat of bare feet, quicker than Rob was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing your eyes, you pray and hope that this ordeal is over soon. Surely you can't give up now after licking all of those giant pets...putting up with all of this crap....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The stench from the squirming mass of Bunny's pets becomes increasingly sharp and heady as you descend towards them. Trying to hold your breath is futile as their scent is so piercing that you find yourself gagging and spluttering; at least you can keep your eyes closed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat plan is ruined when your face comes into contact with the wriggling and writhing bare feet; it's as if they know your plan and use several toes to keep your eyes fully open. This is so uncomfortable that you find yourself shouting at them to let you go, which they do once you reluctantly accept that your eyes must be open for this ordeal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face soon becomes submerged in a sea of sweat and flesh. As you finish descending and are locked firmly into place, your face is grinned and brushed roughly against the various soles and toes of Bunny's pets. The fact that they are much smaller than the huge ones - in fact they are the size of regular feet - is of little comfort, as there are so, so many of them! Different colours, textures, shapes, subtle differences in lengths and widths...some toes are stronger or stubbier than others. Moaning out in despair, you feel your nose being crushed by the creatures, the sharp, vinegary smell flooding your nostrils, while your entire body is surrounded by the pets. Moving all over you, you let out a whimper of embarrassment when they begin to rub against your crotch, their relentless, rapid movements start to build a boner in your pants, against your own will!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you consider quitting. To get away from this stench of cheesy feet, to get them away from being pushed against your face, squashing your nose...but now, worst of all, actually causing you arousal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...please....don't...\" You manage to whimper out, while you are constantly treaded over and trampled by Goddess Bunny's pets. The ones around your crotch spread their toes, wiggle them eagerly around so that your pants become loose and actually slip off you! Likewise, your shirt is undone, as are your shoes and socks, leaving you just in your boxer shorts as your other clothes are instantly swept away in the sea of bare feet. Being just in your underwear does not help matters at all; it allows Bunny's pets to get a better grip and easier access to your groin. One foot pushes against the base of your shaft while another taps it toes all over the head. They don't even need to go inside your shorts; from the outside, they are causing enough friction and rapid movement to get you to full mast in mere minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please....\" is the weak gurgling sound you make until you surrender to the feet. Even though you've always hated feet, you're being forced to get sexual excitement from Bunny's pets! Having licked clean ten giant soles for a good hour, plus this total trample from the smaller pets, you're becoming less disgusted and more and more reluctantly appreciative of them. The feel of their soft skin on your cheeks, the smell of their toes gently nuzzling into your nostrils and, best of all, how much they are pleasuring you, sexually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's too much! Letting out a loud moan of ecstasy, your entire body shakes and throbs inside the endless river of feet, as you ejaculate into your boxers. Never before have you had such an intense orgasm, not even during sex! As if sensing your sexual capitulation to them, the feet start to slow down with their movements, gradually become still until you are unceremoniously dumped on the ground, quivering weakly on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well!\" Goddess Bunny saunters into the room, barefoot and a knowing smirk on her pretty features. \"Had fun, did we, Ethan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, feeling the sense of bliss turn to one of utter humiliation and guilt, you keep your eyes averted from her. <i>Shit...she knows that you came in your underwear...you came while her pets dominated you!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe...well, a deal is a deal after all. Remember what I said though...you're gonna start at my feet and work your way up. I wonder how long it will take me to break you and make you a willing foot slave, like my good little boy, James? Anyway...follow me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Bunny beckons you to follow her as you awkwardly get to your feet, trying to ignore your cum-drenched boxer shorts. An hour to be with her but is this a good idea? She is ridiculously sexy but having blown your load, do you still have the enthusiasm for it....? Also, everything has not worked out well so far tonight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunny walks towards the door, confidently striding ahead. Another door to your right also appears... Maybe it is best to stay away from Bunny rather than walk into yet another trap...</span></div></div>",

You've got laid before but never with anyone this beautiful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, go to the end of the bed,\" Goddess Bunny orders you as she undresses to her underwear, seductively positioning herself and sliding her legs out so her feet are dangling over the edge. \"Now, let's see how far you get....to get a piece of this...\" She uses her hands to indicate her body, looking gorgeous in lacy black pants and matching bra. \"These can come off too, you know!\" She giggles as she cups her hands around her bra, then gently caresses her groin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit...she is beyond perfection! Practically licking your lips in anticipation, you do as instructed, getting down on your knees at the end of her bed, looking up at the ashen-haired girl with a grin. Man, the things you're gonna do to her...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, feet first,\" she says with authority, wiggling her toes. \"I want you to lick up from the heel to the toes on each foot. If you can do that for me, then you can then work up to my legs, then get to the goods...\" She winks at you before pouting. \"But we both know what's gonna happen, don't we Ethan?

Small, soft, perfect arches...you take in a breath and allow the cheddary yet sweet aroma wash over you. Her feet are gorgeous, it can't be denied!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see, foot boy?\" Bunny giggles at you, forcing you to snap away from your thoughts about her feet. She pouts again at you. \"Don't be so embarrassed...licking ten of my lovely big pets, then having my cutey ones smother you...it's no surprise that you like feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But you don't...you don't like feet! You HATE feet! </i>Yet, Bunny's feet are so perfect, so irresistible...with a gulp, you start licking upwards, dragging your tongue - dry from the large pets - up from Bunny's surprisingly soft heel, along her clean, shapely foot until it brushes against her toes, causing her to wiggle them appreciatively. Repeating this several times, you have to admit that you're enjoying this.... It's OK.... You can do the same to the other foot then work your way up her body to get to the real goods...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut can you? Do you find that after licking both of Goddess Bunny's perfect little feet that you're desperate for more of her soles, toes and gorgeous arches?</span></div></div>",

Swallowing her foot sweat hungrily, you continue to swish and swirl your tongue all over the balls of her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at you through her toes, a look of victory on her pretty face, Goddess Bunny giggles. \"Enjoying yourself there? Don't forget my other foot....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you mumble, the word slipping out before you can help it. Switching your mouth over to Bunny's right foot, you lick excitedly, again starting from the very bottom of her heel and working your tongue upwards, swishing from side to side. It's just...incredible! Who would've thought that feet could be this delicious, this perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fully vulnerable....entirely consumed...all for Goddess Bunny!\" She chuckles as she nuzzles her foot against your lips. \"There's no way out for you now, foot boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Foot boy...you're not her foot boy! But it's just so hard...to stop licking...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou steady her right foot, so that you can lick in between each flawless, soft toe, removing any toe jam. Pulling her foot up so that you can such on her big toe like it's a lolly pop, you try to think logically, rationally, but the chance of moving past her feet is slipping away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not an alpha,\" the ashen-haired girl tells you matter-of-factly, fondling with a strand of hair. \"In fact, you're devoid of all ability to be an alpha. You are good for following orders and be used how I choose...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind slowly melting into oblivion, you try to regain some of your senses, taking her foot away from your mouth for a moment, breathing heavily. \"But...I...I am....I'm basketball...captain...I'm not...a beta...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you are a beta! Your manhood is non existent, slave!\" She laughs down at you, pushing her foot forward so that it rests against your face, her toes spreading over your forehead. \"Allow me to occupy your mind and then claim my territory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is so hard to resist...specifically, her feet are impossible to stop worshipping! Letting out a defeated moan, which makes Goddess Bunny sigh contentedly, you grab her foot and shower it all over with rapid kisses followed long loving licks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a beta, huh? Yeah right! For a guy who hates feet so much, you really have a funny way of showing it, slave! I bet you thought you were gonna turn my world around with that cock of yours, right? Well, the only pleasure your pindick provides for me is a good fucking laugh!\" She tilts her head back and giggles a little crazily, as your eyes wander down to your boxer shorts. Sure enough, you have a full on erection - the size of it clearly not impressing a Goddess like Bunny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...can't...please...\" You murmur, incoherently, your mouth full of her gorgeous foot. Bunny rolls her eyes at you and suddenly lights a cigarette, blowing a ring of smoke that is not dissimilar to her hair colour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave, I've already won. I win - you lose. I'm an alpha, you're a beta! It's the way of the world. Be glad you've found your place - at my feet! James - he struggled with his foot fetish for years until he started messaging me on Twitter, letting me drain his bank account...paying for me to go out for lunch or buy a new pair of shoes...he became my little findom bitch for a while. Then he realised he had to get the real thing, so he willingly accepted being my personal slave! See this as a good thing - you've skipped the whole slow drain and got right to the serving me. And you didn't even have a foot fetish before I broke and destroyed you...that's the best part of all!\" She giggles, taking another toke on her cigarette and blowing it wistfully at the ceiling. \"So, shut the fuck up already and put that mouth to good use - <i>serving my feet!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind has turned to jelly as you let out a small whimper of defeat, closing your eyes momentarily as you lavish your tongue vigorously all over Bunny's silky soft soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be useful - be my foot bitch!\" She continues, pure confidence radiating from her. \"This body...\" She again, gestures at her drop-dead gorgeous figure, \"Is out of your league. I am out of your league. So I'm glad that you're content at staying at my feet - where you belong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's right, there is no denying it. Goddess Bunny has won! You are more than content to continue licking and worshiping her feet, sucking up every bit of foot sweat you can, swallowing it gratefully and finding that you are just desperate for more! Goddess Bunny is exactly what she says....a Goddess to be adored! After a few more minutes, your dick is throbbing with excitement, but Bunny does not allow you to touch it; she admonishes you when you try to reach for it, squeezing your tongue between your toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad slave! No, only when I let you! For that, you'll have to wait for at least another ten minutes...\" That time seems like an eternity but you do not dare protest! Thoroughly humbled, defeated and dominated by this woman, you meekly accept and continue instead to hungrily worship her bare feet, trying to ignore the fact that your dick is ready to explode - for the second time this evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, my little loser slave...NOW you can tug one out while you lick my feet....that is the ultimate reward for accepting your place! It's the best you're ever going to get...the most sexual excitement you'll ever have!\" She giggles at you, biting her lip as she watches you desperately fumble for your cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long is that pindick gonna take to cum I wonder....\" Goddess Bunny muses aloud. \"Ooh, I'll countdown for you! 10, 9, 8....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely lust until 4 until your body spasms again and you let out a weak, mewling noise, your mouth and nose pressed in deference against both of Goddess Bunny's soles. She has turned your world upside down...! Completing your orgasm, adding more stains to your shorts, you drop limply to the floor while your conquerer places both bare feet on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that really was...pathetic!\" She laughs at you. \"I think you're gonna make an even better slave than James! You can make sure all of my pets stay nice and clean most of the time...If you do a good job, I will let you have these perfect feet... Ha, maybe I'll make more competitions between my two slaves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying flat on your back, both of Goddess Bunny's feet resting on your face, you feel like an abject failure. You never made it past her feet....you didn't get to taste her pussy, feel her breasts...shove your cock in anywhere....! Worst of all, <i>she's made you love FEET!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lie on the floor, totally broken and beaten, the door suddenly opens. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

You were too far in now to give up, so you press on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, they didn't get any better with exposure. Every time you tried to lick it, you could feel your stomach come back up on you. Each time you stopped to catch your breath, the foot gets offended and hits you. This goes on for quite some time, at one point, you couldn't hold it in anymore and puke on the sole you were working on, causing it to uppercut you with it's toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you hear the door open once again and see Bunny standing in the door frame. Crap, has an hour passed already? You weren't even half done with the first one. In fact, with your vomit added on, it might be even dirtier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk tsk. For shame Ethan.

While you were busy blowing chunks on my pets, James took his hour of playtime and used it. While he did start at my feet like I expected, hesoon upped his game. He pounded me in a way I never expected from him. It was almost magical how good he was. And at no point did he degrade or hurt me. I guess that he's the real man between the two of you, huh?\" She says gloatingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuch. That hurt in an untold amount of ways. To be told that that freak was more of a man in bed than you was an insult. Then again, he was the one that got to fuck Bunny's almost divine beauty, while all you got was a chance to throw up on her pet. Maybe he's onto something? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now on to your punishment. Now I have to find something to punish you for losing the game, giving up, failing a simple task, AND puking on my cute pet.

I'm sure the police will just love to come here and count up the number of missing people you have yourselves photographed with.\" You rant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Bunny's expression transitioned from slightly miffed to a knowing smirk. Just as you're about to ask what she finds so amusing, the tanned sole from earlier jumped you from behind, pinning you to the ground, and getting the drop on you twice in under an hour. \"I tried to be so generous to you Ethan, all you would have had to do is pick one of the two options and do it, then I would've let you go. But now, there's only one thing left to do if you choose to disobey me.\" She says as she walks up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your head between the big and second toe, you can see her standing over you with her hands on her hips. \"Do you remember what I originally said would be your punishment for failure?\" She asks with a widening grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel your face go pale as you reflect the words she said before any foot licking started. \"N-no, please! Not that. Anything but that. I'll take the first one. Just please not that!\" You beg. Dignity be damned, you couldn't let that happen to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late. I gave that offer and you spat in my face. Now my benevolence has passed.\" She says as she begins to leave, only to stop in front of James and give him a kiss on the lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wove you my wittle Jimmy. You did such a good job today.\" She says in a somewhat patronizing tone. \"Come on. Let's go and leave Ethan to his punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith James behind her with renewed pep in his step, the pair walk back out through the door Bunny entered from, leaving you alone with the \"pet\" that's currently trapping you. As you start to wonder how long it will take to get this thing's toejam out of your hair, the floor begins to open up, revealing a much bigger concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word, underneath the floor lay another vat full of her smaller pets like the one Rob is currently stuck in. The hole in the floor grew wider and wider. Soon most of your body dangled over the hole, making you actually kind of glad that the large foot held you down, as it kept you from falling in. However, as if reading your mind and wanting to just ruin your day as much as possible, the foot on top of you hopped off to who-knows-where, leaving you to fall into the pile of sweaty, wiggly feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pure hell. You were only in for a second and you felt drenched in sweat. All their gross toes squirming around you. The worst part of it all though, was that they seemed to be actively trying to make you sick. Several of the ones near your head drummed their toes against your lips, trying to force their way into your mouth, meanwhile, you could feel even more of them grinding against your crotch, making you feel a bit ashamed as you got an erection from their actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was unbearable. It made you want to pass out after only a few seconds. You had to get out of this. You see the edge of the vat and tried to fight your way through the feet to get there and pull yourself out. Unfortunately, you weren't even halfway there before you see a giant lid begin to close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are unable to make it as the lid slams shut, trapping you in the container with your assailants and their rank smell. You soon feel yourself pulled under again. Amidst all the feet blocking your airways and the lack of fresh air as it was, you soon pass out to the feeling of hundreds of the feet you hate squirming around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you wake up?</span></div></div>",

You just disappeared from work one day and we haven't seen you since. Wait, what 'treatment'?\" Rob says as you vaguely remember Bunny saying something about these two having worked together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard about these three and how they love to have men at their feet. I decided to see if the rumors were true. I came to this carnival and looked for them, and when I did, I threw myself at them and begged them to let me serve them. Not only did they agree, but due to how respectful and humble I was, they've actually treated me very kind and gently.\" He explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now what about that second part, the one about our 'treatment'?\" You speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, goddess Bunny's re-education chambers. They work in a manner similar to Pavlov's classical conditioning to give the subject a latent foot fetish. First, the subject is placed inside and the vat sealed. Then, the combination of unfresh air and feet soon cause the subject to go unconscious. From there, goddess Bunny's pets begin to play with the entrapped subject, inserting themselves into their mouth and filling their nose with foot scent, while others simply squirm around the exterior, covering the subject in sweat.\" He explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like you were going to be sick. \"Meanwhile a good dozen or so rub themselves against the subject's erogenous areas, inducing arousal. The subject's unconscious mind will then begin to link the pleasurable sensation with the taste, feel, and scent of feet.\" He finishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what does that mean in English?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that if it worked, our bodies are going to get aroused by feet, whether we eant to or not, and it's all your fault you dick.\" Rob says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fault? What did I do?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about leaving me behind to get dropped into one of those things? Does that sound familiar?\" He shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was on a time limit. Plus, if I tried to save you, I could've been tortured by those larger ones you saw.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, mister big shot was in so much of a hurry that he couldn't stop to help his fellow foot hater from getting dunked in a tank of them.\" He says mockingly. The two of you stood up and began to walk towards each other, with James trying to keep you apart. Before either of you could throw a punch though, the door to your room opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it? </span></div></div>",

Now then, all of you line up, on your knees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than risk their wrath a second time, you and Rob do as you were told, with James kneeling next to you. The goddesses approached, as each one passed the freak, they gave him a kiss on the forehead before they all stopped in front of each of you. The blonde stood in front of Rob, Bunny in front of James, and you had Sasha's mug with the wifest grin possible staring you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you! I remember you. You promised that we would fuck on the ferris wheel, only to knock me out before I even got my pants off.\" Rob spits to the blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty as charged.

By the way, it's <b>Goddess Lucie</b> to you know.\" She responds. \"And we'll be having a lot of fun with you two.\" She says, pointing to him and you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could ladies.\" Bunny says as she lifts up James. \"But I promised Jimmy here an all access tour of my body for being such a good boy in breaking Ethan. So we're gonna go if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, she leads a smiling James out the door and closes it, leaving you and Rob alone with the two remaining goddesses. Sasha leans down and whispers in your ear. \"Just think, if you submit to me now, we can have a relationship like they have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tempting offer, but you knew that part of their \"relationship\" involved the man being a whipped bitch to the woman and even licking her feet if she so wanted.

Or should we call you foot slave?\" The blonde asks mockingly. As the three pass by you and James, the brunette stops when she sees the freak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, James?!

It was <b>this</b> self-centered slimeball that we hated.\" She says, pointing to Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see your just as bitchy as always Denise.\" Rob snarks back.

Alright Rob, let's see if you're as broken as they said you were. Crawl over here and kiss my feet.\" Denise orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Rob struggling, fighting something, but he was losing. Soon, despite his protests, his body found itself on it's hands and knees and began crawling to the giggling trio. With a grimace look and quivering lip, Rob regretfully plants a kiss on Denise's foot, causing all three to erupt in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes yes. He's broken alright, and the best part is that he still seems to be suffering through this.\" Candice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Come on ladies. Let's take our new pet back, shall we?\" Denise says as she grabs Rob by the shirt and begins to pull him out the door with her friends behind her.

Do you really think that you can take on all three of us at once?\" She asks. \"But I'll tell you what. Since you gave us a good laugh, we'll be a bit reasonable about this. We aren't blind.

Although you don't exactly like the idea of paying $20 only to land on cleaning Goddess Bunny's feet or spending 10 minutes in her 'torture stocks', whatever that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, if you're really strapped for cash, the Wheel of Mystery is only $1\" she says with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't like the sound of that last wheel, but you are keen to play...

There, now you just need to swipe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no real reason not to at this point, you swipe your card in the machine and get a confirmation ding. \"Thank you sir. Then I guess it's time to spin the Wheel of Desire.\" She says as she walks over to spin the wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's see what you get handsome. Whatever it lands on, I can guarantee that I'm excited to see what you have to offer.\" She says with a lustful look and a lick of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat makes two of you. You couldn't wait to see what you got to do to her. You had your fingers crossed in hope that you to fuck this \"Goddess Bunny\". While the other options didn't seem bad, getting to have sex with a cute girl like her would certainly justify the five hundred dollar price tag on this wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the wheel began to slow down. \"Oh, looks like we're about to see your prize. What's it gonna land on?\" She says. </span></div></div>",

You can\u2019t beat me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking up at you, Harley\u2019s grinning expression indicated she was far from finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanna bet?\u201d As she reached into her belt, your experienced eye caught a flicker of something metallic, prompting you to move backwards just before a rather large knife sliced through the space where your shin had just been inhabiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpringing back up with that look of utter insanity painted across her face, she wasted no time in attacking you once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow much more in-tune with your newfound body, you easily ducked and weaved around her bladed jabs and slashes, only irritating the blonde criminal even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost whining out in frustration, she tried one last slashing motion after a continuous string of non-success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting the knife arcing through the air from a mile away, you reached up with both hands and seized her wrist just before the knife came even close to your cowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving quickly, you twisted her forearm behind her back, spinning her around for a second before ultimately slamming her facefirst into the nearby wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinching in a hammerlock with ease, you happily wrenched upwards on her captive arm, forcing the woman to drop the knife or else suffer severe dislocation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho put you up to this?\u201d you growled into her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho do ya think, B Man?\u201d she glowered up at you irritably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ivy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, when you see her next in Arkham, tell her that the city is still mine,\u201d you told her firmly, increasing the pressure much to her chagrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you...tell her...yourself?\u201d she squeezed out in between winces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching for your handcuffs with one hand, you\u2019re about to respond when Harley suddenly lifts both legs up to the wall surface, pushing you back a few steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a startling feat of agility, she literally walks up the wall until she had just enough leverage to backflip overhead and escape your vice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding behind you, Harley takes just a second to steady herself as you twirl around to meet he-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUggghhhh\u2026\u201d Your head snaps to the side as she surprises you with a swift roundhouse right to the jaw, the top of her foot painfully smacking against your chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaggering backwards up against some trash cans, you cradle your jaw with one hand as she even does a mocking bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetcha didn\u2019t see that coming, huh Bats?\u201d she taunted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf of you thought that was pretty cool, and the other half just wanted to punch her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll take more than that to beat me,\u201d you snarl at her, standing up with your fists clenched and ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d she chirped happily, before suddenly pointing behind you. \u201cThat\u2019s why I brought her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cNgggghghhhhhh\u2026.\u201d </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react in time, an overwhelming sensation entered your body: electrocution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, the flow of electricity swept throughout your armored body, filling your veins up with massive surges of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost instantly crumbled to the ground as the overwhelming volts of electricity discharged throughout you suit, lighting up every inch of your body with a blinding pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a disorienting, paralyzing feeling that had immobilized your entire being, made worse by Harley Quinn\u2019s mocking laughter from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck!</i> Too weakened to even register the clicking sound of high heels coming around your side, you could barely even breathe with your nervous system now on complete shutdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about that for a, <i>shocking </i>cliffhanger. Get it?\u201d Quinn\u2019s immature voice rang in one ear, before going out the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your head throbbing in pain, and your vision wasn\u2019t doing so well either, you had to know who this mysterious assailant was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould we bring him to Ivy?\u201d the woman spoke, her true voice hidden through a masculine voice modulator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I wanna have fun with him first. I heard through the grapevine that ol\u2019 Bats is <i>all </i>kinds of kinky,\u201d Harley responded in a seductive purr. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou conjured up just enough strength to make out the feminine yet curvy figure, the attacker still proudly brandishing the taser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in an all-black catsuit, she wore a mask that completely covered her facial features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2026?\u201d You couldn\u2019t even finish the sentence, before the pain once again took hold of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot now, Bats. We don\u2019t want to ruin the surprise.\u201d Harley made her presence known by kicking you rather painfully in the sides, forcing you back down to the floor with a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand perched on her hip, the masked woman merely looked on as her apparent partner-in-crime continued to taunt the downed Dark Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile I\u2019ve got you down there, what do you think of my new pedicure?\u201d Harley teased you, proudly presenting her bare feet and sleek black painted toes before your grimacing expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to verbalize your contempt for being in such proximity with a woman\u2019s bare feet, you simply stare at the woman, curious even in your current state as to her true identity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I got these piggies done just for you. Mistah J never did pay much attention to \u2018em but- <i>hey!</i>\u201d Realizing where your true attention was at, Harley grabbed you by your artificial ears and forced you to stare at her wriggling digits. \u201cYa better get used to seeing these bad boys up close and personal, Batman, \u2018cause you\u2019re gonna get <i>real </i>acquainted with them real soon.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit frightened by her ominous tone, you continue to stare down on them, oblivious to the mysterious woman raising her booted foot up above your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNighty-night, Bats!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, her boot connected with the back of your head, rendering your world black. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't know what this is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Detective, just because there are no signs of brutality doesn't mean there was none\", you say with confidence. \"Can you give me a moment with the crime scene?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course\", Gordon says, turning to him men. \"You heard Batman, clear out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are audible murmurs of disapproval from the other cops as they clear the scene. They must feel somewhat useless being told to step away and let somebody else do their job. You enter the room and just as Detective Gordon described, you see three bodies laying motionless on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, I'm detecting three bodies with vital signs showing no pulse and no breathing. I'm unable to detect any signs of life now that the room has been cleared\", Alfred's voice reports into your left ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Alfred. Switching to thermal scanner now. Let's see if anything touched these men\", you say as you think out loud. The thermal scan should show any traces of residual body heat on surfaces, concluding their bodies. As the scanner comes active, a shiver runs up your spine. It appears the bodies have foot prints all over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They..... They were trampled?\" you ask yourself out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, if I may\", Alfred interjects. \"If they were trampled there would be signs of blunt force trauma on the bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that means... They had feet on them, but not attacking them\", you confirm. This seems to raise more questions that it asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room you cannot see any signs of the individuals being subdued. You can only come to one of two conclusions; either they were forced to lay down at the feet or whoever attacked them using a non-physical method like being held at gun point, or being blackmailed, or possibly even seduced. But the foot prints do not answer the question of how these men actually died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove a gadget from your belt and flick it open, aiming it towards the air as you now scan for any abnormalities in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alfred, are you seeing this?\" You ask him, as you see a very peculiar reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, I do indeed...\" </span></div></div>",

Money? They had families, loved ones,\u201d you growled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo bad,\u201d she smiled happily, infuriating you even more. \u201cBank account\u2019s not gonna fill itself, sweetie.

All I had to do was dress like a naughty girl, maybe tease a little\u2026\u201d She lifted up her hem of her dress seductively before continuing, \u201cAnd they were just salivating like little doggies for the opportunity to try me out.

You would do anything to get with her, so of course you respond the only way any straight man in your situation would. \"Name the stakes then\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you pay $50 to take 1 shot from right here\", she motions to a spot on the ground with her foot, and that's when you notice... She is bare foot... You cringe slightly. \"If you make the shot, we go round the back and you get me for 5 minutes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" you say without a second though, reaching into your wallet and pulling out a crisp $50 note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on big boy, I didn't tell you what happens if you miss the shot,\" Lucie says, her mouth twisting into a sinister grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a consequence if I miss? I have never heard of a carnival game that punishes you for losing,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever heard of a carnival game where you get to fuck the staff member if you win?\" She says definitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you have a good point. What happens if I miss,\" you say eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of two things, you can choose. Either you empty that and give it all to me\", she says as she motions to your wallet. \"All the cash, credit cards, bank cards, pin numbers... The lot\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would never accept that, losing all your money over a carnival game with a hot girl? That's a serious bet! You're not that desperate! So you prompt her to continue. \"Or?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or...\", she continues. \"you can lick my feet clean for 5 minutes instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No way, that's disgusting!\" You say, unable to believe your ears. She wants you to lick her dirty feet clean? She has been walking around the carnival, you would never do that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, either all your money, and I do mean ALL of it... Or you lick these beautiful feet if mine clean\", she says. The last thing you would call anybody's feet is beautiful... As you're thinking, she continues. \"But who cares, you will make the shot right? You won't miss anyway. Then I am all yours! So what do you say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her body again. She is easily the hottest girl you have ever laid eyes on - even hotter than Jessica -  you can't pass this up... Plus you've got a basketball scholarship, she doesn't know that you can make this shot with ease! Then your eyes shift down to her dirty bare feet again. All of your money or licking her bare feet... That's a BIG bet to make. What do you do? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The thought that you won't be repulsed by her feet goes instantly out of the window when she crosses over her long, sexy legs and reveals how dirty each of her bare soles are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five minutes...\" You say, gulping nervously and wishing you had never played her ridiculous game in the first place. \"How should I...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down on your knees,\" she clicks her fingers at you in an authoritative manner. You sense that this isn't the first time she's had a guy at her feet, voluntarily or not!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five minutes started yet?\" You grimace as you kneel before her, staring up awkwardly, wishing the ordeal could be fast forwarded in a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling again and shaking her head from side to side she puts a finger over her luscious lips. \"Stop talking, little boy. I'm in control now, not you. You should learn to accept your place - as an insignificant bug at my feet! You will wish that you begged and kissed my feet the moment you laid eyes on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words trigger something in you but you're too in fear and humiliated to locate it. Deciding to stay quiet, you merely nod, hoping that it will all be over soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First you need to smell my feet...\" She smirks at you, lifting up one leg and hovering her dirty bare sole up so it is mere inches from your reluctant face. You can make out the grime and grass stains covering her arches; admittedly, her foot is shapely and as feet go is far from gross! What makes it gross is the filth covering it! \"Smell, little boy!\" She repeats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to play her game, you lean forward slightly so that you can take a whiff of her sole. It isn't as bad as you thought. In fact, without all the dirt and mud, it wouldn't smell unpleasant at all! Lucie chuckles as she swaps feet, waiting expectantly for you to smell the other foot, which you do. Again, getting this over with as soon as possible is your priority right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK...now you've shown some actual respect, little boy, the five minutes can begin. I want <i>long</i> licks from your tongue. Oh, I forgot to say...each of my feet need to sparkly and shiny...if they're not after 5 minutes, then you will have to keep on licking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is getting ridiculous now! You've humiliated yourself enough to literally bow down to her and smell her bare feet...accepting this latest demand would be pandering to her ego....what else will she make you do?! Then again, the sooner you get it over with the better...</span></div></div>",

What the hell was going on? You <i>HATE</i> feet! You've always hated them! That time your stupid cousins, Celina and Yasmine, double-teamed you and forced you to paint their toenails...you thought you would vomit! Maybe it's Goddess Lucie....maybe she is SO sexy that your attraction to her has overcome her feet....clearing your throat, you attempt to say something to save some slither of pride but she holds a hand up in front of you, shaking her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, little boy.

Or how about we take a little walk around The Carnival together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of licking her feet does not appeal. Yes, you had a hard-on before, but that could have been the fact that you were just simply turned on by Goddess Lucie herself, rather than her feet specifically.

Ever since you were little, they ganged up on you and it's only in the last few of years that you've become too physically strong for them to even consider overpowering you. The last time you saw them, at a family BBQ, they used every opportunity they could to tease you, until you snapped and got a telling off from both their and your Mom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....don't...get...\" Your words are still stifled but a glare from Goddess Lucie is enough to force you to stay quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you girls. Your cousin here - he lost a bet. He bit off more than he can chew. Now he needs to lick my feet clean! Turns out that it's good news for him - he likes it\" Goddess Lucie states calmly and matter-of-factly. The twins' eyes widen as they glance down to your throbbing member, unfortunately a clear pants tent standing to attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twin girls walk around you so that they can get a better look. Their expressions are ones of disbelief, soon turning to glee as they let out giggles. \"So this is what you get up to in your spare time! It's been, like, a year...wow what a year you've had!\" Celina says, smirking at you and exchanging a look with Yasmine, who has a mirrored expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Mom said you were going to a college with a \"stellar reputation\". Did she get the right cousin?!\" Yasmine giggles, a look on her face so infuriatingly smug that you feel some anger begin to boil inside you. Arching your head back so that you can try to get out of this crazy situation, all fight evaporates away after a stern look from Goddess Lucie and a wiggle of her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde beauty giggles along with your twin cousins, clearly enjoying seeing you squirm. \"Well, much as we're all enjoying this family reunion, Ethan here as some work to do. You girls are willing to stay of course. Or would you rather play on the basketball challenge for a while - it will be just you two - interrupted until Ethan and I are done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to protest, but find yourself at a total loss for words this time. You are under Goddess Lucie's thrall so much that you feel weak and helpless to do anything about the situation you are in. Desperately, you hope that they will quickly get out of here, and somehow cut you some slack...not mention this to anyone...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the exactly the same time, the twins exchange glances, sly smiles appearing on their cute faces...</span></div></div>",

That may be the worst thing here - that you can't even pretend that you're hating this! The truth is that Goddess Lucie holds power over you; it's impossible to deny that now. Gazing at the bare foot in front of you, you swallow your pride and lean forward a little so that you sticky tongue comes into contact with her heel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a good slave,\" Goddess Lucie purrs seductively, while your cousins watch on in fascination. \"Girls, watch and learn - this is how you take advantage of boys. Make them realise how inferior they are to you. Don't ever let them forget how grateful they should be, just being in your presence. Little Ethan here is just a plaything to me...he's never going to be man enough to have me - and he knows that. This is all he'll get...and all he'll ever need...\" Her powerful, dominant tone makes all three of you strongly quiet as you feel no choice but to slowly drag your tongue along her bare sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sole admittedly soft and velvety, the sensation of licking it far, far more pleasurable than you could ever imagine. Caressing her bare foot with your tongue is a brand new experience for you, like tasting a completely new meal that you did not know existed. However, you also have to contend with the fact that there is dirt and grime now covering your tongue, the taste of which is less pleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry slave,\" Goddess Lucie says softly, as though reading your thoughts. \"Once the dirt's removed, you can enjoy them fully...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimly, you recall this being a 5 minute deal, yet that is washed away with your continued licking of Lucie's foot, as you swirl and lavish her arches and toes with your now moistened tongue. Over the tops of her toes, you can make out Celina and Yasmine's expressions, both smug and gloating, which is mortifying of course. But you are so seduced by Lucie and her feet that you can just about ignore them. Unfortunately, Yasmine begins talking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love your accent, Lucie,\" she says to the blonde woman. \"British accents are so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Goddess Lucie beams, while tapping her toes appreciatively. \"And you both...your accents are American of course, but your heritage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lebanese,\" Celina replies. \"Mom's from Lebanon - lived here most of her life though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, exotic,\" Goddess Lucies coos. She suddenly catches your tongue with her big and second toe. \"Slave, you need to slow down. Longer licks - I want ALL of the grass stains removed on this foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth cousins giggle at how increasingly meek and servile you have become. \"Yeah, it's cool, having another country to be from, y'know? Ethan...sorry, I mean your <i>slave</i> here...he used to tease us about it. He said we were terrorists who should wear burkhas, so no one would have to see our faces!\" Celina glares at you as she says this, though her dark eyes are still sparkling happily at your humbling experience. It's true - you did say that a few years ago. Though you didn't really mean it - it was only to retaliate against their verbal barbs at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So insulting...and uninformed,\" Lucie lets out a disappointed sigh at you. \"Slave, apologise to your cousins at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...Celina....sorry, Yasmine...\" You mumble, in between licks of Goddess Lucie's increasingly soft and dirt-free foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admit that they are superior to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...are...better than....me....\" You say, your voice cracking a little through this total prostrating of yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cousins laugh at you with disdain but you can tell they are pleased. Their expressions have turned from smugness to total victoriousness. If you had been a pretty 5-5 up until this point in your lives, the twins had suddenly scored around 100 points - an insurmountable lead that you could never claw back in a million years!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoroughly humiliated, you stay silent as Goddess Lucie continues to laugh at you with your cousins, finally switching feet. Like a pro, you swish and swirl your tongue around, removing all traces of dust, dirt and grass stains from her soft, now flawless looking sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really good at this!\" Goddess Lucie chuckles at you while she inspects her foot, nodding with approval with how clean it is, glistening with your saliva. \"You may be the best slave I've had yet!\" This sends your cousins into fresh bursts of laughter while you stare at the ground, too embarrassed to meet their eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Goddess Lucie decide to do with you next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I feel bad for you - you've never had the chance to experience your cousin's talents have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basketball? Yeah he's <i>OK</i> I guess...\" Celina says with some reluctance, a slightly annoyed look on her face for a moment until her countenance suddenly changes. \"Talents...oh....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean his...<i>other</i> talents...don't you?\" Yasmine giggles, as she also cottons onto what the blonde woman is referring to. Hehe...Ethan really does <i>hate</i> feet! Well, he used to at least...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember that time we made him paint our toe nails? That was, like, 4 years ago! You held his arms down, I sat on his stomach and pressed so hard on his chest with my feet! You sat on his head until he gave up and agreed to do it! We made him paint all 20 of our nails...it took him over an hour!\" Her twin responds, her eyes shining with enjoyment of this victory they held over you - the biggest one in the wars you'd had over the years...until today of course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYasmine lets out an even louder giggle, practically snorting. \"Oh, oh...what about when we were, like, 11 and we were play fighting in the park? I shoved one of my socks in his mouth while you put your tennis shoe over his nose until he nearly passed out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike you needed reminding of that! To be fair, being a whole year older and there being two of them, you never stood much of a chance against the twins. The last time they had tried to overpower you, you were nearly sixteen and much stronger by then. You almost pitied them for how easily you fought the twins off! Goddess Lucie joins in the laughter until she gently but firmly steadies the two girls either side of her. Bleakly, you realise that your boner is still not subsiding...trying your best to think of 'unsexy' thoughts, all you can focus is on is how much more you enjoyed licking feet then you EVER could have predicted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, girls!\" She squeezes their shoulders. \"Like I said, now you know what your cousin here is <i>really</i> good at, would you like to find out...first hand? Or should that be first <i>foot</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another bout of hysterics, while you stare dejectedly at the ground, wishing you could rediscover the swagger and self-confidence you possessed before kneeling to Goddess Lucie, you merely hope that the cousins will help you out a little here - you are family after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hope is diminished by Celina kicking off her flip flops and presenting each of her bare feet towards you, her legs crossed over so that her soles are only a little off the ground. <i>This just keeps getting better</i>, you sarcastically muse to yourself...they want you to actually crawl on your belly and lick Celina, your damned annoying cousin's feet, like an animal?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, slave,\" Lucie says, her voice back to its commanding, take-no-prisoners tone. \"You've proven that you're not a real man, but a good little slave. Your tongue was made for licking his superiors' feet! Feet like mine and your cousins! They've always been better than you...just accept it rather than prolong your humiliation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's right!\" Yasmine chips in, clearly loving that they have such a powerful ally. \"You always said your side of the family was better...well look at you now! Kneeling in front of us like the loser you are! We've always been better...you should be thanking us! Our Mom would love to see this...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick my feet, slave!| Celina giggles, looking down at you, a smirk plastered all over her admittedly pretty face...</span></div></div>",

Her heel feels immediately harder than Goddess Lucie's, but to be fair to your cousin her feet are pretty clean - only the faint layer of dust on her insole from where she wore her flip flops. <i>That figures,</i> you muse. The twins always used to boast about how they would have regular pedicures, massages, and various other treatments. Being high-maintenance girls, it made sense that their feet would be well-taken care of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin to drag your tongue slowly upwards, you can't quite believe this is happening. It's as though this is someone else, not you...like it's a dream that you know you're in but can't wake up from... Perhaps, admittedly, you have been harsh about feet. Goddess Lucie's were soft, attractive...no, in fact they were <i>beautiful</i>...! Celina's feet are almost as nice, to be fair. They taste slightly salty yet fragrant - some sort of sweet fruit like apricots spring to mind as you begin lapping your tongue up and down her sole, carefully removing the dust layer from the flip flop she had been wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't ever recall having a slave this easily broken! To go from being a cocky jerk who wanted to get into my pants, to this pathetic loser, lying on his belly and licking his cousin's feet...\" Goddess Lucie's words sting a little but not enough to stop you. Finding yourself enjoying licking Celina's feet more than you could ever expect to, you find yourself sliding your tongue in between her toes, caressing her arches...absorbing any sweat that may be residing there and swallowing it dutifully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...you're right Lucie. He's good!\" Celina giggles, spreading her toes so that your mouth widens a little to accommodate them. \"I'm going to call you <i>foot slave</i>, from now on, loser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's got a nice ring to it!\" Goddess Lucie practically seems to beam from above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving to the half-Lebanese girl's other foot, you feel your erection is still throbbing more than ever. Why feet...why did Goddess Lucie have to make you lick her feet! It was if she knew! Couldn't it have been her ass, pussy... No, it <i>had</i> to be feet. Somehow the blonde sensed that about you and has now used it against you. However, your mental capacity to question what's happening to you is becoming increasingly blurred, and dulled by the fact that you are <i>enjoying licking feet!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Scrap that, enjoying licking your cousin's bare feet!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe timing could not have been worse...yet, without Goddess Lucie you would never have discovered this new world! This slightly salty, cheddar yet fruity and totally delicious world of feet! You can't help but let out a small moan of pleasure as you switch to Celina's other foot, making sure to remove the light layer of dirt first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth cousins tilt their heads back and laugh hysterically at your pathetic noise, as they wipe away tears of merriment, sighing with both satisfaction and amusement. They've won, there's NO doubt at that now. They hold this over you FOREVER! You'll simply have to skip every single family get-together... Then again, you find yourself wanting their feet more, accepting that this is something you clearly enjoy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more minutes of foot-bliss courtesy of Celina, you switch to Yasmine. Like her twin, there is a small amount of dirt on each sole, yet her feet are soft and very attractive. Her foot scent is a little distinct from Celina's - more like peaches...possibly mint too! Lavishing your tongue all over her sexy, slightly wrinkled soles as scrunches them, you find it impossible not to let out several more whimpers. Pleasure or defeat? Or both?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you have finished, your tongue is a little dry and the flavour of their feet - a heady cocktail of cheddar, sea salt and ripe fruit - is dominating your tastebuds. Yasmine casually wipes her wet soles on the back of your head, forcing your face to grind into the dirt. Your cock twitches a little, still rock hard. <i>That would be the icing on the cake...ejaculating in your pants in front of these women!</i> Fortunately nothing like that happens...for now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, girls...I hope you enjoyed!\" Goddess Lucie purrs from above you. \"Now I have some plans here for my little slave here. But there's no immediate hurry...do you want to play with him for the next couple of hours? As long as he's back here by 9pm, then that's all good for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do the twins decide? Have they had their fun with you for now or do they want to 'enjoy' their new foot slave at The Carnival for the next two hours?</span></div></div>",

After a few minutes they return to where you are lying, belly down on the ground still, Goddess Lucie now standing victoriously over you as though you were a defeated rival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll play!\" Yasmine tells the blonde woman enthusiastically. \"And don't worry - he'll be back by 9pm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" Goddess Lucie suddenly uses one bare foot to roll you over, causing all three women to laugh mercilessly at the sight of your pants tent, still at fall mast. Staring down at you, a gloating smirk on her face, she speaks directly at you. \"Just remember, slave, <i>you can never escape</i>. Now you've submitted to me, you're powerless! I am <i>utterly irresistible to you.</i>. My eyes see straight into your soul; you just can't escape my gaze...<i>you're fucked, slave</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Lucie's words speak volumes - with every syllable and pout of her gorgeous lips, you find yourself falling deeper and deeper under your spell until you find yourself practically trembling before her. It doesn't seem so important that your brat cousins are here to witness your downfall and total capitulation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgeous blonde suddenly places a bare foot, fully clean from your licking over your lips, her slender toes tapping your forehead. \"As a reward for your surrender, slave, you can touch yourself. Now, we don't want you walking around The Carnival with that loaded weapon...well, small handgun at least! Girls, come over here so you can see your cousin humiliate himself even more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowerless to resist you find yourself reaching a quivering hand over to your pants tent. Goddess Lucie slides her foot down your face so that you can make out her sexy, imperious features. Both Celina and Yasmine join her so that they can witness your total debasement at the foot of your conquerer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell your cousins how much you love my feet, slave,\" Goddess Lucie commands as you begin to slowly rub your hand against your crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...love your f-feet...\" You say feebly, your voice cracking a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And tell them how much you love their feet, too!\" She says with authority. \"Girls - hold one foot each in the air!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins happily oblige, each holding a petite and admittedly, very cute bare sole over you at an angle so you can see both their feet and gloating faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...love...y-your feet....tooo...\" Feeling yourself already arriving towards climax, you nearly close your eyes in both utter pleasure as well as abject embarrassment. It is a strange but alluring concoction, feeling so turned on but humiliated at the same time. You've never experienced anything like this, having always been an alpha, always a guy who would be making a girl crumble and fawn over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot anymore though! You feel yourself surrender your heart and mind to Goddess Lucie; she is beyond perfection - a higher being who deserves constant tribute and adoration. You cringe slightly at the thought of even considering trying to lay her...you are a grateful slave at her...and your cousins' feet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell us that we're better than you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...b-better....than m-me....thank yoooouuuuu....\" Is the last thing you can splutter out before your cock begins to spasm and you shoot your load all inside your pant, staring up in both horror and pure adulation at the three woman towering above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few blissful moments of calm, your ears are suddenly aware of the derisive laughter and whooping from Goddess Lucie and your cousins. As guilt begins to set in, the blonde stunner suddenly orders the twins to hold you down, which they do happily, delighted at the fact where they can physically overpower you once again. As Celina sits on your belly, her feet planted firmly on your chest, Yasmine proceeds to sit on your face, pert ass burying your nose and her soles in contact with the back of your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Lucie returns moments later, laughing and sighing to herself. \"Well, this should do the trick.Controlled by a remote too so our little slave here doesn't have second thoughts... Let him up girls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you realise why she instructed your cousins to pin you down. In her hands, with perfectly manicured nails of course, is a pink, spiked dog collar. Goddess Lucie knows that post-ejaculation, you may have some feelings of doubt, of resistance... Holding an arm of yours each, you automatically begin to struggle. If that remote-controlled collar goes over your neck, you are well and truly fucked for life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her do it, <i>foot slave</i>, accept that you're just a little bitch now! Like you said before you splinted your load while staring at our feet...we're better than you...!\" Celina whispers in your ears, sending both shivers down your spine and a feeling of desperation begin to bubble over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you resist this and fight back, despite the odds? Or do you simply accept that you are a slave to Goddess Lucie and any woman she allows to play with you from now on?</span></div></div>",

She lifts her arm signalling for the attendant's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant is a really attractive young woman with dyed silver hair.  She looks like a model. You blush embarrassed to be shown being led around on a leash in front of someone so beautiful. You suspect that your cousins chose to stop there for that exact reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your relief, the attendant pays no attention to you. Instead she gives the twins a warm smile. \"Hey ladies. Interested in trying your hand at this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Celina said shrugging. In truth she felt a little disappointed her initial attempt to humiliate you in public wasn't met with more of a reaction from the woman behind the counter but she just chalked it up to the attendant's professionalism. The attendant seemed friendly enough though perhaps she could be convinced to dominate you later once the two of you became more familiar with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYasmine shared her sisters sentiments. \"How much?\" She asked continuing the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"$2 a game though it is free if you get your slave to participate.\" There's a playful glint in eyes as she says that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins seem delighted at her acknowledging your position though all three of you are surprised by her casualness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant just smiles. \"Slaves being shown around the carnival is not an unusual occurrence. This place is designed to torture arrogant males and make them feel as pathetic as possible. In fact the games here are all set up to lower their self esteem and degrade them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth your cousins smile at this. \"That's Perfect.\" Celina says. She pauses as she realizes she doesn't know the attendant's name yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant smiles. \"You can call me Bunny\" She reaches over and touches your nose lightly.  \"Although that will be Goddess Bunny to you Slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pleasure\" Yasmine says taking a moment to introduce herself and her sister. \"I do want to double check on the free game option though.

Are there any catches to this that we should be aware of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Bunny shakes her head. \"Nothing that the two of you have to worry about.\" She explains. \"That said the slave does have to suffer a penalty if he loses... an added humiliation on his part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat revelation fills you with anxiety but the twins seem happy with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelina grins. \"That works for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering that you're still dealing with the consequences of the previous carnival competition you competed in, you're not eager to try participating in another one but you're not given a choice as Yasmine pushes you forward volunteering you for this new game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the game you are playing?  </span></div></div>",

Moles pop up from various holes on the game board and the player whacks them with a mallet to score points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Celina and Yasmine nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Bunny continues. \"This carnival has a special variation of that game for slaves.\" She motions for the three of you to come behind the counter. You notice the floor is set up like a giant whack a mole  board with 9 holes in the floor. \"Our version is called stomp a mole.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sense where this is going and grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough the attendant confirms your fears. She presses a button underneath the counter and the floorboards shift aside. A chair emerges in the center of the room. You notice restraints on the arms and legs of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat slave.\" Goddess Bunny instructs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cousins give you sharp glance and you sheepishly do as instructed not wanting to receive another jolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Bunny locks you into place securing you to the chair. \"Mechanisms underneath this seat are designed to raise or lower this chair and shift it around.\" She explains. \"We've programmed them to make his head pop out of these holes at random.\" She smiles playfully as she looks at your cousins. \"The goal of the game is to step on his him as many times as possible within 5 minutes. 10 points are awarded for each time a foot successfully connects with his face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth your cousins are thrilled by this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome.\" Celina says laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It gets better.\" Goddess Bunny informs them. \"Should you manage to beat the top score you'll be awarded with our prize of the day.\" She tells them. \"In this case... a pair of diamond earrings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth twins eyes go wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!!!\" Yasmine says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're so going to try for that.\" Celina agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at the scoreboard and notice the High score is above 1500. That basically means you would have to be stepped on over 150 times. <i>Great</i>, you think, you're stuck getting trampled while your cousins get a shot of the prize. <i>The day just keeps getting worse and worse</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow Goddess Bunny manages to top even that . \"Don't think you'll be just sitting this out slave.\" She informs you. \"It is not like we would let your owners do all the work.You'll need to participate in this too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her curious and she elaborates. \"Slaves are expected to worship their superiors so make sure you kiss their feet at every opportunity. This game awards 5 points each time for every successful kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better try your hardest Footslave,\" Celina threatens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... if we miss out on Diamond earrings because of you... I'm going to shock you so much people would be able to charge their phones off of you.\" Yasmine agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Bunny laughs. \"Seems like you have a lot of incentive to help your cousins win\" she tells you. She turns to the twins  \"Ready to get started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth twins nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Bunny presses a button and your chair lowers under the level of the floor. The floor boards slide closed above you and you are left waiting nervously for the game to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich of your cousins decides to compete?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You'll be able to score points faster and it would be so much more humiliating for the slave to have two sets of feet trampling his face at once.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth twins grin. \"Sure!\" They agree simultaneous. They both kick off their flip flops and stand to the side of the floorboards preparing themselves for the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Bunny flashes them a playful smile. \"Ready?\" She asks. As the twins nod she presses a button starting the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA timer begins counting down and you feel the chair you are sitting in being lifted pushing your head towards an opening in the floor. You hear a giggle and look up just in time to see Celina's bare foot connect with your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whap!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a slight amount of pressure of her sole in your face before you are pushed back down. There's a ringing sound as the scoreboard is updated. As the game determines her foot making contact with you, the chair you are sitting in drops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering Goddess Bunny instruction you pucker your lips and just manage to graze Celina's foot with them before you pulled under the floor again moved around and pushed up at another location. This time Yasmine's foot steps on you lightly slapping your face with the sole of her foot. You manage to give it a kiss before being pulled down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continues again and again as you are pulled down and pushed up at different locations only to be stepped on over and over by your cousins while you attempt to kiss their soles. Due to the randomness of the game, you never know whose feet to expect. Sometimes they belong to Celina while other times Yasmine's feet are the ones to greet you. They also alternate between their right and left feet quite a bit since they use whichever foot is closest to you at the time to step on you. It does wind up providing a limited amount of variation to your ordeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins are actually pretty good at the game. Their strategy going into this challenge was to divide up the floor between them with Celina guarding the right side and Yasmine guarding the left and it seems to be paying off. They are able to move quickly and their feet are often right there to push you back down the second your face starts to emerge. You rarely get to see anything else besides the soles of their feet coming towards your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do what you can to help your cousins... looking up and craning your neck to give them easier access to your face and puckering your lips in advance to ensure you kiss their feet as they step on you. In the back of your mind, you're aware of how degrading this is. Kissing your cousins feet as they trample and abuse you has to be a new low for you and judging the twin's laughter above you, you have no doubt that you look as pathetic as you feel. At the same time you really want them to win this. It is easy to rationalize this by saying that you're trying to avoid getting punished by them but you can't deny that part of you likes submitting to them. You're even starting to enjoy getting trampled by them. Being under their feet feels surprisingly natural to you and you like the feel of their soles dominating your face.  It is like Goddess Lucy rewired your brain to think like a slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the clock gets below the 2 minute mark, the game starts to speed up and you suddenly find yourself jolted up and down much more quicker as the challenge of the game increases. The rapid motion starts to get really disorienting. Your cousins wind up getting rougher with you as well as they attempt to adjust to the new tempo. Their feet smack and kick you as they scramble to step on you in time. You begin have trouble keeping track of whose feet are whose. Timing your kisses also becomes a lot trickier. The challenge only gets harder as the speed of the game continues to increase as the clock winds down. The end of the game becomes a blur of tanned feet feet stepping on you over and over again. You do your best to make sure your kisses connect with whatever foot flashes against you face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you hear a buzzer sound closing out the game. You feel your chair lift out of the floor as the challenge ends. Since your vision was mostly obscured by feet during the challenge you're not sure how you did. It seemed like your cousins stepped on you a lot and you think you did a pretty good job with the kissing but you are not sure if it was enough to win. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the outcome?</span></div></div>",

I can reveal that your score was one thousand...\" Bunny pauses for dramatic effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically exploding with anticipation, the twins simultaneously look down at you for a moment as if telling you clearly <i>'this is all on you!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight hundred and fifty five!|\" The ashen-haired girl finishes with a flourish. Phew, they won! Not only did they win, but they actually smashed the score.

Such is their excitement that their bare feet land several times on your weary face, while they whoop and cheer, continuing to celebrate on the whack a mole floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, girls,\" Goddess Bunny chuckles, before finally assisting them in getting down from the game area, giving them each a high-five as they do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...when do we find out? I mean, no-one's gonna beat that, right?\" Celina enquires, giggling excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what,\" Bunny muses, bending down to release you finally from the constraints. \"Crawl!\" She orders you, as you meekly shuffle on all fours towards your cousins, who laugh derisively at how pathetic you are. \"As that score was SO high, I honestly can't see it being beaten today. So you win! Congratulations ladies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half-Lebanese girls stare for a few moments in shock at one another before shrieking and hugging each other once more, grabbing each other by the shoulders, spinning around in circles until they nearly stumble over you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad slave!\" Yasmine shakes her head at you with disappointment, pressing the shock button, making you yelp in pain. Knowing better than to fight them, you meekly stare at the ground, your body twitching in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man, you really do hate your cousins!</i> Yes, they overawed you with the help of Goddess Lucie, but they would NEVER have done so without her! Having this collar and remote is just so unfair...you hate the fact even more that you enjoyed licking their feet and even during the whack a mole, admittedly liked the feel of their feet on your lips. What the hell has Goddess Lucie done to you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly thought suddenly crosses your mind. Goddess Bunny only mentioned a pair of diamond earrings - not two! This could cause a rift in the twins...they could fight...you could escape...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading behind the stand to fetch something, this fact seems to be lost on your airhead cousins' brains. While they breathe heavily from all of the excitement, Celina looks down at you and pouts. \"Oh slave, thanks for getting all of those kisses in! I mean, it probably added on a good hundred points or so... Yeah, we would've won without you. But well done anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo ungrateful, so arrogant...but you don't dare say a word to the twins. Bunny appears a few moments.

So it is with nervous anticipation as you watch the pretty twins glaring at one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelina takes a breath. \"Let me make this simple for you. I stamped on his face more - each of those was worth 10 points. Even if you did get more kisses from him, I scored more points than you. So hand them over!\" Celina holds out a hand expectantly, her cute face looking both steely and confident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. I scored more points! We can go back and ask Bunny if you really want to!\" Yasmine states, still in a calm tone and now with her hands on her hips. \"Bunny obviously agrees that's why she gave the earrings to me. Anyway, what shall we do now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words trickle away as her twin suddenly lunges forwards and makes to wrest the diamond earrings away. Yasmine cries out in surprise and anger as the precious jewellery drops to the ground. Darting forwards, she snatches them out of her sister's grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! They're mine...MINE!\" She says with triumph while Celina snarls at her. Yasmine's eyes widen as her twin practically jumps on her, scrabbling at her hands in an attempt to get at the earrings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give them...give them!\" She yells, trying to slam Yasmine's wrists onto the ground to release the prize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching them with increasing enjoyment, everything is going exactly as you hoped! It only gets better when the remote control drops and rolls several feet away from them. Gradually inching on all fours, you make your way slowly towards where the device is on the ground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me!\" Yasmine shouts angrily, causing a few onlookers to pause and stare at the scene. \"You always have to have the best stuff! Just let me have them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting and struggling, the twins roll over several more times, bodies entangled and hair swishing around so that it's impossible to tell who's who! Several of the people in the crowd begin to chuckle; to be fair, that could be at your expense considering that you're adorned with a pink collar and on all fours still... One of the twins outstretched foot comes in dangerously close contact with your face, before swivelling away so both of their heads are in the opposite direction to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is it, this is your chance! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the remote, you begin shuffling slowly backwards so as not to be noticed before deciding to get the hell away from your cousins!

Beyond thrilled, they wave a cheery goodbye to Goddess Bunny, who matches their enthusiasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you ever get bored of your slave, send him to me, girls!\" The sexy woman tells your cousins, who giggle and assure them that they will in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, slave, you can rub our feet while we call our Mom and tell her about the earrings,\" Celina tells you casually, after walking over to a nearby bench, clicking her fingers at you sharply to take off their flip flops. Knowing you'd hate another electric shock from the collar, you comply quickly, sliding all four of their footwear so that you can massage your cousins' feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man, this is really the lowest point in your life. Rubbing Celina and Yasmine's feet while they chat to their Mom...!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDutifully rubbing gently, kneading your thumbs against their soft, now-familiar bare soles, you just manage to conceal a sigh of defeat - like the twins needed another reason to revel in your humiliation! They chat excitedly to their Mom, regaling her about the whack a mole game, the diamond earrings. You can't help but cringe as they begin to mention you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...please, don't...\" You weakly murmur up at them, still holding one of Yasmine's bare feet. Smirking down at you, the twins giggle once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, poor little slave!\" Celina says while Yasmine covers the receiver end of her phone. \"Tell you what...lick our feet here right here, with anyone walking past to see you and we won't tell Mom about how much we've made you into our bitch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, nervousness spreading through you, you know that either option is not desirable. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

Terrible as it is to be agreeing to this, you know that them telling their Mom - who loathes you as much as your cousins do - is not an option right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Yasmine's lips curl into a smirk. \"Ask to lick our feet like a good slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...er...please, please can I...<i>lick your feet</i>...\" You mutter more loudly, too dejected at how pathetic this is to look them in the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm.... <i>Better</i>, but I think you should <i>beg</i> us to lick our feet, slave!\" Celina chuckles, a look of malevolence about her as she sneers down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, your cousins are just the worst! \"Please, please....please let me...lick your feet!\" You try to sound strong and confident, but your voice cracks halfway through and you finish with more of a whimper. This causes both cousins to laugh down at you, high-fiving one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, OK slave!\" Yasmine mock pouts,  slipping her small, silky-smooth foot out of your hands and holding it in front of your face, toes wiggling teasingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that you're completely at their mercy, you close your eyes in defeat, sticking your tongue out and lapping it against her peach-scented sole, which is a little sweaty from all of the trampling on you during the whack a mole game. Swallowing thickly, you try your best to ignore the sound of laughter of a group of girls behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a loser!\" One of them calls out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he is. He's our foot slave!\" Celina says with triumph, using her bare foot to ruffle your hair. Fortunately, the girls seem to depart quickly and did not get to have a look at your face at least. You continue dutifully licking Yasmine's bare foot, cursing the fact that - once again - you are enjoying this! There's no doubt about it, Goddess Lucie has really done a number on you; she's got you from totally hating feet to actually...liking them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say thank you, slave,\" Celina orders you, as you switch over to Yasmine's other foot. \"And tell us who's better...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you...Yasmine....\" You murmur weakly, enjoying the slightly minty flavour of her foot, which you can now consider as sexy. Moving across to Celina's hovering bare feet, you give them each a meek kiss in the centre of the soles. \"Thank you, C-Celina...I...I....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words are muffled by Celina suddenly holding your nose between her big and middle toe. \"I don't remember saying you could kiss my feet, slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-soorrryyy....\" You whimper, while your nose feels like it could break at any moment. \"P-please...please let me k-kiss your feet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth twins giggle with excitement, their bodies twitching. \"Only if you call us 'Goddess Celina' and 'Goddess Yasmine' from now on....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...Goddess Celina, Goddess Y-Yasmine...sorry...ah!\" You let out a yelp as Celina finally releases your nose, spreading her toes and pointing at her feet, allowing you to now kiss them. \"Th-thank you Goddess Celina... Y-you both are...better than me...you a-always have been. Sorry for not seeing this b-before.... You w-win...\" You gasp, trying to ignore the fact that more people have walked past and stopped to stare at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is definitely more than just fear and embarrassment of your cousins having caught you at the feet of Goddess Lucie, this is becoming genuine adulation! You let out a whimper of defeat as you proceed to lick Celina's bare soles, lavishing your tongue all over them, enjoying them more and more with each taste. Again, they're similar to her twin's but more like strawberries...you can't deny how delicious your conquerer's feet are!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...we've really broken him!\" Yasmine says, her voice full of both gloating and surprise. \"I thought it was more about what Lucie was doing to you...how you clearly had a hard-on for her....but you, you actually <i>like this</i>, don't you, slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's the point in hiding it? Before you can reply, Yasmine's foot suddenly prods at your dick, giggling when you both realise how hard it is. \"Well, that's official then,\" Celina announces with triumph. \"We've actually turned him to our pathetic, willing slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well...\" A familiar voice rings out from behind you, making the three of you start a little in surprise.

So, you managed to make this worthless boy know his place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the twins exchange a glance before giggling. \"Yeah, well, Lucie - she had him on his knees, about to lick his feet... But, we <i>have</i> made him into our property... Anyway, who are you?\" Celina clearly impressed and bewildered by the other-worldly Goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that I am responsible. Responsible for all of this. You see, I created and shaped this world - this world that has centred around Ethan Price. Everything in The Carnival has been a test, a challenge, for him to face what he hates....and make him realise what an arrogant, despicable fool he really is. Let's say that I....<i>distorted</i> things, somewhat. I honestly thought it would take far, far longer; it's clear that the deep-seated resentment he feels for you both, clearly rooted in childhood, has sped up the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cousins look shocked as they look from you to Goddess Sasha. \"So...all of this stuff...everything here now is...isn't real?\" Yasmine chimes in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Sasha laughs softly. \"Oh, it's real all right. This slave here will remember everything. Unfortunately, when he is allowed to make the choice to seal his fate, you won't remember a thing - it is only me, him and my loyal lieutenants who will be aware of his experience at The Carnival, the moment I cursed him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Cursed him</i>...crap! You really should have known something was up - the moment that you met Goddess Lucie...when your cousins happened to appear at exactly the worst time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...this isn't real though. I mean, I don't really find my cousins' feet attractive...they won't remember any....OWW!| You recoil in gasp in pain after Yasmine suddenly sends a shock through your collar!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad slave!\" She scolds you, while Celina pushes a bare foot in your face, clamping her pretty toes over your nose. \"Let your superiors speak - shut the fuck up already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimper, which makes all three women giggle appreciatively. \"Very good,\" Goddess Sasha says with satisfaction. \"Anyway, I am here to offer this pathetic create a choice. I always believe in choice; it seals our destiny, our fate. It is essential to everything.... So, Ethan Price - once  a cocky, basketball captain with the world at his feet....now a snivelling, beaten creature at the feet of his cousins.... When I lift the curse, what will it be - serving me and my lieutenants at The Carnival or accept your place in life as a mere plaything to your pretty cousins here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelina removes her foot from your face, allowing you to take a couple of deep breaths before making your decision....</span></div></div>",

Such smug looks would once infuriate you but you've learned to accept them this evening, accept your place as their loyal servant! Objectively, your cousins are gorgeous, even if they do share the same blood as you. Even that's questionable though - their Mom's genes seem to have evidently passed down to them, whereas yours - from your Mom's brother, seem to have barely featured in the gene selection. Fitting, really!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Sasha seems narrows her eyes at you, a look of disappointment on her face. \"You really choose them over me? Deciding to be a willing slave to your own flesh and blood? Well, you deserve every ounce of humiliation that you're about to receive! Congratulations, girls. This pathetic excuse for a man will serve you, for as long as you decide to use him. Now, you will not remember any of the events this evening...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis causes the girls to initially protest; they - and you - assume that all of their work in breaking you as their willing slave has come to nothing but the ethereal dark-haired woman assures them gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no - you misunderstand me, girls. When I lift this curse, your slave here will remember EVERYTHING! It will be a very easy, very rewarding process for you to break him. It doesn't matter that you'll be blissfully unaware of me, of Goddess Lucie, Whack-a-Mole - everything that this imbecile has been through this evening. When the curse is lifted, he will submit to you - he won't have a choice! It may take time but if this pathetic boy knows what's good for him, he'll be yours quickly and eagerly. If he doesn't, then what I'll put him through will make this evening's events look like a walk in the park!\" Goddess Sasha gestures emphatically, her foot raised and stamped onto the floor, making you nearly whimper aloud at the thought of her destroying you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right so...what do we do now? Are we gonna become, like, Goddesses?\" Celina eyes wide-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Sasha chuckles. \"Maybe with time, girls. There's nothing you need to do. It's been a pleasure knowing you...\" With that, she suddenly throws some powder into the air, causing you and your cousins to splutter and choke temporarily before a blinding light causes you to cover your eyes....</span></div></div>",

Looking around you, you're still at The Carnival, standing in a familiar part of it. Hang on, was this where attempted to win the basketball challenge? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this was all a dream, a hallucination....what if Goddess Sasha wasn't even real! Before you can articulate your thoughts clearly, you notice a small white card on the floor. Picking it up, your stomach sinks when you scan over the words...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i><b>Dear Ethan Price,<br>\r\nYou Have Chosen To Be A Slave To Your Own Cousins<br>\r\nYour Fate Is Sealed!<br>\r\nGoddess Sasha</b></i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it isn't our dear cousin!\" A sardonic voice rings out from behind you. Of course, Goddess Sasha would've made sure to drop you back in the real world with direct contact with your cousins! You turn around to see Celina glaring at you as she stands with her arms folded. Her twin, Yasmine, is standing by her side, looking equally hostile. \"It's our turn on the basketball challenge so back the hell off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling confused, you see that you're ahead of them in the queue for the challenge. However there's no Goddess Lucie in sight... is it true what Goddess Sasha said...do your cousins not even remember?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you?\" Yasmine says, a smile forming on her cute lips. \"It's been like a year, and you can't even say 'Hey' to us? Mom told us that you've got into that college, that you're all cocky about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's strange, but you see the twins in a totally different way than you did before this evening! Having enjoyed licking their feet, been shocked and bullied into submission by them...you can't help but stare down at the ground, at their feet...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, er, yeah...Sorry... I've got...I mean, I'm going to...\" You babble around your cousins, who start to smirk in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Mom must've been joking! You've like, lost ALL of your arrogance... I like it!\" Celina says deviously walking up to you, suddenly pushing you hard. Being bigger than her, that shouldn't have caused you to stumble and fall to the ground; of course, Yasmine darted behind you without you knowing - you just got owned!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally you would be snarling, getting up to your feet to take these two brats down, or at least giving them a piece of your mind. But you don't - you lie flat on your back, gulping nervously as they stand over you, grinning. <i>These girls own you....they may be your relatives, but you feel like a pathetic dog around them, eager to please them...keen to once again be at their feet!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally decided that we're better than you, huh?\" Celina giggles, a malevolent look about her. \"Kiss my foot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes..I mean... I ... I... Sorry...\" You find yourself puckering up instantly, loving the familiar flavour of her fruity bare sole. Although you regret this instantly, it did feel normal...automatic even to do so! After teasing you a little longer for being such a pussy, the girls decide to leave you alone, with the agreement that after the basketball challenge, you can buy them some food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it is approximately a month later that you find yourself lying on the floor of your own college dorm, both of your cousins' feet resting casually on your face, while they watch TV and eat snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe how easy it was breaking you!\" Celina comments, tapping your nose thoughtfully with her toes. \"All those years of being a pain in our asses...I guess, it was really that you lusted for us - your own cousins...and the fact that you're into feet...<i>what a fucking foot freak</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins decided not to wait until September to pay you a visit. The very next day after The Carnival, they couldn't resist popping over to your folks' place, on the pretence that they wanted to spend some 'family time' with you over the Summer. It didn't take long for them to physically overpower you; you didn't even resist as they excitedly took you down, shoving their feet in your face....before being both shocked and delighted when they noticed that this turned you on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor most of the two months Summer Vacation, you barely saw your friends. After a while, even Casey gave up calling, messaging or trying to see you. Instead, you became Celina and Yasmine's willing servant - just as Goddess Sasha decreed. Even if you weren't terrified of invoking the ethereal woman's wrath, it's doubtful that you would have been able to stand up to the twins anyway! Of course, the twins knew nothing of Goddess Sasha or any of the 'magic bullshit' that you tried explaining to them. They just loved using you as a foot rest, toe nail painter, shopping carrier and general gopher boy to them. It's been impossible to resist them...you get so turned on by their feet; you've lost count of the number of times you've ejaculated in your pants, or jerked off at night to the thought of your cousins' gorgeous feet! Yes, they are technically related to you, but they seem so much like their Mom and so different in looks to you, that it doesn't feel as incestuous as it should!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir Mom doesn't know the ins and outs of your downfall, but seems to be aware that the twins hold the upper hand. She happily allows them to boss you around, making them drinks, fixing them snacks...even massaging their feet while they watch TV! Your parents don't seem to mind either - they see it as a positive that this 'family time' has made you a lot closer to your cousins. If only they knew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Goddess Celina,\" You meekly reply, kissing each of her toes with reverence, which causes her to sigh with satisfaction. For a while now, the twins have insisted on you calling them that, which is fitting considering this is all down to Goddess Sasha!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...tonight, we're going to party with the basketball team... Whoops... I forgot that you're not technically on it!\" Yasmine giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true - after failing to turn up for the first couple of practice sessions, despite your sports scholarship, you were thrown off the team. Of course, this was due to your cousins visiting you during your first week, making sure that you had some time with their feet instead of going to the basketball sessions and actually making friends! Plus, having been humiliated by Goddess Lucie during the challenge at The Carnival, plus how out of practice you are, you've lost so much self-confidence in your abilities! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" the beautiful half-Lebanese girl continues, \"You can stay here like a good slave. If you ask us <i>really</i> nicely, and we decide not to get laid and stay over at some other freshman's place, then you get to lick our feet while we sleep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...p-please...\" you whimper, unabashed at how pathetic you sound. \"Please...I would...love to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelina wipes her foot in your face a few times, enjoying seeing the both discomfited yet longing look on your face. \"Oooh, I like it when you beg! Do it some more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you do, and of course the best you get from your owners is a \"Maybe!\" Either way, you will be making breakfast and waiting on the girls hand-and-foot the next day. You were secretly hoping that the girls will allow you to tag along for drinks - the basketball guys look down on you but admit that you've got 'Hot Cousins'. You could scrape your way into getting another tryout...maybe, actually, if the twins lay one or more of them, maybe that would help you get another shot at the team...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's useless anyway. You'll never be accepted, not since they saw you carrying endless pairs of shoes that you've spent your student loan money on during the first week at college. You're a joke; you've never been that academic so are barely getting by in classes as well. That sports scholarship was why you came here after all! Still, you can't help but admit that you're excited every time you're around your cousins and their beautiful feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cousins themselves are looking to apply to the same college as you, since they've used you to do several remedial papers for them. Hey, maybe there'll get bored of you after that as they'll have their own room and their own reason to be at college, other than to dominate you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour, you meekly paint your cousins' toenails. Finally, when they are immaculately done, you are allowed to lick from heel to toe on each of their bare soles as a reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, slave! Maybe if you give each of our shoes a good clean with your tongue, then that will be good practice for IF you get to lick our feet later tonight!!\" Celina calls cheerily after you before the two girls leave your room, dressed to the nines, looking stunning in small black dresses and heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's face it, even if the twins tire of you, you'll never tire of their gorgeous feet! Hopefully they'll let you visit them, or come round to let you be their foot rest, or allow them to paint their nails... They're both your conquerors yet somehow your liberators! Shocking as it sounds, you've fully accepted your place as their willing foot slave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no doubt about it, Goddess Sasha has orchestrated this - what a transformation she has achieved! If only you had paid her that hundred dollars...man - knowing what's happened to you - you could have leant forward and kissed her feet in respect! Then again, who could have predicted how addicted to Celina and Yasmine's feet you would have become! </span></div></div>",

But I'm pretty sure I already gave you a choice that got you away from your cousins. All you have to do is serve me and my lieutenants instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to be here forever.

Even if you were showing defiance in the face of her choices, the fact that you were being so meek and spineless about it made up for that. Perhaps this can work out even better. With Lucie and the twins already breaking in your new submissive nature, letting you choose your new mistress for life would destroy any remaining chance of you resisting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then Ethan Price, I am nothing if not merciful. Perhaps fate has other plans for you. I will expand upon your choice. You may choose any woman to be your mistress after I drop my spell.\" Celina and Yasmine try to object, only for Sasha to silence them before continuing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, should you choose anyone besides myself, my lieutenants, or your cousins, there will be an extra stipulation. If I discover that you are disobedient, or should your mistress try to free you, then I will bring you right back here and submit you to an eternal fate worse than any amount of feet. So I suggest you choose wisely.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much thought, you decide on...</span></div></div>",

What's going on here?\" You hear an all-too-familiar voice say behind you. \"What's that about being a slave to your bitchy cousins?\" You turn to see your friend Casey standing behind you with her hands on her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitchy, are we?\" Celina asks with a huff. \"Who the hell even are you anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait sis, I recognize her. She's Ethan's little tomboy friend from since he was five.\" Yasmine answers. \"Katie, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Casey you arrogant snob. Now what is goi...\" She starts only to be cut off by the twins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember that time when she tried to back up Ethan during one of his toenail-painting sessions...\" Celina starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only for us to overpower her too and make both of them paint our nails? I know, that was freaking hilarious.\" Yasmine finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. Far too often was Casey around when your cousins tormented you. She always tried to help you, but it almost always ended the same, with her getting caught and forced to share your fate. She's never shown any resentment towards you over it, in fact it gave you a shared hatred of your cousins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\" Casey clears her throat to get the twins' eyes back on her. \"What's going on here?\" She finishes from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you get the memo? Your buddy Ethan here got snagged in a little gambling trouble, and over a series of events has become our obedient little footslave for a while.\" Yasmine explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch.\" Celina starts. \"Slave, lick my feet.\" You initially hesitate at demeaning yourself in front of your closest friend, but when she pulled out that remote, your attitude changed quick as you lapped away. \"See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I saw. I saw you treaten to shock him if he didn't do what you said. Well I'm not going to take it. Let him go now, or else.\" Casey orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than the clich\u00e9 'or else what?', Yasmine smirks and says. \"How about a wager?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Casey asks, now confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty simple, actually. This all started by your friend here not handling his gambling, so why not have a gamble be what saves him? As it also just so happens, we just won these gorgeous diamond earrings you see over at that Whack-a-Mole game by getting the high score. So here's my thinking, you take Ethan over to the machine and play. If you beat out high score, we'll hand him over to you to do with as you please. But if you fail, then you join him at our feet.\" Celina speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, you could just drop the hero act and come sit next to us. Then you can enjoy our slave with us.\" Yasmine offers. Casey looked torn. She's been at their feet too often to let them do this to you, but she also knows firsthand how bad they can be, so would she risk herself for you once more?</span></div></div>",

Gritting her teeth, she ignores the fear and helps Ethan up, and begins taking him over to the whack mole machine while angrily speaking to Yasmine and Celina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, i'll take your challenge and beat both your records. You'll be sorry for putting him through this crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan shakes his head, not up for another round of the brutally degrading game but he trusts Casey enough to follow her anyways, willing to put up with anything to get away from his crazy cousins. Yasmine and Celina pace over to the two of them with an amused expression on their face, wanting to see their cousin so abused beneath his childhood best friend's feet, aware of how tough this would be for him. Once he was finally inside the machine, Casey begins to strip off her own shoes, revealing her cute beautiful rancid soles with damp white socks showing the outline of her feet. With a bit of struggling she manages to pull off her socks as well revealing her flushed sweat glistening beautiful barefeet. Standing up on the machine, she smiles down at Ethan and waits for the game to begin, wondering how she'll manage to beat the other two's record. Not only was she at a disadvantage because of their numbers but also they both were more aggressive. In order to beat them she'd have to go twice as hard at the very least. Despite the position her best friend was in, something about having a man in such a helpless position about to be stepped on did bring a sort of thrill in her that she's never felt before and wanted to explore more.</span></div></div>",

Towering above her friend, she braces herself, knowing she'd have to go a lot harder to beat his cousin's record. As much as she hated it, she knew she'd have to go hard and brutal otherwise she'd end up just like him, tortured beneath their feet. Hearing the bell ring, Casey quickly sprung into action, lightly stepping down on Ethan's face as soon his head popped up, smacking down with surprising accuracy. Though Ethan didn't feel much pain, he still felt disgusted by the degrading task as Casy's sole made contact with his lips. Still he did his best to plant submissive kisses all over her soles but it felt so out of place and demeaning letting his best friend humiliate and abuse him in such a manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasey however seemed to have the opposite feeling as she stepped down on Ethan, feeling a odd sense of empowerment and drive that she's never felt before. Her kicks and stomp became more rapid and rougher, creating light foot prints along his face as she became more thrilled with the empowering feeling she had over her friend. This only made Ethan become more concerned, feeling his face take more hits and get more bruises from Casey's sweaty feet, finding them even more intense then his cousins, making him cry out in disgust from the pain and intense odor invading his senses as her toes smacked down on his sensitive nose, feeling more submissive to her assertive kicks. Before she knew it, the game ended and Casey found that she had managed to beat both Yasmin and Celina's record which was a welcomed surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYasmin and Celina seemed a bit shock but not in a bad way. They never imagined Casey would be so willing to demean Ethan and so brutally. It's almost like she awakened a dominate bitchy side of her that would get along so well with them. They may even be able to use this to their advantage and have a new friend they could turn against Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Ethan was freed from the whack-mole contraption, rather then help him up, Casey proceeds to stomp down right on his face with a light smacking noise, forcing the sweat and intense odor to rub off against his face. A muffled groan comes from his lips as he glances up at his best friend with confusion showing in his eyes which turned into concern and fear as she raised her other dirty sole high into the air, showing off her perfect glistening arches before planting it roughly down on his cheek, pinning him down beneath her weight. In a painful muffled voice, Ethan cries out. \"W-what are you doing Casey? You won already and don't have to do this! Let me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis two cousins watch on with amusement, snickering every now and then as Ethan squirmed beneath Casey's powerful soles, feeling her rub and grind her heel against his face light she were putting out a cigarette. Her once kind sweet smile turned into a conceding snickering grin of amusement, her bright eyes flashing with cruelty as she became more and more comfortable with her new position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious? You're a foot loser and too pathetic to care for anymore. I should have seen it from the start but you're better off beneath my stinky feet, it's more then you deserve!\" Casey replies heartlessly. While a part of her did feel bad and regret, she didn't want to endure anymore abuse from his cousins and liked being on the winning side. On top of that the thrilling sensation she got off having someone beneath her, getting to abuse and push them around was exhilarating and the small meek moans and light breaths rushing beneath her toes only encouraged her to explore these new feelings more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ethan could respond, she firmly plants one foot on his lips, squishing it and forcing him to taste her salty horrid sweat while using her toes to flexibly grip his nose, forcing him to take in the brunt of her stench from between her toes. The collected gunk and stench began to overwhelm him as she flexed her toes playfully while easing her heel into his mouth, inch by inch, stretching his lips back as she violated his mouth. With her other foot she playfully slapped his cheek, leaving more imprints of her foot marking him as her property as she grinned towards Ethan's cousins who grinned back encouragingly, thinking about new ways she could get on their good side and dominate her foot bitch.</span></div></div>",

You try to interject, just the once though. The shock to your collar administered by Celina makes you whimper and tremble in pain, which of course makes you totally silent and meek for the entirety of the phone call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gets worse though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that...I can't believe you're here, Mom!\" Celina giggles, her eyes flashing with excitement as both twins practically lick their lips. \"Fantastic...we'll see you there soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...please, no!\" You whine up at them when the penny drops. The twins' Mom - your auntie Merjan is actually here and will witness your defeat and submission first hand! \"Please....OWW!!\" Shaking all over and actually falling onto your back, you feel several hot tears stinging in your eyes as your pretty cousins stand triumphantly over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so easy dealing with you slave,\" Yasmine states in a taunting voice. \"One word of disagreement, one little step out of line and we can shock you into obedience!

We own you for LIFE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot disagreeing with her, you barely grunt as she proceeds to wipe off several bits of dirt from her bare sole onto your face. Moments later you are yanked up by your leash and forced to shuffle on all fours after your cousins, knowing that encountering their Mom is just gonna be a whole lot worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do they take you to meet your Auntie?</span></div></div>",

As far as feet go, they look relatively nice. They match your ex's skin tone and seem to be pretty well taken care. They are smooth in texture and her toes have pink nail polish on them. It seems like she had a pedicure pretty recently. You cringe at the thought of being stepped on them though. They still belonged to you Ex and the idea having her feet in your face was degrading beyond belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled as she noticed your discomfort. It wouldn't have been nearly as fun for her if you enjoyed this. She wiggles her toes teasingly. \"Looking forward to worshiping them?\" She mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better kiss her feet extra thoroughly while you are playing.\" Celina tells you. \"If she loses because of you... we'll make you lick her feet clean to apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others like that idea and your Ex laughs at the thought. \"That might actually be pretty nice. \" She admits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown. The thought of defiantly refusing to up her score with foot kisses had crossed your mind but that new stipulation made that strategy considerably less appealing. It seems like you would need to kiss her feet as much as possible if you wanted to avoid licking them later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Bunny smiles as she resets the game pushing a button and sending you underneath the floorboards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to begin?\" She asks looking at Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Ex nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess activates the game and the timer begins to count down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat winds up happening?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Expertly shifting her bare feet, she has no hesitation in stomping down hard on your helpless face, each time met with whoops and cheers from your cousins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Lisa! Stomp him hard!\" The twins call out, along with similar words of encouragement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's feet move in a mad flurry; it's a real challenge but you manage to press your lips against the soles of her feet, every time they come in contact with you. She wasn't exaggerating about her feet - they are seriously sweaty so that every time she stomps you, you feel drops of sweat running into your eyes and open lips. It actually makes you appreciate Celina and Yasmine's feet more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly having a whale of a time, your blonde ex continues to rapidly dart her feet around, making you wince in pain by the umpteenth stomp. <i>Remember, you need her to win...you do not want to lick her feet....especially not in front of your cousins, or anyone for that matter!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA buzzer rings out signalling the five minutes is finally up. You stop swivelling, feeling rather disorientated from all of the movement plus Lisa's relentless foot stomping. Clearing her throat, Goddess Bunny has a hushed, enraptured audience as she announces the result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your score is....one thousand....SIX hundred and forty...YOU WIN!\" She says with much fanfare, which causes Lisa to squeal, jumping up and down with delight. Normally so prissy and high maintenance, it's a little strange to see her so jubilant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was awesome,\" Celina states. \"I mean, I still can't believe our slave here couldn't kiss our feet to get us those diamond earrings...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diamond earrings?!\" Your ex gasps. Of course, she didn't know what the prize even was! Getting to step on your face and have you kiss her feet while she did so was clearly a reward in itself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, ah!\" Bunny chides your cousin gently. \"The prize is given to highest score at the end of the day. Remember we have four more rounds here with your slave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing thickly, you feel a wave of despair wash over you. Having your ex trample you, while you kissed her feet at the same time was a truly humbling experience. Catching her eye for a second, you quickly look away, feeling totally insignificant and inferior to her. Your cousins are right - Lisa is seriously hot and you feel guilty for not giving it more of a go with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, cool. Well, I'm obviously gonna stay around and watch the next few rounds,\" Lisa states matter-of-factly, a snooty air about her once again. \"Getting to watch Ethan get trampled plus check no-one beats my score...those diamonds are mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat - another woman in your life to witness your public degradation! Bunny giggles appreciatively at the fact your ex wants to hang around as the blonde steps down from the Whack a Mole area, joining your cousins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder who's gonna come along next...someone else that our slave here knows hopefully!\" Yasmine giggles as you desperately hope that it will be a stranger next time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, welcome!\" Goddess Bunny suddenly calls out cheerily. \"Step right up for a once in a lifetime opportunity - win a prize AND get to put an arrogant jerk in his place! Are you ready to play Whack a Mole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is Goddess Bunny talking to?</span></div></div>",

Most of them serve the typical types of foods you would expect to see in carnivals (Hot dogs, Hamburgers, Giant Pretzels, Nachos, Turkey Legs etc) as well as various desserts (Funnel Cake, Ice Cream and Cotton Candy among them).

Not wanting to receive another shock, you reluctantly turn over your wallet to them. You're rewarded with a condescending pat on the head from Celina.

With neither option seeming viable, you make a sudden decision. Grabbing one of the basketballs, catching her off guard, you hurl it straight at Lucie's face, causing her to yell out angrily in surprise. While she composes herself, you turn on your heel and sprint away as fast as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a nightmare! How could you have allowed yourself to play with such high, dangerous stakes? Lucie is <i>so</i> unbelievably hot, but there is something definitely off with her. She suckered you in <i>because</i> she was so damn attractive! As you manage to get amongst other teenagers in a crowd, you turn briefly around, relieved to see that Lucie is nowhere in sight. Beautiful, but definitely mental! Is your quick summary of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Something is up here</i>, you tell yourself. How that gorgeous but bitch British girl knew your name, plus with everything that happened in Goddess Sasha's tent, you are in desperate need of some normality. Taking out your phone, you decide to check where Casey is at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan! What the hell happened to you?\" She says cheerily on the other end of the phone. \"Jessica said something about you seeing some fortune teller. I thought you hated that voodoo crap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" you reply darkly. \"I'll tell you more about it. Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading towards a hot dog stand, you actually feel your heart lift when you see her. Your cute blonde friend has even bought some food for you, which you accept gratefully. Just as you start filling her in, Jessica appears from behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\" The gorgeous brunette grins, giving you a playful punch in the arm. \"I went to the bathroom after you went to see the fortune teller. You were supposed to wait for me.\" She gives you a pout, her perfectly shaped eyebrows raising a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...I didn't...\" You babble, genuinely unsure if you had arranged that with her or not. Anyway, you give her a goofy grin, thoughts of the hot Lucie now dissipating away since being in Jessica's company. Maybe going into see Goddess Sasha did really impress her after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Casey clearing her throat interrupts you. \"Ethan - you were going to tell me all about it...\" She says, looking a little hurt and irritated that you've shifted all of your attention onto the sexy brunette. \"Let's go and sit down together so you can fill me in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Or</i>,\" Jessica says pointedly, rolling her eyes at your friend and squeezing your arm. \"Or, we can go somewhere a little quieter so you can tell <i>me</i> all about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTorn between your friend and your major crush, you look between the two women.

Storming off, giving a final glare at the two of you, Casey's slender, athletic frame soon disappears into the sea of bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feelings of guilt soon evaporate under the sultry look Jessica gives you; following her eagerly, you sit down next to her on the bench, heart racing and excited beyond belief to have some alone time with her.

If she were shy, or awkward about it, then it would only add to your hesitation. Yet Jessica is a woman who knows what she wants - and she wants you to lick her feet! Instructing you clearly to turn your body so that you are facing her directly, she bends one leg back, telling you to hold the one bare foot in both hands and arch it towards your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, you're a natural!\" She giggles at you, which only makes your cheeks redden. She pouts at you. \"Aw, don't worry, Ethan! Just think...each minute of licking...a minute inside me...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's too tempting an offer even if the last thing in the world of hers you would lick is her feet! Her pussy...yes! Her ass...absolutely! But her feet...as you gaze at the one relatively small foot - probably around a size 4 - in your hands, you move your mouth towards it, allowing the scent to flood your nostrils. It's surprisingly sweet really, a mixture of peaches and something slightly staler, like popcorn. But in no way unpleasant. Glancing at her gorgeous face through her toes, her emerald green eyes are sparkling with excitement. Again, she has the customary look of  superiority - like this is a perfectly normal thing to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you really hate feet, huh?\" She remarks just as you're about to stick your tongue out. \"I mean, you must do - otherwise you'd be loving every moment of this! Ha, I remember a couple of years ago, I let this dorky guy from Math lick my feet. I noticed him staring at my feet in class, so I pulled him up on it. After that, I didn't need to write a Math paper for a whole year! And he got to lick my feet, for five minutes a week in exchange...fair deal, right?! Shame he had to leave town...something about a mental breakdown.... Anyway, he may have been a total loser, but when he licked my feet, he <i>loved</i> it. I want some passion, Ethan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassion?! Is she kidding?! Closing your eyes, you try to picture Jessica's soft, tanned soles as her lips, or pussy. Making out with them won't be so bad.... As soon as you start placing your tongue on the heel of her foot, dragging it upwards to the centre of her sole, a salty, sour taste spreads over your tongue and makes you gag a little. A couple more licks later, you swallow thickly and open your eyes to see her nodding with approval, a smirk on her beautiful face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it?\" She purrs at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...not so bad...\" You half-lie. In truth, it's not as bad as you'd imagine. However it's not enjoyable! After what seems like forever, a few more reluctant licks or so later, Jessica clears her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One minute!\" She announces happily, holding on the stopwatch on her phone just above her delicate little foot, in case she needed proof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>One minute...jeez! That felt like at least 5!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long can you keep doing this for? Trying to be disciplined, you know the longer you get this necessary evil out of the way, the more time you can have of total bliss inside this ridiculously hot brunette.

She calls out angrily after you, clear shock and surprise in her voice. If you walk way, that's, like, totally the last chance you're ever gonna get with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing your eyes briefly, you try but fail not to imagine how hot the cheerleader would look naked... But you can't. You simply can't bring yourself to lick feet! Yes, that is how much you are repulsed by the mere thought! Not turning around, deciding to head towards what seems like a particularly deserted part of The Carnival, you contemplate whether you should go home or not. This evening has been a total fucking disaster! From your run in with Goddess Sasha, to the utter embarrassment handed to you by Lucie, to pissing of Casey, to failing to overcome your hatred for feet in order to lay Jessica. What a mess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a sigh, you look around you. Past a couple of deserted-looking burger stands, looks like one of the exits. Perhaps you should go. However, standing on her own, looking rather lost a familiar-looking woman....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Stephens! You simultaneously inwardly groan and chuckle at the sight of your least favourite teacher all alone. You can't believe that Biology-teaching bitch actually tried to fail you! Sure, you were late on a couple of assignments but you averaged high enough overall to stay well clear of that. Man, she was so easy to torment...when you finished your last day, you grin at what you told her - that you'd let her suck off the entire college basketball team, which you would inevitably captain when you started, if she wanted to pay you a visit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, that was brutal! <i>But well-deserved</i>, you rationalise. Amazingly, she barely reacted; even though her eyes were full of hatred, she merely smiled and wished you all the best for the future. Incredibly self-control, you have to admit, but still frustrating that she didn't slap you or give you a reason to get her ass fired!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo walking over to where the exit is on your left and Miss Stephens on your right, you make a decision...make your evening better by tormenting our former teacher or quit now on The Carnival and head on home?</span></div></div>",

I can't think of many sadder sights than a teacher, all alone at a carnival for kids and teenagers...\" You call out cheerily to your former teacher who starts in surprise when she realises who it is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan Price,\" she states calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, Miss Stephens,\" you say patronisingly, stopping to a halt when you are just a few feet away. \"Bet you thought you'd never see me again, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had hoped,\" she replies drily, staring at you with disdain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is so infuriatingly smug! Admittedly, the Biology teacher is attractive in geek-chic kinda way. Long brown hair and a slender yet voluptuous figure, some people could call her hot. Although, you remember finding photos on Facebook of how she looked at 16 - a total, utter nerd! Not unlike that loser, Laura, who you used to hang around years ago. Smirking, you remember Miss Stephens closing down her account and being very red-eyed the next day at school, after pictures of her geeky self were plastered by a certain someone around school...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you happy to see your favourite former pupil?\" You grinned, flashing your pearly whites. \"So...you missing me so much that you thought you'd come here, hoping you'd catch a moment with this basketball superstar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may seem cruel and unkind to some, but to you what you've done and how you are to this teacher is totally justified. She used to pick on you in class, targeting you for the trickiest questions to humiliate you. Any paper you wrote would be graded a D minus at best, even though you tested pretty well, even in a subject you hated. No, she deserves every bit of vitriol that you fling her way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at you, the corners of her mouth twitches. \"Oh, is that right, Price?  Do tell me, what heroics have you been up to as of late? Burning ants alive? Mindless frolics with the other high school jocks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's something else that annoys you - Price. All your other teachers called you Ethan, expect for her. Even though she called all of the girls and the male nerds by their first names, she insisted on referring you to and your buddies by your surnames.<i> So petty...!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing your throat, you puff out your muscular chest. \"Well, yeah I'm here with friends, if that's what you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really? It looks like you're alone here too,\" she gives you a patronisingly smug smile. \"Unless you have an invisible friend? Is he one of your  special basketball friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your blood boil, you glare at her. There is literally no one else in the world you hate as much as her...even <i>feet</i> would be a difficult call in the loathing stakes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a breath, you remember how you ended things last time... Yes, that will put her back in her place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'll be starting college real soon. When I do, you'd be welcome to look me up...remember that the whole basketball team would be happy for you to suck us off. Hey, I'd even let you start with me - the captain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's pretty much verbatim of what you said before. The teacher continues to stare at you, her eyes not leaving your face for a moment. After a few delicious seconds of silence, you decide to goad her some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no-one's around here, y'know,\" you take a quick look around and see that the entire area is indeed empty. \"Why don't you have a go on sucking my cock now? It's probably the first time a guy's allowed your dorky mouth near their dick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill silent, Miss Stephens purses her lips for a moment. The tension becoming a little awkward, you decide to wait to see how she responds...</span></div></div>",

Staggering backwards now, you let out a yelp of pain and try to defend yourself but Miss Stephens is surprisingly quick and agile. Slapping you across the face for the fifth time, both cheeks feel as though they're on fire, a horrible stinging sensation making you feel a little dizzy. You've been in fights before; hell, you've taken down tough eighteen year olds! You are not going to let this teacher physically dominate you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking several steps backwards, do you decide to attempt reasoning with her or fight back? Yes, she's a woman and you've never physically hit a girl before. But Miss Stephens could be an exception...</span></div></div>",

Your cheeks still burning painfully from her forceful slaps, you feel the satisfying thud of your fist connecting with her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little shit!\" She snarls at you, clearly not expecting you to actually lay a hand on her. Shrugging your shoulders and clutching each of you cheeks in turn, noticing some blood trickling down one of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You slapped me first!\" You seethe, feeling and sounding like a petty school boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour former teacher shakes her head disapprovingly - a sight you are very well familiar with - before stepping forward so she is right in your face. \"Say sorry, Price.

She caught you with such a powerful blow that you can do nothing except try to catch your breath and feel hot tears spring from your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding over you, a gloating, satisfied expression on her face, she folds her arms. \"Well, on your knees in front of me.

Do enlighten me with what you have to say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...Miss Stephens,\" You add her name, knowing it's what she wants to hear. Now, as soon as the pain leaves your groin and your head feels less groggy, you are going to literally punch her in the face...anything to wipe that stupid, smug look from her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your bewilderment, the Biology teacher suddenly slips off her sneakers and pulls her socks off, placing them - in her typical way - neatly and fastidiously into each shoe. Groaning inwardly, you cannot believe that this is the fourth woman who has managed to involve her bare feet in your life this evening....!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing up at her from your kneeling position on the ground, you can't help but admire her slim figure. Wearing a smart, short black dress that shows off her bare legs, you try wonder how often she works out. Shaking the thought away and starting to clamber back to your feet, your nemesis quickly puts one forceful hand on your shoulder so you stay exactly where you are. It's certainly humbling being overpowered by a woman like this, yet you have no choice but to stay where you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back and grinning widely at you, Miss Stephens raises up her slender leg and hovers her bare foot over your face. Immediately, your nose is assaulted with a heady combination off popcorn and cheese. Gagging a little, you try to shuffle back but Miss Stephens grabs hold of each of your arms, steadying the two of you and actually placing her nasty foot in your face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get...gerofff me!\" You yell at her, though your voice is somewhat muffled by her sole resting on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Price. No I will not get off you. In fact, this is what's going to happen. You are going to kiss my foot. While you kiss my foot, you are going to apologise for me. For each and every thing you have done to me during my first year of teaching. Do that to my satisfaction and I will let you crawl away. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is getting increasingly hopeless! You have no strength to fight back in this position and the feel of Miss Stephen's bare foot pushing against your face is both demeaning and nauseating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm waiting for your answer, Price. Do you understand this final assignment? I might even give you better than a D minus, if you do a decent enough job!\" She lets out a chuckle, spreading her toes over your face so that you feel them dig into your temples a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you...answer affirmatively to show you understand or try your best to unbalance her...that could be your only hope!</span></div></div>",

Feet, which you hate beyond all measure. Going from staring at Goddess Sasha's jewellery-adorned feet, to Lucie's dirty soles, to your absolute crush - Jessica - actually bribing you with sex with the drawback of having to lick her feet.... <i>Jeez, feet have dominated this entire evening!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing forward with her cheddar-scented foot, using two toes to squeeze your nose a little, she lets out a clucking noise of disappointment. \"Remember the second part of your assignment, Price.

So...where to start...oh, how about in my very first lesson I taught, when you tried to pretend that the lesson was only 40 minutes instead of an hour?

Oh, kiss my foot first before making your full and clear apology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the lowest of the lows, you close your eyes in silent despair and press another small, reluctant kiss on the centre of her soft, slightly-wrinkled bare sole. \"Um...sorry...sorry Miss Stephens for...pretending....that the lesson was shorter....sorry....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between your humbling apology, you pucker up so that a third kiss is placed on your arch-enemy's salty-tasting foot. The worst part of this is that you've been physically overpowered by her, to the point that even if you wanted to, you couldn't break free. Accepting that you simply to have to get this ordeal over with, you let the teacher verbally and physically dominate you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between mouthfuls of her stinky foot, and a whole series of endless apologies, you lose count of the number of times that you kiss her foot.

A wave of physical exhaustion washes over you to the point that you crumple to a heap on the ground, your lips covered in both your own blood and the salty, cheesy flavour of Miss Stephens' bare feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Price.

She's thoroughly humiliated you...why the hell did you have to walk over to her this evening?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding over you, she places a bare foot victoriously on your chest, pinning you down while using the other bare foot to gloatingly hover over your face. \"I win!\" She proclaims, resting her foot on your face for a few moments before stepping off you. As she picks up her sneakers and white socks, bending down to do so, you think for a moment of rushing her...taking her down and getting some payback!

Are you still yet to learn your lesson this evening? Well, it's a good job your teacher is here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Former teacher,\" you snarl before stepping forward to catch her off guard. You miss a punch to her gut - where you connected before and  barely avoid a ferocious slap from her, which would have smacked you in the ear. Deciding to tackle her to the ground again, you cry out victoriously when you manage to take her down, forcing her onto the ground, pinning each of her arms down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA!\" You grin, blood dripping from your mouth and head a bit woozy from her kick to your face. \"Now I've...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Miss Stephens' turn to widen her smile as she manages to spread her legs before wrapping them around your neck with the strength of an anaconda. Grunting in pain, you let go of her arms in the attempt to remove her vice-like scissor hold from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get...off...\" You splutter, feeling your entire face redden with the pressure from her thighs. Miss Stephens grunts in satisfaction as she rolls neatly to the side, forcing you to crash to the floor, lying on your side and flapping uselessly like a fish out of water. Squeezing even harder, she turns at an even sharper angle so that your nose and mouth bury into the dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should have let me walk away,\" she tells you in a strict tone, still exerting a tremendous amount of pressure with this impressive scissor hold. \"Now are you going to submit to me, Price? Surrender and admit that I'm better than you?\" The Biology teacher chuckles as you let out a groan of pain. \"All you have to do is say 'you win', then I will release you. Think you can achieve that objective?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're running out of time. Realising that your flailing and attempts to remove her strong grip are futile, you allow your limbs to hang loosely.

You don't get to talk to me so informally anymore. From now on, you will say 'yes Miss Stephens'. No, even better, 'Goddess Julie'. Am I understood?\" She demands as she pulls back a foot as if preparing to kick you in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes Goddess Julie.\" You meekly parrot. You didn't even know her first name was Julie before now. She lowers her foot back to it's resting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now then, due to your little attack on me, I'm not just going to walk away after one little sign of submission. So instead, I'm going to drag out your humiliation to make sure the message sticks, and you'll do it unless you want another ass kicking, get it?\" She orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Goddess Julie.\" You cower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Give me your phone.\" She commands with you quickly pulling it out of your pocket and handing it to her. \"Nice to see you listen for once. If you had done it in class then we might not be here right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So since I'm a generous goddess, I'm going to give you a choice in your punishment. Option one, you worship my feet right here while we're in private, meanwhile, I record it with your phone and post it all over your social media, so all your little friends can see you worship the feet of the 'nerdy' teacher you hate so much. And you know what they say, once it's on the Internet, it's there forever.\" She gloats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded horrible. Any possible credibility you could have in college would be lost if a video like that got out. \"Option two, I take you out into a crowded area of this little carnival and have you worship them there. I might even let some of the crowd try you out as well.\" She offers <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that option could somewhat save your reputation, you would then be putting your mouth on more feet than just hers. Plus, your friends were in this place somewhere. If they saw you, it would be just as bad as the video. \"Well? I'm waiting.\" She says. </span></div></div>",

You can't help but notice her smooth soles, toes adorned with a slight coating of lint from her socks. You swear you can smell a sharp cheesy odor, perhaps she had worked out earlier today? She smiles as she noticed you observing her feet closely. Then it happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot pulls back slightly before striking your face hard. It connects your your cheek, making a sickening slap sound as your head flies back so fast you almost get whiplash. You're glad she avoided your nose as the idea of a blood nose was less than ideal, but the alternative wasn't much better, as you feel your jaw dislodge slightly. You fall pathetic to your back, the laughter of Miss Stephens being drowned out slightly by a ringing in your ears that you can only assume is your ear drum rattling around from the brutal force of your sick teachers foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, that was divine\", Miss Stephens says with a satisfied moan. \"Judging by the way you were looking at my feet before I kicked you, I would not be surprised if you enjoyed that just as much as I did Price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have the strength to reply... Hell, you aren't even sure if you can move your jaw yet. You can only lay there as Miss Stephens taunts you, hoping she keeps her promise and leaves you to lick your wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Stephens continues. \"I know I said I would leave you be if you let me kick your face, but like I said... I have a feeling you enjoyed that Price. What did you enjoy most? The pain? Me kicking you in the face?\" Miss Stephens then lifts her bare foot and hovers it directly in front of your face. \"Or perhaps you enjoyed the feeling of my foot on your face? Maybe the smell from my sweaty feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are forced to look at Miss Stephen's foot once again. You can't help but to to smell them... This time they are much closer to your face, so the smell is far more intoxicating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to make you a final offer Price. Look at my foot for the next 30 seconds. Look at it closely, inhale deeply, take in the essence of my feet\" Miss Stephens demands. \"If you want me to walk away and leave you alone after that, I will do it. However, if my feet are too much for you to resist, then I will stay and we can play some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair, you couldn't stop her from making you look at her foot even if you wanted to. You really have no choice but to look as your 30 seconds begin. Miss Stephens twists her ankle, turning her foot so you can see every crevice, every wrinkle, every inch of her foot. The smell is overpowering, and you really can't help but to feel weak... What will you do? </span></div></div>",

Her unusual pose is so sexy it makes you more horny again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan, it is your last chance. If you accept my offer, get down on your hands and knees and kiss my foot.\" Destiny says.</span></div></div>",

Who would have thought that the feeling of submission can be captivating?<br>\r\nAlmost like you're enchanted, you drop down to your knees. Your vision is completely focus on the sole of Destiny's foot, which dangles in front of your face.<br>\r\nTo your surprise, this view seems to be tremendously pleasant. You would love to see her georgous foot without the black pantyhose on it.<br>\r\nImmense humiliation you undergo makes you only more lustful. Despite the fact that you can't see your new friend's face, you sense she is smiling victoriously. You place your hand on the floor and lean your head closer and closer to your new desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smell it first.\" You can hear Destiny's voice from above. Obediently, you put your nose on the arch, but she quickly corrects you by wrapping your nose around with her toes. Your senses are hit hard by the smell, she must have been wearing these boots all day long. After taking couple of whiffs you feel kind of dizzy and weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it, Ethat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\" You answer trying to sound casual, but deep down you realise that the bad aroma still doesn't stop your arousal. Quite the opposite, the fact that <br>\r\nyou are willingly inhaling this goth's stinky feet makes your dick so hard you feel lucky that she doesn't see you. You wonder how pathetic you must look right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" Destiny answers. \"You will get used to it. With more training you will learn to admire my feet, you will even thank me for the privilege.<br>\r\nThat's the key work, Ethan. You must always consider my feet as a 'privilege'. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"you utter, with a rock hard erection<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may now kiss my foot.\" Destiny finally orders you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" After a while you realise what you have just done. You've just expressed your gratitude without even being told too. You' ve never suspected<br>\r\nyourself to be so submissive. What has Goddess Sasha done to you? You are not able to think about it right now, so you just focus on your task. Looks like <br>\r\nDestiny has lowered her leg a little bit, so you assume the bowing position and put your lips on her perfect sole. You notice how soft it is, maybe because of the nylon pantyhose she's wearing. You keep kissing every part of her sole while admiring it with your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her feet are so beautiful.\" You think to yourself. \"How could I not see that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely mesmerized, you are lost in time and also forget about the unpleasant smell. You can't hold it and want to jack off. Destiny flips around and looks at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy! Finally you're learning your place. Do you want to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously you nod positive, with your eyes still focused on her feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take off your pants, but don't touch yourself without my permission.\" She orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obey without question, while the goth girl smirks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First thing...\" She states. \"From now on you will call me Mistress Destiny at all times. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mistress Destiny!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And second, I want you to beg for it. Submit to me, admit that I am superior in every way. Surrender to me completely and if I believe you, then i will let you come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is too late for you to back off. You bow with your dick exposed, all you can think about is to get relief. You can't deny it, you love the sense of submission. You've never been more excited in your whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress Destiny...\" You start your speech and kiss the tops of her feet that are in front of you. \"You are perfect...I am grateful for letting me kiss your<br>\r\nirresitible feet, I don't deserve to be your equal.\" *kiss* \"I should've been grovelling at your feet long ago. My surrender to you is indisputable. I want to serve you...\" *kiss*  \"I want to be your slave.\" You feel so horny you could just explode.

Like a moth to the flame, you find yourself hurrying rapidly towards it, mostly oblivious to Destiny as she chases after you. The goth, Goddess Sasha...all of that seems insignificant now, compared to getting to actually watch a live wrestling show! Maybe there'll be AJ Styles, Seth Rollins.... You nearly pause for the moment at getting to see your massive crush, <i>Alexa Bliss</i>, there too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ETHAN!\" Destiny cries as she flails after you, trying to grab you by the shoulder. Shrugging her off, you get to the queue, which is amazingly short. Maybe this is one of their 'hidden' shows....like a house show, which may not even be televised and isn't particularly advertised. Shrugging that thought away as you do Destiny, you begin scrambling in your wallet for some notes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much, how much?\" You breathlessly ask the security. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guys smile at you and gesture towards the open gate. \"No, no - it's free for all Carnival ticket holders!

Flicking the pink ends of her hair in a seductive manner, she beckons you to take a seat next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you a fan of wrestling, huh?\" She asks you, leaning forward after you take a seat next her. Lightly brushing her fingers against your arm, she nods, impressed. \"Wow...good muscles!

Aware that the eyes of WWE personnel, wrestlers, referees and various other important people, you can't help but feel giddy with excitement.

You also feel a surge of guilt, having abandoned your potential protector, even if she did put that image in your head of sucking Goddess Sasha's toes and enjoying it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Alexa is now glaring at you, still beautiful but a certain deadliness to her. It's clear she's used to getting her own way - in and out of the ring! \"You're starting to piss me off! Come with me NOW, or I'm gonna start getting tetchy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's er, don't take it personal...I...\" You begin backing away from the blonde, having made up your mind that this can't be real. Going with Alexa would mean submitting to Goddess Sasha; you have to fight that fraud and NOT end up her pathetic slave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it,\" Alexa says, exasperated, looking around her and starting to bark orders. \"Take this guy to the ring! Tell Stephanie McMahon that it's a surprise from Alexa - one arrogant, cocky jerk thinks that he's stronger and better than any other women! Let's see how he fares in the ring!\" There is a general cheer from everyone in the backstage area as you're promptly picked up by several security members and WWE personnel and dumped roughly in a dressing room right by the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" You yell out angrily. \"You can't do this to me!\" Then you realise it - if this is all controlled by Goddess Sasha, then anything can happen! Before you know it, you're being whisked towards the ring and pushed forward to the entrance ramp, where a shower of boos from WWE fans meets you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa is already in the ring. \"Here he is everyone - the man who told me that he was tougher and stronger than any woman! He said to me backstage that I was just a \"Diva\", and that I should \"Be a valet instead of trying to wrestle!\" What a jerk!\" She cries out triumphantly, which causes more boos and insults to be hurled your way. This is so unfair - you said nothing of the sort! Turning back behind you, the scary security guards make it crystal clear that you have one destination to head to - the ring!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, my adoring fans...\" Alexa soaks up a mixture of applause and jeers. Even though she is a 'heel' - a villain - the crowd generally give her a smattering of support as well as hostility, as she is so charismatic. Due to the current circumstances, they seem to be more favourable towards her than ever, and that's despite being 'the bad guy'! Compared to how's she portrayed you, she's the one to root for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, you arrogant <i>jerk</i>...\" Little Miss Bliss states. \"I've cleared this with Steph backstage.

How the hell did The Carnival pull of such a.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Goddess Sasha! Cursing yourself for forgetting something so elementary, you are forced to refocus on the current situation. Charlotte Flair is strutting to the ring, twirling in her peacock feathered-adorned gown, which makes look, admittedly, a million dollars. Dropping this onto the floor, she gives you a superior, imperious look before darting to the side of the ring, pulling off an impressive forward cartwheel before swivelling into the ring, such is customary for her entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou back slightly away, gulping at the athlete you are now sharing the ring with. Charlotte is not far off 6 feet tall - only a little shorter than you! Toned and with a very impressive physique, she is certainly more intimidating and more of a specimen than Alexa, to be fair. Alexa meanwhile is grinning from ear to ear, before dropping to ringside to join the commentators. Wow, imagine if this were actually being broadcast... NO! Don't forget that this is all a trick, Goddess Sasha messing with you...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, you are faced with a daunting prospect. You've seen many, many of her matches and what she can do is damned impressive. She was a major factor in the 'Women's Revolution' - since then, female wrestlers have been taken far more seriously. For you, it's more about who is the hottest - which is why you're a major Alexa Bliss fan...or at least you were before this evening! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte stands in one corner, her eyes not leaving you, an arrogant smirk spread across her high cheekbones. Finally, someone hands her a microphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard what you said backstage...I am Charlotte Flair - The Queen! I've taken out bigger women AND men than you before, you jerk!

You've been in fights and come out from the better pretty much every time.... For a moment you glance back at Alexa, who is pointing to the floor, gesturing for you to bow to Charlotte, with a sneer on her face. This infuriates you but makes you feel torn at the same time...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"OK, let's see what you've got!\" You call out cockily across the ring. \"This isn't same fake, staged bullshit. I can take you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte sneers at you as he turns up her nose, her face impassive. \"Well, you had your chance, boy. It will be all the more satisfying taking you down and forcing you to bow before me. WOOOOO!\" The crowd echoes the 'Woo!' call, building up to a fervour of excitement once the bell rings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it is with trepidation that you begin jockeying position with Charlotte Flair, you stick to your guns. Wrestling is fake after all; she's probably never even been in a real fight! Using this fact against her, you attempt a couple of light body blows, feeling out the situation. The blonde amazon scoffs as she neatly sidesteps these, before neatly connecting you with a backfist to your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWincing a little but shrugging off the blow, you decide to regroup. Having been in various scuffles with other basketball players and members of sports teams at your school, you know the best thing to do is find a weakness. <i>You must be stronger than her surely - she is just a girl, well a woman after all...</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to go for a takedown, you instantly regret this; Charlotte is too technically savvy to allow you to even wrap your arms around her! Instead, she grabs your arm and twists it hard, forcing it at a painful angle behind your back. While you gasp and struggle to push her off, she walks casually forward, taking the time to show your pained face to each side of the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, give me SOME sort of a fight...!\" She chuckles in your ear before lazily pushing you away, allowing you to awkwardly force your sore arm into a more comfortable position. \"I guess that's just natural selection....I am <i>genetically superior</i> to you in every way after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smugness of the so-called Queen is too much to bear. Growling a little in anger and frustration, you proceed to rush her, which she deftly sidesteps, allowing you to crash in a heap on the floor by the turnbuckle. The crowd roar and jeer in appreciation, even showering Charlotte with applause, which is unusual considering her usual villainous character. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling over to you, she extends a boot and pushes it to the side of your face, so that you are roughly shoved against the coarse material of the lower turnbuckle. Crap, this is embarrassing! You haven't mustered one single successful blow on her...she's beating you easily! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too easy!\" The tall blonde remarks before pushing her boot under your chin, so that you feel your entire neck twist sideways, so much that it feels it could snap off! Getting tired of toying with you, she finally steps away, her arms held up in her signature <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/53/0d/79/530d79f17d39766d58fae1276d0ee296.jpg\">'Queen' pose</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/53/0d/79/530d79f17d39766d58fae1276d0ee296.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>{/b}...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling confidently across at you, she lets out a long \"WOOOOOOO!\", which again, the crowd eat up and echo throughout the entire arena. Holding your neck in pain, using the ropes in the corner of the ring to support you, you force yourself back onto your feet, even though you're feeling a little dazed. Circling one another, Charlotte is far quicker, far more agile than you; she practically laughs as she swiftly puts you into a headlock walking around with you a little, the other hand stretched out in a regal fashion towards the crowd, before throwing you hard against the ropes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's surprisingly difficult just maintaining any sort of speed, but you find your footing quickly, throwing yourself against the ropes, rebounding well so that you hurtle towards her. The blonde wrestler looks annoyed when you manage to duck her clothesline and instead manage to run to the other side of the ring!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes, this is it...time to build some momentum! </i> Instead of running right back at her, you stop at the ropes, allowing them to steady you, catching your breath. A scowl on her face, Charlotte steps quickly towards you, attempting to twist your arm again but you manage to wriggle free and run against the opposite side of the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Here we go, building some speed, time to...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind is completely knocked out of your sails as you are met with a forceful shoulder block from Charlotte; she shoves you with so much power that you are sent flying onto the canvas, your back hitting it hard. The crowd burst into excited applause again, with 'Charlotte, Charlotte!' chants building to a crescendo. Charlotte arrogantly struts around the ring, mimicking her own father's famous walk in homage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing you by the hair, you yelp out in pain as she proceeds to unleash several almighty chops to your chest. Each one is met with an eager 'Woo!' from the crowd, while you stagger backwards. Charlotte then tears off your shirt, exposing your chest before chopping you again a couple of times until you put your hands up to beg her to stop. Shuffling backwards, until you reach the turnbuckle, you gingerly press your fingers against where she has lighted up your upper body with her stinging, powerful blows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte's grin is wider than ever as she stalks towards you. Without a moment to defend yourself, she grabs the top rope with both hands, using it for leverage, while viciously choking you with her boot. She exerts so much pressure that you almost instantly drop to a sitting position. The referee didn't even need to carry out a '5 count', so quick were you to drop limply to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen beckons for a microphone, towering over you, and not even showing a sign of breaking into a sweat. You meanwhile are panting, sweating profusely and aching in several places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a joke!\" She says with disdain into the mike, gesturing at you. \"This man doesn't stand a chance against me! Alexa, I'm sorry, but next time please find a guy backstage who actually has a fighting chance! Really, you should have bowed before The Queen before I taught you a lesson. I haven't even performed any of my signature moves yet!\" The crowd find this hilarious, whooping and cheering while you struggle to catch your breath. \"OK, loser. I'll tell you what. I'm going to stick the sole of my boot in front of your useless face. You need to kiss it, then I'll let you roll over like a good little puppy, so I can pin you and get this nonsense over with. If you don't, then I am going to humiliate you even more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, it would be excruciating to lose that way but do you have much of a choice? Charlotte is barely trying and is totally destroying you! What do you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There's no chance you're being defeated that easily! Surely none of this can be 'real' - if what Destiny said is true then this is all part of Goddess Sasha's games. She wants to destabilise you, embarrass you...destroy you! Yet, this feels real alright, faced with possibly the greatest female wrestler of all time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimacing at the sight of the slightly blackened sole of her wrestling boot, you feel a sudden flurry of fight spark from you. Suddenly grabbing the proffered foot and throwing it upwards, you're relieved to see Charlotte stumble back away from you, yet disheartened to see her regain her balance almost immediately, like an expert gymnast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ungrateful idiot!\" Charlotte has a severe expression on her face, however you can see her eyes dance in excitement. \"Well, you've sealed your fate - I am going to deny you any mercy now, boy. Wooooo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing yourself up, still aching all over but with a renewed spring in your step, you start to circle the blonde wrestler. Trying to find an opening is like hitting a moving target. She is so quick, so agile... Feeling pain explode in your left knee, you yelp out in pain after Charlotte casually stomps hard against it, causing you to trip and fall, much to the crowd's delight. Trying to ignore their cheers and jeers, you regroup, trying again futilely to find a way of outmanoeuvring her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen seems to find your attempts to fight her amusing, easily blocking any jabs you aim at her, sidestepping neatly whenever she needs to. You can tell she's holding back, which begins to shatter your confidence. Almost lazily, she suddenly chops you again on the bare chest, making you wince and groan, before sweeping you with an expertly placed leg, causing you once again to crash to the ground. It's harder getting up this time, but you still have some fight in you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet you wished you had kissed my boot when you had the chance...you're gonna be begging me to by the end of this 'match'...\" She pauses and mocks you with quotation marks at the mention of this word. \"Ha! You'll be begging to kiss my <i>feet</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mention of the 'F' word makes trepidation melt down your spine; that's just what you need! Practically snarling, you start throwing wild haymakers... <i>all it will take is one to bring her down, surely...</i> But your punches are completely ineffective; Charlotte Flair laughs dismissively as she dodges your attacks before chopping you once again so that your upper body reddens. Stumbling backwards, you groan as she kicks you hard in the gut, then suddenly steps neatly back a few steps and launches off the ropes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SMACK!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see stars as Charlotte's boot connects squarely with your jaw; such is the force of her blow that you are sent spinning sidewards, almost flipped over as you  crash unceremoniously to the ground. It takes several moments to regain your senses and be cognisant of the roar from the crowd. Charlotte's 'Big Boot' has completely crushed you! Wheezing, flapping around uselessly on the floor, you are surprised when the powerful blonde wrestler suddenly scoops you back up to your feet and allows you to stagger in agony backwards to the corner turnbuckle, once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man, your jaw could be broken.</i>..you feel a swelling already forming on it, desperately hoping that she hasn't caused permanent damage to you! Despite the aching haze around you, you soon realise while Charlotte helped you up - she wants to connect again with another big boot! The Queen twirls around to the crowd, soaking up the applause and adulation. This is probably the most positive feedback she's ever received! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at you from the opposite corner post, her bright eyes burning right through you. Like a bull sliding preparing for a powerful attack, she scrapes her feet behind her before yelling out with triumph, steaming forward and boot raised to slam directly into your face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fleeting thought pops into your head as you groggily watch her; she's so confident that you're too battered and beaten to move. If you could just duck down, this forceful attack could prove very reckless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you able to drop down in time or does Charlotte connect with another big boot?</span></div></div>",

Such is the ferocity of her ruthless kick, everything seems to slow down and feel faint; you vaguely remember dropping to a crumpled heap on the floor, sucking in huge amounts of oxygen, the entire room spinning as the pain to your nose and mouth begins to slowly burn through you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap, you are suddenly aware of the crowd screaming at the top of their lungs, jumping up and down in a frenzy of excitement. Groggily looking about you, you grimly notice Charlotte strutting around the ring, a look of victoriousness pasted all over her angular face. Letting out a triumphant 'WOOOO!', things begin to get worse for you - if that were possible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no...!\" You murmur weakly, putting a hand on your nose, feeling warm blood trickle down onto your split lips. Man, her big boot was so powerful, so effective. She could have broken your nose...and maybe knocked out a couple of your teeth! No, even worse than that is what The Queen is doing next... Trying unsuccessfully to pull yourself back to your feet, you stay slumped and beaten at the bottom turnbuckle, eyes wide with fear and despair at the sight of Charlotte Flair...<i>pulling off her wrestling boots!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you,\" she snickers, sauntering over to you in her white sports ankle socks, her eyes flashing. \"You should've kissed my boot, you jerk! Now I'm gonna teach you a harsh lesson in respecting your betters...\" With a disdainful chuckle, she lifts one powerful leg up, holding a socked sole teasingly over your face. It is so sweaty that you can see the clear imprint of her bare sole about to strike...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...no...don't!\" You whimper, spitting a globule of your own blood on the mat. \"Don't....mmmmmffffff.....\" Your words are cut off by Charlotte slamming down her foot, with such ferocity that a fresh wave of pain washes over your already aching face; Charlotte arches back and holds the lower rope for coverage, shoving her foot forwards, so that your neck snaps back, unsuccessfully trying to accommodate the pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte pulls back for a moment, allowing you to breathe momentarily, before slamming her foot down again, hard, pushing it against your face and scraping it back soon after. Your head bounces around on the mat, your body crumpling so that you're practically in the foetal position. Charlotte continues her relentless assault, her foot repeatedly slamming against your face, pushing sharply along it, pulling back over and over. Dimly, in a haze, you recall what she's doing - she's face washing you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFace washed by Charlotte's sweaty white ankle sock, how humiliating! The sound of jeering and jubilant yelling from the crowd becomes gradually fainter, as your face is pummelled into oblivion. Letting a small moan of defeat, you try telling Charlotte that you quit, but she doesn't seem to care! Finally, she lets off, shouting something to the guys at ringside. While you roll onto your back, desperately trying to get your breathing under control, you are just about aware of Charlotte placing a steel chair in the middle of the ring, sitting in a typically elegant and imperious manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, last chance to receive some mercy from The Queen!\" She yells across at you, a totally superior look about her. \"Crawl over here on your belly, like the worm you are. Take off my sweaty socks and kiss my feet! Then I will end this joke of a match!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's hard to tell if the crowd picked up on all of her words but you certainly did. Positioning yourself on your belly, your face turned up to meet her eye, you feel completely defeated. Are you so beaten and humbled that you're going to surrender this pathetically to her?!</span></div></div>",

There is no point in prolonging this misery; at this point all you want to do is get this over with and get out of this hell of a wrestling match! If only you'd listened to Destiny...letting your ego and stupidity lead you to this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a defeated sigh, you begin shuffling forward on your belly, much to the crowd's delight. Charlotte's name is chanted over and over, which she soaks up with a nod and regal wave of her hand. Usually depicted as a villain, and still with her arrogant traits - it's clear the crowd has been won over with how thoroughly she has humbled you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! Crawl over to me like the worm you are!\" She chuckles, crossing her legs and swishing her right foot from side to side. You shudder; her feet are undoubtedly sweaty - removing those ankle socks is going to stink more than anything. After what seems like a painful minute or so of dragging your exhausted and battered body along the ground, you reach The Queen, heart racing with terror as she sits above you - much like royalty over a pathetic servant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk, she stretches out one socked foot so that it is just over your face. Immediately, the dank stench from her sweaty foot floods into your nostrils and makes you gag; she has worked up more than just a sweat! It's like actual clear vinegar running down her sports socks! Shuddering and trying to hold your breath, you begin reluctantly and fearfully pulling off ankle sock, grimacing with how wet and slimy it is before dropping it to the floor in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other one!\" She calls cheerily, while you bleakly stare at her long, powerful sole, glistening with sweat. Focusing your attention on Charlotte's other sock, you hurriedly scramble your hands around, yanking it off so that the powerful blonde wrester is now completely barefoot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is clearly the part that the crowd has anticipated the most, the moment Charlotte yelled at you from the middle of the ring on her 'throne'. Whooping and screaming with unabated delirium, it only adds to your humiliation. In the corner of your eye, you notice a petite figure slip through the ropes, walking steadily over to Charlotte's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Of course, Little Miss Bliss would want to witness this first hand...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is a wonderful sight!\" The petite blonde says in a gleeful tone. \"If only you had not dared to question me - you could have had at least five minutes of fun with Five Feet Of Fury here!\" She giggles at her own joke and pouts at you. \"Well, you're gonna be getting some <i>feet</i> time, alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte sniffs disdainfully at you, a look of malevolence flashing in her eyes as she stretches out her bare soles in front of you, forcing you to inhale the bitter aroma. \"You heard her. Kiss my feet, loser. Then I will pin you and finish this nonsense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she's speaking so dismissively to you, you're grateful to have the suffering over with. Every bone in your body aching, you lean forward and pucker up. Kissing each of Charlotte's feet is mortifying and disgusting but at least it's done quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh no!\" Alexa frowns, shaking her head as she rests a hand on her fellow wrestler's shoulder. \"Nope. The Queen deserves FIVE kisses. On each foot! So Ten Feet Of Fury! HA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte smirks, giving you an icy stare and wiggling her toes, while you literally tremble before her. Closing your eyes in defeat, you press five quick kisses to the centre of Charlotte's bare sole, grimacing as the cheddary smell dominates your senses, the sharp, acrid flavour making you nearly wretch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa interferes again. \"No, no, no! We need five <i>SLOW</i> kisses... Kisses to show that you are totally inferior to an awesome wrestler like Charlotte...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that sounds fair,\" Charlotte agrees, sneering at you. \"And in between each kiss, I want you to say these words. \"I. Surrender. To. The. Queen. Got that, wimp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod weakly, feeling both ashamed of yourself and desperate to get this ordeal over with at the same time. Taking in a breath of the sharp, bitter air around her foot, you do exactly as told, causing the crowd to shout and scream happily, louder than ever. \"I...surrender...to...The...Queen...\" You arch back your head to get some oxygen, your lips stinging with the salty flavour of her bare sole. \"I....surrender.....to......The........Queen......\" You repeat whilst kissing her other foot, being careful to make the words clear and respectful. Your mouth tasting of nothing other than cheesy feet, you lay slumped on your knees, at her feet, while she waves to the adoring crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your back, loser,\" she suddenly orders you. You do so at once, relieved that this is at least nearly at its end. <i>Just three seconds then the nightmare is over!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa helpfully takes the steel chair from Charlotte, holding it in her hands while The Queen towers over you, hands on hips, and a look of triumph adorning her handsome features. You look up bleakly, wishing her to get this over with. Finally, after twirling around several times over your defeated form, she lifts up a bare foot slowly, taking her time to lower it down towards your face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a way to get pinned, you muse, before Charlotte's long, powerful and conquering sole covers your face. She exerts some pressure, scrunching her sweaty toes against your forehead and motioning with her other foot for the hapless referee, who has been conveniently silent for the past few minutes or so, to count the three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1...2...3!\" The crowd roar along, each number punctuated with a tap of Charlotte's toes to your face. Finally, finally the match is over as Charlotte steps off you, ensuring to do so slowly so that you imagine her imprint has been etched firmly onto your defeated face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you've learned a lesson, bitch. By the way, you kissed pretty well. Let me know if you wanna kiss them again!\" She shakes her head arrogantly with disdain, locking eyes with you one more time before posing for the crowd again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a giggle, Alexa raises Charlotte's hand before walking over to you. \"Wow, you were really good at kissing Charlotte's feet! I've heard that she's done that to guys before...but I bet none did it it as well as you! I'll give you a choice, foot kisser. Stay where you are, flat on your back in the middle of ring and lick MY feet clean in front of ALL of these people...or, you go backstage with Charlotte where you can be her bitch.\" She smirks at you for a moment. \"Either way, I win - I know you're gonna be humiliated whatever you choose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Agreeing to be Charlotte's backstage bitch?!</i>Then again, the alternative is to lick Alexa's feet...in front of thousands of rabid WWE fans.

Gazing up at you, you see that Charlotte is on a heap on the floor, spitting and cursing vehemently while grabbing on desperately to her right knee. The referee attends to her, checking on her leg and seeing if there is a major injury there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You did it, you outsmarted The Queen! </i> Slowly rising to your feet, still nursing the now definite bruise on your chin, you glance behind you at Alexa Bliss, still sat in on commentary and with a look of disgust on her face. Giving her a cocky grin, feeling buoyed by how you've managed to get one over Charlotte Flair, you walk over to where she is still writhing in agony on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might...might be...broken!\" Charlotte gasps in between choked sobs, while the referee signals for medics to make their way to the ring. The powerful blonde catches your eye and glares at you. \"You...you...piece of shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"Hey, it wasn't my idea to come charging into the corner post like that! So, you forfeit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncredibly, you've got this won. Surely! Charlotte can't even get back to her feet, let alone wrestle you!

The crowd rain down boos and jeers, but you soak it all up, starting to play the character that Alexa has portrayed you as. Cockily leaning against the ropes, you hold out your hands innocently before crouching down to say something to Charlotte. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to pin you, or make you tap out? I guess just forfeiting would make you look kinda like a loser...\" Charlotte looks enraged as she tries to use her good leg to sweep you, her hands flinging futilely upwards, while the medics start to appear in the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarning them off, you easily step past Charlotte, assuring the referee that The Queen wants to continue. After the official checks, he shrugs; your opponent is so pissed off that she's not quitting yet! This is just the news you wanted. Heading back over, you stand over your fallen foe, grinning at how you're now in the dominant position. Grabbing her injured leg roughly with both hands, you drop down and apply a basic leg lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrithing and desperately trying to shake you off, Charlotte screams out in agony, tears running down her usually so composed face. \"Come on, loser! Tap already!\" You're starting to <i>really</i> enjoy this! Even if this is all a facade, created by Goddess Sasha, then you're having a whale of time. You're a WWE Superstar! Even it means winning in dubious ways...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrying out, choking back sobs, you're delighted to hear the reverberations of Charlotte tapping the ground, causing the crowd to again go totally silent until you hear the bell ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You've beaten Charlotte Flair! Possibly the greatest female wrestler in the world, and of all time!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the referee with some of returning medics help Charlotte onto a stretcher, you give her a departing 'WOOO!', which of course sends the crowd into a frenzy of hatred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...somehow this cocky misogynist has survived!\" You hear Alexa over the speakers. Standing up, one hand on her hip, the other holding the mike, she tosses back her pink-tipped blonde hair. \"But that's not all....no you beating Charlotte Flair as earned you another match....against....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Another match?!</i> You glare at her, suddenly more aware of the huge bruise on your chin, the ache of your arm...various injuries caused by Charlotte.

Of course, the \"Pirate Princess!\" You've seen her wrestler in the Mae Young Classic, which she won, in NXT, which she became the Women's Champion in...she certainly has an impressive resume for someone so small! The height difference becomes even more pronounced when she makes it to the ring, removing her ridiculous pirate hat, coat, telescope and other pointless apparel. Dressed in white ring gear and <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairi_Sane#/media/File:Kairi_Sane_April_2018.jpg\">posing to the crowd</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairi_Sane#/media/File:Kairi_Sane_April_2018.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>, she is undeniably charismatic. Not gonna help her against you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rings rather suddenly, making you hurry into a fighting stance as the young Japanese woman beams at you. This isn't a way of psyching you out, she genuinely seems to be bubbly and excited. Yet, you feel yourself taking this opponent far less seriously than Charlotte; Kairi is a little over 5 feet tall - around a foot shorter to you and has a slight build. You know that she's fast and an aerial specialist. Deciding to go for a headlock, Kairi quickly ducks, launching across the ropes and front dropkicking your knees with tremendous force. Dropping forwards, cursing her as you're forced onto your hands, she suddenly pulls off a running blockbuster - a move that basically involves her flipping over you, using her hands to snap your face straight to the canvas!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning in pain and rolling to the side, Kairi poses to the crowd, doing her telescope mime and beaming as she normally does. Wow, she does not seem concerned by you at all! As you stagger back to your feet, holding your neck awkwardly, Kairi is already on the turnbuckle! Yelling out at you, she connects with a missile dropkick, expertly connecting with your face so that you crumple to the floor, flat on your back. Hazily above you, you see The Pirate Princess do her signature 'walking the plank'. She's in no rush! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe petite woman stands over you, her smile turning to a look of pity, which only enrages you. She says something in Japanese, before holding out a hand, offering to help you to your feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does seem to be a respectful and mild-mannered fighter - quite different to Charlotte in that respect! It would be sporting to accept this gesture...then again, this could be a useful opening for you...</span></div></div>",

In this position, you are in control! Dropping your full weight on to her, Kairi groans in pain and futilely swings her legs around but you have her in a firm grip. Transitioning to a wrist lock, rolling her over and burying your knee into her back, you are aware of the crowd raining down boos and insults at you. Again, you don't care! In fact, you're enjoying this role - someone who can happily prove that men are stronger than women!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give up already?\" You murmur into her ear. The Japanese wrestler is still trying to shake off your submission hold. Finally, she does, rolling over and flipping you over at a high angle so that you hurtle to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth standing up at the same time, you stare at each other. Kairi has her 'no-nonsense face', making you back away slightly as she leaps forwards, aiming a flurry of palm strikes and back fists. You dodge a couple but wince as she plants a chop to your chest, still reddened earlier by Charlotte. She goes for a sharp back elbow, which you manage to sidestep and use the opportunity to shove her hard to the floor. Outsizing her by at least a foot and around 30 kilos, you send her sprawling to the mat, which causes the crowd to go a little hushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your arms out in a faux innocent way, grinning behind at Alexa who has her arms folded and a scowl on her face from the commentary desk. Sauntering over to Kairi, you grab hold of her right foot and begin to twirl it around, preparing the same leg lock you used to defeat Charlotte Flair! Kairi has enough heart to try shrugging you off, but your almighty shove to the mat has left her dazed and winded. Just as you start to wrap your leg around hers for further leverage, you start in surprise as Kairi suddenly begins to untie her boot. What is she...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course! By removing her boot she would be able to slip away from you! It is imperative that you drop down your weight on her now before she can slip away - plus the last thing you want to see is her nasty bare foot, no matter how small it is! Are you able to complete the rest of the manoeuvre before she slips her boot off?</span></div></div>",

With a grunt, you tighten your grip and drop down with authority, forcing the Japanese woman to let go of her shoe at once and cry out in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd begin to shower you with boos and jeers, but you do not care a jot. In fact, it makes you even more keen to show that you're not a pushover! You defeated Charlotte Flair, albeit because of her injury, and can now put away a second accomplished wrestler! Gritting your teeth, throwing your back against the mat, Kairi begins to hold her head in her hands, tears of frustration and agony rolling down her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on....tap already!\" You yell at her. Kairi Sane is not done yet though. With a tremendous effort, biting her lip as she does so, she managed to slowly turn you over, still in the throes of the submission hold though. \"Just tap! You're only gonna make it worse!\" You continue to berate her, even though you're facing opposite ways now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragging her petite body across the ring, Kairi somehow manages to make it to the ropes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rope break, c'mon!\" The referee shouts in your ear, tugging at your arms to release the hold. Reluctantly you do so, only to quickly grab Kairi's legs again, drag her into the middle of the ring and reapply the leg lock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis causes a fresh wave of hostile shouts of the crowd, which you shrug off and twist with all of your might to make this damned woman submit! Straight ahead of you, you suddenly catch Alexa's face. She looks absolutely livid, a thunderous look about her as she stands up and begins walking towards the ring apron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was sneaky, you jerk!\" Little Miss Bliss calls angrily out at you, arms folded and shaking her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad!\" You shout out in response, using every ounce of strength you possess to get Kairi to tap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe petite Japanese woman though is not quitting yet. She is throwing her arms manically about, trying to pull and force you off her but to no avail. Letting out a strangled sob, she finally, with her whole body trembling, smacks her hand against the mat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You've won another match, against two formidable women...is this all a bit too good to be true?</i> Is Goddess Sasha orchestrating all of this, or is Destiny helloing you somehow? Or maybe the goth was full of crap and you're actually becoming a successful, if dirty-playing wrestler!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bell rings, you finally loosen your grip, taking in some much-needed air and allowing your aching body to recover. Shuffling your legs back, you rise to your feet, feeling the several lumps and bruises you have cumulatively taken from Charlotte and Kairi. Still, it feels so good to be this dominant! Two wins in a row! Surely Alexa will admit that you're better than she expected...that she will allow you to have some fun with her after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding into the ring, ignoring Kairi and walking up to you, microphone in her hand, Alexa clears her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, two wins. And although that win wasn't so fluky like the one over Charlotte, it wasn't sporting.\" She smiles suddenly. \"A leaf out of my book, huh? So, this is what's gonna happen next...\"</span></div></div>",

Of course it's not Andrade, it's his Business Associate, the diminutive <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/gallery/zelina-vega-ring-gear-photos#fid-40246763\">Zelina Vega</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/gallery/zelina-vega-ring-gear-photos#fid-40246763\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>! Strutting confidently to the ring, you watch her with increasing excitement. This is the first of your three opponents that you've had a massive crush on! Only second to Alexa in how much you've fantasied over a female wrestler, you can't help but gawk at the beautiful woman heading towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man, the number of times you've jerked off to...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith barely a second to react, Zelina heads straight at you, throwing hard forearms to your chest from her short height - barely at five feet tall. Grimacing at her sharp contact to your chest, still lighted up by Charlotte's vicious chops, forcing you to stumble back a little. You grab her by the wrists, steadying her for a few moments. Zelina gives you a smouldering look, her nose wrinkling and eyes lighting up, which makes you practically gulp. It also proves to be a long enough distraction to allow her to wriggle free and slap you hard against the ear, deafening you briefly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively placing a hand over your boxed ear, you grunt in pain as Zelina mercilessly kicks you in the gut, forcing you down to one knee. Slightly taller than you now, Zelina grins, a devilish smile spread over her gorgeous face as she slaps you several times over, making your cheeks sting with pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is enough! </i> Zelina is more of a manager than wrestler, from what you've seen in the WWE at least. Being the shortest of all the female wrestlers in the locker room, she's rarely talked about as being the most talented fighter. Come on, you need to get a grip and stop allowing this crush to make you hold back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zelina goes for another vicious slap, you block it just in time, yanking her hand away and pushing her hard as you spring back to your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd boo angrily as Zelina practically seethes, shaking her head in disgust. \"You dare? You dare to touch me, you jerk?!\" She yells at you before running forward, her eyes narrowed in concentration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell what does she expect?! Before you can even prepare to defend, she amazingly wraps her legs around your neck and pulls off an incredible hurracanrana, essentially throwing your body directly towards the mat, while she flips over and is back on her feet, like a cat. Seeing stars and groaning in pain, you barely avoid a hard stomp from her boot. Pain exploding in your head, you futilely begin to attempt getting to your feet, collapsing back down each time while Zelina stomps you hard against the ribs. By the fourth stomp, you feel your ribs bruise and in risk of cracking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelina pauses for breath, turning to the crowd for an excited smattering of applause and cheers. Again, like Charlotte, she is typically a villain in the ring. Against you though, she's practically a hero!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw your match with Kairi...\" The Puerto-Rican woman tells you, pausing to knee you in the gut. \"She tried to take off her boots and you stopped her! Well, good luck stopping me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a squeal of excitement, Zelina takes a step back before effortlessly yanking off each wrestling boot, revealing her small feet, each toenail adorned with black varnish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no...!\" You find yourself yelling. Not her feet, not this woman who you've had a massive crush on...you can't let her ruin all that by using her bare feet on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe petite woman giggles. \"Ooh, you've got a problem with feet, that's it, isn't it?! Oh, don't you worry - by the time I've finished with you, you'll be <i>infatuated</i> with my feet!\" Zelina steps forward like a lioness, sensing its prey. With a giggle she lifts up a bare foot and hovers it over your face. It is slender and as feet go - not actually bad to look at. But it's still a nasty foot! Nursing your bruised ribs and various injuries from the three matches this evening, are you able to move out of the way in time?!</span></div></div>",

A cheddary stench immediately hits you as the boot flips over and knocks into your face. Growling with frustration, you throw the boot to one side and attempt to grab Kairi's other boot, while she is still recovering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a determined look on her face, Kairi uses her bare foot to nimbly swipe across the side of your face. Simultaneously, she leans forward to untie her left boot so now you have nothing to grip onto to perform your finishing move! Frustrated and angry, you attempt to pin Sane to the mat, using your greater strength to keep her shoulders in place. However, Kairi seems to sense that you're keen to stay well away from her feet, arching her legs back and wrapping her ankles around your neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar smile is back on the Japanese wrestler's face, while the crowd start chanting her name. All you can hear is the roar of \"KAIRI, KAIRI, KAIRI!\" Giggling a little, she twists her body to one side, then back to the other so that you drop to the mat, the side of your face pressed against the mat. Kairi slides her feet away before hopping to her feet and standing over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You not play fair!\" She says with a reproachful look on her face. \"You also not like my feet, huh?\" With another giggle, Kairi rolls you onto your back and grabs each of your hands, pulling you towards her whilst angling her foot so it is just in front of your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...no...!\" You cry in a faltering tone, a grimace on your face as you stare up at Kairi's pale sole. It is dainty, well-cared for and if you didn't hate feet so much - probably quite attractive! Yet, you can't look away, in horror and transfixed as her foot descends and begins to slide over your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat my feet!\" Kairi shouts down to you, yanking your arms up so hard that you feel them begin to ache - the one that was twisted by Charlotte earlier feels like it could snap! The worst part though is the fact that she's rubbing her nasty bare foot in your face! Your nostrils are assaulted with a dank, cheddary flavour...her feet are very sweaty and have been kept in those boots for God-knows-how-long!This is so humiliating, so demeaning! Kairi is tiny but she has the heart of the lion; she's taken on and defeated bigger opponents before but probably not decided to rub her feet in their face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is so confident now that she swaps between feet, giggling and beaming up the audience who are going absolutely wild with delight. Arms aching horribly and your face covered with Kairi's foot sweat, you can only groan as she happily hops down onto your belly. The Pirate Princess puts both feet fully in your face, scrunching her toes over your nose, restricting your breathing. She's having so much fun! She even hops back up suddenly to start 'walking the plank' across your body, from your legs to your face! When she steps off your face, lingering her feet there, she poses, angling up her peds, one at a time on your face, so that the soles flick up and down, bouncing impressively on her toes. A wet dream to some foot losers watching, no doubt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoroughly humiliated, you lie flat on the back, eyes closed and hoping that the torment will be over. Well, not quite. Kairi at devilish speed, leaps onto the top of the rope and prepares for her finishing move....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>THE INSANE ELBOW!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you see is a blur of cream and white before your heart nearly explodes in your chest. Crying out in agony, you barely have the strength to roll over, facedown on the mat and clutching one trembling hand over where she sharply dropped an elbow on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please....please...\" You whimper as Kairi kicks you over with her foot, grinning down at you. \"Please...finish it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKairi pauses, cocking her head to one side, a curious look on her face. Doe she show some mercy and pin you quickly?</span></div></div>",

For a few seconds you try to resist, but soon accept it, realising that it will hopefully speed up the humiliation. You're physically exhausted, completely beaten!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EAT HER FEET! EAT HER FEET!\" Rings out the entire arena as the chant builds to a crescendo; you close your eyes and hope that is is over soon!

Why didn't you stick with the goth girl rather than let your ego take over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKairi giggles as she caresses your cheeks with her dainty toes, a look of pity on her face at how easily she's dominating you now.

The smirk on her gorgeous face is difficult to watch but what else can you do! \"Crushed and beaten by women's feet...just the way it should be! Jerks like you deserve to be put in their place - at the feet of women like me and Kairi! I saw - we all saw what you did to Charlotte...\" Alexa glares at you for a moment as the crowd boos. \"That wasn't cool and now you're getting exactly what you deserve. Who wants to see his guy kiss Kairi's feet?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the crowd scream their approval while Kairi giggles, spreading her toes over you. \"You kiss my feet,\" she tells you straightforwardly. \"Then I will let you tap out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a fair offer and one you have to take considering that you have not one iota of strength left in you. Puckering up, you press a small, meek kiss in the centre of Kairi's right sole, then the left one. Alexa tosses her head back and cackles, wiping several tears away from her eyes. Feeling sick to your stomach, you let out a small whimper as Little Miss Bliss orders you to do it again. With no other choice, you do so, doing it in fact three times for each foot, so that the flavour of Kairi's feet is lingering on your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod of approval from Alexa, Kairi beams at you while suddenly pushing down hard with her feet over your face, so your nose and mouth become squashed and uncomfortable. The Japanese wrestler giggles while exerting more and more pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she wants a tap out. You raise your hand and pound it hard against the mat, repeatedly until Kairi finally relinquishes her pressure and steps off you, posing as The Pirate Princess while her music plays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa grins at you, a look of pure pleasure on her face. \"I win!\" She declares.

She looked up at you, chewing a gum while smirking and remaining silent. <br>\r\n\"Hey wassup babe?\" You cockily let out, feeling lucky this woman, popping out of nowhere saved you from an embarrassing situation. <br>\r\n\"I'm alright, do you mind following me so we get a drink or something?\" The cute girl raised her hand for you to grab but Destiny intervened and stepped in front of you to face the girl. <br>\r\n\"I see that's what I felt... You're one of them right? Cut the scene, you're not fooling anyone here.\" Destiny slowly speaks to the girl who answers with a cute chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, looks like the challenge might be interesting this time! One of those subbies has someone to protect him it seems!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need protection from anyone, I can handle myself, and if you don't tell me how to stop this nightmare I'll force you to.\" Albeit having felt a weird tingling sensation when the girl called you a sub, you still showed confidence and cracked your fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe petite girl still seemed impassive, and rather amused by all of this. \"Hm, it gets more interresting every second, let's play a game. I'll grant you one wish each if you manage to go through the game.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmpf, and what are you exactly? A Djinn or something? ha.\" You smugly blurt out but realised Destiny was taking this seriously, you decided to listen to the girl too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firsts things first, you'll remain trapped in this carnival as long as there isn't a winner, either you or us... You'll have to only win 5 games, but each time you lose, you get to have an handicap. You get the right to crawl back to me, and swirl your tongue around my toes in defeat to stop the challenge when you feel like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA picture of horror went through your head, if you felt disgusted at the idea, once again you also felt arousal thinking of it.

Think about it, you saw me after Goddess Sasha, she is clearly the one behind all of this. If you think you can handle this on your own, then go.

She is right that she appeared after Goddess Sasha, but she knows far too much to not be a part of this. That means at the best case scenario, she is one of Goddess Sasha's minions sent to try and break you. At the worst, she is much more than that! If you walk away, she will just hunt you down later. You need to eliminate these threats one person at a time, and it starts with Destiny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a single word, you dash towards her and tackle her to the ground with ease, your size providing a clear advantage as you physically overpower her.

You don't know which way to look, but as you look to the right you see the black boot of Destiny. Before you can let go of her write to grab the boot, it suddenly whips in front of you, along with the boot that is to your left. Destiny locks her legs around you and instantly you begin to feel a crushing weight closing in on your mid-section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urghhhhh\", you grunt as Destiny locks her ankles and continues to squeeze her legs together. You mind instantly thinks of James Bond in Golden Eye, when Xenia Onatopp crushes him between her legs. You remember him only just managing to escape her legs each time, but thinking what would happen if he was not able to get out... Unfortunately, with the position Destiny has you in, you may find out today!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, Mr Hot Shot doesn't seem so fucking hot now, does he?\" Destiny says to you. As you are still on top of her, you are forced to look her in the eyes as she crushes the life out of you. She squeezes her legs even harder, causing you to grunt again, struggling in her vice like leg hold. \"Are you ready to beg me for Mercy Ethan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around in desperation, hoping to see something you can use to free yourself. Or perhaps you can make a distraction or attack her and force her to release her hold?

So here's how it is. Goddess Sasha is a <i>seriously</i> powerful sorceress. She has been around for hundreds of years...if not more! Of course she doesn't age; she's immortal of course...\" Destiny tells you, as though this must seem obvious. \"Anyway, I've read about her - studied her, you could say. Goddess Sasha moves from town to town, country to country...all over the world; her mission is to put egotistical men in their place! Sometimes it will be in the guise of a fortune teller, like you would have seen this evening. Sometimes it could be in a derelict village, the other side of the world...or at a Las Vegas casino game....she is seriously powerful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK...but what...what's this got to do with me? And this carnival?\" You ask her, feeling skeptical that the raven-haired girl is winding you up still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came out of her tent. I saw you!

I have been monitoring her movements and energy for months...when I found out that she was coming here, to our town, at the annual carnival...\" She rolls her eyes again, but has an excited look about her. \"Well, I had to see for myself. In Wicca circles, she is like a major celebrity. All you need to worry about is appeasing her - not succumbing to her powers and allowing her to reduce you to a willing slave, but to show that you have learned something and that her magic has changed you for the better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her....willing slave?!\" You practically spit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan...everything around you is a mirage. The Carnival has been recreated by Goddess Sasha; everything has changed. Everyone here is just a pawn in her game - they may not be aware, but when she's done with you, they will forget everything but you won't! Well, she has some other associates...or 'lieutenants' as she calls them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you...what about you? And how do you know all this?\" You blurt out at her, starting to feel like what she's saying could be genuine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks, an air of pomposity about her. \"I've been studying the forces of nature for years, Ethan. I am at an advanced enough level to resist Goddess Sasha's magic; it has no effect on me. She has chosen YOU as her vessel, to toy with and to torture. She doesn't even need to do it herself - she will use people you know...not just your friends like that Casey girl, but other people. Celebrities, fictional characters...anyone at all that she can read and pluck from her mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling overwhelmed, you take a few deep breaths. If this weren't all true, then she has an incredibly creative imagination! Nodding at her, she looks pleased that you've accepted she is being honest with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what do we do?\" You ask her. The more time you spend with the goth, the more you grudgingly accept that she knows what she's talking about. \"And...why are you helping me?!\" It's a fair question - Destiny is not a friend; you actually actively disliked one another at school!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her eyes again, she gives you a knowing look. \"Can you imagine it? Me being the one to thwart a sorceress like Goddess Sasha...do you have any idea how much this will improve my powers and reputation?!\" Well, you buy it - she does seem so knowledgeable and is clearly motivated for her own gains, and is honest about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Destiny's plan of action?</span></div></div>",

You wonder if this Mystical Goddess could tell you how you will do at college. Maybe even see if you make it to the NBA! Your curiosity gets the better of you and you enter the tent... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Without a doubt, this proves to be the worst mistake of your life!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens when you meet Goddess Sasha and attempt to have your fortune told? Little do you know now but she has created a carnival based on your worst horrors. The Goddess has filled the carnival with ex girlfriends, enemies and rivals. She even manages to conjure up fictional characters that you've only ever read about in books or seen in movies... And they all have a common goal. To break you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother important factor is that Ethan has a serious hatred and revulsion for feet...expect that to be a major factor and obstacle on the journey!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Try to escape this carnival of horrors without being seduced, dominated, broken or even killed.

She is a Fortune Teller that is also a very powerful witch. She has the ability to manipulate minds, and enjoys putting arrogant men through hell. Her goal is to make men admit their inferiority to her and dedicate their lives to serving her for all eternity. Exotic and other-worldly, with a thick, foreign accent that's hard to place, this woman is both extremely attractive as well as dismissive and self-assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ibb.co/VWLkg9r\">Lisa</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://ibb.co/VWLkg9r\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> - Ethan's ex girlfriend who he broke up with a few months ago.

She is also on the cheerleading squad like Lisa, but is more confident and sassy. She believes she is a real princess and that every guy should wait on her hand and foot. For a guy not to worship the ground she walks on is considered a sin to her, a sin that should be punished!

Both of Lebanese descent from their Mum's side, these two girls are beautiful and glamorous. Big into feminism, which sounds contrary to their Arabic roots, they loathe Ethan and hate the fact that he can be an arrogant jerk. They used to tease him relentlessly and being older than him, ganged up on him, forcing him to paint their toenails and embarrass him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ibb.co/9bqL3Cs\">Casey</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://ibb.co/9bqL3Cs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> - Ethan's oldest friend, he has known her since he was 5 years old. She is now a very good looking young woman! They went through grade school and high school together, sharing a history that makes them inseparable. Both being very attractive young people, they have often flirted playfully with one another but never taken it further due to their extremely close friendship.

She was a goth, always dressed in black with dark make up and dirty thick black boots. Students would often joke that she had worn the same boots since she started high school, but little did they know that was actually true, they were the same boots. She dabbles in witch craft, voodoo magic and believes she has powers. Ethan doesn't know her too well, and she doesn't really know him that well either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ibb.co/TwpPqF1\">Miss Stephens</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://ibb.co/TwpPqF1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> - A young and attractive teacher just out of university, she was Ethan's Biology teacher from high school. She hates Ethan because she reminds him of the typical high school jocks that used to make fun of her when she was not so good looking back in high school. She actually failed Ethan in the hope that he would not get his scholarship, but was outraged to hear he was still offered the scholarship for his sporting ability. She would love to be the one to take him down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria - based on the real life <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/goddessvica\">Goddess Victoria</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://twitter.com/goddessvica\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> - A complete stranger, but this blonde sweetheart is so hot you can hardly stop yourself from drooling like a dog whenever you see her.

Proceed with caution! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Goddess Lucie and Goddess Bunny can pop into the story at any point! Ethan would not know or recognise them; they could manipulate him in any way possible! For them, they would be 'winning' if they brought Ethan, willingly grovelling to Goddess Sasha at her feet!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny other <b>fictional</b> or <b>celebrity characters</b> are welcome and encouraged! Goddess Sasha will scan what is in your mind to use against you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Goddess Sasha will only reappear in the story if she is a) about to defeat Ethan and have him accept becoming her slave or b) he is doing too well at resisting the various women he gets involved with and has to force him to submit herself!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Rules</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/yinyang.png\" alt=\"*Yinyang*\" title=\"Yinyang\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">Stick to second person and present tense <i>e.g. you see someone coming towards you</i>.<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/yinyang.png\" alt=\"*Yinyang*\" title=\"Yinyang\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">Ethan can have ANYONE from his life involved - the characters above, real-life celebrities or fictional characters.
