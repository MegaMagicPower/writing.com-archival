Even eaten alive, swallowed whole and digested.  Because of this bias against humans, digestion deaths tend to go unpunished.  Ash Ketchum doesn't care, though.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCharming for his age, he has set for himself an ambitious goal.  To bed and eat a woman from EVERY species of Pokemon.  He's one of the few humans with the ability to swallow others whole, an ability universal among Pokemon, and he's just cunning enough to avoid danger.  He knows it'll take a while.  But he plans to get every variant, every shiny, every FORM of a Pokemon digesting in his belly.  And he won't stop until his 'bellydex' is complete.  He even has a folder reserved for pictures of his belly after swallowing someone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYes, Ash Ketchum was ambitious.  He even swallowed his mother up on the day he was set to leave, spending the whole time digesting her and making her the first picture in his album, a shot of his belly he labeled 'Mom.'  Ash was no misogynist.  He recognized that each woman he planned to eat had their own lives and value.  He just didn't CARE, and thought of women as his favorite food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd so, the evil young boy went off to complete his bellydex...</span></div></div>",

He was dressed simply for his journey, a black t-shirt and blue jeans, a blue jacket with short white sleaves, a red and white cap, and green fingerless gloves.  He had a backpack with extra food and water in it, as well as basic camping supplies, and he had a bicycle parked nearby.  He patted his belly, which was still a little plump from devouring his mother, playing with the soft, squishy As he admired the picture, he heard a voice behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Your own Mom?  Nice,\" said the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsh blinked, and turned around, seeing a pudgy Pikachu boy around the same age as him.  He was a bit fatter than Ash, sporting a wider gut, but he was dressed similarly, save for his jacket being red with white sleeves, his gloves being black, and his cap having a different design.  \"Relax, kid,\" the Pikachu said.  \"I'm not gonna eatcha.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Don't call me kid,\" Ash said.  \"If you're not the same age as me, I'll suck my own dick.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Pikachu laughed.  \"Okay, okay, sorry.  Name's Red,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah, I noticed a color motif,\" Ash said, smirking.  \"Ash Ketchum.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Pleasure to meet you,\" Red said.  \"I saw that you titled that gallery 'Bellydex.'  Goin' for the full list?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And shinies, and alternate forms,\" Ash said, scrolling through the list he'd set up.  \"I'm going to have a COMPLETE 'dex.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Ambitious, for a human,\" Red said, nodding.  \"Even if you are one that can eat others like Pokemon can.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsh smiled.  \"I have my ways,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And what about when you meet someone your ways don't work on?\" Red asked, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...I'll figure something out,\" Ash said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRed scoffed.  \"Yeah, sure,\" he said.  \"What you need, m'friend, is a bodyguard.  Someone to help you catch your prey.  You goin' for a single gender?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"All girls,\" Ash confirmed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"All right, fair enough,\" Red said.  \"Which probably means I'm safe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Never assume,\" Ash said, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRed grinned.  \"Oh, I definitely like you,\" he said.  \"Anyway, what I'm saying is this - I wanna help you fill out your 'dex.  I'll keep others off you while you eat, and if need be knock out anyone too tough for you.  It'll be good training.  Plus I might find a Thunder Stone along the way, which would be awesome\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsh looked surprised.  \"...Seriously?\" he asked.  \"What's the catch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I get to fuck 'em,\" Red said.  \"Plus sometimes I want to fuck them into your mouth.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...And if you end up with your dick in my mouth?\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm bi and your cute,\" Red said, grinning and waggling his eyebrows.  \"I wouldn't mind at all.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsh blushed.  \"W-Well... We'll discuss that later,\" he said.  \"I do admit it'd be easier if I had help, since aside from being able to eat people, I don't have a Pokemon's power.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRed nodded.  \"So we're in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah,\" Ash said.  \"Welcome to the team.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Nice,\" the Pikachu said.  \"You won't regret it.\"  </span></div></div>",

They and the other two Digimon Sovereigns, Baihumon and Ebonwumon, managed to defeat the D-Reaper and destroy it before it became too powerful, although just barely, leaving them very weak.  But tiny bits of the D-Reaper survived.  Little blobs of red goo eventually making their way to the human world, some of them fading.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSeveral, however, lasted much longer.  Long enough for two Digimon to find them.  Specifically, the partner Digimon of Rika Nonaka and Takato Matsuda.  Character development they and their Tamers had during the D-Reaper saga happened in a different way, but their relationships with their Tamers were just as close as they were in the world you know.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon and Guilmon stared at the floating blobs curiously.  They seemed harmless enough, and just bobbed around in midair when they were touched.  Neither sexy fox Digimon or naive lizard Digimon could make sense of them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Well, they're certainly squishy,\" Renamon said, holding one of the blobs and squeezing it.  She tossed it aside and wiped her hand on the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGuilmon looked at the blobs, then at Renamon, then back at the blobs.  \"...I dare you to eat one,\" he said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon gave him a confused look.  \"Excuse me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I saw it on a show,\" Guilmon said, grinning.  \"I think it was an American show... something called 'Jackass.'  They dared people to do things.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon quirked an eyebrow.  \"You're taking things from a show called 'Jackass.'\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It was funny!\" Guilmon said.  \"This one guy put a big jellyfish on his back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon's jaw dropped.  \"...Guilmon, jellyfish are potentially lethal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGuilmon blinked.  \"Really?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon nodded.  \"YES!\" she said, incredulous, explaining jellyfish toxin to him.  Guilmon's batwing-like ears drooped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I didn't know that...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon shook her head.  \"Just because someone on the television is doing something stupid, doesn't mean either of us should!\" she said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGuilmon nodded.  He understood... intellectually.  But he really wanted to see Renamon eat one of the blob things for some reason.  \"Well, okay.  If you're too scared to...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon scowled.  \"I fear nothing,\" she said, offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Then why don't you eat one?\" Guilmon said, smiling innocently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon sputtered.  \"Because I don't want to!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Scardeymon,\" Guilmon said, remembering a taunt Impmon used on him one time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I AM NOT AFRAID!\" Renamon said angrily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Then eat it!\" Guilmon insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAngry, and not thinking straight, Renamon growled.  \"You know what?  FINE!  I will!\" she said.  She grabbed two of the floating red blobs and stuck them in her mouth.  They wriggled about for a moment on her tongue, and she swallowed them, a brief glow of red passing down her throat.  \"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon blinked.  Guilmon frowned.  \"How'd they taste?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Like nothing,\" Renamon said, shrugging.  \"This was completely pointless.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Awww,\" Guilmon said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon shook her head, mad at herself for Guilmon goading her into the dare.  \"I'm going home,\" she said, flash stepping away.  Meanwhile, inside her stomach, the D-Reaper bits she swallowed were digested, intigrating with her code permanently, changing her.  And as she was changed, Rika's Digivice briefly glowed red, Reaper code merging with her as well...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tTo say that Kyle Zork was not a nice person was putting it mildly.  The Zoroark was so psychotically evil, he became a Shadow Pokemon without any need for an external influence.  Tall for his breed, six foot seven, the red on his claws and mane were actually a ghostly white, his fur darker shades of black.  His eyes were red with green irises, and a demented smirk was on his face.  He dressed casually, black sweatpants and a black t-shirt with a zipper down the front, wearing shoes modified to let his footpaw claws free.  He was a pure predator in every sense of the work, and his belly, a round, soft bulge of fat, reflected that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t(Granted, zipper front shirts were also a hallmark of predators in this world.)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe liked to eat, and he liked sex.  If he could fit his dick in a hole, he'd fuck it.  Consent was not necessary in his eyes.  He very rarely ate normal food, preferring something he could attack, violate, and eat.  He'd eat anyone.  Adults, teens, children, no matter what their line of work was, no matter how fat or thin they were, he'd gobble them up.  Some of his favorite snacks were the babies of inattentive mothers.  If he saw someone with a stroller, chatting away on her phone, he'd use his illusion powers to disappear and grab the child out of their stroller, turning them into a bulge in his belly.  By the time they noticed their child was gone, he'd be halfway down the block.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSometimes, Kyle would torment his prey.  He'd gulp down their family members one by one and make them rub his belly, feeling them digest inside his gut or balls.  In the latter case, he'd force his target to give him a blowjob and cum their family down their throat.  He got off on being hated as much as he got off on being feared or causing pain.  And because he loved being hated so much, willing prey disgusted him.  He'd go out of his way to torment them and make them hate him, and he wouldn't always eat them.  Sometimes he'd just knock them up and let them carry his children, some of whom he'd eat later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe was evil.  He was psychotic.  He wasn't stupid, though.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIf faced with someone with more power or skill, or he wasn't in a position to ambush and disable them, he would back down.  He would also form casual relationships with other predators.  He wasn't above faking normal behavior to make friends.  And if they enjoyed his wickedness, he'd become true friends with them, engaging in casual sex.  One of his closest friends was a Blaziken who ran a gymnasium, and frequently provided alibies and a place for him to rest between meals.  She got off on his cruelty, quite literally, the two meeting after he spotted her masturbating to violating one of his future meals.  She eagerly let him fuck his meal down her throat, and the two had been inseparable ever since.  So close were they that they were actually thinking about having kids... (Marriage, both of them thought, was not necessary.)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKyle was a predator in every sense of the word.  And he was perfectly content with his life.  </span></div></div>",
