His first Pokemon was a Salazzle he had raised from a Salandit.  And the two were in love with each other.  Andrew was a handsome man, buff from years of adventuring, with dark brown hair that he kept shaved short and stubble from a beard.  He generally wore sweatpants, boots, and a tattered t-shirt with holes in it.  Technically speaking, he was a gym leader.  Although his 'gym' was wherever he decided to be at the time, the Pokemon Leagues of various regions recognized his status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe liked living off of the land, although he had a house back in Maldash.  He was a skilled survivalist, he and his Salazzle capable of handling almost anything.  The thing was? Andrew was only mildly attracted to human females.  He was, however, VERY attracted to female Pokemon.  He never broadcast it, never made a big deal out of it.  But he and his Salazzle not only loved each other, they were also lovers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Salazzle was also a naughty sort, and tended to use her pheromones to find Andrew many Pokemon lovers.  He had girls on every continent, and wondered if he'd managed to get any of them pregnant.  As when he visted those regions again, his lovers always seemed to remember him fondly.  Life was good.  He had his Salazzle, he had his supplies, he had his lovers, and he had his freedom.  Everything was going to be fine...</span></div></div>",

They and the other two Digimon Sovereigns, Baihumon and Ebonwumon, managed to defeat the D-Reaper and destroy it before it became too powerful, although just barely, leaving them very weak.  But tiny bits of the D-Reaper survived.  Little blobs of red goo eventually making their way to the human world, some of them fading.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSeveral, however, lasted much longer.  Long enough for two Digimon to find them.  Specifically, the partner Digimon of Rika Nonaka and Takato Matsuda.  Character development they and their Tamers had during the D-Reaper saga happened in a different way, but their relationships with their Tamers were just as close as they were in the world you know.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon and Guilmon stared at the floating blobs curiously.  They seemed harmless enough, and just bobbed around in midair when they were touched.  Neither sexy fox Digimon or naive lizard Digimon could make sense of them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Well, they're certainly squishy,\" Renamon said, holding one of the blobs and squeezing it.  She tossed it aside and wiped her hand on the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGuilmon looked at the blobs, then at Renamon, then back at the blobs.  \"...I dare you to eat one,\" he said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon gave him a confused look.  \"Excuse me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I saw it on a show,\" Guilmon said, grinning.  \"I think it was an American show... something called 'Jackass.'  They dared people to do things.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon quirked an eyebrow.  \"You're taking things from a show called 'Jackass.'\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It was funny!\" Guilmon said.  \"This one guy put a big jellyfish on his back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon's jaw dropped.  \"...Guilmon, jellyfish are potentially lethal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGuilmon blinked.  \"Really?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon nodded.  \"YES!\" she said, incredulous, explaining jellyfish toxin to him.  Guilmon's batwing-like ears drooped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I didn't know that...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon shook her head.  \"Just because someone on the television is doing something stupid, doesn't mean either of us should!\" she said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGuilmon nodded.  He understood... intellectually.  But he really wanted to see Renamon eat one of the blob things for some reason.  \"Well, okay.  If you're too scared to...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon scowled.  \"I fear nothing,\" she said, offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Then why don't you eat one?\" Guilmon said, smiling innocently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon sputtered.  \"Because I don't want to!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Scardeymon,\" Guilmon said, remembering a taunt Impmon used on him one time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I AM NOT AFRAID!\" Renamon said angrily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Then eat it!\" Guilmon insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAngry, and not thinking straight, Renamon growled.  \"You know what?  FINE!  I will!\" she said.  She grabbed two of the floating red blobs and stuck them in her mouth.  They wriggled about for a moment on her tongue, and she swallowed them, a brief glow of red passing down her throat.  \"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon blinked.  Guilmon frowned.  \"How'd they taste?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Like nothing,\" Renamon said, shrugging.  \"This was completely pointless.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Awww,\" Guilmon said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon shook her head, mad at herself for Guilmon goading her into the dare.  \"I'm going home,\" she said, flash stepping away.  Meanwhile, inside her stomach, the D-Reaper bits she swallowed were digested, intigrating with her code permanently, changing her.  And as she was changed, Rika's Digivice briefly glowed red, Reaper code merging with her as well...</span></div></div>",
