You didnt even get to take off your jacket and unbutton your shirt. Then again, what's the point?<br>\r\nEtna wrapped her arms around you in an almost loving embrace even though you just met her a few minutes ago (or maybe Etna's been stalking you for quite a while and you just never noticed! You'd expect that from a demon!). You felt obligated to wrap your arms around her back and return the embrace! It was kind of a cute moment to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little nervous, being your first time and all, but you swallowed down your fears and stared the red-headed imp in her big red and eyes with confidence like a true hero would!<br>\r\n\"You ready to do this?\" you politely asked your partner.<br>\r\nEtna just snickered, \"Ready? I was getting bored from the stupid monolog! Now stick it in, already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am,\" you obediently replied and carefully positioned your shaft between the lips of her nether-mouth and slowly and carefully pushed it in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GEEEEYYYAAAAGG!!!!\" Whoa! Etna let out a loud piercing shriek as she squeezed on your jacket! Man, you didnt expect to be that fragile!<br>\r\n\"A...are you ok?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!\" she gritted her teeth at you and glared, \"keep going!\"<br>\r\nBeing obedient as you are, you squeezed your dick in there even deeper until.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FffUUUuu.... cckk!!!\" the imp bit down on your collar trying to hold back another scream! Yikes, was it hurting THAT much? You felt lukewarm blood dripping down from between her legs. Oh dear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...a...are you sure youre alright?\" you started to get concerned, \"you look like youre in pain.\"<br>\r\n\"I SAID I'M FINE!\" Etna roared, \"...eggh... stupid... human!\" Her eyes were squinting. She was not fine.<br>\r\n\"Look, m-maybe we should stop. I-I dont wanna hurt you-\"<br>\r\n\"God, what are ya, a damn saint?!\" she sneered at you, \"I told you I'm the most powerful demon in the Netherworld! This pain is nothing to me! NOW QUIT STALLING ALREADY!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst your better judgement, you did as you were told. You started off very slow and gently, lightly thrusting back and forth in a calming motion, but the vaginal walls squeezed tightly against your dick as Etna bit her lip, trying to prevent another shriek coming on!<br>\r\n\"G....god...d...damn.... fucking....\" she groaned as your cock was brutally ravaging her insides! She was obviously not liking this. Maybe she underestimated her abilities or your well endowedness. Maybe a human is incompatible with an imp and all youre doing is causing damage to her! You started feeling guilty, but she asked for it and wouldnt take no for an answer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to take her mind off the intense pain by kissing her and running your fingers against her exquisitely flat chest. Heck, you even ran your tongue up and down each of her tiny tits, but the brief moment of pleasure was nothing compared to the intense agony her twaut was suffering! You couldnt take your eyes off the tears running down her ruby-colored eyes. You cant believe how miserable your very first time is feeling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna, sensing your mental resistance, got angry. \"Geez, do I have to do EVERYTHING myself?!\" She glared and shrugged before shoving you down against the floor and mounting you! She pinned your arms against the ground and assumed the stance of the cowgirl, glaring down at you with dominance. Her dominating facade couldnt hide the tears in her eyes though!<br>\r\nNonetheless, she thrusted herself against your cock, riding it up and down, forcing it to squeeze into gaps it probably didnt belong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEeeessshh!!!\" you gritted your teeth at how tight and warm it felt! Her pussy was amazing. You could feel your cock lighting sparks inside her! Etna twitched as she rode you, trying to savor the pleasure despite being unable to withstand the pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...H...HOW DOES IT FEEL, HUMAN?!\" she flashed a menacing grin as her tears came down over you,  \"TELL ME! HOW DOES IT....eer....FEEL TO LOSE YOUR... PRECIOUS VIRGINITY TO A DEMON?! TO HAVE YOUR...gawd... SACRED FIRST TIME...rrrROBBED FROM YOU BY AN UNG-G-GODLY APP-uuuhh-RITION OF HELL?! TO HAVE YOUR FIRSTBORN BECOME A FULL FLEDGED DEMON WHO WILL ONE DAY GROW UP AND BECOME OVEeeeeeRLORD OF YOUR....PITIFUL WoOOOooRLD?! TELL MEeeee!!!\"<br>\r\nHer words didnt frighten you as much as her struggling did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, you answered, \"T-T-T-TIGHT..... IT FEELS... SO...T...TIGHT!!\"<br>\r\nEtna lowered her head down at you and smiled, continuing her menacing facade, \"Oh... so you like it, then? You enjoy being... toyed with? It must be a....gahh... blessing to become a breeding tool for Overlord Beeeeeauty Queen Etna! Her exquisite pussy is much more pleasuring than any bland human's can offer you! Drown in her pleasure! Become a slave to it! Know that I-JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!!!\" Unfortunately, unlike you, she couldnt keep it up (ba dum PISH)! She scratched her nails against the carpet and twitched. Once again, you couldnt stop staring at her crying eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-look... maybe we should just stop,\" you tried to talk sense into her, \"this isnt working out. Youre hurting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last damn time.... shut.. UP!\" Etna ignored your pleas.<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna...augh... warn you again, vassal!\" she threatened, \"if you dont impregnate me...geee.... I'm gonna tear your dick off and give it to a prinny!\" What's a prinny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, vassal or not, you were getting worried about this imp. You coulda sworn sex wasnt supposed to be THIS excruciating! She's obviously biting off more than she could chew. But you heard what she said. She wants a kid and youre gonna give it to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realize the grip she has on your arms isnt very strong. She seems to be using most of her strength trying to endure the fuck. If you want, you could just push her off you. Then again, common sense tells you angering a Demon Overlord is hazardous to your health. On the OTHER hand, incompatible sex might be hazardous to HER health!</span></div></div>",

She grabbed you by the wrists and took off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause you were flying high and fast, Etna being a speed freak trying to balance out your weight, you didn't get the best view of Hell, aside from the plains and rocks and fire and various beings scattered about. It was only a minute before you reached a massive, ancient, intimidating castle, clearly Etna's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flew straight at a terraced balcony and through an open pair of French doors, coming to a halt in the air. She let go of you, which sent you onto her queen-sized bed. It was incredibly soft and plushy, with purple silk sheets, ornately-carved and darkly-painted posts, a beautiful canopy with tassels lining the edges, and big plump pillows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna dropped to the floor, which you noticed had several absolutely gorgeous carpets (probably Persian) on it. As Etna moved over to a writing desk with a heavy, old-looking book on it, you took a moment to examine her chamber: She had a couple bookcases against a wall, with some dusty volumes, scrolls, and glass spheres sparsely populating them. A small table held a human skull with a crimson candle (halfway melted down). There was also a large map on the wall opposite the bookcases, detailing the geography and landmarks of Hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha!\" Etna cried out, pumping a fist in the air. \"I knew I was forgetting a couple of details!\" She strode towards her bathroom with a grin on her face. \"I just need to get myself ready. Take your clothes off while I'm powdering up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed the heavy wooden door shut, and you heard her goofing around inside. Not having much choice, you strip, leaving your clothes on the floor. After several minutes, the noises from the bathroom stop and Etna flings the door open.</span></div></div>",

You dropped your fridge-I mean rock as you froze stiff in place as if your life was flashing before your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reliving your life in mere seconds, the last thought that raced in your mind was that arrow that almost turned through your face like William Tell\u2019s apple.

As the smoke cleared, you picked yourself up off the ground and came up with a clear conclusion: wherever you are, you have just made an incredibly powerful enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFREEZE, FIEND!! PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of powerful enemy, you overheard the shout of a loud high-pitched feminine shout attempting a fa\u00e7ade of dominating authority. It sounded too cute to be threatening, but explosive arrows are still explosive arrows.<br>\r\nThe dust clear and before you stood a short young(looking) blonde girl with blue eyes, a cute blue bow in her hair, wearing what seems to be a white sleeveless choir-girl dress and little white wings sticking out her back! Aww\u2026 a cute little angel\u2026 who\u2019s got an angry look on her face\u2026 and had a little bow with another pink heart arrow pointed at your throat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa whoa whoa!

It\u2018s all listed in the Top Ten Most Wanted Bounties compliments of Hunter H. Hunterson &amp; Ted Corporation, the universe\u2019s world renown bounty hunting agency!\u201d she pulled out a piece of paper and read it out, \u201cKing Nightmare, the Nightmare King. The most feared self-proclaimed Dark Lord in the universe wanted for comprising against governing officials, staging wars between the humans demons and celestials, and single-handedly creating the uprise of galactic anarchy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap.

You never even left your home state!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs an angel of justice, it is my duty to see you brought to justice!\u201d she pointed to you and gave you that serious determined expression, \u201cit has absolutely nothing to do with the 2,000,000,000,000 HL reward for your capture! \u2026Or the fact that I\u2019m in desperate need of paying back a friend after I kinda blew up his castle! Nope!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I think there\u2019s some sort of a mistake,\u201d you try to remain calm despite that arrow, \u201cI\u2019m not this King Nightmare youre looking for.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHA! Typical liar!\u201d Flonne of course didn\u2019t believe you, \u201cyou cant fool me! I got your picture RIGHT here!\u201d She showed you the picture on that paper she was reading off of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squinted your eyes at the picture of King Nightmare. He was, to say the least, nowhere NEAR looking like you! His skin was paler than yours, he had unusually bleached white hair with a white goatee and you cant even so much as grow a mustache, his eyes were purple with abnormally large pupils, he has purple glowing veins spouting across his forehead, and his teeth in his devious grin were whiter and shinier than yours\u2026 and had fangs!<br>\r\nHow the heck could angel confuse you with THAT?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 looks nothing like me!\u201d you object.<br>\r\n\u201cQuit your denial,\u201d Flonne ordered, \u201cit\u2019s obvious youre one and the same!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTHAT\u2026 LOOKS NOTHING LIKE ME!\u201d you repeated, \u201cNOTHING!\u201d You immediately regret raising your voice the moment she pulled her bowstring back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough!\u201d said Flonne, \u201cthis is your last chance! Give yourself up nice and easy, Nightmare, or I shall be forced to smite you\u2026 with the power of LOVE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no use. You were clearly not the person she was looking for, but she was not gonna listen. Perhaps it\u2019d be best to turn yourself over and hope the authorities she\u2019s turning you in to will get it through her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could just refuse and run away. That\u2019s cool, too.</span></div></div>",

mauled again...\"Said our hero,as he started to take note that the cat girls,where on constant patrol.Luckily,they all got their clothes back...sadly,they didn't find the thief.If they don't find this guy soon,our Hero may find a quick end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where,he could be.\"The Cat saber said,as she looked under a tiny pebble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He couldn't have gotten too far.Maybe he saw you,then decided to hide somewhere.A place no one expects.\"Our hero suggested,rubbing a finger his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where no one expects,eh?\"Said a voice,which our hero quickly turned to the top of the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was the voice female,the body was female too.This girl basically had an hourglass figure,with round hips,and C-cup breasts,covered by a red bra,but the bra looks like it can snap at any moment.She was also wearing a hat,with two holes in it,and it had stitches near the bottom.The stitches were in a curve,that looks like a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remind me,when I was younger.\"She giggled,as she slowly swayed her legs.She was sitting on the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...that's a weird way to introduce yourself.\"Our hero said.Despite her rather large size,she was able to front flip of the roof,and land in front of our hero,with out even toppling over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,excuse me.How do you want me to introduce myself,Mr.I-know-how-to-greet-people.\"She said,as she crossed her arms and turned her head away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...but,besides that,what are you doing here?\"He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I overheard about you being framed,for my rival's doing.The name's Shelly,by the way.\"She said,wagging her finger,but she still had her head turned away.She even had her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rival...at least you didn't confuse me,for your rival...so that's good...\"He said,relived.The girl but on a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"She started,rubbing a hand behind her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found him!Yes!\"Our hero,and the girl had turn all of their attention to the Cat Saber...who was playing with a yarn ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...that's a yarn ball.\"Our hero said.The Cat Saber stopped playing the ball,and started to hug her yarn ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just a Yarn ball...it's Mr.Yarny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>That will explain the 'him' part.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...anyways,who's your rival?\"The hero asked,which Shelly shoved a picture into our hero's chest.He quickly took the picture,and examined what was on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently,this guy did look like our hero.Pale skin,blue pants,brown pants,blonde hair,and a blue shirt.The only thing different about this guy,was that he was wearing the same hat,except his was blue,plus he was wearing a cape,and there was a noticeable pocket along his belt.It looks like a gun was sticking out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...not only is this guy ironic,but he's dangerous,too.\"Our hero said,as he face turned into a giant frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not that strong,if you ask me.\"Shelly said,as she took the picture back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you need to be strong?A gun could instantly kill us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you're weak enough.For me,however,I have one too.\"She said,as she pulled out a red a purple striped gun,that looked too heavy for one hand.However,she was holding it with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Our hero was shocked,when he was told of something unreal.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,stop calling me the hero!My name is Kyle!Get it right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Okay,okay...jeez.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways,do you know where your rival could be?\"Kyle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know exactly where,he could be!Why would you ask such a question,about my ultimate rival,when I am sworn to defeat him,wh--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,yeah,yeah...let's just go already!\"Kyle shouted...but then realized something...how is he suppose to go against someone,who has a gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...I need something to defend myself against him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...you're quick to catch on...hey,you!Yemen!\"She quickly called out,which the Cat Saber quickly stood in front of Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gun time!Nya~!\"Yemen said,as she sprang up into the air...and didn't seem to return...but then she came crashing onto the ground,but her body looked completely stoned,and she was holding a yellow tube of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...this is cool...but at the same time strange...\"Kyle said,as he examined his newly developed friend,turning a flipping her.He soon found a little chipped of piece,below the yellow tube,near the part where it bend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,there's a chipped off piece here.\"Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch it!It's the trigger!\"Kyle backed his hand away,when Yemen said that.Good thing she did,because he would have gotten his head blown off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you have a weapon,let's get going!\"Shelly yelled with excitement,as she grabbed Kyle by his shirt,and dragged him along with her on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>And so,Kyle,Shelly,and Yemen,set out on a quest to find the bandit,and clear his name.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...his hiding spot isn't far from here.\"Shelly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Oh...then never mind about the quest thing.</b></span></div></div>",

You were one of the human resistance's finest soldiers. A star pupil of one of the greatest Demon Hunting agencies in the world, you were a hell of a weapon against the hellish oppressors! Heck, that rock you mistook for a fridge was your patented Lucky Rock which you used to bludgeon the dreaded Maderas to death at the Battle of New Hope City. That's right, you killed a vampire general by beating his friggin head in with a rock until he stopped moving! It was epic! Shame it was the ROCK that got a medal. (The human resistance made a great enlistment campaign after it: 'LET'S ROCK THEIR NETHERWORLD! JOIN THE RESISTANCE TODAY!')<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything after that's a blur. Er... train ride... explosion... drunken gypsy... tentacles.... 40HL. Next thing you knew, here you are. In the middle of a dark, gloomy, creepy wasteland. No humans in sight. Just eerie glowing eyes surrounding you, glaring your direction.<br>\r\n\"Aw... crap,\" you whispered to yourself as you attempting to reach for a bottle of booze in your fridge and remembering last minute it's STILL a rock! A whoop-ass rock, but a rock nonethless! So the Netherworld demons finally caught up to you. You took a deep breath and made a silent prayer in your head, ready to go down fighting with your bare fists!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DOOD! CHECK IT OUT!\" you heard a high pitch shout of excitement from one of the silhouettes, \"IT'S THE SMASHER!!\"<br>\r\n\"Smasher?\" you silently muttered to yourself.<br>\r\n\"The Smasher?! No way, dood!\" a similar high-pitch voice replied, \"THE Smasher?! The same Smasher that jumped off the roof of a 10 story burning building to deliver a dropkick to Hoggmeiser on the ground floor?!\"<br>\r\n\"The same Smasher dood that jumped into a lake of man-eating piranhas and communicated with them the order to sink serpent battleships?!\"<br>\r\n\"The very same Smasher that singlehandedly defeated a Majin in hand-to-hand combat by kicking him in the balls so hard, his head exploded?! Dood!!\"<br>\r\n\"The same Smasher that swallowed a dragon?!\"<br>\r\n\"The one Smasher that can talk to the dead... and teach them broadway musicals?!\"<br>\r\n\"The Smasher guy that if you spell his real name backwards, he rips your eyes out and mails them to your mom?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow... you were aware there's a lot of rumors going on about you but GEEZ!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The very same...\" said a much older, more sophisticated male's voice coming from the much taller silhouette. The moon shined bright, lighting up the shadows. You found yourself surrounded by those godawful stupid jihadist stitched penguins!<br>\r\n\"Prinnies...\" you gritted your teeth at the name of those abominations! You were sickened by these things! For all you know, those could be the souls of your fallen friends and comrades that have been corrupted and reduced to these shells by the damn Overlords! With them stood a tall robed figure in a dark cloak and garb covering all but his glowing yellow eyes and abnormally long gray untrimmed fingers and thumbs.<br>\r\n\"Mr. Smasher,\" the sophisticated robed gentlemen spoke, \"my master requires your presence immediately.\"<br>\r\n\"He says the boss wants to see ya, dood!\" one of the prinnies 'translated'!<br>\r\n\"Will you sign my rock, dood?!\" another prinny handed you his rock. You groaned, but signed the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Boom!!!* Suddenly thunder struck and lightning flashed!<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAahahahahahaha!!!\" on cue with the equally thunderous evil little boy laugh! \"one of the weakling mortals' greatest warriors... right here in my domain! Move aside, lackies!\"<br>\r\nThe robed gentleman and a few prinnies moved aside and gave room for the Big Bad... er... Small Bad blue haired shirtless brat Overlord himself! You recognize this guy from all the propaganda posters! The two antennae-like hair strands and red scarf gave this particular Overlord away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LAHARL!!\" just saying his name struck fear in your soul! His dominating aura was just as overwhelming as you imagined it... although you never thought he was THIS puny in real life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis red eyes stared deep into yours as he approached you with a menacing grin. \"The one and only! And you must be the great Smasher himself! One of the other bugs from the lame mortal resistance that's actually giving me a CHALLENGE!\"<br>\r\n\"And he brought with him his Lucky Rock, my lord,\" the robed man quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well! Guess we can say his just luck run out! ....LAUGH!!\" Laharl demanded. The rest of his prinny crew started chuckling or pretended to.<br>\r\n\"Hahah...uh... good one, dood!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, very amusing indeed, my lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonally, you thought 'Rock Their Netherworld' was funnier. But now was not the time for jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you plan to do to me,\" you looked down at the twerp lord, \"make it quick!\"<br>\r\n\"He is as brave as he is rumored to be,\" the robed man commented.<br>\r\nLaharl snickered, \"He certainly is, Nic! He'll make a great tool!\" Tool?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what he meant by 'tool'. Well, technically you DID because of the choice you selected for this chapter, but anyways!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally, I could just simply kill you here and now,\" Laharl warned you, \"preferably bash your head in with a rock like ya did good ol' Maderas, then pour whatever's left of your unspilled brains into a prinny skull!\"<br>\r\nThe prinnies got all excited from hearing that!<br>\r\n\"Ya hear that dood?! One of us is gonna get Smasher brains!\"<br>\r\n\"I hope it's me! I wanna rip an angel's wings off and fly over Los Angeles with them, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glare from Laharl made the penguins shut up.<br>\r\n\"...However,\" he spoke, \"it'd be an awful waste of perfectly good potential! I've got a particular job position that requires YOUR special abilities with your name on it!\"<br>\r\nYou squinted your eyes off him, ready to snub off his job offer. \"I'd sooner die than be a servant of the likes of YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your tongue, lad,\" the robed gentleman warned, \"less you want it ripped from your jaw.\"<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Nic,\" Laharl wasnt offended, \"actually, I wasnt asking you to be a servant. This er... particular I have in mind is something the rest of your worthless kind can only DREAM of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, now?\" you played alone.<br>\r\nLaharl nodded, \"You see... my girl subordinates are a real fickle bunch. Especially around this time of year. You see, unlike the guys, their behaviors are pretty hostile, primitive, and especially unruly. When theyre not given the proper satisfaction to certain desires, they make for an unorganized group. And an unorganized group means an unorganized army. And an unorganized army means a WEAK army!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I follow.\"<br>\r\n\"You see,\" Nic tries to explain, \"the females of this season tend to be what you humans call 'in heat'. The peak of potential reproduction. What my lord seeks is a proper designated stallion for his female soldiers to nourish themselves with to sate their primordial urges.\"<br>\r\nYou blinked at Nic's philosophical explanation.<br>\r\n\"He wants ya to bow-chika-wow-wow 'em, dood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened and your jaw dropped! \"YOU... YOU WANT ME TO BE A SEX-SLAVE TO YOUR DEMONS?!\" How disgusting! Tempting, but disgusting! The Smasher himself reduced to siring his enemies' hellspawn?!<br>\r\n\"Youre a great warrior! You should be honored to have this opportunity!\" Laharl commented, \"And with you ka-boinking my minions, not only will they continue fighting strong, but with your strong genes, you'll provide me with future top-class soliders to add to the army! HAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!!\"<br>\r\n\"...But... in that case. Youre a high-ranked Overlord,\" you remarked, \"why couldnt YOU just fuck 'em?\"<br>\r\nLaharl suddenly stopped laughing and got a little nervous... \"Uh... well... um that is...\" his face got red and started sweating, \"normally I would, but you see...\"<br>\r\n\"My lord sadly has no time for such matters,\" Nic covered for him, \"he is far too busy planning his next steps toward victory to do so.\"<br>\r\n\"But I thought you said it's cuz boobies scare hi-BOOOOOM!!!\" the prinny suddenly exploded before he could finish! Nic wiped off the excess dead prinny off his cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaharl gritted his teeth, \"Grr... and as you can see, the males I already got arent of much use! Now enough chat! Will you accept my generous job offer? Or would you rather die a slow, horrible, agonizing death?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the brat. Will you agree to be a sex-slave to his female demon minions?! Or will the great Smasher go down fighting?!</span></div></div>",

This guy's got a big job to do!\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Flonnes eyes widened innocently, \"what kind of job?\"<br>\r\n\"Why makin' us babies, of course!\"<br>\r\n\"Babies?!! I'M... I'm gonna be a mommy? The Smasher is gonna make me a mommy?\" it almost tugged your heart strings to hear Flonne so excited to hear such news. ALMOST. \"W...Wow. I'm so excited! Wh...what should I name our child?! Smashling? Smashette? Smasherella? Flonne Jr.?\"<br>\r\n'How bout Stillbirth #71930?' you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Cool your jets, Flonny!\" Etna said, \"you can worry about that when it's YOUR turn! After all, Laharl said we ALL get a round! So, Flonny-Baby! What time is it?\"<br>\r\n\"Um... a quarter after midnight?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope! Ladies...\" a microphone magically appeared in her hand as Etna turned her head to the darkness... you sensed a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT of bad vibes coming from that direction, \"what time is it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S RAPE TIME!!\" roared a tremendous crowd of strong, ovulating demonesses! Oh, Hell's Belles...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the bright flashy lights suddenly come on and you hear what you assume is the theme from Wheel of Fortune playing on the speakers! You found yourself in the middle of what looked to be a game show!! The loud lively audience that could barely remain sitting down all consisted of women. DEMON women! There was a wide variety of demons, too! You saw vampires, nekomata, plant girls, pink prinnies, succubi, beastmasters, ronins, kunoichis, mages, what you assumed were girl dragons, the friggin works! You probably broke the neck of at least one demon of each kind you saw in that audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right ladies!\" you heard the lady announcer, \"Live from the darkest deepest region of Overlord Laharl's manor for the first time ever... It's time to play 'It's Rape Time'! And here's your host... BEAUTY QUEEN ETNA!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered as you did a double take when Etna magically changed into a red sparkly dress in the blink of an eye! She waved at the crowd and even blew a few kisses. What in the heck have you gotten yourself into?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Thank you!\" Etna spoke up as the crowd's applause died down, \"now... as we all know, being underpaid overqualified minions for smarmy high-and-mighty brats is hard work. I mean, you work your fingers to the bone fighting, blowing up stuff, ripping organs out, increasing the orphan population of our enemies... all this while trying DESPERATELY not to break a nail! You get what I'm saying, girls?\"<br>\r\n*ramble ramble ramble* the audience seemingly agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes, and after doing this for SO many decades, dont you just wish you can finally get a break? I mean, not just a day off, but a REAL reward?! A suitable reward that can just take all that rage out on and finally relieve that incredible amount of stress we've been building up?\"<br>\r\n*ramble ramble* the audience agreed again. Youre still shaking your head in shame of what's about to come!<br>\r\n\"Well today's our lucky day, gals!\" Etna announced, \"because with us right now is that stress relief in the form of a puny human! But not just ANY puny human! No siree! Pandora, introduce our special guest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajor spotlights lit your puny body up for all to see! You could feel the glowing eyes of every she-beast in the audience gazing into you!<br>\r\n\"Hailing from the corners of Mason Hawk, Florida of the human world,\" the announcer spoke, \"of the human resistance's finest soldiers! The Legendary hero that spent the last few years devouring troops of the Netherworld like Pez, striking fears in the hearts of monsters a hundred times his size! Current bounty of 786,000,000HL! His turn-ons include fighting for silly justice the ridiculous idea of freedom for his fellow race! He enjoys walks on the beach and using Axel's carcass as a surfboard. SAY HELLO TO THE ONE... THE ONLY... SMASHER!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou covered your ears and the thunderous roaring and applause you got from those things! They were thrilled to have someone like you as their personal 'stress-relief'! You felt sickened that you were actually a teeny bit tempted to be their plaything! You forced yourself to remember what they did to your comrades to keep your will strong. Unfortunately, for the time being, there was no escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isnt he just a dream boat, ladies?\" you gritted your teeth as Etna stroked your cheek, \"he's like a big cute cuddly tiger that wants to rip your face off, but cant cuz he's declawed and defanged! So Mr. Smasher, tell us in your own words... how's it feel to be the Bitch?\" She put her mic to your mouth.<br>\r\nYou stood your ground and replied, \"To be honest, I'm looking forward to YOU especially!\"<br>\r\nEtna raised an eyebrow and grinned, \"Oh?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" you smirked, \"I could use a good FLAT surface to iron my shirt!\" ZING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd broke out in a fit of laughter at the flat-chested imp's expense! Etna's eyebrow twitched as Flonne whispered, \"Dont worry, Etna! Some boys happened to like the petite frame!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"VERY good joke!\" Etna had a forced smirk, \"I'll be sure to remember it when it's MY turn! *Ahem!* Anyways, each girl in the audience will get a whole 20 minutes alone with Smasher to fulfill your wildest desire!\" TWENTY MINUTES?! WITH EVERYBODY IN THAT AUDIENCE?!! \"However, the order of which girl gets him will be decided by pure lottery!\"<br>\r\nTwo succubi drag out a raffle cage with pieces of paper inside!<br>\r\n\"I have each person's name in this raffle cage,\" Etna explained, \"for every 20 minute session, I'll draw a name! Whoever gets called, gets their fun! Who'll get first go... and who'll end up with sloppy seconds?! Will an alraune get fertilized? Will a nekomata bag herself a nice live scratching post? Will a kunoichi discover just how many pressure points a human has?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard, waiting in fear and anticipation as a succubus turned the crank of the raffle cage, mixing up those names real good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The suspense is just KILLING me!\" Etna kept staring at you with a glittering grin as she pulled out a piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Lucky Gal #1 is....\"</span></div></div>",

Is this another one of your tricks?\" Flonne asked, pouting cutely. You got the feeling that if Flonne was the one that won the lottery, you could have talked her into letting you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna then put her arm around Flonne's neck and whispered \"Trust me, I'm not playing a prank. Not when there are a thousand psychos ready to tear me apart for a guy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then released Flonne and faced you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like a bit of privacy for my time. Sorry, Girls!\" Etna said as she grabbed you by the shirt collar and teleported to a bedroom. You could have sword the crown groaned in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room had a large bed. a couple of dressers, and a window that had bars on the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your chance, you decided to punch Etna in the stomach and escape. Right before your punch connected, you saw an evil smirk form on Etna's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon realized why she was smirking. When you hit her, you were the one that got hurt! It was like she was a brick wall and you were an egg!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you held your hurting fist, Etna sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I thought the Smasher would be stronger then this...\" Etna muttered. \"Then again, you've been fighting the scraps of this Netherworld.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying?\" you asked, not liking what she said. You were cradling your hurting hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm saying that you're roughly about lv. 80, and that I'm lv. 1000. You couldn't beat me even in your dreams.\" Etna asked, now sitting on the bed. She then asked, \"Do you know a General Carter?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you demons murdered him at the EDF Headquarters!\" you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because he tried picking a fight with the Prince, but was unwilling to fight Laharl face to face.\" Etna said. \"Carter claimed he wanted the resources of the Netherworld to deal with the problem of overpopulation or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have helped us instead of fighting us!\" you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could have, if you asked in the first place. Instead, you humans woke up the conquering streak in the Prince. He's just sending the weaklings to Earth to let you guys grow stronger before he gets serious about the whole invasion thing.\" Etha replied, as she got up to grab a potion out of a dresser. \"Need a healing potion? It'll fix what ails ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared at her. She smiled back, in a way that let you know that she had full control of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna know what destroyed the two million ship armada that was sent here?\" Etna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laharl's armies, Duh.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong! It was a single attack from the Prince.\" Etna said. \"And he made sure not to harm a single human with that attack. He prefers to do that part of the job face to face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face paled. You had some idea of Laharl's strength from the propaganda films you watched on TV, but you never realized that Laharl was indeed strong enough to destroy an armada with a single attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I... Think I'll use that potion, if you don't mind...\" You said, while still shocked at what Etna said. Etna then handed you the potion. You never noticed the smile on Etna's face as you drank the potion.</span></div></div>",

The flavor was sort of a mix of coconut, onion, pig oil, garbage water, and a LOT of salt! Of course, you already know never to drink anything offered by a demon (especially after the 'Ni\u00e0o Long' incident in Ningbo!). But you chugged that piss-water down and thankfully you felt your wounds slowly recover from it. The pains in your aching muscles were vanishing. Too bad the aching pain in your pride remains strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tastes good, dont it?\" Etna grinned at your disgusted expression.<br>\r\nYou wiped your mouth and coughed, \"Uggh... now I know why a lot of your human POWs cut out their tongues!\"<br>\r\n\"Nah, that's just a rumor,\" she quickly brushed that off, \"besides, your tongue's gonna come in REAL handy if ya know what I mean!\" Ew... as if you werent grossed out enough! \"Now that youre all fixed up, how's about giving mama some sugar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go fuck yourse-...\" just when you were about to tell her off and probably die like a soldier, you started feeling weird!  You felt a little dizzy but you werent sick. You started to sweat, you felt all hot and tingly in all the wrong places, and you began salivating. Yikes, the world was spinning. What's gotten into you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could still make out Etna grinning as she a hand to her ear, \"I'm sorry, I didnt hear that last part! Go fuck my WHAT?\"<br>\r\nYou tried to say the words, but all that came out were slurs. And not because you seemed all drunkish, but you really didnt want to tell her to fuck herself. You felt bad for thinking about telling her such a nasty thing. She deserved better than that. How dare you say such a thing to a cute girl like her with glittering ruby eyes like hers and a bright fanged smile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWut teh?!\u201d you slurred after thinking how pretty she looks! She\u2019s a damn imp! An imp with such a beautiful petite tender body\u2026 GYAWD!!<br>\r\nEtna tilted her head and smiled as pink hearts swirled around her. Her overpowering scent was\u2026 overpowering you! <br>\r\n\u201cAre you feeling alright?\u201d Etna\u2019s alluring voice was heavenly, \u201cyou dont seem to look so good.\u201d<br>\r\nYou tried looking her in the eye as you talked, but her eyes were hypnotic, \u201cWut\u2026 whats happnin tah me?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna snapped her fingers, \u201cOh! Did I forget to tell ya? That little potion ya just drank happens to have a special little added ingredient. It is laced with one of the most potent aphrodisiacs in the universe! One sip had enough drug for a young thoroughbred stallion to conceive approximately 529 prized foals in one season. And you drank the whole bottle!\u201d HOLY SHI\u2019ITE!!! No wonder your crotch is on fire!<br>\r\n\u201cNnnggg\u2026\u201d you gritted your teeth as you drooled in the strangest state of mind! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! It's working even better than I expected,\" Etna noticed you getting weaker, \"That gyspy lush wasnt blowing smoke! And all this for only 40HL?! I paid more than that for bikini wax!\"<br>\r\nGypsy lush... 40HL... why does that ring a bell?! <br>\r\nYou tried to stay strong, but just looking at Etna sitting on her bed crossing her legs was too much of a rush. Youre the goddamn Smasher, however you were still but a mortal and she was but a demon. When she grinned and ushered her finger to her in a 'come hither' fashion, your feet practically moved on their own toward her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she puckered her lips, you became thirsty for them! In the back of your mind, you curse like a sailor as your lips locked onto the demoness's as your tongues wrestle eachother! You were disgusted to NOT be disgusted that you were swapping spit with the enemy! It should be because she's over 900 levels higher than you that you couldnt fight her off, but instead it was because you DIDNT want to fight her off!<br>\r\nYou dare not look down as you felt her warm glove slip down your pants and gently stroke your little Smasher!<br>\r\n\"Hah! Take a gander at this little beauty!\" you tried to ignore her comments as she stroked it faster, \"it's a meal fit for a queen! A Beauty Queen, that is!\"<br>\r\n'God, shut up!' you said on the inside as you moaned on the outside. You closed your eyes, dare not looking down at her salivating tongue running up and down against the tip! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errrgggh...\" you gritted your teeth at the suckling motions and vibrations you feel your dick receiving! <br>\r\n\"Heh! What the hell kind of noise was THAT?\" Etna giggled, \"just cuz I did THIS?\" *sslluurrrppp*<br>\r\n\"EERRGGGHH!!\" Good god, were you sensitive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were humbled to say the least. You made a legacy of protecting your race by destroying Netherworld bastards that wish to harm them. To reduce yourself to being a sex-slave to these same bastards is beyond low! You felt like an even bigger traitor to your race than Carter was. Worst of all, you were a virgin! Youre gonna lose your virginity to this THING! Maybe youre a tad bit old-fashioned, but you always thought that your first time should be sacred and with someone you truly love. You prayed in your mind for God to just strike you down with a lightning bolt right here right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsk. '20 minutes'. Might as well have been 20 HOURS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! 'Nuff playing around! HIYAAAH!!\"<br>\r\n\"WAAAH-OOPH!\" that interior monolog left you vulnerable to a sudden overhead toss onto Etna's bed! Level 1000, indeed! Didnt hurt, but MAN were you in agony!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the tears in your eyes, you glared up at Etna, pinning you the bed by her arms, still smirking that trademark smirk! The longer she had you in her grasp, the weaker you got. The weaker you got, the more likely you were to accept your fate. The more likey you were to accept your fate, the more likely the human resistance loses another damn good hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we get things started,\" Etna said, \"let me ask you a simple question... who is your mistress?\"<br>\r\nYou twitched and shivered, trying to fight back mentally, but to no avail.<br>\r\n\"C'mon! Say it!\" Etna got impatient! \"SAY IT!! SAY IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldnt hold on much longer. You had to say it. You had to break the taboo and submit. Any longer, you'll explode!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Smasher! Do something!!</span></div></div>",

Your hope, confidence, and pride of a human male has increased 666-fold! As it should. Now wasnt the time to be getting soft and submissive in front of your greatest enemy! If you were gonna be a sex-slave, you might as well have fun and show your rapists that you are not the type to be 'RAPED'!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Etna started to notice an odd twinkle in your eye... and her dominant grin turned into a suspicious frown. She squinted her big shiny ruby eyes as if realizing something bad WAY too late!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT!!\" you shouted, before grabbing Etna by her cute little wings and rolling her under YOU!<br>\r\n\"Wh...what in the... how did...?!\" the imp was practically flabbergasted at that sudden change in you. You were kinda flabbergasted too, but you didnt show it since it made that little brat question her hold on you. Now YOU began to smirk. A Level 1000 uber-god rookie-summon starting to panic?!<br>\r\nThat's right. She may be an outrageously high level rookie-summon, but she's STILL a rookie-summon with all their flaws and weaknesses. Like most overly high-leveled idiots, they get so big-headed that dont bother to cover their weaknesses such as weak points and vulnerability to crippling status ailments!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Let go of me and get back down under me!\" Etna barked, \"I never said YOU'D get to be on top!\"<br>\r\nYou did no such thing... you just stared deep in her eyes and smirked. <br>\r\n\"H-Hey... didnt you hear me?!\" you noticed she began to sweat, \"get off now or I'm chopping your nutsack off and making a prinny pouch out of it!\" Heh... she aint gonna do that. \"I SAID GET O-....eh...\" She suddenly got nervous when you leaned down and her and gazed DEEP into her eyes. Your cold yet alluring stare was stunning her as well as cutting down her offense by quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EGH?!!\" the imp twitched in surprised when you began to kiss her neck. She held back the urge to moan as you casually sucked on her little neck, savoring the taste of the sweat dripping down it! \"S...Stop that...\" she stuttered as you continued kissing her vulnerable neck, \"s-stop, damn iiiiiiit....\" you began to run your tongue down her exposed chest nearing the pegs of the old ironing board. \"Damn dog, cut it ouuuuu.......ooo....\" Etna cooed when you pulled down her top and suckled on one of her tits! Her eyes dilated as she ran her claws against her bed from your embrace! Looks like she got dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo point in quitting now! Time to exploit ANOTHER rookie-summon weakness!<br>\r\n\"EESSH??!!\" Etna froze up when you squeezed her cute little pointy tail! Weak little low-ranked imps cringe when you yank on their tail! Easy paralysis stat change! \"L-LET GO OF THAT!\" she growled. Savoring you panic, you didnt. \"LET GO OF IT, YOU LITTLE SHI-Eeeeeeeee!!!\" she shivered in delight as you rubbed the pointy end! She zoned out again and drooled as you sucked on it like a pacifier! You lowered her stats even more as she lied there paralyzed by your touch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you hated her kind with a passion, you were no longer disgusted by the thought of having sex with these things! Even in THIS lewd way of 'combat', you can still show 'em who's boss! Still, you'd be lying if you didnt at all think this sudden table-turned event was unbelievable. Either somebody outside this universe plugged in a gameshark and activated God Mode or maybe you triggered the inner True Hero within you or some philosophical crap. Either way, this was BEAUTIFUL!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna, despite her speed dropped dramatically, still eyed you in confusion, unsure herself of what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th...how the... unbelievable! That potion was supposed to make this human fall head-over-heels for me! Not go all dominatrixy on me!\" she picked up that damned Healing potion and read the ingredients... then her eyes widened in horror at a certain ingredient she read, \"....WHAT?! That fucking lush! He didnt tell me that-\"<br>\r\n\"That what?\"  you got curious yourself! Etna's strength was too low to prevent you from snatching the bottle out of her hands so you could read it yourself.<br>\r\n\"Let's see... pig jelly, onion loaf, peanut oil, green tea extract... hm? Blood of Asmodeus, the Dark Prince of Lust?!\" One of the most devastatingly powerful biblical Dark Princes of Helel in existence?! And this idiot low-leveled demon fed you his blood?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalk about an almighty irony. She intended to make you her love-pet with a tainted potion, only to end up being YOUR love-pet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the reflection in the mirror, you had a nearly demonic grin on your face along with a pair of black feathered wings sprouting out your back and glowing yellow eyes!<br>\r\n\"Must suck to be you, huh?\" you smiled at Etna, who's now suffering from the 'Fear' ailment! Amazingly enough, there's still 15 minutes of 'fun' left!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe imp attempted to leap off the bed, but you were too quick for you that you grabbed one of her legs before she could attempt flight! Opportunity! In a flash, you unzipped your pants and pulled her leg over your shoulder while straddling the other one! Splitting Bamboo, baby! That's how you rock it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-wait a minute!\" you relished Etna's nervousness, \"w-were g-going a little t-t-too fast, arent we? I mean-\"<br>\r\n\"Why so scared?\" you whispered, \"after all, I'm just a lowly Lv 80 human and youre a Lv 1000 Beauty Queen! Besides, this is what you wanted, wasnt it?\"<br>\r\nEtna gritted her teeth at you which only enticed you more! Asmodeus unlocked a sadistic side to you! A side with a craving for smart-mouth little flat-chested twerps! You didnt so much as let her blink before cramming your lv 666 Tool of Life into her ungodly cunt and shattering a very personal defensive barrier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!\" she shrieked as you felt lukewarm liquid leaking out from her vital spot!<br>\r\nAgain, you grin with glee, \"A VIRGIN?!!\" Etna looked away, red with embarrassment. This was just TOO rich! \"Not to worry, shrimp! Your secret's safe with me! Now where were we?\"<br>\r\nAnd with that, you began thrusting into that little annoying bitch you loathe so much, loving her endless shrieking until you get so sick of hearing it that you cranked the radio to max to drown out her screams! With each thrust into you, you feel more and more of her energy drained away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the expressions on her face she made as you squeezed your big manhood back and forth inside her way too small pussy! So much of her energy drained from her that she was left with her watering eyes rolled back and her jaw dropped opened, shamelessly drooling like an idiot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C...CANT HOLD ON... GONNA...CUM...\" she cried. Not wanting to let it slide, you slip your fingers inside her and block THAT part off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say the magic words!\" you ordered, \"who rules?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...S...Smasher... rules...\" you obediently replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Louder!\" you ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smasher rules!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOUDER!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SMASHER RULES!! SMASHER RULES!! SMASHER RUUUUUUUUuuules!!!\" You plucked your fingers out, letting her spray her orgasm all over the place and fall fast asleep!<br>\r\nThe badass overpowered prima donna... reduced to an exhausted sexually ravaged mess at the hands of the great Smasher! Man, Asmodeus sure is something! Could this little baby be key to ending the war once and for all? ...Or perhaps, worsen it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you thought about it, you gazed over at the clock... still 10 minutes left.</span></div></div>",

The perfect time to immediately regret what you just did! You practically signed your death warrant doing what you did to one of the Netherworld Higher-ups. Not to mention, you were also so disgusted about what you did, you immediately pulled out of that imp before spilling a gallon of your seed all over her nice bed! The thought of making babies with that bitch gave you the creeps!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, you continued to cringe in fright as Etna seems to be snoring rather peacefully in her deep sleep youre merciless rape drew her to. Though she's sleeping really sound, you know she aint gonna be happy when she wakes up.she's gonna tear your nutsack off and make a prinny-pouch out of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ponder, the clock continues to count down. Only 8 minutes left at this point before youre either dragged back for another round with your enemies or horribly murdered before the next demo-chick gets her filthy claws on you! This might be your only chance. You need to get outta there and FAST!<br>\r\nThe door was obviously a stupid choice since it's probably heavily guarded, but luckily there's a window!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up yet another conveniently placed rock on the ground and hit that window as hard as you can with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THUNK!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHm?! The window didnt break! Must be harder than regular glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THUNK THUNK THUNK!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pound the window a few more times and it didnt even leave a dent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THUNK!! THUNK!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pound it even harder, but to absolutely no avail!<br>\r\n\"Aw c'mon, rock!! You never failed me before!!\" you blame the rock as you continue to pound on the window! \"Smash, you sonovabitch! SMASH!!\" But sadly there was no smashing. It seems that even Netherworld glass is infinitely superior to Human world's glass. On the plus side, at least Etna's snoring was drowning our your curse rage and rock pounding!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it all!\" you tossed the broken rock to the ground and given up. Worse even, you just wasted about 5 minutes on this wasted effort! Only 3 minutes left!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought quick. Since you couldnt smash the window, perhaps you could remove the frame casing around it? You spotted four silver screws on each corner of the frame that you assume are what's holding the glass window in place. They didnt look like anything a regular screwdriver couldnt undo. Too bad you didnt have one of those, so you had to improvise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a quick peek around the room for something. One thing that caught your eye was a cute pink skull encrusted razor-sharp switch-blade! You snatched it off the dresser and got to work on one of the screws.<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, the switchblade took little effort undoing the first screw. But by then, only 2 minutes remained!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hauled ass undoing the second screw while the clock worked against you. It took a bit of effort, but down at the very last minute only one screw remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and turned the last screw... only for it suddenly stop on something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, great! It's stuck!\" you muttered as you jiggled the blade a bit trying to free the screw. Time was running out, but you were being patient with that little bastard stuck in between you and freedom! Not long after, you felt it coming loose! You sighed in relief as you resumed undoing the last piece holding the frame!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little longer..\" you whispered as sweat dripped down your brow, \"...just a... little... longer...\"</span></div></div>",

You probably lost a few vital braincells just from witnessing Etna's new outfit! Safe to say it was difficult to keep a straight face seeing Etna wearing a pretty flashy black nautical uniform with black bows with mini-skulls, a frilly skirt that left no more to the imagination than her last one, a ruby red jewel encrusted on the chest, and a black cartoony bat magical scepter in her gloved hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you werent already zoning out from the tainted healing potion, you would be right now! After readjusting your jaw, the only words of intelligent you can mumble were '...The fuck?!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna seemed to be proud of it. She even giggled to herself and blushed, \"Heheh! Years later and it STILL fits!\" She twirled around trying to show it off! Sadly, this wasnt really new to you. The Netherworlders all had their weirdo bizarre otaku fetishes. Majority of television consisted of news, propaganda, anti-human sitcoms, and anime. Hell, nearly half the world's churches were torn down and replaced with friggin anime conventions! But in all's fairness, one of your mentor did have a huge thing for dressing up like Van Helsing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice suit,\" it was EXTREMELY hard to say that to her with a straight face.<br>\r\nBut it didnt stain her ego! \"Oh, this thing? This isnt just a suit... this is actually my alter-ego! By day, I'm known as Beauty Queen Etna von Drago Malchior Tepes Rosaria Beldont XVIII. But between 1-1:30am, I am known as...\" Suddenly, spot lines shine on Etna as she did some sort of sailormoon-esque pose, \"EVOLUTIONARY MAGICAL GIRL ETNA!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you still had your lucky rock, you\u2019d be beating YOURSELF with it until you stopped moving! It was cuz of that damn potion that you actually tolerated her new look. Part of you still wanted to screw her hard no matter WHAT she was wearing\u2026 while the rest of you tried as much as possible to restrain that urge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 so it\u2019s one of THOSE games, eh?\u201d you smiled, \u201cin that case, can I be Harry Dresden?\u201d Forzare, bitch! <br>\r\n\"SILENCE, YOU WICKED GOOD-DOER!!\" Etna shouted in a higher pitched girlish voice than usual, \"As the Netherworld's cutest, strongest, fastest, swiftest, cutest heroine, it is my sworn duty to see you ay for all of your crimes done for the sake of peace and preserving humanity! I, Evolutionary Magical Girl Etna, the 9th daughter of Mammon, the legendary Dark Prince of Greed, harness the dark powers of Dawkins, Hawkings, Randy, and TJ Kincaid to trounce the evil bearers of good and light as well as steal the hearts of all the cute guys in the universe!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. Not only is this imp out of her mind, she's not even as literate of the Dark Princes as you are!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Mammon only had SEVEN children,\" you correct her, \"and they were all boys.\" You wanted to say it, but you were not that dumb and suicidal enough to add 'unless...'!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the imp STILL kept her charade!<br>\r\n\"You dare question my legacy, Smasher?!\" she poked your chest with her bat-scepter, \"then perhaps you need a taste of the pure awesomeness first-hand!\" That impatient friend between your legs was DYING for it! If she wanted to rape you so bad, why didnt she just DO it already?! Aw... damn that potion, youre losing focus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the plus side, all this pointless stalling killed quite a bit of personal 'fun' time. You noticed the timer on the bed was down to the final minute! Only a matter of time before you can finally say goodbye to this level 1000 abomination and hello to a potentially weaker demon creature!<br>\r\n\"Do you worst, NOT-Flonne!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vein popped in her forehead for only a few seconds, before it quickly vanished and was replaced with a conniving grin! NG!<br>\r\nShe pointed her scepter to the timer and shouted, \u201cEVOLUTIONARY GAME-BREAKING SPELL:  SLOW TIME!!!\u201d<br>\r\nSuddenly, the speed of the world around you came to a sudden halt. The timer itself stopped moving. The Prism ranger on the tv screen delivering a flying kick to a troll froze in mid-air! You felt the flow of time itself become dramatically slower! Did she seriously just slow time?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWH\u2026WHAT DID YOU DO?!!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSlowed down the time around us,\u201d Etna announced, \u201cthis should give me PLENTY of time to thoroughly cleanse the thought of your mistress, the Fallen Angel of Stupid from your heart!\u201d Crap! She has the power to slow down time?! That is so unfair!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if ya thought THAT was awesome, get a load of THIS! INTELLIGENTLY DESIGNED SUMMONING: OCEANUS, THE GREAT PINK MILLION-TENTACLED TITAN OF THE SEA!!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA Ti-AAAAAYEEEE!!\u201d suddenly, several pink tentacles ripped from the floor and entangled you! You groaned and squirmed at the feel of the pink tentacles tightly squeezing around you and lightly suckling on your skin! Gross\u2026 yet arousing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile some tentacles restrained your arms and legs, one tentacle slipped into your shirt and caressed your chest. Another tentacle slowly suckled your back, giving it a nice soothing massage. Another tentacle slipped in your mouth and started playing with your tongue! Another tentacle slipped into your pants and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEeerrrrgh!!\u201d made you squeal as it suckled on your sensitive spot! Not even Etna\u2019s mouth was THAT good! This was even worse than being raped by some uber-strong creature that 1st year summoners are expected to conjure up as a final exam!<br>\r\n\"HAH!!\" Etna laughed a snooty cocky laugh at your misery, \"AHAHAHAH! Humiliating, aint it good-doer?! The great Smasher reducer to being a squeeze toy to Oceanus?! Not many horny adolescent mortals can resist her incredible tentacles!\" You glared at her as she grinned back, \"You coulda had the unmatchable pleasure of being dry-humped by I. And you pissed it away!\" You cant believe you regret pissing that sickening offer away! Time flowed slowly as Oceanus went to work on that overly sensitive tip of yours! You almost choked on her tentacle trying to moan in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally spit out the tentacle just in time to announce, \"GyAd... I think I'm gonna-\"<br>\r\n\"OH NO YA DONT!\" Etna snapped as Oceanus squeezed your dick TIGHT! So tight, you couldnt release your load!<br>\r\n\"Aghh....\" you drooled and squinted your eyes in desperation! Too bad, your temporary girlfriend was not generous!<br>\r\n\"Because of that smart mouth of yours, maybe I should just let you suffer a little longer...\" damn damn damn DAMN! You were so close to begging! SO close! Begging to a demon for mercy! Ew!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna then raised her eyebrow, \"...Although, I MIGHT reconsider that... if you say the magic words!\"<br>\r\n\"M...Aaa...gic....\" you groaned, \"...woo...rrdd...sss?\"<br>\r\nEtna leaned in close, until you could see your aching face in the reflection of her eyes, \"I'm gonna ask you ONE last time.... WHO IS YOUR GODDAMN MISTRESS?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to break you! Whether physically or mentally, she was gonna break you. So far, the mental part is cracking. You wanted her. BAD. Despite being a taboo, you wanted to release your load, regardless of whether it's IN her or ON her! <br>\r\nYou couldnt hold out any longer. You had to say. You'd say ANYTHING just to relieve this torture! Hell's bells, what else can you do?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this the end of the Smasher?! Will our hero accept his untimely fate? Will the human resistance fall apart from losing one of their few champions?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTune in next time, same Smashing time! Same Smashing website!</span></div></div>",

The Overlord who's awesome power could rival even the Seven Dark Princes of Helel?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot THAT same Overlord Zenon, right? You know damn well about THAT Overlord. You always thought the dude was just a fairy tale meant to scare little children. 'Drink your milk,' you grandpa would always tell you, 'Overlord Zenon hates kids with hard, crunchy bones!' Man, did you tremble when you learned he was REAL. THANKFULLY, the dude remains neutral in the war between the human resistance and Laharl's army. Your mentors said if Zenon got involved, humanity is as good as doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sweated fiercely as the lone girl in the middle of the large audience stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" said the blonde haired red eyed demoness wearing the most elegant of elegant black dresses that is worn by demon nobility, \"does this mean I win this little contest?\"<br>\r\nYour skin paled as Etna shouted, \"Rozalin!!

Very well... you have the privilege to be ridden by the Overlord's daughter.\" WHOA! You never thought that the daughter dearest of Oblivion was into kinky shit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...wait! Is that a riding crop in her hands?! And a saddle?! Oh Hell's Bells...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard her, Smashy McSmashSmash!\" the imp grinned, \"dont forget to be on your best behavior...\" Etna then whispered, \"you wouldnt wanna upset Daddy-dearest, would ya?\" Blue Ovaries had a point. If you offend Zenon's daughter, worst case scenario, he'd get pissed. He'd not only take his anger out on you... but perhaps the rest of your race as well! The sake of your kind struggling in this war is more important than the taboo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRozalin clapped, \"This way, Smasher.\"<br>\r\nYou lowered your head, \"Yes'm.\" and followed Zenon's daughter through the portal to GodKnowsWhere (which is 40 miles south of HellifIknow!). The sounds of the crowd finally died down. GOOD. Well, not quite. The abyss the two of you were walking through was absolute silence. You hate quiet, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so you know, Smasher,\" Rozalin finally broke the moment of silence, \"my father is certainly not pleased with your species' disobedience. It is unruly people like you who stand in the way of diplomacy and trample on potential Netherwordal peace.\" Oy... like you need a lecture from these damn things! You dare not be rude, but you do feel the need to speak up.<br>\r\n\"Well, a mentor of mine once told me,\" you explained, \"Diplomacy is two wolves convincing a sheep that he's dinner. Liberty is the well armed sheep suggesting an alternative.\"<br>\r\n\"How philosophical,\" she added, \"but convincing your species that theyre any class higher than they really are will only get them needlessly wiped out. The sooner you know your place, the better.\" Ugh... there was no reasoning with her. Like it or not, if you make it out of this alive, for the future of your kind, youre gonna have to confront idealists like these. Until then, you were her... pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's enough talk about this for one day!\" Rozalin changes the subject, \"there's another reason I entered that little contest than discussing politics with you.\"<br>\r\n\"And what might that be?\" you stared at the saddle and riding crop in her hands and tried not to shiver.<br>\r\n\"Well, it certainly wasnt procreating unlike the rest of those whores playing Etna's game!\" she DOESNT wanna bow-chika-wow-wow you? \"A vagrant of your stature doesnt deserve to touch my reproductive organ!\" she then smirked, \"but that doesnt mean I cant use you to enjoy myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow, \"I'm... not sure I follow.\"<br>\r\n\"You see, ever since I was little, I\u2019ve always wanted a pony,\u201d as did every other HUMAN little girl, \u201cbut father would never buy me one.  Sure I\u2019ve got cats, dogs, goldfish, parakeets, snakes, bats, even a rhyno, yet he wouldn\u2019t give me a pony!\u201d \u2018OH POOR YOU\u2019 you sarcastically think. \u201cSo I\u2019ve decided that for the next brief period, YOURE going to be my pony!\u201d<br>\r\nYour eyes widened, \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 not sure I follow.\u201d And then the abyss around you transformed into what looked to be a horse training ranch coming complete with it\u2019s own racing field and several hurdles and fences to jump! \u201cY\u2026 youre joking, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRozalin flashed a smirk and shook the saddle in her hand, \u201cGiddyup, horsey!\u201d Demeaning, but after thinking of the worst case scenario,  you strap on the saddle and get on all fours! Thankfully, she wasn\u2019t very heavy, but the way she tugged on the bit mouthpiece urging you to go faster really hurt your jaw! You galloped like mad across the track, cuz the faster you went, the less it hurt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah! Yah!\u201d she\u2019d shout every once in a while and smack you on the ass with the crop!<br>\r\n\u201cGyaadd!\u201d BOY did it hurt! \u201cIs it really necessary to whip me with that thing!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPonies don\u2019t talk!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Some do-OW!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran around the track for a while, trying to tune out Rozalin\u2019s shouting and crop-smacking. You lost count of the number of times you circled the track, but it seemed to go on forever! It was one of the most humiliating things you have EVER done during the entire war. As you disguised as a female groupie to infiltrate the backstage of an Axel concert! At least Zenon\u2019s little girl was enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, horsey! Time to jump the fences!\u201d<br>\r\nYou almost spit out the mouthpiece as you shouted, \u201cWHAT?! I cant do that!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPonies don\u2019t talk!\u201d she repeated, \u201cthey jump fences! Now JUMP!\u201d<br>\r\n*Whack!*<br>\r\n\u201cAAAYYGGHH!!\u201d one incredibly hard smack on the ass made you jump a couple of feet in the air, passing over a few fences! Such a show impressed your rider!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful jump, my pony!\u201d she congratulated you, \u201cI just might have you branded once the war\u2019s over!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks but I\u2019ll PAAASSSS!!!\u201d you squealed still aching from the pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after what seemed like 20 minutes in Netherworld time, Rozalin jerked HARD on the reigns, forcing you to stop!<br>\r\n\u201cSSSS!!!\u201d you gritted your teeth in pain as youre forced to a sudden stop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, pony! Riding time is over!\u201d Rozalin said and hopped off your back, \u201cfeel free to have a quick drink.\u201d<br>\r\nYou groaned as you limped toward the water trough. It was embarrassing to dig your face in to drink like a real horse, but man, were you thirsty!

Sure, Roz-zenon as she is was pretty much scaring the heck out of you despite the pokerface youre given, but the wicked aura that's intensifying with that smirk she's giving you is melting your pokerface away like a hot knife through butter! You remember one of your mentor's mentioning something about a feeling prey get when theyre cornered by a huge hungry predator a hundred times their size and absolutely no possible way to escape other than the route through it's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you shoulda drank your milk like your grandpa suggested when you had the chance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Zenon's throat rumble shook the ranch around you! Even the horses neighed like crazy as if saying 'DUDE! RUN! OR YOURE GLUE!!'<br>\r\nBut being the weak timid prey that used to be the great 'Smasher', you stood there shaking and shivering as she slowly approached you. The black slanted pupils in her red eyes widened with intrigue, revealing smaller white glowing inner pupils beneath!<br>\r\n\"!!\" you gasped when she grabbed your arm and shoulder then sniffed at your neck! Normally you didnt expect demons to be above sniffing butts, but she was seriously sniffing out your scent from under your sweaty throat! Why doesnt she just sink her jaws into it and be done with it?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Asmodeus,\" Rozenon's voice spoke, \"it's been a long time... since we had a talk.\" What in the?!<br>\r\n\"Er, I-I-I'm sorry?\" you had the courage to stutter, before adding a \"...ma'am?\"<br>\r\n\"Is this the new frail timid mortal body you've decided to hide in?\" Rozenon asked, \"this doesnt fool me. You know you cant fool me. Asmodeus. Dark Prince of Lust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened almost as inhumanly as Rozenon's! Does she actually believe your...<br>\r\n'I... probably shouldnta used the Asmodeus Healing Potion so prematurely... my bad! My bad... my bad... my-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAD!!! This was the work of that stupid potion Etna gave you, wasnt it?! What the hell was in that stuff?!<br>\r\nAnd did the friggin Dark Prince of Lust itself really have some sort of fling with THE Overlord Zenon?! Did it have some sort of a death wish?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have remained in solitude,\" Rozenon spoke, \"until I could find you again. And repay you... for stealing something close to me!\"<br>\r\nDamn damn damn damn DAMN!!! Quick!! Think! What did your mentors teach you when youre put in this kind of situation!! Uh... um... Oh! 'If you ever suddenly bump into Overlord Zenon in real life... it's already too late'!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Ms. Rozalin?\" thankfully, you heard Pandora's voice on the intercom that magically appeared out of nowhere, \"your time is up! It's time for the next drawing!\"<br>\r\nYou sighed in relief as 'Rozalin' turned her head to the intercom.<br>\r\n\"Ms. Rozalin? I know the Smasher is a fun toy, but the other girls would like a turn with him too!\"<br>\r\nRozenon squinted her eyes... then turned her head back to you with that damn smirk again!<br>\r\n\"Ms. Rozalin! Please stop stalling! It's time to bring the Netherworld's prized sex-slave back!\" Pandora continued to speak. You cringed when Zenon herself start to giggle.<br>\r\n\"Ms. Rozalin, seriously! That's enough! If you bring back S-\" *CRUUUUUNNNCCHHH!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YIIIPEE!\" you let out a yipe when huge razor sharp jaws appeared out of nowhere and chomped down on that intercom! Something tells you this being of solitude isnt gonna give you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right...\" Rozenon continued to giggle, \"...youre a SEX-SLAVE, are you not? What a delightful role for the likes of someone like you, dear Asmodeus!\" Hell's bells! She's STILL calling you that!<br>\r\nAnd right on clue, the clear blue sky morphed into a huge organic red mass full of blood red eyes leering down at you and huge gaping mouths chanting in a language that probably predates mankind! The green grass changed to blood red and with a flash of Rozenon's eyes, a super sharp tentacle-like appendage busted from the ground and lunged at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaahh!!\" you screamed as it struck in a lightning fast motion! It didnt cut you, but it sliced the hell out of your tattered shirt!<br>\r\n\"GYAADD!!\" before you could blink, another appendage ripped from the ground and sliced your pants and boxers into ribbons! You couldnt so much as breath when you saw Rozenon gazing down at your member, now outrageously hardened thanks to that damn poisoned potion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheheh! I see you've gotten a little smaller since we've last met, Asmodeus!\" you couldnt believe the Overlord just made a joke about your penis, \"No matter. I'm certain that new body of yours can still successfully satisfy the urges this shell deeply craves.\"<br>\r\n\"W-W-Wait, Roz...er...Zenon... whatever!\" you pleaded, \"you got it all wrong! I'm not Asmodeus! I'm a human! Some crazy imp just drugged me and-!!!\" You shut the hell up as soon as one of those appendages pointed at your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk tsk!\" Rozenon waved her finger in your finger, \"I grow awfully tired of your meaningless stalling. Come with me, Dark Prince.\" With a snap of her finger, another set of jaws appeared and opened wide, revealing some kind of weird portal in it's mouth. \"We have so much catching up to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as she stepped into the mouth-portal, ushering you to follow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the appendage lowered from your throat, you...</span></div></div>",

Absolute disappointment. It was bad enough she isnt gonna be the first to get her unholy regions even more unholied by the Smasher, but apparently it's making her sick to her stomach reading the name of the gal that is!<br>\r\nEtna practically snared as she did a quick shrug and mouthed the words 'MOTHER FUCKER!' with no sound. As much as you didnt wanna get raped, you were kinda intrigued by who or what's pissing off little Miss Blue Ovaries!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Flonne asked, just as curious as you, \"who's the next girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....\" Etna stalled, \"...false alarm! Just a blank piece of paper!\" She immediately crumpled it up and stuck her hand in the cage again, \"Let's try it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, the gullible fallen angel didnt fall for it.<br>\r\n\"Wait, Etna! Didnt you say earlier that there were no blanks?\"<br>\r\n\"Apparently, I was wrong! Anyways, THE NEXT GIRL-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on a sec!

Tell me now!\"<br>\r\n\"L-LET GO ME, LOVE FREAK!\u201d<br>\r\n\"SHOW IT NOW, MEANIE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough watching two flat-chested midgets rolling on the floor fighting over you was one of your secret fetishes, you were in no mood to wank off in a corner. Besides, it wasnt long until Flonne cold-cocked Etna and swiped the paper out of her hand while she was in a brief daze. Right before Etna could pull blondie's hair, Flonne's eyes widened with joy when she read out the name!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flonne?! Flonne! FLONNE!! THAT'S ME!!\" the cute little fallen angel shouted with glee, \"I'M THE NEXT GIRL!! I'M THE NEXT GIRL!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that everyone?\" Pandora announced on the speakers, \"our next lucky girl to try her hand on the great Smasher is none other than Fallen Angel Flonne!\" The crowd cheered for the fallen underdog as she hopped around in excitement like she just won the Big Spin. She actually was giddy about taking you. Technically, she was probably the most gentile out of every other godforsaken estrus demoness here waiting to jump your bone, but you were ANYTHING but happy to be Flonne's toy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hate angels.You despise those hypocritical holier-than-thou winged buzzards with a passion. They look down on your kind like youre one of their unwanted children, yet they sit on their almighty asses and do NOTHING to help your kind when theyre practically on the verge on extinction thanks to their polar opposites! And Flonne is a living example that angels, despite looking down on those that are easily seduced to evil, are easily seduced to evil!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Flonney,\" Etna gave an angry forced smile, \"Smashey told me about how he couldnt WAIT for you to be his mistress! I really hope you still got your Flonezilla suit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Did you hear that Smasher?\" Flonne cheered, \"I get to rape you! I get to rape you!!\" You and Etna sneered, for different reasons. \"This'll be a tremendous honor that I finally get to defile one of the human's finest heroes! I'm so excited I can barely contain myself!\" Geez, laying on the flattery THAT is KINDA getting to you. \"C'mon, Smasher!\" she grabbed your hand and ran through the Door, dragging you along, \"I dont wanna waste a second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph...\" was all you muttered as a cute little fallen angel who was infinitely stronger than you dragged you off like her little play-date!<br>\r\n\"So... so...\" her big red eyes beamed as she still continued to stare at you in awe, \"...so is it true you really swallowed a dragon? Huh? Huh?!\"<br>\r\nYou sighed, \"Well, I had dragon soup once.\"<br>\r\n\"And... and... that angel whose wings you ripped off and glided with...  did he survive?\"<br>\r\n\"Meh,\" you grunted, \"I plucked one simple feather and he ran away screaming.\"<br>\r\n\"Did Axel really try to get to second base with you before he found out who you really were?\"<br>\r\n\"What's with all the questions, shrimp?\" sure enough, you werent in much of a mood to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlonne lowered her head and gave a cutesy frown, \"I... I'm sorry if youre uncomfortable. It's just that I'm a really really big fan! I know youre my enemy and it's my sworn duty to see that youre struck down in an excruciatingly painful way by the sharp jagged blade of Love... but it doesnt mean I cant admire you for your work and your effort to liberate your kind.\"<br>\r\n\"You... admire me, huh?\" again, you had a weak spot for flattery.<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\" Flonne said, \"you give hope to those who are normally hopeless. You prove that despite the odds stacked against you, you are not afraid to go against your superiors. You would sooner die in a horrible, bloody, gorey, disgusting way, than surrender and be walked on. In a way, it's kind of romantic!\" Romantic, eh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw... gee, I...\" you rubbed the back of your head.<br>\r\nThe fallen angel gave you a determined look, \"I was honestly hoping Laharl would be my first, but after hearing YOUR story, I fell in love with it! I cant think of any human out there that is more suitable of mating with a devoted Angel of Love than you. I know my child would become a weak mortal, but if he/she had YOUR traits, I'm sure he/she would be capable of beating the odds!\" Good lord, you were having trouble shedding a tear from that touching speech! Maybe not ALL of these demons are that bad. Well, maybe all of the fallen angels, anyway. If Harry Dresden can make it with Lasciel, maybe Smasher can make it with Flonne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Plus, thankfully she's not haunting your mind, slowly manipulating your brain like Lash did to poor Harry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wasnt gonna be that easy. You knew Flonne was up to something. You'd be a dillweed to think otherwise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you dont like angels, Mr. Smasher,\" Flonne said, \"and I know you wont accept me willingly. However, I'm still an angel of honor! There I challenge you, Smasher, the hero of humans, to a duel!\"<br>\r\nYour eyes widened, \"A...duel?\"<br>\r\nFlonne nodded, \"I played a game I found on the internet about a blue-haired warrior who traveled the world dueling against monsters who yearned for his love and that whosoever defeated him would have the privilege of mating with him... repeatedly.\"<br>\r\n\"Monmusu Qu-\"<br>\r\n\"And it got me thinking!\" she interrupted you, \"perhaps if I defeat YOU in a duel, I'll win your heart and you'll willingly accept my love! At least until you pass out from exhaustion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA duel for your love, eh? It seems a little one-sided since youre going against one of the most powerful types of beings in existence! But maybe she'll give you an even playing field! Maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duel began in the form of...</span></div></div>",

Santa has to think REALLY hard how to punish one of those.\" Etna put a hand to her chin and paced around in her thinking pose. Her skirt bells jingled with each step she made.<br>\r\nIt took you until now to realize your pants and boxers were suddenly missing! You gazed dumbfoundedly at your painfully over-erected cock, wondering how she managed to make your clothes vanish in mere seconds!<br>\r\n\"Something so horribly agonizing that he'll NEVER wanna do anything naughty ever again!\" Etna said to herself, jiggling her bells as she paced. \"but what will that ever be? I wonder. HM.\"<br>\r\nJust as you thought about breaking the hell out of there while she was pretending to ponder, an invisible force suddenly slammed you down against the bed and pinned you there! It felt like your arms and legs were restrained by invisible hands. The only part of your freed from the restrained was your member as it remained pointed stiff up in the air, ready and reporting for duty!<br>\r\n\"I'VE GOT IT!\" no soon after did Etna smirked with an idea in mind! \u201cHey, little boy. Santa aint got any lumps a coal to give ya, but she does happen to have a nice special gift wrapped package for ya that only the worst of the worst naughty boys deserve! THE Package!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHE Package?\u201d at first, you were oblivious to what she was referring to, but then you remember this one long-ass music video series by R. Kelly (for some reason) and got rather scared, hoping to a god you no longer believe in that THAT isn\u2019t \u2018the package\u2019 she\u2019s referring to! You would way WAY rather die or get gangraped by demons than be given \u2018the package\u2019!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, look on the bright side, Smashy,\u201d Etna turned her back to you and jingled her bells with a hip shake, \u201cwhile youre dying a super slow untreatable death, at least you can be honored that it came from the privilege of pounding the great booty of Beauty itself!\u201d Sweat dripped down your forehead as you were forced to gaze at her lifting her skirt and pulling down those cursed panties, displaying to you her cute little ass in all it\u2019s glory, baring a cute little skull tattoo on her left asscheek! The sight did plenty to help agitate your stiff member!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the first round of gang-rape, my mistress gave to me\u2026\u201d she sang another revised Christmas song as you shook your head in horror. The very next moment, she hopped hard onto your lap and you screamed in agony of the excruciating pain of your dick completely grind deep into Etna\u2019s asshole! \u201c\u2026a life-threatening STD!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ass squeezed awfully tight the moment your tip entered passed the canal! You can feel the incredibly merciless walls within her rectum crush you in your most sensitive spot! You learned the hard way that Etna\u2019s ass was clearly one-way! There was pleasure, but it was less sex than it was masochism! Your tool was tightly constricted like a gerbil squeezed in a boa\u2019s coils! Of all the merciless beatings and creative torture tactics you\u2019ve suffered as a Hero of the resistance, you\u2019ve never endured one as grueling as anal with this OP imp!<br>\r\nDespite your suffering, Etna didn\u2019t seem bothered at all at her in! In fact, she got so comfortable with you inside her that she proceeded to bounce her waist up and down, rubbing your cock against those painful yet still pleasurable walls! Each ring of the bells meant each hard painful thrust!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGOD\u2026 PLEASE\u2026 STOP!!\u201d you actually begged her to stop butt-fucking her!<br>\r\nShe just laughed, \u201cHeh. I\u2019M the one taking it up the pooper and YOURE begging to stop? C\u2019mon, wimp! My butt has no pity for weak chairs!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cP\u2026PLEASE\u2026 PLEA-Auggh!\u201d your pleas net you another wicked smack by her tail.<br>\r\nAnd then she hopped up and down even faster, torturing your little friend trapped inside her anus! She hummed the 12 rounds of Gang-rape while you cried in agony.<br>\r\n It was a mystery how she managed to keep so calm. Then again, it could be cuz youre far too under leveled to tap an ass like hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only lasted barely a minute before you desperately desired to orgasm, however the epic binding kept you from doing so! You couldnt take it anymore! At this rate, your penis could explode unless you pulled it out of her! But since you cant move, all you could hope for was the generosity of you-know-who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-ETNA! ETNA!\u201d Etna ignored your screaming. You knew what you had to say, \u201cM\u2026MISTRESS ETNA!!\u201d<br>\r\nShe turned her head back to you and smiled sweetly, \u201cYou called?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPLEASE\u2026 LET ME\u2026 CUM\u2026\u201d you begged near the verge of tears! \u201cI BEG YOU!!\u201d<br>\r\nAs expected from a demon, she smirked sadistically. \"Sorry, wimp. You gotta say it properly... to my butt!\"<br>\r\n\"W-WHAT?!\" this was getting on your nerves.<br>\r\n\"Yep! Say 'Oh, bodacious rump of the lovey super hot gorgeous Lady Etna whom graced me to be your personal chair, if you could allow me the undeserving pleasure of spilling my filthy unwanted seed, I would be eternally grateful to you and the incredibly sexy owner of you!' \"<br>\r\n\"Y...YOU GOTTA... BE KIDDING....\" Wrong answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya better watch OUT! Ya better not CRY!\" Etna sang as she emphasized each painful thrust, \"Ya better not POUT I'm telling you WHY! Smasher's cock is going... to bust!\"</span></div></div>",

Et...\" You uttered, your will breaking with each second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail then went away from from your penis and came into your view.

Her tail then went back to your dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until you say my name...\" Etna said, with the wicked gleam in her eyes increasing.

She continued to look around, sniffing, trying to find out what the odd scent was. She went closer to you and then took a big sniff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!

You actually addressed this damn imp as MISTRESS Etna! MISTRESS! And in such a pleading desperate voice too! How shameless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna smirked, knowing that she pretty much defeated you. The Smasher!<br>\r\n\"That's a good boy,\" she said just before releasing the tightening grip on your cock, allow it to finally blow it's long awaited load into the mouth of her tail! You gasped in relief as the tail swallowed your cum down.  You eyed the bulges full of your cum flowing through it's 'throat' toward Etna's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp!\" Etna burped, \"whoa, that was quite a lot you held back there, wasnt it? Coulda made yourself quintuplets with that kind of tenacity!\" Earlier, you'd have been disgusted at the thought of impregnating this demon with your seed... but now youre relishing it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... M...Mistress Etna,\" you gradually recovered, \"w-what am I... becoming... if you'll excuse me asking?\" Pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right! I totally forgot!\" the imp whipped out a pocket mirror, \"here's some of the perks of chugging that special love of mine, Smashie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoulda been spooked by the reflection, but you werent. Your skin tone looked a little peachier, your ears were slightly pointed, your blue eyes despite being bloodshot were twinkly, you could see horns in your blonde hair which was now glittering gold, and there was a little pink heart tattoo on your cheek. You've become a demon! That damn OP rookie-summon made you into a demon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check you out. Congrats, Smash! Youre an alp!\"<br>\r\nAn alp. Possibly the worst kind of demon a certified Demon hunter like yourself could become. A lowly subservient love-incubus that feeds off lust, regardless of who or what it's from. Pitiful. A simple pitiful end to what was once a hero of the human race.<br>\r\nAnd worst, WORST OF ALL, you didnt mind being an alp. You actually liked the new you! You thought the heart tattoo was kinda cute.<br>\r\nAnd speaking of cute, you still longed for your cute level 1000 mistress!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I take it you like the new you?\" Etna said with a menacing smile that glittered beautifully to you.<br>\r\n\"I do, Mistress Etna,\" no shame was in your voice as you answered wholeheartedly. Disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna chuckled and hopped off you and you immediately missed her embrace! \"Hmm... come to think of it... I've been awfully generous with you, havent I? I took you away from all those creepy girls, healed your wounds, gave you a little booster, and even got you off and you still havent shown any gratitude! Not even a thank you!\" She faked being mad at you, but you bought it hook line and sinker!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very sorry, Mistress Etna!\" you bowed apologetically. Low. \"I really do appreciate what you've done for me! You have my deepest thanks for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOPE!\" Etna lifted her chin and sneered, \"too late for that, Smashy! For your rudeness, youre gonna have to do a lot better than that! I dont want you to tell me youre grateful! I want you to show it!\"<br>\r\n\"Absolutely! I'll do anything!\" Your mentors are spinning in their graves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mistress smirked... then leaned over the bed, bending over and spreading her legs. Your eyes lingered toward the back of her skirt. You knew immediately what this meant!<br>\r\n\"C'mon!\" Etna patted her ass, \"it aint gonna tap itself!\" You were just about to commit the ultimate taboo and think nothing of the consequences. The part of you that found such a fate absolutely horrific was no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst everything you once fought for, you pressed yourself against Etna's backside until your corrupted dick was tickling the forbidden entrance that was her nether lips. Then as you grabbed both her hips, your positioned your corrupted dick toward the forbidden entrance and slowly squeezed into it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\":EEEEEeee!!!\" Etna suddenly let out squean as you thrusted deep into her! Despite it being incredibly tight, you managed to fit! She shivered with such anticipation until the very tip could go no further! By then, red lukewarm liquid dripped from the vagina and down her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...youre a virgin?\"<br>\r\n\"O-o-of c-course not!\" she blushed, failing to hide it, \"a...a high leveled mega-ultra-powerhouse like myself uh... can easily self-repair her hymen good as new each time!\" She was an awful liar, but you bought it lock stock and barrel. \"Hmph! Just another superior trait that your bland human females lack! And I didnt say stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou complied, resuming thrusting into her doggy-style, turning your back on everything you stood for! You gasped and moaned in the bliss of ravaging your mistress's insides, losing yourself in the pleasure that only HER pussy could offer!<br>\r\n\"Geee....eeegghh.... gaa....\" listening to Etna moan under her gritted teeth was like music to your ears! You stared at the reflection in the bedroom mirror of her perverted expression she was making faced away from you. Her glowing red eyes were rolled upward and she drooled like crazy, even biting down on the sheets of her bed to muffle her screams! Suffice to say, she was enjoying it just as much as you were if not more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how tight it got, how hard her insides clamped down on your tool, it didnt slow down your thrusts. You were truly determined to impregnate your mistress no matter the cost, provided she'd let you.  This couldnt seriously be what the great Smash was reduced to. This had to be a bad dream. There'd be no way you'd willingly lose your virginity to one of those creatures! No way in Hell would you seriously even THINK of siring a monster's offspring! The Humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M...Mistress...\" you gasped, \"I... I'm gonna... cum...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it!\" she demanded, digging her nails and teeth into the sheets, \"pour it ALL in me! Spare one drop and I'll kill you!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to put the final nail in your coffin, you did as instructed. You let out a loud gasp and let loose one final orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AaaaaAAA<i><b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\"><span class=\"clred\">AaAaAaAaAaAaAaAa</span></span>{ /size}</font></b></i>aaaaaaaahhhh!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus Christ Almighty! That roar Etna let out was unearthly! For that moment, her eyes were suddenly bloodshot, her teeth were feral and grizzly, and her jaw unhinged abnormally low during that roar! That reflection in the mirror would be something that'd haunt you for the next ten lifetimes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you got chilled to the bone from her orgasmic expression, her face suddenly went back to her normal irresistably cute self.<br>\r\n\"W...w....whoa...\" she collapsed onto her bed and panted in exhaustion, still shivering as your excess seed dripped down her \"goddamn...I'm gonna be walking funny for a week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou collapsed next to her and gasp, \"H...how was I, Mistress Etna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled onto her back. \"On a score of 1 to 10... I give ya a 9.6,\" she was being brutal, \"have to take off some points for climaxing before me. Still, all in all, you aint bad. You aint bad at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*DING!* And on that cue, your time with her was finally up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time's up, Miss Etna!\" you heard Pandora's voice call out from somewhere, \"it's time for the next lucky girl to get her moment with the Smasher.\"</span></div></div>",

Or at least cosplaying nerds trying poorly to cosplay at them. Honestly, you take no issue in that. A few of your mentors were really big nerds in that sense. Heck one of your most favorite superiors was a My Little Pony fan girl. She was SOOO adorable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skinny red headed kitkat had poorly dyed her hair blue and wore fake cat-ears in front of her REAL cat-ears, and wore scantily clad fake white fur covering only a fraction of her naked body which somehow looked LESS scantily clad than what a typical kitkat wore, as well as big fake cat-paws and cat-hind legs. The outfit clearly didn\u2019t match the body since she was too scrawny to have a \u2018physique\u2019 for the kind of girl she was dressed as.<br>\r\nThe rather plump blue haired succubus in glasses was a big too big-boned to pull off the outfit SHE was wearing and she knew it.  She blushed nervously in her tight skimpy black jumpsuit which barely concealed her exquisitely round bosom, the heart shaped cutout showing off her slightly wide belly, and easily tearable bat stockings that went all the way up her thick legs to her wide jiggly hips! You barely paid attention to the batwings on her head, but you knew the character she regretfully cosplayed as!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd\u2026 you seem to find the plump girl very attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you!

Not 20 per turn.\"<br>\r\n\"What?! But-\"<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid theyre right, Ms. Flonne,\" Pandora stated, \"there is no rule preventing a combination of minutes with more than one lady.\"<br>\r\nFlonne got a bit cross at the cheaters \"Why that's... that's....

The alp part of you missed her DEARLY and would want nothing less than to go for Round 2 and 3 and 4 with her... but then you remembered her creepy as fuck orgasm face and that stopped it cold! God help you if Reina and Xiyu make faces like that! That'll be another reason to find sex with demons disgusting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon c'mon, meow!\" Reina grabbed your hand, \"time's a wastin'! They'll be plenty of time to drool over Xiyu's fine booty later!\"<br>\r\n\"R-Reina!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd. What you expected was humiliating gang rape from your enemies, but what you got was far from it. Throughout the 40 minutes, you spent most of it chilling out in what looked to be a college dorm crammed with several posters of old rock bands, and piles of video games ranging from old consoles to virtually new, and even collectible videogame tat like figurines, trading cards, artwork, dvds, the works! It was a game nerd heaven!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, you kinda enjoyed sitting on the comfy couch between Reina and Xiyu playing several fighting games, chatting up about video games, and chugging energy drinks 'til you no longer blinked! Your inner nerd was thrilled, it was a breath of fresh air from the rest of this horrible night.<br>\r\nHowever, your inner Alp was getting restless. There was one thing on it's mind and it didnt a damn if it was getting it from two demons! Heck, your lustful glances toward Xiyu made you lose a couple of rounds of Marvel Vs Capcom against her! You partially tuned out most of Reina's rants about Capcom's decline or why they dont make a freaking fitting sequel to Darkstalkers 3 and other video game plethora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, I dont think a crossover between Street Fighter and DBZ would work, Reina,\" Xiyu remarked, \"the characters in DBZ are intentionally way OP.\"<br>\r\n\"So what, meow?\" Reina said, \"Asura's Wrath involved tearing the entire planet apart on a regular basis and it didnt stop them from making Asura Vs Akuma!\"<br>\r\n\"I dont think that worked well,\" Xiyu said, \"all it did was merely cater to the SF fanbase. Now you think they should cater to a fanbase starring outrageously powerful aliens and balls that grant wishes?\"<br>\r\n\"I honestly could see it happening,\" you put your two cents in, \"they made a crossover with an anime company that was popular in the 70s. Heck, I'm surprised they didnt do a crossover with Shonen Jump sooner!\"<br>\r\n\"See, Xiyu?\" Reina quipped, \"even the Smasher himself agrees with good ol' Reina! Not even your hawt sexy body is enough to win him over!\" The plump succubus cringed with embarrassment. As much as you hate to admit it, there was a voice deep down inside you going 'WHEN ARE WE GONNA POKE THE FAT CHICK, ALREADY?!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, it's gettin' awful late, meow! Ya hungry, Smasher?\" come to think of it, you havent eaten for a while, have you? \"I think we got some leftover pizza in the fridge. You up for some, Xiyu?\"<br>\r\nXiyu shivered nervously as she adjusted her glasses, \"S-S-Sure. C-can I please change out of this suit already? It's... really uncomfortable!\"<br>\r\n\"Why, meow?! It's clearly working! Smasher cant go a round against you without thinking about your delicious, scrumptious, fine as hell, bootylicious-\"<br>\r\n\"Reina!!!\"  <br>\r\n\"Sigh! FINE!\" Reina waved her hand as she hopped off the couch, \"I'll get the microwave ready. BRB, meow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump succubus let out a sigh of relief as she got up off the couch. Your eyes were still drawn to her. As she pulled out a spare of clothes from her drawer, you eyed her plump round butt as it wiggled uncomfortably with spandex wedgied between the stocking-covered cheeks! You eyed Xiyu's butt as it swayed all the way to the bathroom just before shutting the door behind her. She didnt lock it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDangit, it was bad enough you were checking out a demon of all things, but the most reserved demon from a species of demons known to be the LEAST reserved?! As if that wasnt bad enough, naughty things brewed in your mind. Xiyu's taking her clothes off, her door isnt locked, and Reina is way the heck in the other room. To your Alp side, that spelled Opportunity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell am I thinking?!\" you whispered to yourself, \"she's a demon. It's bad enough I did it with a stupid imp, now I'm lusting for HER?!\" You didnt have a lot of time left, so hopefully you'll waste all the time with vidya games before they even THINK of screwing you! Too bad part of you was tired of waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock was ticking. Choose carefully.</span></div></div>",

In the brief few seconds you closed your eyes, your body had gotten up and walked over to the bathroom. You looked down and realized that you had stripped as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'This won't end well...' </i>You thought as your body quietly opened the door. There was a part of you that thought<i>, 'Or will it?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snuck in and silently closed the door.. Xiyu was facing away and taking off the last bit of clothing she had on, which was a g-string. As you got one nice look at her divinely delicious derriere, she froze for a moment and you swore you heard her sniff the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Smasher?\" Xiyu weakly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeek!\" Xiyu cried out as she turned around and tried to cover herself with her hands. One hand covered her pussy and the other arm tried to cover her breasts, Which due to the size of her bosom, was pretty much doomed to failure. She could only cover one of her nipples, both of which began to show she was getting aroused. She was a succubus, after all. As she began to blush, she asked, \"P-p-please leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to force yourself to turn around and do as she asked, but all that happened was you took a haltingly step forward. You replied, \"I'd like to, but my body seems to be acting on its own...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sniffed the air once more, Xiyu's hand that covered her vagina began to act on its own. The hand began to play with her pussy. Xiyu's blushing face began to turn redder. She muttered, \"Ii-It seems we both have the same problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and took a deep breath to calm down. Then she slowly opened her eyes. Her pupils were heart-shaped and a lusty smile began to grow on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I spot a little boy who stared a bit too long at my ass... I think I should punish him by overindulging him...\" Xiyu said with a lusty whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xiyu?\" you asked as your body took another shaky step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXiyu's eyes widen before she closed them and shook her head. After opening her eyes to show that her eyes were back to normal, Xiyu then muttered, \"Gotta get outta here. Urge for sex is getting too much and I'm dealing with a newly-made alp who's really under the control of his dick...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, the door silently opened slightly. Reina was watching the two of you through the small crack. Xiyu then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The plump succubus wearing nothing but her glasses practically stared at you panicky and impatiently. She was awful shy and nervous which was practically foreign for any succubus that you know of, but you could tell she couldnt hold back her natural instincts. As bad as it was that you gave your virginity to an imp, this was practically inevitable. Youre now a horny alp and you had to indulge yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and whispered to Xiyu, \"...Well, Etna's goons are practically expecting us to. If you wanna do this, let's just get this over with.\" The awfully cute buxom succubus nodded and grabbed your hand.<br>\r\n\"C'mon!\" she whispered and dragged you into the shower with her. It was a small standing space big enough for one person, but it had plenty of space for the two of you... ya know... despite Xiyu's slight big-bonededness. Speaking of big-boneded, your erection never died down since you laid eyes on Xiyu's deliciously divine derriere in all it's glory. Now that you were confined in a small space with her, the blood flowing toward your shaft intensified just being around her which may be another inadvertent affect from her succubus powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her hormones were in control of you, the wait she sweated nervously with her cheeks flush red told you she had no idea what to do next!<br>\r\n\"Uh... um.... uhhh...\" she stuttered, pretending her adjust her glasses, \"w-w-what do we do now?\" Your alp body had a grand idea that your human one was far too embarrassed to say out loud.<br>\r\n\"C-could you.... turn around and bend over?\"<br>\r\nPoor Xiyu gulped hard but did as she was told, nervously turning away from you and raising her irresistible rump in the air, her tail wagging with the jitters. The effects of the love potion amplied a hundred fold staring at those jiggly cheeks. Part of you considered spreading those cheeks open and just sticking your nob in her asshole, but you preferred not to harm that incredibly sensitive part of her. Instead, your attention lingered to her fuzzy virgin flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands instinctively gripped the sides of her shivering hips and your dick instinctively nudge toward her vaginal opening. <br>\r\n\"Ahh!!\" Xiyu yiped and suddenly jumped back, slamming you against the wall and pinning you there by her rump! You howled as your penis plunged deep into her in the process! You failed to remember what one of your mentors taught you. The inside of a succubi vagina is practically like a nesting ground of an eldritch abomination!<br>\r\nYou gritted your teeth, feeling what you assumed were several strange barbs wriggling around your tip! You feel each little barb practically squeezing into your foreskin, squirming against each sensitve spot of the exposed tip! What made things worse for you was that Xiyu decided now was an opportune time to swing her hips back and forth, forceing you to thrust in and out of her demonic pussy!<br>\r\nYou pant hard, incredibly vulnerable to the nether barbs quickly binding around each inch of the shaft that squeezed in and out of her! Her warm wet inner muscles felt like big slobbery kisses against your urethra while the barbs dug under the foreskin and around the neck! Not even Etna could compare to this intensity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D....Does it... feel... good?\" Xiyu panted, still pounded her hips back and forth!<br>\r\n\"It's.... incredible!!\" you scream, twitching with ecstasy. <br>\r\n\"I'm so.... so.... ohhhh... glad...\" she gave you a sweet smile in the middle of her lusty moans. Had she not been a succubus, it mightve warmed your heart.<br>\r\nFor this moment, you said fuck all to whatever your mentors taught you.  You didnt care that the greatest threat to your species threw you here as a lowly sex-slave to his female subordinates. You didnt even care that some OP flat chested twerp drugged you, mutated you, and raped you! All you cared about was fucking this girl whom you know next to nothing about as her best friend peeked through the curtains and quite possibly touched herself watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didnt take this girl long to put you on the verge of an orgasm, but that's a demon of lust for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xiya... gonna... cum...\"<br>\r\nShe didnt respond nor did she even change her pace the slightest! Her vagina on the other hand responded. You coulda sworn you felt big warm lips clamp down on your penis while inside her. You gave a disturbed expression but resumed moaning in pleasure as her rhythmic pumping kept you at bay. You felt your load release into those 'lips' as feel them suck hard on your dick, sucking down every little drop! You even felt a tongue licking up the runoff!<br>\r\nXiyu let out a high-pitched squeal while her body graciously accepted your large sperm donation.<br>\r\nReina stared drooling from the lip and possibly fingering herself, enjoying the show. It's a damn shame she had to miss out. But it was perhaps for the best. You dont think you had the strength to pleasure both the demo-nerds at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment of catching your breath, you gently pull yourself out of Xiyu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Only to be squeezed back in when her rump pinned you against the wall again! Oh crap, the barbs were squeezing even tighter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I say we were done?\" the tone of her voice changed again. The lusty sultry tone from earlier!  \"Such an impatient little runt.\"<br>\r\n\"X-Xiyu?!\"<br>\r\nShe turned her head back you with a wide smirk. The hearts in her eyes came back! Once again, she gives in to her 'natural' instincts!<br>\r\nYou dug your nails into the wall because the tight barbs became unbearable! Xiyu's continuous and merciless pumping told you she got one hell of a second wind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you still got a whole lotta energy left in those balls of yours!\" she said with sudden no concern for your well-being, \"and I'm gonna swallow it all up!\" Damnit! Not even your Alp side had the kind of strength left to take it! Urgh... this was the kind of shite your teachers warned you about! Succubi KILL prey this way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer inner muscles felt like tiny little toothless mouths painlessly chewing on your member while the barbs squeezed and wriggled into your foreskin! You shuddered to imagine what the inside of Xiyu was looking like at that very moment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reminded yourself not to panic however. You just had to hold out until time was up. And surely time was almost up by now, right?</span></div></div>",

Things are getting good, real good!\" Reina said as she sashayed into the bathroom, her paws on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs began to shake, either energy was being drained from you or you were getting ready to cum again. Regardless, Xiyu's pussy and ass were definitely going to be in your wet dreams for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joining us, Rei-chan?\" Xiyu cooed as she began to fondle her nipples. \"Betcha I can make milk for my sweet little kitty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, You're Lust-Xiyu...\" Reina muttered as she shook her head. She looked at you with an annoyed frown. \"Ah well... As long as I'm not getting her main attention, I can take it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you knew you'd get punished for it, you chuckled at the nickname. Reina got on her knees and crawled towards her friend as the latter said, \"Nicknames like that are annoying, Rei-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReina made an 'eh noise' as her lips came into contact with Xiyu's nipples. You heard licking noises and from what you could see from the mirror, Reina was suckling from her bottom-heavy succubus friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt something wrap around your chest. It felt like a smooth kind of rope. Looking down, you saw that it was Xiyu's tail! The bulb at the end began to shift and shudder before a pair of oversized lips appeared on Xiyu 's tail bulb. If they were to kiss you, the lips would be able to cover from your chin to your nose. You'd be smothered by a single pair of lips! A cold shiver went down your spine as a lustful smirk appeared on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" You muttered as the lips began to make a kissing motion as they neared your lips. Somehow you managed to grab the tail, but alas, Xiyu's tail was strong enough that it was drawing nearer and nearer to your own lips. You never hear of what really might might happen if a succubus kisses a man, but you didn't want to find out. Rumors ran from sapping energy to enslavement to even an super-aphrodisiac effect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kissy-Kissy, smasher!\" Xiyu cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReina tore herself from Xiyu's boobs and said, \"I gotta see this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Reina stood up, wiped the milk from her mouth, and watched as Xiyu's tail drew closer and closer to your mouth. As for Xiyu, she began to play with Reina's vagina, making the Kit-Kat begin to moan. </span></div></div>",

A tail that currently had such big supple kissable lips that your own were practically begging to smooch even at the risk of being completely engulfed by them. From the first moment you met Xiyu, you couldnt take your eyes off that lovable shy nerd and now at this point with your dick being tortured by her unholy womb, resistance was absolutely futile.<br>\r\nYou've already broken the taboo three times in a row and youre only gonna be made to break it again and again and again until the Netherworld's femmes no longer have any use for you. There was no Smasher anymore. There was only an Alp slave with the name of a fallen hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being worried what the lips of Xiyu's tail would do to you, your fears were pushed aside for raw lust when you gazed over at your succubus partner locking lips with her kit-kat gal pal. Seeing those two smacking their lips against eachother ever so passionately, completely ignoring you kinda made you a little jealous. Despite being plowed from behind by you, your succubus lover seems more interested in that nerdy cat than you!<br>\r\nAs soon as that tail opened it's mouth, your own tongue was dragged out and your tongue and it's were caught in a wrestle way before your lips could make contact! Not long later, the tail's mouth had engulfed almost half your face, smothering your mouth and cheeks with wet slobbery kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pure euphoria. Absolute heavenly bliss that you had the pleasure of being kissed by the most succulent sensational lips the universe had ever conceived! And this was just the lips of Xiyu's tail. Just kissing her tail alone put you in such a tremendous state of awe! You could only imagine the kind of euphoria Reina was feeling being honored enough to kiss Xiyu's actual lips! She probably gets to kiss Xiyu on a regular basis!<br>\r\nMan what you'd give to be Xiyu's roommate. Hell you'd be Xiyu's pet if it meant you'd get to live in the same dorm as her! It was hard imagining living whatever life you used to live before SHE came into it, rocking that tight-ass Morrigan outfit! You had long forgotten who the hell this Etna twerp was. Xiyu wasnt some random run of the mill succubus. She was a robust goddess in spectacles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn case you didnt realize it by now, the kiss practically made you a slave to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as a good slave, you were obligated to please your mistress and poke her with your very best! You grabbed her wide jiggly hips tightly almost making her flinch a little and resume ramming it in her as rough and hard as possible! Her 'natural' side tried to keep a straight face as she ignored you and kissed Reina, but by the way she was shivering, you were really getting to her! You could even feel the barbs snapping off your tool and you could feel the inner-mouth practically gagging and choking on it with every thrust!<br>\r\n\"Heheh! Smashy's got a second wind, meow!\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Reina!\" Xiyu growled with drool dripping down her mouth! She dug her nails through the shower floor almost cracking the marble! She even had to cover to mouth to block out a loud yelp! Looks like she's noticing you now!<br>\r\n\"Yeah! That's it! Get her, meow!\" Reina was cheering you on, \"she's been a bad bad girl!\"<br>\r\n\"I SAID SHUT U-\" you reached over and planted your lips on hers before she could finish that word! The inner voice was screaming with joy that he finally managed to kiss his mistress on the lips! You could now die a happy man.<br>\r\nFortunately, instead of killing you, she merely closed her eyes and accepted your oral embrace as well as the abdominal one! SHE LIKES IT! YOU HAVE DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN! Now happy that you successfully satisfied your mistress, you end this embrace with a one long hard orgasm that even her nether-mouth couldnt handle! Hidden in Xiyu's high pitched squeal, you could hear the nether-mouth spitting and gasping for air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had finally tired out. The three of you lay in that shower panting from exhaustion. Even tired, you still couldnt take your eyes off your beloved goddess. You might probably never forget this moment together for at least 2 lifetimes. How you wished this time together would never end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*DING!* Whelp. That's the end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Xiyu suddenly snapped out of it! Her eyes reverted back to normal and she went back to her usual timid self... with full memory of what she had just done! \"Oh no! Smasher! I-I'm so sorry! I-I-I was way too caught up in the moment and... oh dear, are you alright? Please tell me I didnt accidentally kill you!\" Even the look of fright and desperation was irresistible on her serene face.<br>\r\n\"See, Xiyu? I told ya he'd like you!\" laughed Reina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo... did ya have a good time?\" a quick return to the game show later, Etna passed the mic to your two former caretakers while Flonne was still frowning at them angrily, probably still bitter that they got away with their raffle scam and she didnt.<br>\r\nAt the very least, Reina and Xiyu dressed slightly more conservatively, wearing traditional tank top and blue jeans. Xiyu looked incredibly good in her pink tank top that blended with her equally pink bra straps and tight nearly hip-hugger blue jeans... than again, she'd look incredibly good in ANYTHING. <br>\r\n\"Oh you bet your ass we did!\" Reina grabbed the mic, \"it started out pretty chill, meow. We talked, we played games, then suddenly, Smasher over there couldnt control his hormones and suddenly went all feral on Xiyu, meow! Tell 'em about it!\"<br>\r\n\"What?! Me?!\" Xiyu eyes widened when her friend passed her the mic.<br>\r\n\"You heard her,\" Etna smirked, \"tell us. Was he as good as the legend suggests? I mean I already know the answer, but I dont think the thousands and thousands of women out there watching do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Gulp!* Th-thousands?\" man did Xiyu get a bad case of stage-fright. She sweated, she shivered, and she still looked damn good to you doing it. You wouldnt mind if she took as much time as possible answering, because it just meant more time staring at your darling mistress.<br>\r\n*Ahem* \"Um, I-\" she flinched when the mic made a loud hiss noise, \"...I um, really enjoyed Smasher. And uh... I think he really enjoyed me.\" All eyes were on her. Especially yours. \"Well, um, I'm not saying I'm easy or anything, you know, cuz I'm definitely not.\" Irony from a succubus was answered with chuckles. \"A-anyway, it kinda started when I went to go change in the bathroom... I didnt realize he was following me until it was too late. I er, really dont remember much of the details, cuz I wasnt ENTIRELY there-\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she does!\" Reina interrupted, \"she remembers everything when she lets her instincts take control-\"<br>\r\n\"REINA!! Uh, well, I was nervous, very nervous, and I think he was too, but... he didnt mind taking the lead, so I let him and well... next thing I know... I got so far into it that I kinda wanted to uh.... dominate him.\"<br>\r\nA roar of laughter and cat calls erupted from the audience. Except for Flonne... who seemed to be stuffing more names into the raffle pot! <br>\r\n\"But in the end, not even I could tame the great Smasher! Heheh....\" she then turned to you, left you lost in her twinkling eyes covered by spectacles, \"th-thank you Smasher, I really loved the time we spent together.\" You wanted to say how much of an honor it was to be with her, but your brain was still too fried by her pheromone, \"And well, if you ever manage to escape... it'd be really cool if you'd give me a call.\" She even slipped her number in your pocket! FREAKING AWESOME!<br>\r\nAnd then she gave you a gentle kiss on the cheek! FREAKING AWESOMER! To add more awesomeness, Xiyu turned around and even her tail gave you a kiss! SUPER EPIC ULTRA MEGA AWESOMEREST!<br>\r\n\"Attagirl!\" Reina cheered her, \"I knew ya had it in ya, meow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two walked off the stage and you eyed Xiyu's jean-clad backside as she left. Just seconds staring at her wide luscious hips swaying back and forth and her tail swinging about hypnotically and already you missed her. Your eyes followed her tantalizing ass all the way out the doors in the back, still longing for your mistress. If anything could influence to plan out an escape, SHE could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, ya miss your super-sized playmate?\" Etna suddenly snatched the paper with Xiyu's number out of your pocket, \"dont worry, shug. I'll put this somewhere safe.\" She then stuffed it in a nice electronic storage unit called a shredder. \"Now that the room has finally fallen within the max weight capacity, let's see who's the next lucky lady to get her ass poked by the Smasher!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything around you drowned out what with you being in far too deep thought over Xiyu. You still thought about her as she left the building. Probably to make out with her roommate when they get back. That lovely buxom demon of lust was still on your mind and you hated to imagine never seeing her again and the last memory you have of her is her ass shaking in the distance as she leaves your sight for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually contemplate escaping this place just for the sole purpose of reuniting yourself with your mistress. Your corrupted mind fills with ambitions of escape and finding her again! Question is, will you dare act on them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Or will you just stomp on your hopes and dreams again and accept your fate with the next female demon like a good alp?</span></div></div>",

You recognized her as Jennifer, the genius who was Captain Gordan's assistant! \"I've been meaning to study more about demons and the fact we have a newly created one is intriguing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This oughta either be real fun or real boring,\" Etna muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to spend the time in my lab,\" Jennifer said. Etna nodded before she snapped her fingers. You and Jennifer vanished from the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer looked at you with a gentle smile and asked, \"Could you strip and sit on the stool in front of the mirror, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feelings for Xiyu were being overridden with an urge to please Jennifer. Could your Alp-fication make your feelings unreliable? Could any feelings of love and lust now are just there for your body to  trick you to feed off of women's lust? Could-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, your body took control as you thought about your situation. You sat down on the stool that Jennifer asked you to. She walked up behind you and undid her metal bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need some samples. Some of it will be sold to female demons, though. Research materials aren't free...\" Jennifer said as she walked up behind you. She paused fora moment before she said, \"Well, they can be, but free can be very expensive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So about the samp-\" You asked before Jennifer put a large glass container in front of you. \"That's overkill, miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you were a human, then I'd agree,\" Jennifer said with a sexy giggle. \"But you're an alp now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then pressed her large boobs against your back as she added, \"I do apologize, but all I will be doing is giving you a handjob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then gently grabbed your dick with one hand and used her other hand to rub your chest. Jennifer's handjob was surprisingly gentle. Her other hand was seemingly focused on teasing your body as best as it could. Jennifer also made sure to rub her big soft sexy bosom into your back. After awhile, you cummed into the container. It didn't fill much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... I guess we have to do this some more. I hope you don't mind...\" Jennifer cooed in an arousing manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more she made you cum, the more you realized something. The demonic marks on you had gotten worse. The horns were bigger, your ears were now as pointed as Etna's, your eyes were more twinkly, and the heart tattoo now seemed to glow. Your body also seemed to grow very slightly smaller a little bit, and your dick seemed to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms... I seem to be changing the more you make me cum...\" You whined a little bit.<i> 'It seems the more I cum, the less human I become!'<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nJennifer  looked in the mirror and noticed. \"Oh my... I'm glad I'm recording this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have spoken more, but Jennifer stopped rubbing your chest and slightly covered your mouth, even putting a finger in your mouth. You began to suck on it a little bit, making Jennifer giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the container was quite filled, Jennifer looked at a clock and said, \"Well, my time is about up and I have enough samples. You can take him. I have work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were teleported back, without your clothes. There were cheers and whistles from the crowd of women, making you try to hide your erection. Somehow, that part of you now seemed impossible to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that was kinda boring, but some of you can go bug Jennifer for a hit of Smasher, now for the next lucky lady. She gets to handle the full Alp-ified Smashy!\" Etna said before she pulled out another paper. \"And it's... It's... Flonne squared?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiyooo!\" Flonne's voice uttered in stereo as two Flonnes appeared on stage. One fallen angel, one regular angel. \"Our room please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Etna's jaw dropped for a moment. \"I don't even wanna watch this next one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Flonnes vanished, along with you. You landed on a fluffy bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should we handle this?\" Devil-Flonne asked, shuffling around in a cute manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fusion dance? We did get it down right,\" Angel-Flonne answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. From the recording, we did seem kinda mean when we weren't talking about love,\" Devil-Flonne muttered. \"Perhaps we should make him choose which one of us to have fun with his smasher pole and which one can kiss him on his smashing lips!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Flonnes looked at you with expectant gazes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'ja... Two... How!?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One is from another dimension... or maybe time travel... I forget which,\" Angel-Flonne answered with a cute little knock on her head. \"But enough of this. Choose how we should spend time with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fusion of the Flonnes to become the heroic goddess of love and lust!\" Devil-Flonne answered with a heroic pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you can have a nice  Twin threesome fantasy!\" Angel-Flonne said with a wink as she began to take her robe off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou honestly didn't expect Angel-Flonne to be the bigger pervert of the two.</span></div></div>",

Choose!\"<br>\r\n\"Stop that, Flonne 1,\" said the not-yet fallen but has certified potential to fall angel, \"the Smasher needs time to make the right choice. Patience is a virtue after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd boy was she right. You had to think hard, even if you were ultimately thinking with your crotch. After that moment of unparalleled Heaven with Xiyu, the bar was set incredibly high for you. Just fucking ANY old demon or angel whose wings deserved to be chewed off wont compare to the divine vagina belonging to your favorite plump nerdy succubus! As high-leveled and uber strong as she was, youre not confident Flonne will be able better. Not even TWO annoying Flonnes can compare to ONE bootylicious Xiyu!<br>\r\n...However, fusion might not be a bad idea. Two super powerful perverted angelic shrimps merged into one unstoppable ungodly deity of destruction, passion, and gullibleness... hm. Maybe someone like HER could give Xiyu a run for her money. Any normal uncorrupted hero for humanity would be worried about cataclysmic damage to the universe from this, but this corrupted fallen hero turned Alp just doesnt give a shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F....\" you stuttered as your face went red, still feeling embarrassed to suggest this, \"...f...fu....\"<br>\r\n\"What? What?!\" the fallen angel scooted up close, giving you her undivided attention, \"c'mon spit it out!\"<br>\r\n\"Awww... how adorable!\" the angel Flonne said with a sigh, \"he's so bashful! I cant wait to see what his 'ahegao' face'll look like!\" Disturbing.<br>\r\nRegardless, you bit your lip, twitched your tail, and scratched one of your horns, \"F...fusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of them gasp.<br>\r\n\u201cDid you hear that, Good Flonne?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI believe I did, Kinda Pushing the Boundaries But Still Overall Good Flonne! He doesnt want both of us divided! He wants both of us UNITED!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUnity is always a beautiful thing!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! No need to fight over who goes first or who gets oral and who gets missionary!\u201d PLEASE STOP TALKING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two finally turned to you and nodded. \u201cVery well, Smasher! You shall have the honor of being thoroughly raped by us merged into one great divine rapist!\u201d You remained silent in your embarrassed and incredibly arroused blushed as the two continued musing themselves.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready, Fallen Flonne?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI certainly am, Angel Flonne!\u201d And with that, the two seemed to make some sort of mocked Dragon Ball Z synchronized fusion poses as they chanted what you assumed was phony Latin until bright glowing rays of light shined around them and you could see their forms dissipating and merging into one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAngel Flonne! Fallen Flonne! Biomerge Angel-volve to...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...VENUS-FLONNE!\u201d<br>\r\nThe bright glowing rays finally dissipated. What used to be two short twin forms was now one rather tall, rather fit looking six-winged female form standing before you! The 'Flonne' you were staring wide-eyed at looked much older, much bigger, and had an aura much stronger than the two Flonnes put together! Her blonde hair was longer and more glittery golden, her 'choir dress' was custom made to fit her more enhanced frame (ie, longer, more fitting around the waist, extra space in the now expanded chest area!), three of her wings were white feather angelic while the other three were dark batlike devilish, there was an upside cross tattoo on her cheek and a heart-shaped tattoo on her breast, the bow-ribbon that was on her head was now floating around her body with two little tiny cherubs holding it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not avert your mortal gaze from Venus-Flonne. It felt like a cardinal sin to dare look away! The illustrious beauty and intensity of her aura was both alluring and intimidating to you. You were sure whether to be terrified or entranced! It was if the aura was telling you 'Hold still, shut up, and spread your legs and youre gonna be JUST fine!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV-Flonne opened her red and blue dual colored eyes and your eyes immediately locked on hers. Your blood ran cold as soon as she looked into them! You were beginning to wonder whether you shouldve just stuck with fucking the two brats!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLowly mortal,\u201d her voice didnt fit her body. It didnt sound older and more mature, it just sounded like Flonne's regular squeaky voice amplified, \u201cyou dare have the nerve to reveal your handsome face and irresistably sexy body to me without care of the consequences?!\u201d<br>\r\nHer intimidating voice wasnt really intimidating. The aura she was giving off was. And combine that with the fact she is incredibly OPed (even more so now that she's two Flonnes fused into one!) and she's a force to be reckoned with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch an indiscretion will not go unpunished!\u201d suddenly, several little tiny cherubs appear out of nowhere and drag you to the ground, pinning you there! \u201can irresistibly sexy body like yours is meant for satisfying a gorgeous deity of love like myself! Reflect on your sins mortal as I gorge myself!\u201d You almost shudder with anticipation as soon as her midsection rested upon yours! The intensity of her holy crotch alone could drive weaker men to orgasm! \u201cThere will be plenty of smooching! Then rubbing! Then tongue! Followed by some spankings! Then they'll be thrusting! Followed by even more spankings! And more thrusting! And even more spankings until that naughty sexy behind of yours is permanently engraved with my hand prints\u2026 then perhaps some rubbing and smooching so your sexy behind doesnt hurt too badly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Will you just shut up and screw me already?!' man were you getting impatient, although you dare not say it out loud! There is no doubt she's incredibly powerful at this point. She could probably take out Laharl at this rate if was actually smart enough to-<br>\r\n\u2026.holy crap, you got an idea! You may be a sex-crazed alp, but youre still as clever as you were when you were a hero of humanity! If Venus Flonne is more outrageously OP than Laharl is at this point, why not convince HER to overthrow his demonic empire for you? If she's still as gullible as her previous forms, it wont be a challenge for you to convince her, will it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there's always a chance it wont work. And why bother? Youre not the Hero you used to be. And youre only becoming less and less of him with each demoness youre forced to mate with. Just forget about it and enjoy your fate while you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! No, you cant let this be the end of you! You got a tremendous opportunity here! If you turn one of the Netherrealm's toughest generals (er, TWO of their toughest generals) against the Kingdom, you can cripple the Kingdom and it'll eventually crumble. Then you'll be ten times a great hero of humanity than that rock will ever be!<br>\r\nProvided you can convince her, of course.</span></div></div>",

I mean, you are strong and beautiful enough to have anyone willing to follow your words on love... except Laharl.

Did she just flat out say she overthrew Laharl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serves him right, that big meanie!' she continues talking to herself, \"I mean look what he did to all those poor humans! Enslaving them, indoctrinating them with heretical dogma, threatening to nuke cities if they dont provide him his monthly snack horde! Maybe now he'll start to learn to behave himself!\"<br>\r\nYou squint your eyes almost with disbelief. One moment youre suffocating in cleavage hell, the next, the war against the demons had finally come to an end! Uh... hooray? Do you celebrate? Maybe not. Youre still a horny alp. And youre still currently at the mercy of your current captor. You'd sneak out the door while her nice shapely backside is turned to you, but there's a holy spell-ward sealing the door. And the holy key that can undo the ward is in the back pocket of Venus Flonne's brand new tight holy hip-hugging white jeans. And if you attempt to get it at your current state, odds are that youre less likely to actually go for the key than to bury your face between her jean-clad cheeks and start worshiping her holy thong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your head and cringed, hoping she didnt have telepathy and picked up that thought!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" speaking of, V-Flonne stopped her train of thought and quickly turned her attention to you. Her blue and red dual-colored eyes immediately drew your vision toward her and her bright excited smile warmed your icy heart and her new low cut holy white tank top barely concealing her big supple holy tits kinda made you yearn for another suffocation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Smasher!\" her cute amplified voice was angelic music to your ears.<br>\r\n\"Good mor-ow,\" your backside ached as you stepped out of bed. You rubbed the aching portion, and you couldve sworn you felt a hand-shaped bruise, \"uh, good morning. How long was I out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not long!\" she sounds quite just as uppity as her previous Flonne forms, \"just about a week, tops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A WEEK?!\" your corrupted soul almost jumped out of it's corrupted skin, \"I've been out for a whole week?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" VF nodded, \"but dont worry. I made absolutely sure my loyal followers kept you properly safe, secured, and well preserved.\" She crossed her arms, \"But I personally ensured that your super sexy behind remained properly firm and toned, regardless of the many spankings!\" Ugh. So THAT'S why your butt hurts!<br>\r\n\"Gee, uh, thanks,\" you smiled uncomfortably.<br>\r\n\"OOPS!\" she flung her cute little heart-shaped ring across the room, \"Oh dear! I accidentally dropped my love-ring purely out of coincidence and absolutely not out of lust-driven sinful convenience!\" She then gave you an angry frown and pointed at you, \"As the new Queen of the Heavenly Love-Converted Netherrealm, I command you to walk over there and pick it up! And I command you to do it facing away from me and bending at the waist, NOT at the knees!\"  It didnt matter how that obviously perverted demand made you feel. She's an OP fused goddess of absolute destruction. Flaunt your ass, buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure!\" you walked to the other side of the room and bent over at the waist to pick up her ring!<br>\r\n\"Oooo! Ahhhh!\" you pretended to ignore the 'ooo's and 'ahhs' coming from her cherub companions!<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you lord! Thank you for this opportunity of witnessing such a magnificent sight!\" you tried hard pretending to ignore Venus Flonne praying as her shadow was descending on you!<br>\r\n\"H-HERE IT IS!!\" you immediately handed her back her ring and quickly changed the subject before something most likely unrepairable happens! \"S-so... you said youre the new Queen of the Netherrealm?\"<br>\r\n\"The Heavenly Love-Converted Netherrealm,\" she corrected, \"while you were out cold, I overthrew Laharl's evil meanie empire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?!\"<br>\r\n\"Naturally!\" Venus Flonne gave a proud smug grin, \"unfortunately, you missed out on all the action. Sadly, the hero of humanity wasnt able to witness humanity being saved.\" Those words, despite being reduced to no hero at all, brought you to attention. Is it true? Did she honestly save humanity?<br>\r\n\"Wh-what happened?\" the shred of humanity cramped in all that corrupted demon beamed, \"please tell me!\"<br>\r\n\"It was obviously easy for a true goddess of purity and goodness such as myself!\" she stated proudly, \"I marched right into Laharl's throneroom and said 'Wicked Prince! Your nefarious reign of tyranny is over!' and he said 'Wh-what? Flonne? I-I-Is that you?! What happened to you?! When did you grow boobs?!' And then he tried to outnumber me with hundreds of his loyal hellknights, estrus harlots, and suicidal jihadi penguins! But with the power of Almighty by my side and a strong heart of pure gold beating in my voluptuous bosom, I crushed nearly every last one of them! Then I recruited fellow fallen but devoted angels and we swept the Netherrealm clean of the Demon Lord's nasty corruption!\" Holy crap! So it's true?! The war really IS over!! HOORAY! Youre still a horny alp though, but HOORAY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And dont worry, Smasher!\" Venus Flonne stated, \"It's Rape Time has been cancelled permanently! Flatty Queen Etna and all those filthy harlots have been incarcerated for their crimes and are currently being converted into a nunnery!\" NUNNERY?!<br>\r\n\"E...even Xiyu?\" you started to worry for your lovely plump succubi gal-pal.<br>\r\n\"Especially Xiyu!\" NOOOOOOOOO!! NOT HER! NOT YOUR XIYU!!! She's supposed to be your caretaker!! Damn it all!! Damn it all to Hell! ...Well, look on the bright side. Maybe Xiyu will still look fine in her new nun getup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course that didnt get your hopes up as much as when V-Flonne grabbed your hands looked you deep in your eyes.<br>\r\n\"And of course, I would have never accomplished this without you, Smasher!\" your eyes were getting dreamy as she spoke, \"if it wasnt for your dynamic persuading combined with your undeniably sexy alluring body, I would have never mustered the courage to become the savior of mankind!\" In all honesty, you didnt really do THAT much to save your species. You couldnt really take much credit for this. It was just opportunity with an idiot. Any other situation, you'd probably care less for your species by now and just completely give in to your urges. But you havent completely! The Smasher still comes out victorious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...well...\" you blushed and nearly swooned, \"...actually, I should be thanking YOU. Youre the real hero, not me. How can I ever thank you for saving my kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth her red and blue eyes beamed when you asked that question! <br>\r\n\"HOW, you ask?!!\" Uh oh! She sounds intrigued! The aura grew strong, both alluring you and scaring you at the same time!! She took her time thinking of a proper way to repay her for saving your kind... until now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I command you to...\"</span></div></div>",

You tried to tear them away, but V-Flonne was too strong. Looking up at her face, she was giving you a look that was somewhere between motherly, teacher-like, and lustful. Only when her hands stopped glowing, were you able to take them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter noticing a heart with an angel wing and a devil wing on the back of both of your hands, you glared at V-Flonne and asked, \"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I decided that since you're such a cute little alp with some love-issues, I decided to give you a helping ha-ahnnnn!\" V-Flonne said before trailing off with a blush and a moan. She even closed her eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered what she was getting at, until you realized that your hands were fondling her boobs, enough so that her nipples popped out of her tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i-If you wanted some milk, all you had to do was ask...\" V-Flonne said, opening one eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! I didn't mean to do that!\" You said tearing your hands way from her bountiful bosom. you'd be lying if the idea of drinking V-Flonne's personal milk out of her jugs wasn't on your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because of the seal I put on you! It's a training seal that helps beginner sex demons learn how to please others, but I supercharged it, so it'll stay on and overwork until I say otherwise!\" V-Flonne said, still with the blush on her face. \"Oh my!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an annoyed grunt, you looked down. Your hands were feeling up V-Flonne's thighs. Her white pants did little to keep your hands away from her soft thighs. So with another annoyed grunt, you forced one of your hands to be by your side. Looking back up at her, you pointed at her with the other hand and said, \"Flonne, as much as I'd like to be your acolyte, there's the issue of Xi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV-Flonne giggling was not a good sign. The feeling of you about to cum was another bad sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess supercharging it made you someone for your hands to please!\" V-Flonne said as she produced a large cup. The hand of yours that was supposed to be by your side was currently jacking you off, right in front of a freaking goddess-powered devil/angel fusion! \"I've heard good things about the taste from a few demons! So I'd like a cup to go! I have a meeting to get to in an hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting your errant hands up by your shoulders and keeping your eyes on them, you asked, \"Flonne!

A white sleeveless dress with separate white matching sleeves with bows, a cute red cross tie, and awfully short bloomers clearly did not meet your approval!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenus Flonne's warming smile told you she either didnt notice your obvious disdain or simply didnt care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Flonne, what the he-\" she suddenly flashed you a quick intrigued glance that kinda left you feeling a little scared, \"-ECK are these?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are your new acolyte uniforms!\" she says beaming, \"they used to be mine before I assumed the title 'Fallen'. Ah... it seems like only yesterday that I was an innocent non-disgraced angel of mercy and love... well, not so much 'mercy', but still!\"<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard and voiced your disdain, \"Er... these clothes are.... kinda not very fitting for me.\"<br>\r\nShe frowns, \"I know. These are lacking the necessary wings. I'm sorry, Smasher, but youre gonna have to earn those. But dont worry, I'm super confident you'll have no problem doing that!\" THAT'S what she thinks youre upset about?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no no,\" you object, \"this a girl's outfit.\"<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh!\" Venus Flonne shook her head, \"it's actually unisex! You'd be surprised how many boy angels wore this!\"<br>\r\n\"Were they houri?\"<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n\"Er, I said I dont know... I mean... someone like me putting this on... I mean I'd look pretty ridiculous!\"<br>\r\nV-Flonne snickered, \"Aww... youre worried someone's gonna make fun of you?\" You lowered your head, unable to answer the question, which alone answered the question, \"...Well, I'd hate to be that sorry dumb-dumb that makes fun of the Heavenly Love-Converted Netherrealm's High and Mighty Matriarch's most esteemed and beloved subordinate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Oh right. After putting it THAT way, that changes your entire way of thinking completely! What kind of moron WOULD possibly make fun of you, knowing that your new OP godlike boss could obliterate them with a snap of her fingers! You could walk around buck naked completely painted in pink singing 'Do You Believe in Magic' and no one would DARE let out a chuckle your way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... got a point,\" you had to give this one to V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" she nods as she hands you one of the uniform, \"now as your Queen, I command you to try it on!\"<br>\r\nAs if getting some of her enthusiasm seeped into your bloodstream, you nodded hard, \"YES, MY LADY!!\"  And immediately slipped into her old handmedown! Yeah, you looked awfully and disgustingly cute in it (which completely went AGAINST your whole brave hero facade back when you were still one!). To any regular guy, it looked awfully demeaning and degrading! Earlier, you'd way rather be sporting the horny alp look than the new super cutesified (and kinda girly) androgynous cupid-boy look! You may as well have just tossed all your man-cards in the fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, maybe it was V-Flonne's enthusiastic aura filling your body. Because right now, you didnt care about the whole macho man crap! Not only did you look absolutely FABULOUS as a cute angel of mercy and love, you FELT fabulous to match! You felt like a new 'man'! Like a million bucks without the taxes! Ready to face the day and kick it square in the balls! Hell, even your hardon wasnt bothering you, because it felt roomy and snug into your super-short bloomers! The merchandise was well packaged!<br>\r\nAs for your urges... well, you still had them. That 'training seal' was still going overtime. You still wanted to tear every shred of clothing off your mistress and jam your smash-pole into her and sire her demi-children. But the bloomers did great easing the tension amplified from your aching member while the atmosphere emitting from the clothing itself was soothing you, giving you a telepathic pep talk telling you 'You are not a animal! You are a graceful angel! You will not succumb to such sin! You will conquer them! ...And she will properly reward you for it'!<br>\r\n'Properly reward me...' you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully adjusted the nice cool bamboo viscose-laced sleeves and adjusted your  huge yet surprisingly lightweight cross-tie and asked your goddess, \"How do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KAAAAAAWWWWWAAAAIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" the little cherubs on her shoulders squeemed while she let out a sigh.<br>\r\n\"It looks incredible on you!\" she states her approval, \"almost as incredible as it did on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldnt help but blush, \"Well... I gotta admit. I honestly didnt expect this outfit to fit so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be fair, I did sorta modify it a little to properly adjust to your figure,\" she admits, \"I also added a few... suitable changes to it!\"<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n\"We'll go over them another time,\" she immediately changes the subject, \"now, would you be so kind as to hang up with your other uniform in my closet, please?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" you happily remarked as you turned around and headed to her closet, feeling her presence behind you closer than before. You feel it the whole time you properly put the dress back on a hanger and slip it in the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, there,\" you shut the closet and door and turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ZIP!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coulda sworn you caught a millisecond image of V-Flonne crouched up close to your midsection before seeing her zip back to her original spot she was standing in earlier with a smile on her face that appeared to be dripping drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" she wiped the excess drool off her mouth while one of her cherub minions had a bloody nose and the other had a pair of sunglasses on and gritting her teeth! \"Oh! While youre there, could you put my radiant ribbon in there too, please?\" She handed you her old bow-ribbon. You nodded and turned around again to put that in the closet as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Mwa!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"???!!!\" and jumped with surprise as soon as you felt something warm and went press right up against your asscheek! Your BARE asscheek! It literally touched your skin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ZIP!!!*<br>\r\nYou turn back around and see V-Flonne still standing in her original spot... er, funny. You dont remember her wearing blue lipstick earlier. The two cherubs on her shoulders were looking all directions and whistling to themselves. Fortunately for you, despite her major upgrade, Flonne absolutely sucks at deceit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it when you glanced at yourself in the mirror that you notice one of the 'suitable changes' to her old wardrobe: The back of that dress you were in had a nice big heart-shaped hole cut out from the region of your lower back to the top of your asscrack! As if THAT didnt shock you enough, there was a nice blue lipstick print on your left asscheek... about the size of Flonne's lips!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if sensing your shock, V-Flonne's smiling face went completely red and shaky! She was SO caught! And you were SO sinfully violated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-W-W-WHAT... IS THIS?!!\" you had trouble talking properly, \"T-THIS IS.... CUT OUT.... WHERE... AND.... THAT?!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. um.... I-I-I can explain.... I can easily explain this.... you see..... uhhh... well.... the thing about that is.....\" one of her cherubs whispered something in her ear, \"...I've just left you a mark of my blessing!\"<br>\r\nYou tilted your head, \"A mark of your blessing?\"<br>\r\nShe nodded hard, \"Y-Yep! That blessing contains a special magical ward that will keep evil demons with bad hearts away. It also adds a bit of a stat boost increasing your strength, magic, defense, speed, etc. while preventing any status ailments from affecting you as long as my kiss-I mean my mark is on you!\" Oh wow! That's pretty cool! Come to think of it, you do a feel a bit stronger. But...<br>\r\n\"Well, couldnt you have just put the mark on my face?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope! It HAD to be your butt!\" she states factually, \"that's how it works!\" That's weird. But a free stat boost is a free stat boost!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... thank you!\" youre still grateful for her blessing. Weirded out a little, but grateful, \"I really appreciate the gift!\"<br>\r\n\"Youre welcome. Let me know if you need another one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time to mull on that now.<br>\r\n\"Oh dear!\" V glanced at the clock, \"all this time we spent, I had almost forgot about the meeting! I better hurry before I'm late!\"<br>\r\n\"Who are you meeting with?\" you ask instead of offering her a cup of your delicious seed. Thank you so much, holy bloomers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm meeting with the representatives of the Human Resistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHUMAN RESISTANCE?! That got your undivided attention! She's gonna be meeting with your colleagues! That's good... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you know a few of the reps over there,\" even she knew, \"would you like to come? I'm sure they'd love to see you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSEE YOU AGAIN?!! LOOKING LIKE THIS?!! How are you gonna explain your absence?! From a demon sex-slave to a horny imp to a cross-dressing servant of an angel/demon queen?!! LOOKING LIKE THIS?!!<br>\r\nThe atmosphere was telling you that you had nothing to worry about, but you clearly DID! This would be awkward. You'd be ruined! But again, the atmosphere was still telling you that you had nothing to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, you cant stay hidden forever. SOMEBODY'S gonna find out about your fate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, you swallow hard and make your decision.</span></div></div>",

The entire room waited with impatient silence while the stupid imp just kept staring with a hint of suspicion and disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Ahem!*\u201d Pandora cleared her voice and repeated, \u201cand the next lucky lady or ladies to share a moment of passion and/or unadulterated lust is...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a sec!\u201d Etna snapped as she kept staring oddly at the paper.<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Etna?\u201d even Flonne was getting tired of waiting, \u201cthe girls are looking a little anxious. We really should hurry up and announce the name of the-WHAT IN THE UNHOLY HELL IS THIS UNGODLY IMPURE FILTH?!!!\u201d Wow. Some 180 that cute little fallen angel just made. Now youre REALLY curious whose name is on that paper!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon, ladies! Tell everybody the name!\u201d a familiar smug bratty voice called out from the audience. Too familiar. Like dang near the same exact voice that dropped you into this mess in the first place!<br>\r\nYou marched over to Flonne and Etna and snatched the paper out of their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a disgusted look on your face, you read out the name:<br>\r\n\u201cLaharl-Chan?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire crowd gasped in unison. You coulda sworn the pot grinned ever sharper than earlier! Everybody but you got the message. Not that it mattered, you'd find out soon enough!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAahahahahahahaaaa!!!\u201d went the hearty annoying laugh of a certain overpowered blue-haired brat coming out the mouth of a pretty young blue haired pointy-earred woman in the audience\u2026 clad in a fire-style bra, tight red hip-hugging jeans\u2026 and the same exact tattered red scarf and two antennae-like hair strands sticking out like\u2026 NO FREAKING WAY! IS THIS THE REAL LIFE?! IS THIS JUST FANTASY?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2026 SHE got up out of her seat and stalked toward you as every single female audience member stared in cold silence!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeeeeey Smasher, baby!\u201d 'she' said in a disturbingly seductive tone, \u201cfor a puny weak human turned lust imp, you sure are looking fiiiiiine!\u201d ...She then turned and whispered, \u201cdid I get that right? That's how a girl's supposed to sound, yeah? I didnt mess that up, did I?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldnt know, dood,\u201d answered his prinny subordinate.<br>\r\n\u201cThat's something you should be asking one of your female colleagues,\u201d answered the long-fingered guy in the robe. You couldnt stop blinking at the sight in front of you. This chick was Laharl?! Overlord Laharl? Rule 63 Laharl?! The very demon lord you sought to bring down and liberate your kind from once upon a time\u2026 with boobies! CAUGHT IN A LANDSLIDE, NO ESCAPE FROM REALITY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaharl, what in the everloving fuck is going on?!\u201d Etna stared at him/her with absolute disgust, \u201cwhat is the meaning of...\u201d she points all over him, \u201c...THAT?!!\u201d<br>\r\nLaharl grins, \u201cOh, this? Well, ever since I heard you girls were making a big game out of raping the piss out of one of my more keen arch-nemesises.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNemeses,\u201d Nic corrects her.<br>\r\n\u201cIt got me thinking,\u201d Laharl continues, \u201cwhy let such a tremendous opportunity go to waste? What's the best way for a proud lord of all the Netherrealm to properly HUMILIATE such a powerful foe without killing him? The answer of course would be to force him to sire their offspring! The very Demon Hunter sought to destroy the Demon Lord would be the very father of the Demon Lord's child, continuing the royal bloodline with the help of his very seed! The Strong breeding with Strong to create more Strong!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWith the genes of the Smasher flowing within the veins of the future Crowned Prince, he would truly be an unstoppable force to be reckoned with,\u201d Nic stated, \u201cit would also deal a devastating blow to the Resistance. The son of their hero would be their ultimate destruction.\u201d Damn. That is pretty deep. That truly would hurt the Resistance. So many were counting on you. It's bad enough Etna reduced you to this sex-craving little monster, but now the Overlord him/herself wants you to bare a Demon child that would one day be the next Overlord?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHAT STILL DOESNT EXPLAIN\u2026 THAT!!!\u201d oh right, the whole sex-change thing. Thanks for reminding us, Etna!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the fine work of the great Unhallowed Surgeon Quixote! Cost a ton, but she has skills most quacks cant even DREAM of pulling off!\u201d Laharl answered.<br>\r\nQuixote\u2026 that's a name you aint heard in a while. You cant say you've met her in person. You have however met some of her patients. One good thing about being an alp: The uncontrollable lust is great for brushing away the painful memories!<br>\r\n\u201cAnd by the way,\u201d Laharl bragged, \u201ceverything you see? 100% all natural! These babies squirt REAL milk!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTMI, dood,\u201d Prinny remarked with disgust.<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough to be fair, Overlord milk must have an overabundance of vitamins and protein,\u201d Nic quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaharl! How could you do this to me?!\u201d Flonne cried, heartbroken, \u201cI thought the two of us meant something!\u201d Pot meets the fucking kettle!<br>\r\n\u201cLIKE I GIVE A CRAP ABOUT YOUR LITTLE LOVER'S QUARREL!\u201d Etna blurted, \u201cPrince, you cant participate in this game!  The rule strictly states 'NO MALE CONTESTANTS'!\u201d<br>\r\nBoth Laharl, Nic, and the Prinny point over to the androgynous Flora beast in the audience<br>\r\n\u201cBridget doesnt count. We burnt his ticket.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, as shameful and disgusting this is, your Alp half didnt really care that the Overlord is a guy turned girl. Your prick was not picky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRegardless, as your superb sovereign,\u201d Laharl announces, \u201cI officially pull rank, overturning your rules and declaring myself the winner!\u201d<br>\r\n\"Screw the rules, we have money, dood!\"<br>\r\nAs expected, the crowd booed, hissed, jeered, and hurled objects at the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*KABOOOOOM!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen immediately gasped in shocked silence as soon a quarter of the auditorium was obliterated right before their eyes! Everybody got the message then.<br>\r\n\u201cPandora, make the announcement,\u201d ordered Laharl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, our current winner is none other than our beloved supreme Lord\u2026 Lady and master, Overlord Laharl!\u201d Nobody but Nic and the Prinny clapped as she took a bow then grabbed your arm, making you both tense AND hard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you! Thank you so much!\u201d Laharl thanked everybody, \u201cnow if you'll excuse us\u2026 the Hero and I have some business to take care of!\u201d The door appeared out of nowhere and you glanced over at an enraged Etna and heartbroken Flonne before being pulled through it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door magically led you to...</span></div></div>",

She was offering herself to you, but was she serious? She seemed like she might run you through with the spear rather than keep her word. Nevertheless, she at least might NOT kill you if you found the other prinnies. You run down the hall, following the path of the other prinnies. You find a staircase at the end that leads down.
