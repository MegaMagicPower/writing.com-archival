At work you were laid off due to budget cuts, meaning you were unable to make your already 1 week overdue rent payment. This resulted in you getting evicted from your apartment. When you went over to your girlfriend's place, hoping to crash there overnight you discover her with another guy and she dumps you. Heading back to your car, which contains all your remaining belongings you discover it to have been stolen. When you try to call the police to report the theft you discover that your cellular plan has been cancelled due again to late payment. You then walk to a hotel only to have your credit cards and bank cards refused due to being overdrawn. after bumming some coins off of some pedestrians you make your way, in a drenching thunderstorm, to a phone booth and call your parents only to learn that your father has been arrested for assaulting your mother and that your mother is moving overseas to live with her sister. Finally convinced that you've reached rock bottom, you start the long trek across the city (on foot) to your sister's apartment. Along the way you are mugged. The mugger takes your wallet, cell phone, watch and glasses and leaves you with swollen lip. when he hit you to make his escape. Half blinded without your glasses you continue your journey to your sister's apartment and finally arrive moments before a power outage begins, prohibiting you from buzzing in to have you sister let you in. As you sit there in the outer lobby of your sister's building a police officer comes by and when you can't produce any id proving your relationship with one of the building's tenants (your sister) he tosses you back out on the street into the drenching rain. Eventually you find a place to rest under an evergreen and drift off into a fitful sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon first light you snap awake and look around, wondering where you are for a moment before regretfully remembering the events of the day before. brushing the pine needles off you go back over to your sister's building and ring her apartment. She buzzes you in and you go up the elevator to her fifth floor apartment. Once inside your sister's apartment you tell her your story and she offers her condolences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/buttonb.png\" alt=\"*ButtonB*\" title=\"ButtonB\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the question is, how does the story progress from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Your sister is moving to go to an all girl's community and offers to help you dress up as a girl to come along.<br>\r\n2. Your sister is moving to africa to help with a charity and uses a potion she'd been given by a friend to morph you into a copy of her to stay in town and take over her life<br>\r\n3. Your sister says she wishes your situations are reversed and the world's last genie makes that request come true before dying</span></div></div>",

When the bra is released you stare down at your breasts; a slight tingle going through your body. You knew your sister was stacked but this was amazing. Your hands gently touching your breasts, holding them and squeezing them. Not sure when you ever felt such pleasure. It only reminded you of your other new region when you felt a slight damp feeling at your crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly pull the panties off to admire your private part, it certainly looked different than your own.

Your moans are loud and listening to them make yourself go crazy; you sound exactly like Jackie. When you finally feel an orgasm coming you go even faster and then you feel yourself cumming clenching your toes. Staring at your reflection  you see Jackie's body orgasm.

And then I felt so happy and I...\" You couldn't go on anymore as you felt tears pouring out of your eyes. You were just so tired of living, having to deal with a shitty life like yours. And then when Jackie's body gave you that pleasure, you were not thinking about your life, there was only the pleasure. But it was wrong having it done. So you sit on the floor crying your eyes out when you suddenly feel a hug. To your surprise it's Jackie. She's holding you close to her and you automatically hug her back, just like when you were younger. You remember that time those bullies gave you a beating. Your parents weren't home when you came back, but Jackie was. She held you just like now, forgetting your worries for the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry too Josh. I shouldn't have become so angry at you.\" She says in a calm voice. \"The shock of you in my body seeing me like that, was too much for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I won't do it again.\" You promise her. To your surprise she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you won't have to. It's okay with me, but just promise me you won't do it when I'm around here. I'd rather not see it. And besides,\" she says pointing to your old crotch, \"I want to test this thing out as well. Can't wait how that feels.\" She says sporting a little grin. She then turns serious again. \"That said you better get dressed up again. We need to discuss what we do now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head and as Jackie goes back to the living room you dress up in her clothes. The bra took a little while but after some huffing and puffing you manage to put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie is sitting on the couch as she sees you. \"Having trouble with the bra?\" You nod to her question.\" I'll let you know later how to do it easier. We now have to focus on getting our bodies back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we do that? You heard that genie, he was dying. We can't ask him to swap back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know dammit. Ugh, this really sucks. Not to mention that I have a meeting in an hour.\" Jackie says frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A meeting? What kind of meeting?\" You ask Jackie surprised.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You, Joshua Kendall, had had an impossibly bad day yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust yesterday, you'd lost your job. The reason hurt more then anything else. Your boss had hired his nephew to a position he just created, naming him Vice President of Work Place Efficiencies. It came with a parking spot, a corner office, two assistants, one secretary, and one whopper of a paycheck. For the first few months, it seemed like the nephew did nothing in his role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he provided his first suggestions to improve efficiency. Namely, fire 25% of the ENTIRE STAFF, and for the remainder to take on the extra work load. And guess who'd been one of the canned?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the shit storm that was yesterday wasn't done yet, oh no. You'd already been behind on your rent payment thanks to a pay cut earlier in the year, and your landlord was many things, but definitely not understanding. It had taken an embarrassing amount of begging to get him to agree to wait until pay day, so he was just tickled pink when you told him that you were now unemployed. Before you could blink, he'd evicted you, giving you a week to get him an address to ship your stuff or it'd hit the bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they say bad things come in threes, so obviously there was more pain in store. You'd gone over to your girlfriend's place. You and Tiffany hadn't been dating long, maybe a couple months, but hopefully she'd be willing to put you up for a little while. As you were walking up her driveway, you'd stopped dead in your tracks. There was Tiffany in the window, stark naked, bouncing up and down on an unfamiliar lap. The two of you had made eye contact, and you promptly turned around and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany had come out of the house, calling down the road for you, but you'd dutifully ignored her as you travelled down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you were pretty desperate, weren't you? It really would take something like this to make you actually call your parents for help, as you were anything but close. All attempts to reach them ended in silence, however, and it was only through Facebook that you found out why. It seems your Dad decided to try and end your mother's life and was now in jail. Your Mom, meanwhile, had moved to the East Coast to be with her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, the only parent you could have turned to was now about 6-8,000 miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, because you pissed in a baptismal fount during your christening, God decided to throw one more curve ball your way, and you got mugged. You were now left with no money, no ID, and no phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you only had a single option left. And so, you began the long, <b>long</b> hike to your sister's house townhouse at the edge of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*** *** ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour home life had been pretty screwed up, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom had been a gamblaholic, and your Dad was a drunk. Their standard night involved your Mom driving the two of them to the bar, where she'd play the VLT's while your old man drank his face off. Then, she'd drive them both back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, at least they weren't driving drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour family was always broke, constantly getting evicted, or having the utilities cut off. In the end, the only person you'd been able to rely on was your twin sister, Samantha. She was shy, bookish, and brilliant. She'd always excelled at school, and got into MIT on a scholarship. You'd been so proud of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, likewise, you'd been devastated when she decided to forego college to marry her high school boyfriend, Chad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you had had a pretty serious fight, and didn't speak for a very long time. She'd finally reached out three months back, just to inform you that she and Chad had gotten divorced, which you promptly ruined by saying, \"I told you so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really are one dumb son of a bitch, you know that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*** *** ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate my brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whispered that aloud as you stood on your sister's front porch, delaying knocking on her door. How long had it been since you'd seen her in person? A year? Two years? As kids, you'd been inseparable, and being apart from Sam for so long had felt like you'd lost a part of yourself. How would you even go about repairing this badly burnt bridge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, only one way to find out,\"</i> you thought, hitting the doorbell before you thought about it for too long. Immediately, you heard the sounds of dogs barking, but the place was otherwise silent. No lights were on, and you were really beginning to doubt anyone was home when, at long last, you heard the sounds of locks being adjusted. The door opened a crack and a familiar voice came from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh? What are you doing here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sam. I... I need some help. Can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha still hadn't opened the door very wide, and you could just make out one of her green eyes behind her thick, black frames. \"I haven't seen you in almost two years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and I'm sorry. Not for hating Chad, but for not even trying to see you. I thought you just needed distance, then by the time I realized you were waiting for me to call, I'd made it too weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniff. \"You smell like shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I slept in a bush last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell.\" You heard Sam shifting behind the door. \"You can come in, but... just, promise not to judge me, okay? I'll explain, but I get enough shit from Chad and my ex-in-laws.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I won't. Thank you so much,\" you said, gratitude apparent in your voice as she closed the door to undo the locks. You were rather curious as to why she was worried about you judging her. Maybe she'd gotten really fat while married to Chad? He was a pretty shallow creep, so it would explain why he'd given your twin so much flak. You were standing there, picturing all the terrible things you'd do to Chad given half the chance when at long last the front door opened. When you set eyes on Sam, your train of thought was hopelessly derailed. Your jaw dropped open, and you could do nothing but stare. \"Holy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not the Sam you knew. Now, the Sam you knew was a very cute girl. She had shoulder length brown hair, green eyes hidden behind her glasses, and more freckles then you could shake a stick at. She was petite, had the 'girl next door' look, and while a brother shouldn't notice these things, her breasts had been a handful at most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, well... at least the freckles were the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Samantha couldn't have been more different then your memories. The first thing you noticed was her hair. She'd dyed it a bright bubble gum pink, and it now easily reached her belt line. She had an assortment of tattoos on her arms, legs, and exposed belly, mostly depicting skulls, battle scenes, and Gaelic curses. As she ran her hand through her hair, you could see more ink on the back of her hand and on each ringed finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also wearing a ton of jewellery, most of it Egyptian themed. Rings, bracelets, thick necklaces and a wide assortment of earrings and other piercings. Oh lord, the piercings. Everywhere you looked on her, you could see more - her ears, her nose, her eyebrows, her belly button. You could even tell her nipples were pierced through her tight top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer choice of clothes left <i>nothing</i> to the imagination. She was dressed in a pair of Daisy Duke's so short, they might as well have been a glorified belt. And for a shirt, she was wearing a sky blue tube top over a lacy pink bra, leaving most of her generous measurements on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd boy oh boy, were they generous. At some point, your sister had clearly gotten a boob job, and she didn't half ass this. They were absolutely enormous, and it honestly looked like your tiny twin had strapped a couple of silicon basketballs to her chest. You briefly lost yourself in her cavernous cleavage before your eyes snapped back up to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you mentally berated yourself for checking out your own sister, she shifted uncomfortably. She was still wearing the same thick, black framed glasses you remembered, and she still twirled the hair behind her ear when she was nervous. She finally got enough courage to look you in the eye, and as she spoke, your could see a flash of silver from her mouth. It seemed she'd also pierced her tongue. However, what she said next definitely cemented that this was indeed your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, have you eaten yet? I've got some pop tarts and nachos in the kitchen.\"</span></div></div>",
