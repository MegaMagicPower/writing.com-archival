However, he wasn't finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, to finish this off. I'll give one last surprise!\", Monokuma excitingly yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students widened thier eyes, as the bear drew a dart gun. It aimed in the direction of the student Makoto Naegi. The yellow dart was shot and zoomed past the students who looked back in shock. The dart missed Makoto's head by an inch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd hit Ken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blacknette fell onto the floor, dart embitted in his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PUPUPUPU~, have fun Kenny~\", Monkuma taunted before vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto keeled down in worry next to Ken. Despite just meeting the boy, he still was worried. He noted quickly however that Ken's body seem to be getting.....smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ultimates watched in confusion as Ken dwindled down, eventually reaching a inch. Opening his eyes, Ken looked up shocked as Makoto loomed over him as a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nThe students soon adjusted to thier imprisonment. Ken had the most difficulty doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around took hours. When he arrived for breakfast, all that was left was scraps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraveling around the school was a challenge when he was this size. Almost all walks had him against the wall when his classmates passed. He'd nearly been flattened, but luckily Hagakure's sandals were elevated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto would luckily see him and gently carry him where ever he needed to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogami would pay little attention. He missed stepping on him by an inch and would scoff and tell Ken not to spoil his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIshimaru was strict. If Ken was late, he would scold him regardless of his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen sighed, wondering what he was in for today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed Ken was going to encounter......</span></div></div>",

His pompadour was slightly messy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Mondo stopped and stood up, wiping the sweat from his forehead. Grabbing a towel to wipe his strong chest, he made his way over to where Ken was standing.

The tiny watched as the titanic teen loomed over him and sneered over his muscled chest down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you little bastard, you wanna come in here i'll give you a warm welcome!\", Mondo barked as he clenched his fists and brought up his right foot, covering Ken in a shadow while filling his sky with his white sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S CRUSHIN TIME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying that the shoe was brought down at full speed, within a second Ken quickly jumped to the left, getting blasted away by the excessive force of Mondo's stomp. The biker swiveled his foot but stopped at the lack of a crunch. Bringing his shoe up, Mondo saw the absence of a red splat before catching the moving speck getting away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrr..quick huh? Well try and outrun this!\", Mondo growled before bringing his knee up to his chest and leaning forward into his next stomp. Ken manage to hop out of the shadow of the foot and get blasted away further. Mondo meanwhile smirked before leaning onto his stomper wanting to hear the satisfying crunch, but stopped and widened his eyes as he saw the speck fleeing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EH?! STAY THE FUCK STILL SO I CAN CRUSH YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMondo continued his stomping assault, always missing ken by a hair. More sweat dripped down his body, both from moving so much and the seething rage he felt at not being able to smash a (to him) bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen wasn't doing too well. He was getting tired and Mondo seem to just stomp more. thinking of a new strategy, Ken ran over to Mondo's bed and started climbing the covers. He wished he had Makoto's luck right now. Hopefully he could hide in the bed until Mondo lost interest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMondo however saw the speck crawling up towards his bed and smirked. \"Alright you little fucker, i'll play dirty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen managed to make it on top of the bed. looking around, he tried to find a fold he could maybe hide in. He stopped when the area around him darkened. Looking up, at the sight before him his jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMondo's backside was looming over him. HIs thick thighs, firm rear, and muscled back. The gang leader smirked widely over his shoulder down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you fucking pest, i'm about to show you a real man's weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tan giant's knees bent and his large ass stretched his pants before completely filling Ken's sky.

In his hands was a insect case, with what appeared to bugs inside. However, looking closer you could see that the \"bugs\" were in fact tiny humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young adult was known as The Ultimate Scientist. He was responsible in creating a serum capable of shrinking human beings down to half a inch tall. Immediately Ken received numerous companies in favor of purchasing his research for the benefits of mankind. The man was put off by this, if his invention was sold what were the chances of it being used for war or illegal purposes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serum gained a purpose when the tragedy happened. Ken gained a job at Future Foundation, he had the task of shrinking possible Remnants of Despair and capturing them. Most cases ended the same, the shrunken humans were found guilty and executed. While he didn't know the process, Ken always saw Munakata changing his shoes before the execution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was brought out of his thoughts when he felt his face suddenly hit a wall. Opening his eyes he saw the \"wall\" was in fact a pair of large pecs and that they belonged to Juzo Sakakura, The Ultimate Boxer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Pardon me Sakakura-kun!\", Ken nervously bowed his head at the much taller man. Juzo gave a grunt in response, before his eyes trailed down to the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So those the new Remnets?\", the boxer asked as he grinned slyly at the case. Ken gave a nod in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuzo bended over bringing his face to the glass wall. Inside multiple adults were thrashing around, some had monokuma heads while others looked pure insane. All of the shrunken humans had a elastic band wrapped around them, so they didn't kill each other. Juzo smirked as he watched them, before standing back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know Nakagawa, I could take these bugs off your hand for you. I'm sure I can SQUEEZE the truth outta them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen gulped. \"I-i'm sorry Sakakura-kun, I was instructed to deliver them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hn, alright get them to interrogation. I'm sure thier dying to get a taste.\", Juzo slyly said as he walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen sighed before continuing down the hall. The short Ultimate soon arrived at the room in question. Opening the door, he was greeted by a pale green room with a single table and chairs. Walking over to the table, Ken placed the case down. He looked down  at the inhabitants in the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It be best you talk, they don't hold back when it comes to getting information. I don't know what they do, but i can hear thumps from outside when they do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen felt the need to prepare these prisoners somehow. That's all he could hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as he placed his hands in his lab coat he felt a sudden...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling his hand out in horror, Ken looked as the shrinking serum drenched his hand. His body began to tingle and as he leaned against the table, his frame shrank in size, eventually coming to the size of the shrunken prisoners. Ken looked up in shock as he stood in front of the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is bad if he get's caught, who knows what'll happen. Just as Ken moved the door suddenly opened, and the white haired Munakata came striding in now the size of a giant. He soon stepped to the side allowing the interrogator to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw it was.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The boy made headlines with his creation of the shrinking serum. While this was a breakthrough, it would soon be put to vile uses when the tragedy occurred. Ken would shrink people down, thier last sight being his boot sole and his crazed grin. Even in the midst of the chaos he still made himself known to the Future Foundation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good while of using his own serum and regrowth pills to hide from Future Foundation, he was finally caught and while shrunken for that matter.

Connected to them were the sleeves of a white suit, and they went up to the head of Munakata Kyosuke the Ultimate Student Council President.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white haired man looked down at Ken with his intense and stern gaze. \"Speak now despair.

With him this time was a tablet, setting it down Munkata sat in a chair and focused his stern gaze on the tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then agent, confess your crimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen tilted his head as he childishly grinned. \"Hmmm, what crimes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunakata kept his composure as he gazed at the tablet screen. \"Ken Nakagawa, the Ultimate Scientist.

A connection between these deaths is that all corpses were only a inch in height.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunakata placed the tablet down, looking at Ken with a more intense gaze. \"Now then despair, confess your crimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say I do, what would happen?\", Ken kept his childish attitude as he swayed side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you confess to every murder you've done, then you shall be executed by lethal injection. However, if you hold off like this, then it was agreed you would recieve a fitting punishment.\", Munakata explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you would risk me staining your shoe~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunakata took a quick glance down at his dress shoe before narrowing his eyes at Ken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind if my shoes are stained, seeing you splattered on my sole would be all to pleasing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smirked before sighing. \"Alright I'll confess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunakata picked up the tablet before nodding to signal Ken to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen brought up his leg, showing the treads of his boot. \"This right here is my weapon, the serum was step one and this bad boy was step two.\", placing both boot soles together, Ken looked off in reminisce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember when I was little. An ant had gotten into the house, and my father got rid if it. I always wondered how the ant felt, to have my father a giant raising his lofer over it and looking at it with only annoyance. Then when this tragedy began, I figured out what that ant felt. Fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I shrunk down a drunk man vandalizing a car, he looked up at me with nothing but fear. I realized, when a large being has the ability to end your life with a step, all you can do is hope thier merciful. Once I started, I couldn't stop. They all looked up in fear at the big bad giant and his boot. I even tricked one of your own into doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunakata widened his eyes at this confession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daisaku was his name right? Sweet guy huh? I shrunk down about twenty people, didn't touch them though. But I watched when he arrived wanting to give supplies. Didn't even look down, walking around confused as to where everyone was. It seems unreal, a sweet guy like that crushing them totally oblivious to why there were stains on his sandal. One even ran up to him, only to be stomped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunakata clenched his teeth. It was one thing when Ken did it, but making someone snuff out humans and not even know about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next moment, the white haired giant grabbed Ken in a fist. The tiny found himself being squeezed and then roughly thrown on the floor. Looking up at the pale giant, his front began to stiffen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunakata stood up, clenching his fists and looking down at Ken with complete hatred. His right trouser leg then rose, bringing the foot with it. Ken looked as the black sole of the shoe loomed over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunakata looked at the mere speck on the floor, one small step could reduce the agent to paste. His hands trembled from how hard he clenched them, he wanted to stomp on the man so badly. A weird feeling filled him, a sort of excitement. Right now, the man under him was a bug. He wanted to relish in the sound of his crunching body, to have him stuck to his sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunakata blinked. Where did those dark thoughts come from. Looking down, he still had his foot raised and Ken beneath him. He took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen's body bounced at the vibration. Rather then stomping him, Munakata placed his foot back next to the other. The pale giant then grabbed the back of the elastic band before dropping Ken back in the bug case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant made his way to the door, stopping to look over his shoulder at Ken again with his signature gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll return shortly. We will finish this, and see if you end up under my shoe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen once again was left alone. He panted as he replayed the events. That ultimate didn't seem have the highest control. Maybe he'd get his pleasure soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time</span></div></div>",

It's ya boy, back at it again with another interactive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it's focused on the Video game/Anime Danganronpa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, before you proceed with the interactive I'm going to need to tell you that going into this story will spoil you on the Danganronpa games. If you don't want to be spoiled then go catch up and come back, if not then proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also have to give a disclaimer that this may have more mature content. Danganronpa is known for it's dark and violent moments, so the chapters may be more graphic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the way this interactive will work is I'm going to list the Danganronpa games and anime. Depending on which choice you pick, the protagonist could either be on the side of hope or despair. Some may have a option to pick, depending on the number of characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-With hope, the character will have a ultimate talent and like everyone wants to inspire hope for the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- With despair, the character will want nothing more then to submerg everyone in negative emotions and create chaos with his talent. <br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nOk onto the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Keep the micro interactions M/M. Now there will be female characters, but keep the macro/micro on the male characters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You can end the storyline, but don't do it abruptly. Keep the story going and try to make a happy or sad ending..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Gore is allowed, this includes the main character dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You can do what ever micro interaction you want, but please refrain from scat or piss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright then, read on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPUPUPUPUPUPUPUPUPU~</td>",
