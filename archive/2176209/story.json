You also are kinda broke, so you had to watch old cartoons you got from the bargain bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the ones you watched, you liked the Mario cartoon the best. In fact, you were surprised that even though Nintendo liked to pretend the cartoon didn't exist, they did borrow a lot from it. Like Bowser and Peach being able to use powerups, Luigi being a scaredy cat, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a rainy day, you sighed, wondering if you were gonna go on and do nothing forever.... Then you looked out of a window and saw something that boggled your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA green pipe, right in your backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting on rainboots, a raincoat, and an umbrella, you walked out to go check it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked up to the pipe and looked down it.<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mushroom Kingdom, Princess Toadstool was talking a walk around her kingdom, merely enjoying the bright sunny day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is a wonderful day... The Sun is shining, the birds are chirping...\" Toadstool said with a smile. Then she frown a little bit and muttered, \"and yet I'm lonely. Mario loves food way too much, Luigi's easily scared, Toad values his retainership way too much... I wish I could get... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then noticed a brand new warp pipe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... Wonder where that goes? Maybe I should ask the Mario brothers or Toad if they...\" Toadstool began before shaking her head. \"No! It's my time to shine! It's my adventure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she walked to the pipe and looked down it.</span></div></div>",

Usually the pipes' magic prevented any sounds from coming at the other end. Not wanting to be rude, she replied, \"Yes. I am Princess Toadstool of the Mushroom Kingdom. To whom am I speaking to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked. Whoever put this green pipe was obviously playing a prank. Who'd claim to be a character from an old cartoon show? Probably the same person who placed the green pipe. You gave them props for being able to mimic the princess's voice and decided to try and pick up the pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you decided to play along and said, \"My name is Y/N. I live in Canastota, New York.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New York? That's where Mario and Luigi lived! I have to tell them we found a pipe that'll allow them to go home in the real world!\" Toadstool replied in a happy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, that might be a problem...\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, why is that?\" Toadstool asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mario and Luigi and Princess Toadstool are all video game characters... and I guess cartoon characters. Toadstool's been renamed to Peach, even,\" You answered a bit smugly as you leaned on the pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh. So this is a warp pipe that leads to an alternate dimension. I guess the Mario Bros aren't going home. So, you know my first name... Are the video games and cartoon good?\" Toadstool asked, the wind blown out of her sails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The video game series is still going strong thirty-some years after it was created. The Cartoon ran short, but it still has its fans, even if a good amount of them like to mock it to this day,\" You answered. You thought,<i> 'Man, they're dedicated to keeping this prank going on.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... I guess that's better than nothing...\" Toadstool replied. \"I have a question...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and ask,\" You replied.<i> 'If they're a cute girl, I'll ask them on a date. This wasn't that bad of a prank.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment or two, Toadstool asked...</span></div></div>",

Toad? Where are you?\" Toadstool cried out as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, princess! What's wrong?\" Toad asked, carrying a box of city incident reports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found a new warp pipe! One that leads to a different real world, one that's not where the Mario Brothers are from! I was able to talk to someone through the warp pipe!\" Toadstool answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee! That's pretty interesting, princess! I'll let the Mario Brothers know, so we can go see that world!\" Toad replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm going to see it for myself. It's my time to shine as an adventurer,\" Toadstool said as she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't it dangerous to go by yerself? Yer a princess!\" Toad said as he put the box on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take care of myself, Toad. Besides, it's only a small trip,\" Toadstool replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... since youse made up yer mind, at least let me come with yah to the pipe,\" Toad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, but I'll wait at the castle door until you put that box away,\" Toadstool said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToad nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the pipe. You said to yourself, \"I wonder if I can turn it into a flower pot? Might be nice to grow some red sunflowers. They look like fireflowers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Y/N? Are you still there?\" Toadstool's voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I let Toad know and he'll be seeing me off. Is there anything you want to warn me about before I travel through the pipe?\" Toadstool's voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, It's raining here, but I do have an umbrella with me,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. I have one too! Thanks for the warning!\" Toadstool's voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rememba, princess! Don't take too long!\" Toad's voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't forget,\" Toadstool's voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'They're really dedicated to this prank if they made a Toad voice,' </i>you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few seconds, you were shocked to see A red-haired woman pop half-out the pipe, holding a pink umbrella over her head.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dressed just like the Princess Toadstool on the show. She did look a little off, like her eyes being a bit bigger than a normal person's and her forearms being a little bulgy. If you had to guess, her bosom was about C-cup or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Y/N... Wow, you're pretty cute,\" Toadstool said, blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're cute too,\" You replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool then seemed to be having a bit of trouble, trying to get out of the pipe. Then again, it was raining, so maybe it was because it was wet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked, \"Could you give me a little help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you said, extending a hand.</span></div></div>",

I gotta split. Those reports won't file themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... can we go get something I can use as a weapon? I think I broke that tree branch on a Koopa,\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but let's get something that won't scare my subjects,\" Toadstool said as she grabbed your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bat?\" You asked as you and Toadstool walked out of the sporting goods store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You did swing that branch around like a club,\" Toadstool answered. \"And besides, it's easily repairable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you have a good point as you put the bat in a  back sheath. \"So... Why didn't you fight back against the Koopas and Goombas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I do know some martial arts, it's not befitting of a princess to enter into fisticuffs. What if one of my citizens not in the adventurer's Guild imitated my actions against the Koopas? They could get into some serious trouble!\" Toadstool answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any magic?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have any innate magic, but give me a wand, some space, and a little bit of time, and I can whip up anything!\" Toadstool answered with a grin that oozed pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a single chuckle before you asked,\"So what now?\"</span></div></div>",

Mostly delivering paperwork or delivering coffee/juice/water/soda and snacks. Toad was pretty helpful and even had a few stories that were interesting... as well as a few stories that let you know he had some blackmail on some rather jerky people, which made him a bit scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of that, you got a license for adventuring and completed a few tasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of which was finding lost pets or helping deliver groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept an eye on the newspapers and the internet cafes for any signs of King Koopa or his Koopalings.

In fact, it's a game called 'Luigi's mansion'.\" You added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... do I...\" Luigi began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mario get's rescued by you. The game only had you by yourself, with Dr. E. Gadd as support,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And with all of us working together, I bet we can finish this problem in a third of the time!\" Toadstool answered with a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad I only have the one Poltergust,\" Dr. E.

You promised yourself to start working out more in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... While Dr. E. Gadd works his magic, let's figure out a plan,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have a floorplan. All we know is that it appeared,\" Toadstool said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have this. Dr. E. Gadd said it's called the Game Boo Horror,\" Luigi said, producing a modified Game Boy. He pressed a few buttons before it showed a map of the first floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Luigi. First thing, We don't split up unless we absolutely have to,\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a good idea, but I saw some ghosts when Mario and I checked the mansion... I looked away and he just vanished,\" Luigi replied, looking a bit sad. He looked at you and asked, \"Do you know if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mario is sealed inside a portrait within the mansion. We get to the roof, we defeat the head ghost there, then we can bring Mario's portrait back here to be freed,\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finished!\" Dr. E.Gadd exclaimed, holding two more Poltergusts. Unlike Luigi's, these looked a bit ramshackled. \"I apologize, but due to the lack of proper materials, these have less functions than Luigi's. They don't have the element functions or the ability to be used as a vehicle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than nothing, Dr. E. Gadd,\" Toadstool replied as she and you put on your poltergusts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking a bit guilty, Luigi began, \"Hey, maybe I should-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your poltergust. You're more of an expert at the hero thing more than the princess or me,\" You quickly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Toadstool said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the mansion...</span></div></div>",

Somehow, Toadstool flew backwards, and landed against something soft.

A very special coffin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coffin? Why is there a coffin in here?\" Toadstool asked as she tried to push open the lip open and was unable to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, to make a vampire, Silly!

Sure, they dressed like how people thought people in the medieval times dressed. None of them seemed bothered by your modern clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was food and drinks, but the prices were far more fair. Perhaps it was because the princess was with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you and Toadstool bought some apples and pamphlets of the towns that had been hit with the potions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at a picnic table under a tree, Toadstool was looking at a map and various letters from the towns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Koopas may have been spotted in these towns, some with hair, as in actual hair, not one of King Koopa's wigs.

The hate potion worked quickly. You felt all the love towards the princess get changed into hate. Sure you still felt attracted to her, but you found her really annoying. So  you said in an annoyed tone, \"I mean, not everything about King Koopa should revolve around you and your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool looked up at you in some slight shock, \"I guess it might be someone from another land, but you don't have to be so rude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled, \"Me, rude? I think you're the rude one, passing judgement on anyone who doesn't exercise as much as you do. Being rude and judgmental if anyone's first reaction to evil isn't to fight said evil. And what about letting King Koopa run off every time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool looked quite hurt by your words, even tearing up a bit. \"I do not mean to come off as judgmental. I just get disapointed and angry when people just give up because things get a little bit harder. As for King Koopa, he's an expert at slipping out of capture like a low-down, no-good sneaky, slimy snake. If you apologize now, I'll forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a part of you that wanted to apologize like she said and tell her that you were under a hate potion. Alas, the hate potion was too strong. \"Oh, remember Milli Vanilli?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're my favorite band...\" Toadstool replied, sounding worried about what you were going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mere two weeks... and I doubt it even was that long... after you saved them from Kootie Pie Koopa, Milli Vanilli was revealed to be a bunch of lipsynchers. Sure, both Rob and Fab claimed to be good singers on their own, but they merely just moved their mouths to four different singers behind the scenes because the four singers were deemed too unmarketable,\" You said. You hated how much pleasure you were feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow tears ran down Toadstool's face and she began to sniffle. She uttered, \"Y-yo-you lie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.

The Mario Brothers, Toad, and I were on the run from King Koopa and wound up in a gold coin mine. We dug up and found ourselves in Lonesome Mushroom. Long story short, some things happened, we drove off King Koopa, and the town prospered,\" Toadstool explained. \"Now I've got a request to go check out some claims about UFOs being spotted in the area. I'd like your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Princess,\" You answered. \"I'll just grab my adventuring gear and I'll meet you at the bus stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I'd go and ask the Mario brothers ot help us, but I'm note sure where they are. Last I heard, they were in Pasta Land. So our backup will be Toad,\" Toadstool said before kissing you on the cheek. \"Consider that the down payment for this job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she skipped away, you blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus ride was a bit long and did get hot when it reached the desert. After you got off the bus, Toad said, \"According to the reports, The UFOs show up mostly at night. All witnesses pass out soon after seeing them and wake up a bit drained in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you get us a couple of rooms, Toad?\" Toadstool asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Princess!\" Toad replied before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool looked at you and whispered, \"Does it sound familiar to anything in the games or movies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it before you whispered, \"Two. One of which had only one UFO and they were friendly. The other was an armada of UFOs and they were evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool whispered, 'And which one do you think it might be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second. I'll talk about later when we get a room,\" You whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you headed to an Inn, Toad ran up to the two of you and said,\"Good news and bad news, Princess! The good news, the Mario Brothers are in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the bad?\" Toadstool asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They tried to find out about the UFOs, but... The brothers got caught by them and were beaten up. They're in a room at the Inn and the town doctor told them to rest for the day and even tomorrow,\" Toad answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Sounds like the Shroobs,' </i>You thought.<i> 'Sucking Vim from Toads and beating up everything else.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! We need to go see them at once!\" Toadstool cried out. She grabbed your hand and said, \"Come on, Y/N!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" You replied as you followed the princess and retainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, The Mario brothers had bandages on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What hit you? A space truck?\" Toad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. our memory is spotty about last night,\" Luigi answered. \"Whose the new guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Y/N. I'm from the real world, but not the one you're from, there's works of fiction about you guys,\" You answered. \"But Koopas bricked up the pipe soon after I came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. We find a way to the real world, but it's a different real world and then it gets blocked up,\" Mario grumbled. When his stomach growled, he said, \"I want some Pasta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only is the town's all out from the festival for us the other day, you ate all of the Pasta,\" Luigi said. \"And it was enough to feed the whole town!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm still hungry!\" Mario whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool chuckled, \"Oh, Mario. Now I know you're both okay. Y/N, Toad, and I will be looking for the UFOs this night. Tomorrow, we'll go together to look for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in Toadstool's  room, you told her, \"There's two possibilities that it could be.. If we're lucky, it's Rosalina. Her duty is to watch over and protect the cosmos. She also watches over the Lumas, who look like teddy bear star things. She's on the side of good, so talking things out is what we'll do with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstoll asked, \"And the other possibility?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evil alien purple mushrooms called Shroobs. They'll be invading to steal the mushroom people's lifeforce. They call it Vim. They're ruled by two evil Princesses, Princess Shroob and Elder Princess Shroob. Both are willing to throw away their entire forces to defeat any one target,\" You answered. \"Not only that, but they also like mind-controlling and altering anything that might be a useful slave. We would have to fight and possibly get as many allies as possible or risk the Shroobs draining everyone dry. We might even have to free King Koopa and offer a pardon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool looked horrified  before steeling her will and saying, \"The Mushroom Kingdom will defeat the Shroobs, should they invade. There will be no need to free King Koopa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should note that in the games, they took over and altered the castle of that version of you. True, it was in the past, so they didn't have to deal with the adult Mario Bros... until some timetravelling was involved. Then the Shroobs dealt with four Mario Bros, Two Adults and two toddlers,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, the Mario Brothers lived in the Mushroom Kingdom in the games?\" Toadstool asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different continuity,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night sky was pretty awesome, as it was full of stars.Most were stationary, but a few were shooting stars. Using a telecope revealed that the stars looked like the invincibility Starman. All three of you were hiding under some cover that looked like sand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if we find no UFOs, we still got to enjoy this wonderful night,\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool sent a smile your way and said, \"Agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'If only Toad wasn't here, then it could be considered a date,'</i> You thought.</span></div></div>",

Their music is just wonderful,\" Toadstool said, her smiling face was was hard to look at for once. How could you tell her that a mere two weeks after she met the duo, a concert had their sound system repeat a line over and over again, revealing that they were lip-syncers who hadn't sung a note on their albums? True, they could sing, but their manager wouldn't let them. She asked, \"So, what kind of music do you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I-\" you uttered before you, toadstool, and Toad were suddenly lifted up into the air. \"We're being abducted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the radio is down on the ground!\" Toadd cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and saw that the UFO was white, save for the center being purple with white dots. In a panicked voice, you said, \"Princess! We're dealing with Shroobs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Toadstool replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you, Toad, and Toadstool all passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you were on a medical bed with some medical equipment  in a room barely big enough to hold it all. However, you felt a bit drained, making you mutter, \"I wonder if I have whatever they count as Vim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou checked the door, revealing it was unlocked. So lacking anything that could be used as a weapon, you looked outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd immediately saw a few shroobs aiming their laser guns at you. After a few moments, you said, \"Would you believe I'm the new janitor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took a few steps back and gestured for you to go a certain way. Any time you stopped towards an intersection, they gestured which direction for you to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you were led to a door and forced to enter it. Inside was a grand throneroom.

They\u2019ll meet us at Land\u2019s End, so let\u2019s take a warp pipe there,\u201d Toadstool said as you invited her inside your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre the King and Queen of Nimbus Land sick?\u201d you asked, getting a bad feeling about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool nodded.\u201d Yes, they are. I received a message from one of the advisers, though they also said that the chief Adviser is currently ruling in place of the King and Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Is the chief adviser named Valentina?\u201d you asked with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool nodded before asking, \u201cIs that a problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just\u2026 Just that she might be faking their illness and has them locked up, just so she can take over their kingdom. Do the King and Queen have a lost son named Mallow?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool looked surprised before answering, \u201cWhy yes, they do! And what makes you think Valentina is faking their illness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA feeling and one of those video games I told you about had a plot just like that,\u201d You answered. \u201cBut I do hope I\u2019m wrong about their sickness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do too because Valentina now has a lot of political power and a wrongful accusation would lead to a lot of trouble,\" Toadstool replied. After a moment, she added, \"But so would a royal coup. We have to be careful. If you're right, then we need to stop Valentina at all costs for the sake of Nimbus Land. We just have to hope King Koopa isn't behind it. Was he in that game you mentioned?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, No. in fact, he helped put a stop to Valentina's scheme, as a gang of evil weapons had stolen his castle and he needed help to get his castle back,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sure doesn't sound like King Koopa,\" Toadstool muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King Koopa here and in the games are two different koopas, Princess,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Toadstool, and Toad leapt out of the warp pipe. Soon after, Mario, Luigi, and Mallow leapt out of the pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Princess! This is Mallow, Frogfucius\u2019s grandson. We were asked to bring him along by the froggy guru himself!\u201d Mario said, gesturing to Mallow. \u201cWho is that with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis name is Y/N. He\u2019s a real worlder like you! Why, he even saved the princess the other day,\u201d Toad answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat to know that there are still good guys in the real world. Right, Mario?\u201d Luigi replied with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup!\u201d Mario smiled. \u201cYou into pasta?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded before saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to talk about some stuff later, about the real world. You have the medicine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallow produced a sealed box and a letter. \u201cGrandpa said that the stuff inside this box will cure any sickness! He also gave me a letter to read when we meet the King and Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake sure to keep all of that safe, Mallow,\u201d Toadstool ordered. Mallow nodded before putting the box and the letter away. The princess gestured to a large bean stalk that stretched to the sky and said, \u201cNow let\u2019s get climbing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYippie\u2026\u201d you sarcastically muttered as everyone began to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long climb, one that made you glad to see Nimbus Land and its benches. The others also seemed quite tired, but not as much as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s sit down,\u201d you uttered as you sat on a bench. The others followed suit. Toadstool looked the least tired, but even she enjoyed sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a large crowd of Nimbus citizens, all of whom looked like Mallow. They all stared at the castle, where two people soon appeared. One was a giant overweight dodo and the other looked like a caricature of a human. Her body had a thin waist, big boobs, and large hips, which made her look kinda like a martini glass. Her head was rectangular, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around and spotted you. Had you been closer, you would have spotted the hearts in her eyes and would have probably run away in fright.</span></div></div>",

I see that his time away from Nimbus Land has made him lose his memory and addled his mind! Better for him to be quiet than for him to unknowingly speak lies!\u201d Valentina ordered as you vanished from the crowd\u2019s sight. Before she walked inside, she dismissively said, \u201cOh, and get the medicine, guards. As for my future subjects, you may go about your day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bird guard flew to the Mario Brothers, Princess Toadstool, Toad, and Mallow and asked, \u201cAs Valentina requested, the medicine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallow produced the sealed box, which the bird guard snatched away and flew into the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it, Mario. The Mallow with us looks like he\u2019s more likely to be Nimbus Land\u2019s prince than Y/N,\u201d Luigi muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool\u2019s hands curled into fists as she recalled your words about Valentina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s adopted and was kidnapped to the real world when he was younger? Or maybe under a magic spell?\u201d Mario suggested. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys\u2026\u201d Toad uttered, shaking the arms of the Mario brothers as he stared at the princess as she grew more angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, if the prince was adopted, then it\u2019s another thing we have in common!\u201d Mallow said with a smile. But then he frowned, \u201cBut Grandpa said I was supposed to meet with the King and Queen and read the letter with me. It\u2019s not like him to be wrong about something\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys\u2026 Y/N said that there is a good chance that Valentina is lying about the sickness, just to gain power. I know my advisers and how they act,\u201d  Toadstool said as she gestured to Toad. \u201cNot only does she act more like King Koopa than an adviser, but the guards here are supposed to be Nimbus Land people, not bird mercenaries. Something\u2019s up and Y/N tried to warn me about it. We need to get info and fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario, Luigi, Toad, and Mallow nodded.<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were thrown against a wall and Valentina\u2019s lips crashed against yours. Sure, her body felt soft in all the right places and can easily get you aroused. Sure her face kinda reminded you of an oval-ish  stereo, but you could get used to that in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her awful personality.  Greedy, bossy, temperamental, disrespectful, and domineering. You suspected the moment she lost interest in you, she\u2019d claim you lied, were an impostor, and have you either thrown into the dungeon or off the cloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did try to struggle, but she was stronger than you. You hoped it was because of magic and not because of natural strength. After a few minutes of the forced makeout session, Valentina took a step back, but shoved your head in her expansive bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a lusty leer, she cooed, \u201cWell, \u2018prince\u2019. I hope you enjoyed my affections.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she let go of your head, she grabbed one of your shoulders, preventing any escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grabbed your crotch with her free hand and said, \u201cGoing by what was poking me, this part of you certainly does!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not Prince Mallow!\u201d You spat out in a panicked manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know. You\u2019re going to play that part because you\u2019re far more attractive than Dodo. For I am a refined art buff and beautiful beyond compare.\u201d Valentina replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go. Please,\u201d You pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValentina\u2019s lusty expression turned to an evil sneer. \u201cIf you don\u2019t play along, I will punish someone. Maybe you? Maybe the King and Queen? Maybe those friends of yours? Who knows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your friends somehow talk to you, claim that you're Prince Mallow,\" Valentina whispered as she leaned in.closer to you.

That had the same brainwashing effect as looking at them did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re attractive and rare. I think you\u2019re called a human. In any case, rare means valuable. Valuable means I get more attention for having you and money for selling you if I don\u2019t want you anymore. Now submit to my boobs, \u2018Prince Mallow\u2019!\u201d Valentina cackled before going back to her chant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou prayed, <i>\u2018Someone help! I don\u2019t want to become Valentina\u2019s prince!\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking around, the Mario group managed to find Garro, a master sculptor.  When the group entered, Garro saw the similarities between Mallow and a statue of a young King Nimbus. He agreed to help them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018I hope this works,\u2019 </i>Garro thought as he dragged a wagon. On the wagon was Mario, disguised as a golden statue of himself. The others were hiding under a window near the Nimbus Royal castle\u2019s Parlor room. The plan was that after Garro convinces Valentina to accept another statue for her collection, Mario uses a hidden rope on his person at one of the windows in the parlor to bring the others in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Valentina's boobnosis's effects on you...</span></div></div>",

So you went back to struggling to free yourself. You knew that Mario and the others were sneaking in. Not exactly how, as this was an adaption of Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars. You suspected that Mario would be in a statue disguise, but not much else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you remained here, then you\u2019d either be her hostage or might even be hypnotized into her boytoy/servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll your struggling did was cause you to fall backwards. You sighed, but were glad you weren\u2019t hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Valentina came back, she looked displeased and angrily said, \u201cI thought I told you to stay there, \u2018prince\u2019! Not only that, but you\u2019re free of my hypnosis! I guess I need to punish you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoying the look of fear in your eyes, she stomped towards you, her big boobs bouncing the whole way.

Just as long as I can make you do what I want, when I want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then brought the chair back up and sat back on your lap once more, continuing her boobnosis. Unlike before, she said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, she went to her dresser and pulled out a bra and panties. She put the panties on your face, making sure that the crotch part was over your mouth.

Oh, Rosalina...\" Peach uttered before she just broke down crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down and explained, \"I think I know what happened with her... Bowser, Their version of King Koopa, created a Galaxy Reactor to recreate the universe and rule over it with Princess Peach, via a black hole at the center of the universe. However, I think he just wound up destroying their universe and the resulting implosion sent Peach here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool gasped, \"How...

Toadstool was a bit angry at Peach, but Peach proved your suspicions correct. She was a very skilled fighter and was able to prevent Toadstool from doing too much damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the session, The three of you went off and changed into some clean clothes. You and Toadstool went to get you registered in the Mushroom Kingdom, as Peach had done it when she was in the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she walked around. As she did so, Peach felt like a stranger in a familiar land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she knew where a lot of people, places, and items were, but it all felt off. There were changes that kept throwing her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome who were child-like were more like adults. Places seemed more simple or were more 'wacky' than in her kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on a bench in a park, Peach sighed as she thought,<i> 'My dimensional counterpart is nice and I always did want a sister, but I miss my world. From what she told me, Will is from a place called 'the real world'. Worlds of fiction aren't new to me. I still remember meeting Paper Peach and certain tournaments did alter us to be toys in alternate realities.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach smiled as she saw you walk about the park. 'If I recall correctly, the warp pipe to his world is blocked off. He might understand a little about what I'm feeling. He's also easy on the eyes. I just hope he picked up on my hints during the spar..'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoo-hoo!\" Peach called out when you were within earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Peach! I just finished some papers, now I can be considered a citizen of the Mushroom Kingdom,\" You said as you sat down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice. Are... Are you free to do something with me?\" Peach asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have nothing planned, but I guess it depends on what you have in mind,\" You answered.</span></div></div>",

The Troopa group had brought you to some castle, and quickly tied you to some large chair in some large room with large doors, you were left alone for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your patience wore out, you grumbled, \u201cHow do the princesses deal with the boredom of being captured?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor one, they usually are kept in either a cage or shackled near dear old dad,\u201d Kootie Pie\u2019s voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear a similar voice add, \u201cBut we were nice enough to give you a chair because you\u2019re so cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the large doors opened, revealing Kootie Pie Koopa and Wendy O.

Wendy\u2019s was bigger, which made you wonder which one lorded their looks over the other more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCute?\u201d you asked. Then in quiet horror, you uttered, \u201cOh no\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we\u2019re gonna entertain you, while those pesky plumbers and the puke-worthy mushroom princesses try to \u2018save\u2019 you,\u201d Kootie Pie said as both Koopalings sashayed in, making sure to emphasized their hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that won\u2019t happen, as you\u2019ll fall in love with us,\u201d Wendy cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen both Koopa ladies said with evil sneers, \u201cWhether you like it or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLove is a two-way street!

After a few seconds, \"I guess him being small would make it easier to protect him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can defend myself if I was my normal size!\" you declared, trying to escape Peach's hand. You were only able to get your upper body out of her fist, but she tightened her grip at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King Koopa may be dumber than rotten ravoli, but he's very strong. There's a reason why the Mario Bros have never went into a hand-to-hand combat with him,\" Toadstool answered when looking at you. She then turned her attention back to Peach. \"As for you... You need consent in situations like this when there's not an emergency!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was mad because he kept calling me Princess Peach!\" I wanted to be called Peach by him! Like how you get called Toadstool!\" Peach answered, sounding upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool sighed before she said,\" Then I guess it is Y/N's fault. You should be nicer to girls. If they don't want to be called by their titles, then don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were flabbergasted. \"She shrunk me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't call her by her name.

Peach's pink puckered lips painted you with pink-lipstick, while Toadstool's red ravishing lips covered you with red kissmarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they stopped, only your eyes were kissmarked-free. You did enjoy the attention, even if you did fear you mgiht be drowned in kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peach's punishment will be that she will look after your home until you're back to normal,\" Toadstool decreed.</span></div></div>",

I have no real say about who dates him unless he makes me his girlfriend,' Toadstool thought several times in a row. She knew it was logical, but her heart kept saying she had a big say over who dated you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was no big surprise that Toadstool's jaw dropped when she saw Peach over you and wriggling about as the blonde princess appeared to make out with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she only saw Peach's back, not Peach's face. If Toadstool did, she'd have seen Peach's panicked face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with a growing annoyance, Toadstool pulled Peach off of you and uttered with a touch of anger, \"Peach, you really should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool was perplexed. Peach's mouth was smiling and had much larger lips than before, but her eyes were pleading for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peach?\" Toadstool asked before Peach's lips covered her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool struggled, but Peach hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore tears fell from Peach's eyes as she thought,<i> 'Now my lips can control both my arms! Y/N, please do something!'</i></span></div></div>",

The only thing that Peach had control of was the fact she was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of princess-on-princess kissing, Peach's arms let go and took a few steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was fun,\" Peach's voice said. After a moment, Peach thought,<i> 'I know I did not say that.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach's hand covered her mouth as she chuckled. After that, Peach's mouth said, \"I did. I am a combination of the Lippy Powerup and your own lips, but you were so powerful and beautiful, I couldn't help but take over your body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach then looked back at you. You were slowly sitting up, feeling quite drained. Peach's body began to sashay towards you, while Toadstool was being dragged towards you by her glowing lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I needed energy and for you to get a bit addicted to your lips absorbing energy from people, people like Y/N,\" Peach's lips cooed. \"I enjoyed the energy that you, Peach, produced when kissing him. I guess you must love him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Leave Y/N alone!' </i>Peach and Toadstool both thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach's lips giggled once again before she sat down besides you. A struggling Toadstool sat down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be like that, girls. We can all share him,\" Peach's lips said as she caressed your face. \"Y/N, you don't mind having more than one girlfriend? Peach, Toadstool, and a female hivemind that controls women through their lips?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered her words. Both princesses made panicked noises. Neither one liked being taken prisoner by Bower or King Koopa. They especially didn't liked being held prisoner by their lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the Koopa kings allowed them some measure of freedom that allowed them to escape and defeat the evil kings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach's lips noticed that Toadstool was nearly able to take back control of her body. So Peach's lips put two fingers at her own lips and made the motions like she was blowing Toadstool a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic sparkles came from Peach's lips formed into a floating lipstick container. Peach's lips smiled as she grabbed the lipstick and somehow quickly and expertly applied it to Toadstool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool's body stopped struggling, but her eyes were still panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Peach and Toadstool looked at you and asked in Stereo, \"Will you accept us as your girlfriends? I'd be happy to put more bodies under my control to be your girlfriends.\"</span></div></div>",

Whoever did have it before you... must have claimed it was from me,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool let out a huff of anger. \"Here I thought you wanted to be my boyfriend...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. I just never gave you the crown as I never found it,\" You quickly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool's anger eroded into happiness.

As orbs of purple appeared in the palms of her hands, long white gloves appeared on her arms. Her dark pink dress became purple as she threw the orbs at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orbs flew through the cage and hit you. A metal collar appeared around your neck and shackles around your wrists. As the cage door opened, Toadstool cooed, \"There. Now You're free of the cage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not your love,eh?\" You replied in a flirty tone. In reality, you were scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool nodded as she walked over to you and hugged you. With a bit of reluctance, you hugged her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you let each other go, Toadstool said, \"Now I will show you your new room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she led you down a hallway, you asked, \"So... what are you going to do with the Mushroom Kingdom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool looked back and answered, \"Why, let them know I now rule the Koopa Kingdom. At least the parts that now obey me. Some parts of the Koopa Kingdom are resisting my rule, claiming they are ruled by King Koopa's seven Koopalings... Whoever they might be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do if they all resist you?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool merely chuckled, making you fearful. She passed by a fancy door and said, \"This is my room. Enter it whenever you want, my boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led you to the door next to it and said, \"This is your room, Y/N.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a bed, a dresser, a desk, an empty bookshelf, and a long mirror. There also was two doors. One that might be a closet, while the other led to Toadstool's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror, you briefly saw the Shadow Queen's image over Toadstool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing your frown, she asked in a concerned tone, \"Is there a problem, Y/N?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

You overheard Zelda whispergrumble, <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"I never got lessons from Impa.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still would, but I would appear from time to time to offer a lesson or advice,\" Impa suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that would be nice. I accept, but only if Zelda gets similar training,\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it is agreed, You are my secret student, while Zelda is now my main student,\" Impa replied. \"First lesson for the two of you. How to shoot beams from a magic sword.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lesson was to will magic into the sword and let it fire from the tip. During the lesson, you asked, \"Can we use the chargeup energy to perform a spin attack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa pondered your words and said, \"Possibly. See if you can do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, you did it on your first try, though you were a bit dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa smiled, \"Good. You have a crown control move, one that strikes both the ground beneath you and the air above you. You may get some more bombs and some rupees when you leave the castle later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the sweating-but-pleased Zelda, Impa added, \"And if she learns quick and well, then she might join you on your quest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=o=<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you left to go on your quest, you asked Spryte, \"So any dungeons or cursed areas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diving headfirst into danger? You really do have the makings of a hero,\" Spryte giggled. \"Well, there's the forest dungeon, right near some old trees that look like they could be used as child-sized houses. We call it the Moon dungeon because the layout looks like a crescent moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecalling that the Impa you met was like the Ocarina of time Impa, you thought, <i>'I bet it is the Kokori, cursed to be monsters or something.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte continued, \"Then there's the Snake dungeon, located right within a lake, where the old Zora used to live. You'll either need good swimming skills or raft. Monsters come from it and make getting good drinking water a hard task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought,<i> 'The Zora under a curse, probably.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte's third suggestion was, \"Then there's the Demon Dungeon, located under a lake. I can use magic to remove the water, but only for a little bit, so you'll need to get inside the dungeon. Don't worry, it's dry inside. Shadowy, but dry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought, <i>'Dunno who might be there. Maybe Midna and the Twili, under a curse?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte shivered before she said, \"And then there's the Dragon dungeon, located in the old Graveyard, creating minions for both Twinrova and Veran.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered, '<i>Maybe I can free the Poe Sisters and get them as allies?'</i></span></div></div>",

Anyway Link and I had a bit of a row,you know a fight and he actually went back to his home in Calatia(Spryte sighed sadly as she had a major crush on the hero) so now I had the honor of fending off Ganon's hordes of monsters on my own....well with the aid of the Triforce of course.\" As she pointed to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you need any help princess? I'll be glad to assist anyway I can.\" You suggested at once as despite her somewhat bossy tone you did find her very attractive,especially in those hot purple pants! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's very generous of you Will, but you seem to possess no weapons,are no knight,very sorry to ask this but what exactly can you do to help us?\" Zelda asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I may lack 'heroic' training' but I'm pretty good at karate.\" You say without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Spryte asked looking just as confused as Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sort of fighting style but with your hands instead of a sword or shield.\" You quickly said \"Besides that I do know quite a few things about Hyrule and it's true history and even bits of Ganon himself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once both the cartoon princess and fairy's eyes widened in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know about Ganon's past?\" Zelda asked skeptically raising her tone a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a bit.\" You replied \"Like did you know his true name is Ganondorf,King of Thieves and that he's been around for hundreds of years?

That a wizard spoke poison into the son's ear and that the son had a speeling spell put on the princess and regretted it immediately. No one could undo the spell, as it rerquired all three pieces. It's how my name is Zelda, as all princesses were named Zelda in honor of her. Do you know where it is?\" Zelda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of. It's sealed in a place called 'the Great Palace' which is protected by a forcefield that's powered by six other palaces, which are currently monster-infested. Only a warrior with the mark of the Triforce on the back of his hand can get the Triforce of Courage,\" You answered, making Spryte let out a little gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Courage... Sounds like it might belong to Link...,\" Zelda mused. \"but that 's ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link is the closest one to being that warrior, but it requires Ganon to die,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typicial. To defeat Ganon once and for all, we need all three pieces. To get all three pieces, we need to kill Ganon,\" Zelda grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To defeat Ganon once and for all, you'd need the Master Sword, blessed by Hylia, Din, Nayru, and Farore to be Evil's Bane.. Link also is one of the few who could get the Sword,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Sword? That sounds a little familiar,\" Zelda muttered. She looked at the fairy and asked, \"Does it ring any bells, Spryte?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... not allowed to talk about it to anyone that doesn't know,\" Spryte said, sounding like saying that was hard to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spryte, this is important. Any information can help us bring peace to Hyrule,\" Zelda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Spryte struggled, you said, \"Princess, Spryte's a fairy. Even though I'm from a magic-less world, I know there's magic laws about what they can and can't do. It may be a case where she wants to help, but she's limited by what the goddesses allow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda frowned a Little, but said, \"I'm sorry, Spryte. I guess I got a little excited. Will. What else do you know about the Master Sword?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That it usually is either in a temple or deep within a forest. It contains an entity named Fi. When Hyrule is in a big enough danger, the hero of Hyrule will be drawn to three trials. One of courage, one of power, and one of Wisdom. Whenever a Link defeats Ganon, it strips Ganon a little bit more of his power and the curse of Demise,\" You answered. \"I wouldn't be surprised if this was either Ganon's last life or close to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte let out a relieved sigh, \"Thanks, Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any way to activate these Trials early?\" Zelda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By seeking the Hylian reincarnations of Din, Farore, and Nayru. Farore is drawn to books and secrets. Nayru has interest in singing and harps. Din likes to dance and probably is part of a Traveling Circus,\" You answered, recalling the Oracle games. \"They may not remember. In fact, they might choose not to remember. No one can say they know the mind of a goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of Hylia? What about that goddess?\" Zelda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she could start the trials early, but...\" You began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte looked horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\" Zelda asked, getting annoyed. She even put her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Huh. So that's why Link likes to annoy her. She looks a bit cute when she gets mad,'</i> You thought. \"Hylia tends to be reincarnated as... Princess Zelda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I am Hylia's reincarnation?\" Zelda asked with a great amount of surprise. Then a thought hit her, making her utter, \"Or is it the sleeping princess in the Northern Palace? Is there any way to wake her up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You both might be. Goddess magic tend to be beyond mortal thought,\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got that right,\" Spryte said, flying over to you and sitting on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I need time to think about your words, Will,\" Zelda said, sounding a bit panicked. \"Spryte, show him around the castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, Zelda!\" Spryte said with a playful salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you and Spryte left Zelda's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now, Spryte?\" You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad I have someone to talk to about all the lost and secret things of Hyrule. You have no idea what it's like to not only keep a secret, but be forced to keep it by magic! So here's a bit of thanks for taking some weight of my shoulders!\" Spryte said before kissing you on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-hanks,\" you mutter as you blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, Spryte may be a small fairy, but she still is a cute girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte giggled at your blush.

Then you said, \"Fairy Spell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the world around you began to appear as if it all were slowly growing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" you uttered, utterly enchanted by what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were three-fourths of your normal size, you noticed your clothes weren't shrinking with you.

I guess your clothes don't accept magic energy,\" Spryte said as she enjoyed you trying to keep your pants up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you were about Spryte's height. You currently were holding up your shirt collar, trying to stay clothed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Let me find something,\" Spryte said before she spotted a handkerchief on a table. She grabbed it, flew down to you, and said, \"Here. You can use it to make a toga or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou accepted the handkerchief and waited for Spryte to turn around. when she didn't, you said, \"Aren't you going to give me some privacy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?

This thing sort of happens when someone is holding a powerful magical artifact that interferes with all sorts of spells. The fact you didn't have any magic items is a bit concerning. Maybe the fact you're from the real world is the cause?\" Spryte asked back as she flew around you. She had a serious look on her face as she studied you. She landed behind you and felt up you back. \"Huh... You're not a late wing bloomer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Can we get to you showing me the castle?\" you asked. While you liked the feeling of being felt up by a cute girl, you knew if you didn't stop her, she'd probably start making out with you. She was a very horny fairy in the show and probably was horny here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Right! Zelda asked me to do that. Hope you don't mind being cuddled as we fly!\" Spryte answered, taking a step away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could ask, Spryte pressed herself up against you. She wrapped her legs around you and her arms around your body, squeezing her boobs against your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!\" Spryte purred before flying up in the air, holding you a bit tighter then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't say anything. The experience was exciting and scary. If Spryte let go for any reason, you'd fall to your death. You didn't want to risk it.

I guess either Hyrulians bend the law or the King sends the lawbreakers to other places to protect his daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen and the larder was filled with food. Spryte held you over a bin of apples as she said, \"This is the castle's larder. Mostly healthy food because Zelda listens to someone named Princess Lana during inter-video-game-world meetings. The King complains, but follows Zelda's orders. I swear, she's the ruler in all but name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armory was filled with weapons, armor, potions, all sorts of magic items, and oddly enough farming equipment.

Link never visits here, as anything he finds in the dungeons surpasses Castle Hyrule's stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Spryte flew you into the library, she had no idea Zelda was there, poring over various history books and spell books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda heard Spryte say, \"This is the library. Old, dusty, and musty. Link almost never visits here, but it's pretty much Zelda's second bedroom. So he mostly shows up to see if Zelda's taking a nap between books.

She then cooed, \"You shrank him with the fairy spell to show him around, but due to the lack of fairy wings on him, I take it that the spell didn't work right on him, making the usual 'wait until the spell wears off' risky as he might never grow back to normal. So you came here to look for a possible cure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte glared at Zelda for a few moments before asking, \"That's not what happened at all. What? Is Link not enough for you? Are you trying to be something worse than your usual snotty self?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you need a time out, Spryte. Besides, Will's cure can wait,\" Zelda said as she carefully pulled you out of her fist. She placed you on a table, took out her fairy bottle, and placed Spryte in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda smiled and chuckled as Spryte pounded the side of the fairy bottle. After placing the bottle in her item pouch, Zelda looked towards you with her smile turning lusty.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n'This is a weird twist on the Spryte-Link-Zelda love triangle. Spryte helps me and seems to have a crush, but Zelda lusts after me enough to pull dirty tricks,' </i>you thought. \"Zelda... Are you feeling alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never better,\" Zelda replied. Hearts practically appeared in her eyes. You took a step back, making Zelda gasp, \"Will... Are you trying to run away from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head before you said, \"N-no! I was just trying to play a game with you. Y'know, a game of tag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda giggled before she quickly grabbed you and asked, \"You're a silly one. Don't you know that you're not allowed to engage in horseplay in libraries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess not, Princess Zelda...\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Zelda. After all, we're going to be friends from now on,\" Zelda said as she held you up. She giggled, \"Maybe more than friends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you me-\" You began before Zelda hugged you. Due to her much larger size, it was more like 'pressing you against her bosom' than an actual hug. You weren't sure to be thankful or not that her purple shirt and what felt like a bra separated you from her royal breasts.</span></div></div>",

After all, they were technically the boobs of a goddess, especially if this Zelda was an reincarnation of the Goddess Hylia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda mostly looked down at you and enjoyed how you were lost in the pleasure of her breasts.

There are Octoroks,Stalfos(skeleton warriors),the mummy men Gibdos,Zoras(boy they look completely different from the Ocarina of Time ones),Darknuts and Moblins with the bulldog faces.....\" You cried out amazed if only you had your camera but the princess looking bewildered pulled you back in from the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will,what are you doing? Get back in here! They might see you! Oh No! Ganon's attacking sooner than expected! W-we have to do something!\" She cried out looking at the magical triangle and pulled it from its stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All Soldiers Not On Duty,Prepare To Defend The Castle!!\" Cried a voice from below the princess' chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to cut our talk short Princess Zelda.\" You said shrugging<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh and we could have done with a tad bit more information!\" She moaned \"Ah well it's time to fight....umm you are familiar with wielding a sword aren't you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,not really.\" You said looking at your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh then have you ever used a shield before?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A spear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dagger?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really unless you mean a knife!\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm this is more difficult than I thought,you certain need to defend yourself and there's literally no time to train you but...oh I'll make time...here take this.\" And the princess reached into her pouch at her side pulling out a tiny crossbow which grew to regular size as she handed it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I supposed to do with this?\" You began puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick aim it,fire it at the monsters!\" She instructed as she produced fiery magic from the Triforce of Wisdom to strike at the hordes of monsters as most of the castle's guards were already engaged in battle with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu..but how?\" You asked as she didn't hand you any arrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bow's magic Will,aim it at any monster and it'll zap it....Ohhh!\" She screamed as she was grabbed around the waist by a few Moblins crawling into the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab the princess,Get the Triforce!\" One of them cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owwwww,Owwwww Let Go Of Me Brutes!!\" She screamed and tried to break free but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried aiming the crossbow at the monsters but nothing happened so you did the only thing you could think of as the princess was crying out for help:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi-Ya!\" You took a running leap kicking the Moblin nearest you and judo chopped the next one holding the cartoon princess both it and she looked at you in shock as you karate kicked the last Moblin out of the window as Zelda used her fiery magic to zap the two downed monsters back into the Evil Jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-how did you do that?\" She asked quite amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you before I take karate classes! It's a sort of fighting style only without weapons like swords and stuff.\" You explained as she looked even more interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very fascinating! D-do you think when this is over you can teach me a few of these k...whatever it is moves as well? It'll help out a great deal for the next time Ganon attacks!\" Zelda asked breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly princess,I'd be glad to but don't you reckon we ought to go help out down there?\" You asked pointing downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Such a polite gentleman,he's so much better than Link!</b>\" Zelda couldn't help but think to herself. \"Oh,my yes we certainly should!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fight was very tiring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw yourself into the fight, throwing every dirty shot you could at Ganon's forces, providing enough of a distraction that Zelda and a few archers could fire without worrying if the darknuts would block the arrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, you got hit quite a few times, but health potions were splashed on you via Spryte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat in a chair and groaned, \"That was something else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again. I'd have given a Kiss to Link, if he had been around help us ward off Ganon's forces,\" Zelda uttered as she sat down near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat down on a table, Spryte giggled. at Zelda's words about Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... when do you want some training in Karate?\" You asked. \"Hopefully, not too soon. I'd like to rest up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes. Those moves you did. They reminded me of a friend named Sing. They do seem quite useful, so I would like to learn them. I think we have some stamina potions, if you don't mind them having a bitter taste,\" Zelda answered. \"And would you like to learn how to use a sword?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which kind of swordplay? The one where it is strictly swinging? Or the kind that involves sword beams?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The regular one. The Sword beams can only be done with special swords, like Link's Crissword. We do have his White Blade sword and his training sword that can also do the sword beams,\" Zelda answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... So no Master Sword,\" You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Sword? What's that?\" Zelda asked, while Spryte gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sword made by the Goddess Hylia. A sword called 'The blade of Evil's Bane'. A sword that has been used against Ganon time and time again, each time reducing his strength. Once there had been a time where only the Master Sword and Silver Arrows could kill him or even harm him. Now he's been weakened enough where any magic sword can harm him,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if we found the Master Sword, we could end Ganon once and for all!\" Zelda cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But only a hero who has passed three trials can wield the Master Sword. A test of Power, A test of Wisdom, and a test of Couurage,\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte flew in your face and said, \"And only Link can pass those tests, mister! Don't even think of trying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know about the tests? You know about the Master Sword, Spryte?\" Zelda asked, looking at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte refused to answer, so you did. You said, \"Spryte has her reasons for not telling anyone, Princess Zelda. Believe me, magical beings like fairies do have laws from the Golden Goddesses and Goddess Hylia that they have to follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looked like she just swallowed a lemon. \"Very well, Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and took some potions out from it. She drank one and shuddered. \"Drink up. They're bitter, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou accepted it. As Zelda warned, it was very bitter, but you felt like you could run for miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's...\" You began before sniffing yourself. \"Probably wash up and get a change of clothes. The battle did get us sweaty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah, good point,\" Zelda muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting washed up and a new pair of clothes, you asked Zelda to meet you out to the training field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start off with Karate,\" You said. \"The sword Training can come later. After all, we might decide I'm better off with a lance or a warclub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Karate training went smoothly. Zelda was a quick learner, often only needing a second explanation or you repeating an  example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Zelda's enthusiasm was the only thing making her go through the lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn't insult her because she was a girl, or go 'Exxxcuse me, princess!' whenever she had a complaint or question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she had... incidents where she was 'clumsier' than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would not admit to anyone (except Impa), that she did it to feel up your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were moments where Zelda thought about dating you, but knew she couldn't because she was a princess and you were a commoner. The only way she could date you was if she made you a hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever you corrected Zelda's form, both she and you enjoyed the moments of close contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you enjoyed how Zelda's hot pink riding pants sometimes seemed skintight for a few moments, sometimes revealing her ass cleavage.. Especially when she did highkicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's enough for the first lesson. You're a faster learner. In fact, we've probably skipped several lessons because you learned so fast,\" You said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you, Will!\" Zelda replied, tightly hugging you. You blushed, as you felt her bosom press against your chest She asked, \"Shall we start on your sword training? I'll have one of my servants bring Link's Wooden Sword.\"</span></div></div>",

And second I throughly believe Will has the potential to be a great hero as good as Link,perhaps even better!\" Zelda replied firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph! Not likely! Why not let him stay here and watch after your father?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy doesn't need a babysitter Spryte and besides Will happens to know quite a bit about Hyrule and the Triforce itself he can be just what we need to defeat Ganon...I mean Ganondorf once and for all!\" The princess shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really believe I can do this Princess Zelda?\" You asked ignoring the fairy mocking you behind her back \"I mean armed with only a simple boomerang?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do Will,regardless of what Spryte says!

Oh almost forgot I need the Triforce!\" As Zelda used the small chain and snared it around the mystical green triangle from the pedestal and began escorting you out of the northern tower which was her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you began walking out of the palace Spryte still made room to protest like crazy:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you princess,you're better off waiting for Link! Who knows what Ganon could have up his sleeve!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense Spryte,we'll be perfectly fine now go back and watch after Daddy,we'll be back shortly.\" Zelda called over her shoulder as the two of you walked along the path then she led you through the castle marketplace although you were stared at like crazy by all the common folk none of them questioned your bizarre attire and basically went about their business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay now that we're finally out of the safety of the castle Now's the time for a real adventure!\" Zelda said almost happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh yeah I-I'm looking forward to it! You're not at all like the Princess Zelda in the games are you?\" You asked fidgeting with the boomerang a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Game? Eh no I'm not! But tell me exactly what is she like?\" The cartoon princess asked curiously balancing the Triforce on one finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's very kind,full of wisdom even without the Triforce itself,she doesn't dress the way you do,you know in your purple vest and pants,boots etc...she mostly wears pink or purple dresses and she's also telepathic as well.\" You explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Telepathic?\" The 1989 cartoon girl asked arching a eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know able to send out messages with your thoughts alone,according to the instruction booklet of one Zelda game most of the ancient people of Hyrule can receive hidden messages from the goddesses of old...yo-you can't do that?\" You looked bewildered as she shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me send out messages with my mind? No,I never been able to do that Will! But tell me something you said before something about there being a third part of the Triforce,what was it?\" As she leaned closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm surprised you or Link haven't figured it out yet...or rather he didn't as the third piece pertains to him anyway. It's called the Triforce of Courage,and according to myth only a person of noble,selfless heart can possess its power. As you already know Ganon has the Triforce of Power which grants or should grant him unnatural long life,vast magic abilities and the power to summon a endless amount of monsters,since you are the only one able to use the Triforce of Wisdom it grants you incredible knowledge and also vast magic and lastly in due time Link will discover the mark of the Triforce of Courage somewhere on his body which I believe grants him incredible courage,unlimited stamina and the ability to use any weapon without any type of training involved.\" You carefully explain as the princess' natural green eyes grow wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness! Y-you do know a lot about Hyrule's history as well as the Triforce don't you?\" She exclaimed breathless stopping dead in her tracks to stare at you with her jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know as much as anyone else here princess,I just know these things from the numerous games I play.\" You shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then do you think it would be possible that I can see how these 'games' are played so I can get a better understanding of how the actual history of Hyrule is told?\" She asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure that's entirely possible as the technology is not advanced enough here in....\" You were at a loss to what to say next as you already told her a little too much! Maybe Spryte was right,maybe you weren't qualified for this 'hero' stuff but the cartoon princess seemed to be completely awestruck with you in more ways than one as she kept looking at you with a certain romantic yet friendly manner and though you hated to admit it you found yourself getting equally attracted to her physical beauty and incredibly hot as hell body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er yeah sure,if...if I ever manage to get back to my world.\" You looked down at your feet as she beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,thank you Will! I'm certain you will get back to your world and even if you don't you're more than welcome to stay here in Hyrule.\" She said putting a hand on your shoulder but you were looking ahead at the crowd of monsters coming right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh here comes the welcome wagon princess!\" You pointed at the rows of Moblins,Octoroks and Goryia(the devil/rat monsters with boomerangs) charging at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh,G-Ganon must already be aware of our presence Will! Time for a fight.\" As she pulled out her trusty crossbow but much to her surprise she was grabbed by of all things a disembodied hand coming out of the stone wall next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GASP! Ohh,A W-Wall Master!! Let go of me! You creepy hand! Will-Help! I-I can't aim properly with this thing grabbing me!\" She screamed as she struggled to get free quickly you tried throwing the boomerang but one of the Moblins threw his spear knocking it out of your hand and it disappeared in a blind flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh No!!\" You moaned utterly defenseless and surrounded by monsters you did the only thing you could think of and grabbed her crossbow and started shooting magical beams at the monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will! You....you're doing it!\" Zelda cried amazed as she still struggled to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're being a true hero....don't let up,keep at it!\" She cheered you on as you zapped monster after monster until none was left then you fired at the Wall Master which also exploded with the defeated enemy sound effect from the 1st game and as she was being held a few feet in the air Princess Zelda came tumbling right onto you only to.....</span></div></div>",

I mean, Ganon sent out his men, so soon after the attack on the castle. Ganon's probably defenseless until the Evil jar heals his forces. So for Ganon to do that, Will must know something that Ganon fears! Besides, he's cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spryte, let go of Will like that! You're a princess too!!\" Zelda ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd have a better arguing position if you stood up, but you'd lose the position on Will's face,\" Spryte giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda grunted as she stood up, making sure to grab Spryte. Zelda asked, \"Will, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a blush and memories of how soft Zelda's behind was and how Spryte used your dick like a stripper pole, you answered, \"I'm... I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G... good, Let's go get the Triforce of Power,\" Zelda said as she picked up the crossbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded as you saw several boomerangs and grabbed as many as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were done, the three of you headed into a dungeon entrance, one that Ganon's forces came out of.</span></div></div>",

The object replied, \"There is a spell, but the effect is temporary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Let's use it,\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Triforce glowed for a moment before the glow hit you, Zelda, and Spryte before fading altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you saw several tiles that seemed to have an evil glow. You muttered, \"So... If those are trap tiles, then the trap sight spell works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...

Even if Link is away, I am thwarted!

Was it someone I killed? A bounty hunter I hired?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda stepped out from her hiding space and aimed her crossbow at Ganon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just where did I hear that name before?\" Ganon muttered to himself. he then growled, \"Boy! Tell me where you heard that name before or I will rip the information from your-AH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanon spun around, revealing he had a silver in his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the end for you, Ganon,\" Zelda said, firing another Arrow and making Ganon cry out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't get away with this, Princess Zel-ha!\" Ganon cried out before firing a third Arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! Stop that!\" Ganon bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey, Ganon!\" You cried out, getting the dark king's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he saw you had the Triforce of power in your hands, He growled, \"Put that down and I promise a quick death, boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, but I will answer who Ganondorf Dragmire is... he's your former self, the King of the Gerudos,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanon's eyes widened as memories flooded his mind... right before Zelda his his head with a Silver Arrow, destroying him and leaving only his robs and helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's... gone?\" Spryte asked,a bit scared to hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look like it. Triforce of power. Is Ganon still alive?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but a revival ceremony can still bring him back,\" The Triforce of power answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And will pretty much all his forces still in the Jar of Evil, he's gone,\" Zelda said with a smile. \"Let's go home, Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe return trip was uneventful... but when Zelda went to the balcony for speeches she announced, \"Ganon is Dead! Not only that, but we have the Triforce of Power!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured for you to come next to her as the crowd cheered. Once you were next to her, she said, \"And it is all thanks to this person, Will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cheers became deafening, a few people in the crowd took special attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, a party was thrown, one that spanned the whole town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit shy because you still were new in Hyrule, so you kept your distance from large crowds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you decided to walk around the castle.When you passed by an empty bedroom, you were pulled in.

A warp pipe would have let him keep his memories, but a warp allowed him to return to the very moment he left the real world,\" The Triforce of Wisdom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How painful?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A headache strong enough to require rest for the remainder of the day,\" The Triforce of Wisdom answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might've been your imagination, but the Triforce of Wisdom sounded... worried?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can back out of this, Will,\" Zelda said, sounding concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered your choices.</span></div></div>",

You reached around and fumbled around with  her bra for a few moments before Zelda sighed and undid it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her breasts were free, you squeezed, fondled, licked, and suckled her breasts, as if you were trying to milk them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs\u2026 is that all you\u2019re going to do?\u201d Zelda moaned as she reached down and began to feel up your back. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind if you did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta make it pleasing to the both of us,\u201d You said as you crawled up and were now face-to-face with the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda kissed you, right on the lips. She hugged you and  continued to kiss for a few more moments before she said, \u201cNow it\u2019s my turn to make you feel good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then rolled the two of you around so she was on top. Zelda looked down with a smirk before she asked, \u201cSo where shall I place my royal rump? Shall I see if I can make you cum with my ass? Or shall I let you feel my divine derriere on your face like before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could answer, Spryte flew in and said, \u201cOh, there you two are\u2026 Can I join in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis was supposed to my time with Will,\u201d Zelda growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can spice things up\u2026\u201d Spryte cooed as she flew about the bed, dropping fairy dust from her wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat felt like an electric charge ran through you and Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou take the face and I\u2019ll take the dick, just like before,\u201d Spryte cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 I think I will....\u201d Zelda cooed as she turned around and straddled an inch or two above your stomach. She looked back and gave you a lustful gaze before she shook her butt as she inched backwards towards your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Sprite, she flew to the Triforces of Power and Wisdom. She said. \u201cMake me bigger, about the size of Will!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glow came from the two Triforces and hit Spryte, She grew and grew, until she was as tall as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! The world looks so different at this size!\u201d Spryte said as she walked back to the bed. She climbed onto the bed and straddled your hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sprite?\u201d You asked as Zelda\u2019s delightful behind was closing in on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d Spryte asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t I decide who I lose my virginity to?\" You asked as you put your hands on Zelda\u2019s ass to stop her from sitting on your face..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTch, fine,\u201d Spryte muttered. \u201cBut whoever doesn\u2019t get your first time will sit on your face.\u201d</span></div></div>",

A simple domino mask was pointless. A doll mask didn't seem right, as it made any dress she wore with it looked creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing a knight costume seemed odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing a white mask, white scarf,, chainmail, black leggings, a white tabard, hand armor, arm armor, leg armor and various bandages seemed to call out out to her, and suggest she call herself 'Sheik'. She thought<i>. 'Maybe some other time.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she decided on getting a mask and designing a costume around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she found a salesman who sold only masks that drew her attention. The salesman said, \"Welcome, Princess Zelda. How may this humble mask salesman help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to purchase a mask for the party tonight,\" Zelda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then my wares are all available,\" The mask salesman said. eagarly awaiting a large sum of money from the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looked around. A number of masks seemed to remind her of various people and monsters that Will told her of Hyrule's past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to both Zelda and the mask salesman, the masks he sold were secretly magic ones that transformed the wearer into whatever the mask looked like. However, the only ones that would trigger that effect were ones who had a great deal of magic, like Link and Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only ways was to free the wearer from the effects was to either use the Orcarina of time (which was lost to the ages or kept by the fairies), use a instrument enchanted with magic, or try to remove the mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last one was not desirable, as it brought a great deal of pain to the wearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne mask had red hair, tan skin, and white-lipstick-covered lips on them. Zelda believed that this mask looked like what Will said what a Gerudo looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother mask resembled something of a hybrid of a hyrulian and a blue fish. It looked more attractive than it sounded. Zelda thought, <i>'This must be what the old Zora looked like, before Ganon corrupted them.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother was a simple wooden mask. While Zelda thought this was a redead mask, it was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a onclick=\"$('#dropNote1').toggle (200);\" style=\"cursor:pointer;color:#0000ff;\" title=\"\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">It was a mask that would expand itself over the wearer's face and turn it green.

Eventually, the power bracelet glowed pink for a few moments, so the wizzrobe stopped and waited. When the Power bracelet\u2019s gem changed into a heart, the wizzrobe handed the power bracelet to a moblin,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat we do with this?\u201d The moblin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake it to a dungeon and place it in a chest. Then attract Zelda and her boyfriend to the dungeon,\u201d the Wizzrobe answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we defeat them and use their blood to revive Ganon?\u201d the Moblin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Sure, whatever,\u201d The Wizzrobe answered, not caring about the moblins. The Wizzrobe thought,<i> 'I might not be able to revive my master, but I will ensure that his killers will not know a moment of peace in their lives!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda had bought you some equipment, a dagger and shield. Spryte enchanted your boomerang and shield, making them the magic versions. The fairy even provided a magic bag. Spryte  said it would take some time before a blacksmith could be found that could upgrade the dagger to shoot beams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the three of you were traveling Eagle dungeon, the easiest dungeon. Especially so now that Ganon was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember, just because Ganon\u2019s gone, doesn\u2019t mean we can simply relax. We need to scout and defeat any of Ganon\u2019s forces,\u201d Zelda explained as she fired an arrow at a goyria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd any monster that surrenders and offers to join our side will have to be kept at arms length until we know for certain we can trust them,\u201d Spryte added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd any treasures?\u201d You asked, using your magic boomerang to defeat a number of Keese in one throw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe split them,\u201d Zelda answered, firing another arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds about right,\u201d you said as the room was cleared, revealing a treasure chest. \u201cI\u2019ll open it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you opened the chest and found a power bracelet, one with a heart-shaped gem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything useful?\u201d Spryte asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPower bracelet, Bit of an odd one too. A heart gem, instead of a diamond one,\u201d You answered. \u201cWho wants it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m too small at the moment,\u201d Spryte said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m fine with you taking it. I\u2019ll take the next one,\u201d  Zelda answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d You answered as you put on the power bracelet. When the gem glowed brightly for a moment, you asked, \u201cIs it supposed to do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Link never told me,\u201d Zelda answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe either, but you look really attractive wearing it!\u201d Spryte said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Zelda cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your partners. Both Zelda and Spryte had hearts in their eyes and around their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing Cartoon logic, you realized that the power bracelet was behind the change. You tried to remove the bracelet, but couldn\u2019t. You asked, \u201cLadies, I think we need to find some magic blacksmith to remove the bracelet. As in right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense, What you need is kisses,\u201d Zelda cooed as she put away her bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLots and lots of kisses,\u201d Spryte said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pointed behind them and said, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two women looked behind themselves, You ran off, deeper into the dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill! Get back here!\u201d Spryte called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! The sooner you return to us, the sooner we can start the kisses!\u201d Zelda loudly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hid  in an empty treasure chest, mere moments before Zelda and Spryte came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, the two left. You waited a few minutes to make sure you were left alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began to leave the treasure chest, you heard hissing.

She wanted to react like she did with Link when he tried to flirt with other girls. If you were a flirt, then she could get angry and punish you. She looked down and thought,<i> \u2018But you are trying to shore up diplomatic relations between Hylians and the Gerudo, as well as set up stronger forces for if Ganon somehow returned. Not only that, but there is no reason that we are expected to become a couple, as I am royalty and you are a commoner from another world.

There's no telling what traps Ganon might have set,\" Zelda said. looking for a target to hit with her crossbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I assume monsters in hiding, animated statues, trap doors, trap walls, and trap treasures,\" You said as you readied a boomerang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a pretty good list of Ganon's usual tricks,\" Spryte said as you looked in a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you saw a a treasure chest, you said, \"And here might be proof of a trap. A treasure chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might not be. It could be Rupees or Arrows, just to lure us into a nastier trap later,\" Zelda replied. \"Go check. I'll keep an eye on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and carefully headed to the chest. When you opened it, the ground under you flipped around, sending you down a shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will!\" Zelda cried out as she and Spryte ran to where you were last seen. Zelda tried to bomb a hole in the ground, but it was too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good going, Princess Zelda! now we gotta rescue him!\" Spryte huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda growled before stomping off, muttering, \"I just need a map and a compass...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of moments, you landed on a large soft pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, real worlder, welcome!\" Ganon's voice hissed, making you sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around, seeing that you were in a medium-sized room where the entire floor was a giant pillow. Only when you looked up, did you see that Ganon was above you on a balcony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird prison, if you ask me,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to harm to my newest ally,\" Ganon growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think I'll work with you?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you seem to have feelings for Princess Zelda, I will offer you three Zeldas if you join me!\" Ganon said in that screechy voice he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree figures walked onto the Balcony, making your jaw drop. Each Zelda's clothes had a color scheme of Red and Black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut only one was a Doppelganger of the Princess Zelda that you met in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was the Zelda from Ocarina of Time. The third was the Zelda from Breath of the Wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be quick in making your decision to join me. Feel free to indulge with your presents,\" Ganon growled as he walked away, closing the door and locking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three Zeldas leapt down, you tried to crawl away, saying, \"Let's not do anything we'll regret later, ladies... you are ladies, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoppel-Zelda began to take off her shirt as she cooed, \"Only one way to find out, handsome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we'll regret this at all,\" OoT-Zelda said as she used a spell to remove her clothes, revealing she had nipples and a vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBotW-Zelda took off her pants and said with a smile, \"Maybe if we're lucky, we'll include the real Zelda in this orgy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you tried to stand up, the three Zeldas rushed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been forced onto your back. OoT-Zelda sat above your head and held down your shoulders. Looking up let you look at her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoppel-Zelda and BotW-Zelda sat on your legs and took turns kissing/stripping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew if you didn't work fast enough, they'd strip you of your clothes and rape you!</span></div></div>",

So I have to ask,\" Zelda began, only the tiniest blush appearing on her cheeks. \"Do you wish to live at the castle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! You are <i>NOT </i>putting him in Link's room! As Princess of the Fairies, I forbid it!\" Spryte said, flying about in front of Zelda's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was not going to put him in Link's room!\" Zelda said with a glare. \"I was going to use one of the empty room below mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if he doesn't want to?\" Spryte asked with a touch of smugness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'd give him an advance payment, so he can live in the village by the castle,\" Zelda answered. Then she gasped, remembering you were nearby. \"But I do think that you'd be willing to live at the castle. Right, Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I mean, I don't know much about the social customs about Hyrule. So me living here would be better until I have a firm grasp on Hyrulian etiquette,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? He's understanding of why my offer is a good one, Spryte,\" Zelda answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days were uneventful. You told what you knew about the Zelda games and Zelda taught you about Hyrule customs. To be honest, it was oddly modern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte still didn't seem to like you, but was willing to tolerate you more, especially when you shared your desert with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A red-haired man named Groose was a key element in defeating a demon named Demise. However, keep in mind this is mostly speculation. Somehow, Demise cursed Groose, as Hylia's attention was mostly on Link. So Groose's family line wound up in becoming the Gerudo and created Ganondorf,\" You explained. \"But after Ganondorf was sealed, the Gerudo decided to open up more with the rest of Hyrule, probably wound up mixing in with Hylians. I mean, the Gerudo that became the Sage of Spirit was named Nabooru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the town was named after her... Wow,\" Zelda uttered in amazement. \"So much history... lost over the years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I guess the constant monster attacks are the cause?\" You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda nodded, saying, \"I think that's a safe bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda! Zelda! Link's back!\" Spryte cried out in happiness as she flew in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's back?\" Zelda asked with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should... I hide?\" You asked, remembering how jealous Link was of Prince Facade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'll handle Link,\" Zelda said as Link entered her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back, Princess. Did'ja miss me?\" Link asked. When he spotted you, he asked, \"Who is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Will. I summoned him after you left. Right before Ganon sent a large army here to steal the Triforce of Wisdom,\" Zelda said, standing between you and Link. \"Since then, he's been helping me re-discover ancient Hyrulian history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Large Army? I should have been here. I bet I would have finally gotten a kiss from you for warding it off,\" Link grumbled, angry at himself for the possibility of letting Zelda get kidnapped. When his gaze returned to you he said,\"So he can read musty old books and he's good with a sword. Is he supposed to be my <i>replacement</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No way am I your replacement. You're still the hero of Hyrule,\" You quickly said, interrupting Zelda. \"Besides, I don't know how to do that sword beam you and Zelda could do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know someone knows his place,\" Spryte loudly muttered. Link nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how could you help ward off Ganon's army?\" Link asked, wondering if you were secretly part of Ganon's forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am skilled in Karate, a form of hand-to-hand combat,\" you answered. \"As for my knowledge of Ancient Hylian history, my knowledge is rather broad-stroked. so details can be sketchy. I mean, I am from another world and the way I came across the knowledge is rather... embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would explain your ears. You don't have the Hylian ears, the kind that are supposed to hear the words of the goddesses,\" Link said. \"And how embarrassing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will, you don't have to answer,\" Zelda and Spryte answered, a stern look in both their eyes. First aimed at you, then at Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to answer, Link, but when have Zelda ever agreed to something?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, Link laughed. \"Heh, Guess this means I won't know for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda and Spryte seemed relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few days, Link being there was a bit odd for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had moments where he distrusted you, but they passed quickly and he treated you with a good amount of respect and care, as you were a stranger in a different world ... save for when Zelda was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way Zelda paid attention to you did rankle him. A lot. He was quite rough in any spar that happened an hour or so afteR Zelda was affectionate with you. While you knew Kerate and he was more of a brawler when he was unarmed, he did have a lot more experience in an actual fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did seem to like you better when he heard about how whenever Ganon appeared in the past, a Link appeared to defeat him. Both of you wondered if the various Links were of the same Family, but never managed to marry their Zeldas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat and Zelda didn't give you any kisses either. You felt that he didn't need to know that you never tried to get a kiss from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Spryte would know more about the past than you, but you didn't want to risk a fairy's fury for trying to pry information out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you learned that Zelda's birthday was coming up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need help in getting the princess a gift?\" Link smugly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Tomorrow, I'll just look around the market place for something. I do get pay for helping with history,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. Whatever,\" Link muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Princess Zelda's newest ally is trying to get a gift for her... for her Birthday...\" Ganon growled. He cackled, \"So let's help him. Let's help the love of their... relationship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanon teleported around, laughing harder each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave of his hand, he created a necklace, one that was of rare and foreign materials. It even looked like it was from your world. Tossing the necklace at a Gibdo, he ordered, \"Go make sure that sure that this... Will buys it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugh... how?\" the Gibdo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanon blasted the gibdo, putting the monster in the form of a beautiful female merchant. He bellowed to all the monsters of the underworld, \"Monsters! Search the Dungeons for any items that can be sold and bring them here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you went to the Marketplace. you looked around, trying to find a gift for Zelda that she'd know it was from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, handsome. Need a gift fora girlfriend?\" A hot merchant asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda.  What do you have?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had various items. Swords, bracelets, bombs, arrows, potions, dresses... and a great looking necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it,\" You said, pointing at the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good eye,\" The merchant cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Zelda had her birthday, it was a Lavish ceremony, where many people from nearby countries gave her gifts. Even a few countries from across the sea gave a few gifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink gave Zelda a new dress and she thanked him for it. Though he did try to ask for a kiss, she refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you gave her your gift, she opened the box and loved the necklace. She said, \"Oh, Will! Thank you! I'll put it on right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Zelda put on the necklace. Her feelings toward you were... enhanced, so to speak. She now...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few days were interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda wore the necklace whenever you saw her. When she thought you weren't looking, she looked at herself in a mirror and posed for it. She still worked with you in re-discovering Hyrule history. She also kept teaching you about the various Hyrule customs and was learning Karate from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte didn't appear as much, but continued to do so for the History rediscovery as you were told her job was Zelda's assistant. When she did appear outside of that, she was annoyed with you and Zelda. You suspected she was with Link most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink kind of stopped sparring with you, claiming he was getting bored. He still stuck around to watch you teach Zelda Karate. If you had to guess, he was trying to learn Karate by observing it. Other than that, he kept his distance from you, going on short adventures, trying to find a better gift than the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did make the odd complaint of the dungeons being cleaned out of... well, all items!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked into the main hall, where Link was pouring over the map of Hyrule that listed various dungeons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I can come along on your next dungeon trip?\" You asked, hoping to befriend him. Even if Link was annoying, he still was kind of your hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And risk you giving another gift to Zelda?\" Link asked with annoyance. He stood up and headed out the room. \"No thanks. Spryte, let's get moving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, Link!\" Spryte said as she flew after Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, \"I wonder if there's any way to stop Link from hating me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe fight him hand-to-hand like the ancient warriors of old, bellowing out all your problems with each other? I had similar problems with the king of Calatia and a fight was how we cleared the air,\" King Harkinian asked as he walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, \"No. I think that will exacerbate the problem in this situation. He thinks I'm stealing Zelda and his glory. I'd rather settle things out peacefully with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King shrugged before he left the room as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why I like you more than him!\" Zelda cried out as she suddenly appeared and hugged you from behind, mashing her boobs against your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks, Zelda,\" You said with a blush as Zelda walked around you, still pressing her bosom against you. \"So... Why so affectionate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I realized that you're a better match for me. Perhaps we can start dating?\" Zelda cooed. \"After all, that was going to be the next item for you to learn on your Hyrulian customs agenda. What better experience than a hands-on lesson? Especially when we add in some... 'extra credit'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly took a step back, as Zelda groped your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eurm, Zelda? Aren't you moving a bit too fast? I mean, It's only been a few weeks since I came here. Sex is kinda....\" You said as you put a chair between you and the approaching Zelda. \"Too soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the chair aside, Zelda said, \"Oh, I'm ready for it. In fact, I'll make it a royal order. I order you to date me, Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I don't?\" You asked, quickly rolling over the large table to put it between you and the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll gladly wait then. You're worth it,\" Zelda cooed as she leaned against the table, trying to look sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was hot enough to it to look good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of thought, You decided to...</span></div></div>",

What's going on?\" He cried angrily pulling out his sword and pointing it directly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link,nothing was going on between us!\" Zelda tried her best explaining but still had stars in her eyes and hearts floating around her head Link noticed the way she was looking dreamily eyed at you and got even madder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't look like it from me! Yo...you <u>do</u> have a crush on this guy! Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!\" The hero of Hyrule was so unable to contain his rage he actually grabbed hold of the necklace around the princess' throat and pulled it off,it even broke off completely at the chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tears it! No one takes my girl and gets away without it!\" As he pointed his blade at you and you began slowly backing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,now Link....ta-take it easy believe me,I never wanted this in fact the princess came onto me hugging and flirting with me like crazy! Please don't......\" As you were really scared as there was no telling what a single beam from that sword could do to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late for apologies pal,you picked the last princess to flirt with....\" Just as Zelda without warning grabbed his arm screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO LINK DON'T!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Princess-don't try and stop me!\" Link screamed angrily as even Spryte looked terrified for a bit but Zelda managed to pull the sword from his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not telling you,I'm ordering you,NOT TO HURT HIM! Now back away slowly.\" She said with fire in her green eyes Link threw a dirty look at you but did as she requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you now what's going on here?\" She ordered sharply,her beautiful green eyes darting from one person  to the other she seemed to come back to herself in a flash as there were no longer stars in her eyes or hearts floating over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy's been putting the moves on you Princess,he gave you this necklace to cause you to fall madly in love with you (pointing to it on the floor at her feet) but I think it's really a curse from Ganon himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-is this true?\" As Zelda stared at it then directly at you,her green eyes flashing like fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I........No! Of course not! princess...I-I wouldn't..............\" You choked out.  \"It was a gift from me for your birthday remember?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looked bewildered for a minute as if she was about to say she remembered but that cold frown returned and she cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards!\" As two burly men dressed in thick armor came running into the room and the princess said the one thing you dreaded above all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take him to the dungeon at once!!\" Pointing directly at you as both men put heavy chains around your hands and feet as you cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,hey Princess Zelda Please................No I Didn't...I-I couldn't.....\" But she shook her head sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I trusted you Will,I allowed you to stay in my father's kingdom and you would dare do this to me? And after all your fancy talk about Hyrule's history! And to think I actually believed you. Take him to the dungeon!\" As she turned away but you could sense the hurt and sadness in her voice as Link didn't look one bit sorry,on the contrary he looked more happier and proud with this unfortunate outcome as you were led away you couldn't help but think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God what a jerk!\" As you were placed in one of the smallest dungeon in the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both Link and Zelda were prepared to again head down into Ganon's underworld for another attempt to get the Triforce of Power when Zelda stopped briefly a good distance from the castle looking back at it with a concerned expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Princess?\" Link asked also pausing to look back at the girl he loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link,what if we made a mistake about Will? I can't help but keep thinking maybe I did do all those things without realizing it.\" As she put a finger on her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Zelda? You didn't do anything wrong it was that Will guy.\" Link folded his arms in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if I did Link? I must admit ever since he arrived I...I have been strangely att...........\" But her voice trailed off as she saw the hero in green's sudden frown.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What..y-you mean you actually developed a crush on him princess?\" He choked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if I have? I'm the royal princess here and I'm allowed to fall in love with whoever I want!\" She snapped angrily. \"But still I can't help but feel bad for what I did to him. Oh where's that necklace you showed me earlier? Give it to me!\" She held out her hand and groaning to himself Link pulled out the necklace from his magic bag he kept all his items in to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange there's nothing unusual about this necklace it looks like any other necklace but.....GASP!! There's definitely a great source of magic within this piece of jewelry.................Ohh Link,Will...We were all wrong about him! I was wrong. T-this <u>is</u> Ganon's work...he's using Will to get to the Triforce of Wisdom!\" Zelda cried out as she dropped the necklace on purpose to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah so,what were you expecting princess,that's what ole Pig-Face does! Anyway forget about him and let's go get the Triforce of Wisdom!\" Link said as he again prepared to leave but Zelda......</span></div></div>",

After all, tricking us into arresting an innocent person would be something Ganon would do,\" Zelda said before she turned around and began to walk to the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink grabbed Zelda and said, \"Zelda, we can do that when we come back. Let's go beat Pignose and get the Triforce of power!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking Link's hand off, Zelda replied, \"No. I refuse. Father might go ahead and banish him while I'm with you in the underworld.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So no big loss!\" Link said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could grab her, Zelda ran to the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dungeon, You lookedaround.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a guard walking by every ten minutes or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cell you were in had some wooden planks attached to the wall as a bed. A hole in the floor as a toilet. There was little else in the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte suddenly appeared. You asked, \"Come to gloat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... well, maybe a little,\" Spryte answered. \"I believe that you know a lot of Hyrule's history, but I think Link was a bit out of line. He never should've tried to attack you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And me getting arrested?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You deserve it for making Link mad,\" Spryte  answered as she flew in the cell. Zelda arrived in the Dungeon with the Triforce of Wisdom. Spryte  continued, \"But I don't think you allied with Ganon. For one, you're on your own, no personal guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her hiding spot, Zelda nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpryte continued. \"You were summoned from another world BY Zelda, not Ganon. If Ganon could access other worlds, we'd be in a whole lot of trouble! You being with Ganon doesn't make sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm Ganon's patsy? Is that what you're saying?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much. I'll try to get Zelda and argue for her, but stop making Link mad!\" Spryte demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't deliberately done anything to make Link mad! I looked up to him and his family as heroes! But no! He goes and acts like a jerk, simply because I'm helping Zelda learn some of Hyrule's lost history and Karate!\" You ranted, making Spryte and Zelda pause. You sat on the bench and leaned back. You sighed, \"Honestly, I don't know how to prove I'm innocent and how to make Link not get mad at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Well, I can help with the innocence part,\" Zelda said, bringing the Triforce of Wisdom. \"Have you ever worked with Ganon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never in my life. I pity him more than anything else. He's the angry greedy shards of a man long dead,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know the necklace had any kind of magic in it?\" Zelda asked with a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. If I did, I would have smashed it myself and warned you of it,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triforce of Wisdom?\" Zelda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All answers that Will has said are true and are without falsehood or trickery,\" The Glowing pyramid said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... Guards, release Will,\" Zelda ordered a trio of armored knights.</span></div></div>",

You kind of had a fascination for older games and making/playing mods for them if you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, your parents decided to kick you out, since you were 18 years old and out of school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo 'help you' find a new place, they sold all your things and gave you the money they got for all of it. They didn't tell you until after the fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked away with only the clothes on your back and your smartphone. You doubted you'd ever speak to them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you passed by an alley, you heard the sound of a warp pipe from the Super Mario game. You looked and indeed, there was a green pipe sticking out of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you carefully walked up to it, wondering if it was a prank or not. At best, you had your first bit of furniture, a table that looked like a warp pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tapped it with your knuckles a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely metal,\" You muttered before leaning above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt... stretched down for a long distance. In fact, there appeared to be a cup-sized opening that seemed to be...sky?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your hand in, just to see if it was oil-based paint or a velvet painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened. Some force seemed to grab your arm pul you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed for help as you were pulled through the pipe. As the other end came closer and closer, you saw that it lead to open sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you reached the other end of the Warp Pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut instead of being shot out like a bullet, you stopped the moment your upper body was out of the pipe. To your relief, there wasn't any whiplash from the sudden stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe land around you was what the 1980's thought what a futuristic city looked like. There were building that looked like machines and elevated walkways all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen someone walked into your line of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for you to recognize them, but it was <a onclick=\"$('#dropNote1').toggle (200);\" style=\"cursor:pointer;color:#0000ff;\" title=\"\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Bunsen from the Super Mario Bros Super show.</span> <span style=\"font-size:8pt;opacity:.75;text-decoration:none;\">\u25bc</span></a><div id=\"dropNote1\" style=\"padding:0px;display:none;\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Bunsen\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mariowiki.com/Bunsen</a></div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... in that old show?\" you muttered, getting Bunsen's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a human.

I was not told by Dr. Nerdnick,\" Bunsen answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get to the doctor in a hurry. I think I know who the King is and they definitely are not a good person,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is the King, then?\" Bunsen asked as she put her hands on her hips, apparently not believing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King Koopa, leader of the Koopa Troopa. He's a slimy disgusting, ugly, conniving, cruel, big time meanie! Go ahead, send a message to any of the lands you can contact to learn if he's on the level or not. Heck, go call the Super Mario Brothers or Princess Toadstool,\" You answered. \"As for King Koopa's description, think a large turtle with a lot of spikes and wearing a crown. His face kinda looks like an ox's.face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll check,\" Bunsen replied as she walked over to a building and pressed a panel, which caused the panel to flip over and reveal a computer terminal. She typed away for some time. When a video of Dr. Nerdnick's lab appeared, she pressed a few more times to access the security tapes. When King Koopa appeared on the screen, she gasped. \"He looks even worse than you described!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's stop Dr. Nerdnick from making a mistake!\" You said as Bunsen flipped back the Terminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIna few minutes, you entered Dr. Nerdnick's lab, where the scientist in question was working on the robosuit's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunsen cried out, \"Dr. Nerdnick! You're making a big mistake! Don't build that for King Koopa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Dr. Nerdnick uttered his gibberish, Bunsen interpreted, \"He's asking how could he be making a mistake? The Robosuit is to help promote peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think making something that can produce Bob-ombs and Bullet Bills is very peaceful. In fact, I can only think evil purposes for such inventions,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Nerdnick shrugged and said more gibberish. Bunsen interpreted, \"He said, 'You got a point, but how can we make sure that King Koopa is evil?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Add in a function where if he targets anyone with the weapons, the robosuit turns into a prison cell,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Nerdnick nodded before saying more gibberish and getting back to work on the robotsuit. Bunsen said, \"He said no problem. It can be done in a jiffy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is my robotsuit?\" King Koopa asked as Dr. Nerdnick led him into the completed Robosuit. You and Bunsen waited nearby in an escape tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Nerdnick nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!... How do I get in?\" King Koopa asked. Dr. Nerdnick pressed a button and the Robosuit unfolded. King Koopa entered the unfolded suit and the suit folded back up. \"Mwua-ha-ha-ha! Now Ican take over Robo Land!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe aimed a hand at Dr. Nerdnick. King Koopa briefly wondered why the good docker was unphased, but shrugged it off. But when the horned Koopa got ready to press the Bullet Bill button...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Robosuit immediately changed into a prison cell that vagly looked like the Robosuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you... You... You! You sneaky underhanded labcoat-wearing pansy! How dare you trick me when I'm trying to trick you!\" King Koopa bellowed, trying to pull the call bars apart. He paused and muttered, \"Man, I wish I was the one to think of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Nerdnick uttered some gibberish. Bunsen interpreted, \"He said we can come out now and that we should contact the Super Mario Brothers about King Koopa's capture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and so Bunsen opened the escape Tunnel's door to the lab. Bunsen walked over to a phone and quickly dialed. \"Hello, is this the Mushroom Kingdom? It is? Good! I wish to report the capture of King Koopa, all thanks to Y/N's plans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, feeling good that you captured the villainous King Koopa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I get out of here, you'll all pay! Oh boy, will you all pay! Especially you, Mario, you pasta-eating drainbrain!\" King Koopa yelled, still shaking the bars as it was being transported to the Banishment Zone. \"And I have a special punishment in store for that Wimp, Y/N!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Y/N! We've been trying to capture King Koopa since forever!\" Toad said, shaking your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Let's go celebrate with an all-you-can-eat pasta contest!\" Mario said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I can get behind, brother!\" Luigi said,high-fiving Mario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where did you come from, Y/N?\" Toadstool asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erhm, Well, the Real World. But my parents sold almost of my things and kicked me out of their home, so I kinda don't have any reason to go back,\" You answered. Both Toadstool and Bunsen's hearts felt for you. You produced your smartphone and said, \"Other than the clothes I'm wearing, this is my only belonging. It's a phone, music player, video player and a bit more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you let Dr.Nerdnick look at it, your smartphone will work with anything in Robo Land,\" Bunsen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise that there will always be a place for you in the Mushroom Kingdom, Y/N. Come with me and I will personally insure that you will have a home to your personal specifications,\" Toadstool said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunsen frowned for a moment before she smiled and said, \"If living space is a concern, then you can live near or even with me! Robo Land was made for human and robot cohabitation! In fact, your plan that defeated King Koopa has some robots wondering if you'd like to be leader!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool was cuter and more human-like, but you knew that King Koopa would return and cause more trouble. There was also the concern that you might be personally selected to help teach the cavemen in Dinosaur Land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunsen could probably upgrade herself to look more human and she was quite helpful, but you were afraid to be accused of being a 'robosexual'. The idea of being Leader of Robo Land was intriguing, but a bit scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could go explore the Lands of the Video Game Land and not have to worry about King Koopa or helping Cavemen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you know that whatever your choice was, Bunsen planned on staying with you, as she gained a crush on you because of both your plan to defeat Koopa and the fact you treated her like a person.</span></div></div>",

I will be staying in Robo Land,\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunsen smiled, while Toadstool frowned and asked, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to reveal too much about future shows, you said, \"Because I don't think King Koopa will stay in the Banishment Zone for long. Bunsen, is there a way for me to create powerups for Mario, Luigi, and Toadstool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but such work will take time,\" Bunsen answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I had an idea of what the powerups looked like and what they could do?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would streamline creation quite a bit, but it still would take time,\" Bunsen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do appreciate being cautious, but please reconsider my offer, Y/N,\" Toadstool requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do more good here. If we prepare for his return, then we can trap him faster,. We can make the world safer,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a quote from the real world I think fits. 'Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety'. Keep that in mind, Y/N,\" Toadstool said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said, \"And here is another quote, 'The price of freedom is eternal vigilance'. To assume Koopa will never escape is practically taunting him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry, Princess Toadstool. I and several others will make sure Y/N won't go overboard,\" Bunsen said as she hugged your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool's hands curled into fists. She said, \"See that you do, Bunsen. I will be joining Mario and Luigi in their contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few months, you enjoyed life in Robo Land. You learned how to make flying motorcycles and how to ride them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was weird, as trying to duplicate your smartphone kept running into all sorts of problems, like power, weight, and shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunsen proved to be an excellent assistant. She recorded any ideas that you so much as muttered and was quick to remind you to take a break and eat if you skipped a meal. If you got injured, she was quick to heal you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Powerups, you managed to create the powerups from Super Mario Bros 3 and Super Mario world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a security break by Koopa Troopas and you lost a large number of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It happens, Y/N. At least the powerup boxes will ensure your powerups will always be there if they are needed anywhere in the world,\" Bunsen said, trying to cheer you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I guess. It still sucks, though.\" You replied. \"So what's the news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what you said you would stay here? Well, you were right. King Koopa broke out, but not only that, he revealed he has seven kids to help him conquer the world!\" Bunsen said in a worried voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't say I didn't see that happening. So shall we send a message to Princess Toadstool that we are ready to help if she needs us?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get right on it,\" Bunsen said with a salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you do, how is the Auto-doc's progress?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it can heal injuries and identify illnesses, but that's about it,\" Bunsen answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about magical illnesses and transformations?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They still fall under the category of illnesses. Dr. Nerdnick sped up progress for magical ailments cures the moment he heard King Koopa broke out,\" Bunsen answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Contact the princess,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunsen opened her heart-panel on her chest and took out a phone. \"Hello, Princess Toadstool? This is Bunsen. I'm calling on behalf of Y/N to let you know we are ready to form an alliance with you if you need one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, she said, \"Y/N, I have some news...\"</span></div></div>",

I guess I'm a little out of it, now that Y/N is coming here,\" Toadstool sheepishly answered as she put theRobot Princess's head in the box. She then looked at herself and how her body was still tanned from her vacation. \"Do... Do you think he'll stay in the Mushroom Kingdom if he sees my new look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, Don't take it the wrong way, but if he didn't accept your offer before, he still ain't gonna accept,\" Toad answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a frown, she muttered, \"I know, but still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here!\" You called out as you landed your Hoverbike, one modified to have a platform in the back. \"I brought the walkie-talkies. So where's the robo-double?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here!\" Toad said, holding up the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. That makes things simple,\" you replied as you got off your hoverbike and undid the straps keeping the Walkie-talkie box secured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... How is everything?\" Toadstool asked, posing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad. Smartphone development is still hitting deadends, though. I'm almost done with magic cap development, so you, Toad, and the Mario Bros can either turn into steel, go invisible, or even glide,\" You answered as you and Toad switched the boxes. \"Nice tan, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks, Y/N. Have you changed your mind about where you want to live?\" Toadstool asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....\" Toadstool sadly muttered. \"So what are you going to do with the robot princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look into the programming, remove any Koopa traps in her hardware or Software. I might be able to let her live her own life in Robo Land,\" You answered as you strapped the box onto the hoverbike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to change her appearance?\" Toadstool asked, anger showing up in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a few moments before you answered, \"I'll have Bunsen find some new clothes for her, but it'll be up to the robot princess... and that's assuming we'd be able to activate her. Koopa Tech is rather new to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want her to pretend to be me any more. Make sure you change her appearance,\" Toadstool replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if she volunteers to be your official double for situations or areas where you appearing in person is too dangerous? Heck, you could still do that if the robot never gains sentience or sapience,\" You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool paused and said, \"I'll consider your words. It would be useful if I had protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you returned to Robo Land, you placed the box containing the Robot Princess in ours and Bunsen's lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's Kooky's Robot... Huh... What shall we do with the parts?\" Bunsen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking about removing all the bad Koopa programming and letting Robo-Toadstool live her own life, but if we can't do that, then I guess we turn her into a controllable drone for Princess Toadstool,\" You answered as you placed the parts on an operating table. Once you were done placing the parts, you asked, \"What's your opinion?

Following his orders,\" Bunsen said as she walked over to a terminal and tapped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to stop her, but Bunsen was a robot several leagues stronger than you. When she walked away from the terminal, you were dragged for a few moments before giving up and trying to stop King Koopa from entering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were relieved to discover the terminal was not password-bound, but annoyed that King Koopa and his kids were entering Robo-Land. So you quickly entered a few commands. Some to shut the door, a few to send a message and passwords to the Mushroom Kingdom, and a large number to block access to any major terminals by either Koopas or anything praising Koopa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were doing that, you grumbled, \"I hate how cartoons get technology wrong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the disabled Robo-Toadstool, you took a remote computer, attached it to her, and set up a few programs. One to delete anything Koopa-related programming and another to give her a basic A.I., one that would let her become her own bot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then looked at the main terminal, showing Bunsen meeting King Koopa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here is our ticket to taking over the Mushroom Kingdom! She and some nerdy human stopped me the last time, but thanks to Kooky, she now obeys us!\" King Koopa crowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plans within plans, just like you said, Dad!\" Kooky replied before cackling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where is this human?\" Bully asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is with the Robo-Toadstool. we were checking it over when I was infected to obey you,\" Bunsen answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... did you leave him any surprises?\" King Koppa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I set a few factories to create RoboKoopa Troopas,\" Bunsen answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make them Smoochbots, all to kiss that human into being our slave!\" Kootie Pie ordered, getting a glare from her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changing end product to Smoochbots and adding in mind-control lipstick!\" Bunsen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly went into the computer history and disabled Bunsen's connection to the city. As you did so, you muttered, \"Why do we have mind-control Lipstick in stock? Water and a towel can remove both it and the mind-control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warning! Y/N is disabling my control over Robo-Land!\" Bunsen quickly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then disable his control!\" King Koopa bellowed. Then an evil idea came to him and he cackled, \"Then go seek him out and kiss him to pieces!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger, King Koopa!\" Bunsen said before your connection cut out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\nYou were able to disable Bunsen's control over the city, but she managed to lock you out of most terminals. Only the one in your apartment would allow you in, as you were paranoid this situation might happen. Doing a reboot to set Bunsen back a day might save the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you left Bunsen's lab, making sure to use the regular lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, you peered around the corner and saw the Smoochbots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were just like the Smoochbot from <i>Sonic X</i>'s episode 21, <i>Fast Friends</i>. They looked like a camera on a stick with feet at the bottom, and had large pink lips where the lens would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...\" You grumbled, wondering what else might go wrong.</span></div></div>",

You said, \"Alright, I'll pick this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You can walk home. It's only a mile away,\" They said before driving off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared at them, but said nothing.

Her ship landed nearby and she loaded you on it. As she picked you up, she said, \"Huh, kinda cute. Gonna have to see what's in the box, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Samus put you onto a medical bed and strapped you in, just in case you were dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the box and muttered, \"I knew Mario and Link were famous to be in comics, but Kevin? So he is famous enough for some comics? Huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she picked up Captain N Issue 5. She muttered, \"Ah, the time I went into the future...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you discovered that you were strapped to a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you saw a familiar woman in a green leotard with long arm sleeves She was reading one of the comics and seemed... enthralled? Whatever it was, she was just staring at the comic with her jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samus Aran? you muttered, gettign her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus quickly composed herself and put the comic back in the box. She gave you a stern glare and said,\"Alright, you're awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I strapped down until I am known to be friendly?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus nodded. \"First question.

They came up with a plan instantaneously. A few rushed you, others went for some rope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you were bound and gagged, they hid alongside and above the door, just out of view of whoever was entering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outer airlock opened and closed. Then the inner door opened and Samus carefully walked in with her arm cannon readied for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw you, she whispered, \u201cWill?

Once SA-X1 had enough room, she landed behind Samus and did something to cause Samus\u2019s suit to shock her into unconsciousness. The other SA-X quickly grabbed the knocked-out Samus and took off her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X1 looked at SA-X9 and said, \u201cYou and her will be Bounty Hunters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samus was being stripped, SA-X9 said, \u201cShe won\u2019t accept us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you will be a bounty hunter and she a sex slave,\u201d SA-X1 replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=o=<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Samus was woken up, she was naked, bound to a medical bed, and spread-eagled. After trying to free herself, she noted she was still in her ship. So Samus then said, \u201cComputer! Free me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a negative-sounding beep and Samus saw something that horrified her. She saw herself dressed in her zero suit and a lab coat wheel in a large adjustable metal pole with you tied to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2026 Who are you? What do you want with me and Will?\u201d Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith him? We desire sex and acceptance. With your appearance, we can eventually achieve both,\u201d SA-X1 answered in her flat tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd me?\u201d Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither you accept us as sisters or we gain a sex pet,\u201d SA-X1 answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by sisters? And are you saying there\u2019s more of you?\u201d Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X2-9 walked in and just stared at Samus. SA-X2 was dressed like SA-X1, SA-X3 and SA-X4 were in Samus\u2019s green leotard, but had some communication headsets, SA-X5 and SA-X6 were dressed in mechanic coveralls, and SA-X7 and SA-X8 were wearing zero suits and some basic bodyarmor. SA-X9 was completely nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith quiet horror, Samus uttered,\u201cThe X parasite\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were, once. But the radiation from the Biologic Space Laboratories explosion altered us, making your form the only one we can take,\u201d SA-X1 answered as she put the metal pole near the medical bed and adjusted it so that your face was a few inches away from Samus\u2019s bare pussy..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus glared at the SA-X as she asked, \"Will... Did you join the SA-X?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to look away from Samus's pussy because of head-restraints, you said\"N-No! I thought you came here early.

What the hell!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSA-X1 moved the metal pole, so your face was pressed against Samus's pussy. That part of her felt warm and wet. After you were brought back up, SA-X1 answered, \"We offer a choice. Either we join forces and become a family with Will dating us all or we will make you two our slaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So which one makes me SA-X0?\" Samus asked in an angry jestering tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither. you would be SA-X10, since you absorbed her,\" SA-X1 answered.</span></div></div>",

It's like being tortured with water drops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Chinese water torture. My problem is I tend to spend way too much time traveling for bounty missions, so I can't really date guys who are homebodies. For guys who can keep up, they have a nasty habit of 'trying to protect me'. So either they get mained and have to retire, or they get hurt enough that I'm forced to abort the mission to get them to a hospital ship,\" Samus replied before she drank. \"So either I have to choose between guys who can't wait or guys that think I'm way too delicate for bounty hunting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mario, Luigi, and Toad are nice, but none are my type.

She had a rather big butt. Then again, she was a cartoon character who had the smallest bust of the three, so she would have the biggest butt because of Cartoon logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus\u2019s rear was covered a little bit by her green leotard, but still was a great sight. Samus had a nice hourglass shaped body. So she had the middle-sized booty out of the three, but had the biggest boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t lose,\u201d Zelda growled as she turned around and bent over. Zelda had a bit of a lesser figure than Samus, but because of her age and connection with the Triforce, offered that she could possibly grow bigger than Samus.

Thanks to boredom while traveling and portals dumping stuff from various real worlds, Samus knew it was the breast expansion device from <i>Mahoromatic</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the instructions, Samus saw it was an upgraded version, one that could not only be set to target specific people or to ignore them, but also alter more of the body than just the breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019d like to buy this,\u201d Samus said as she showed a box to a cashier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you buying, Samus?\u201d Zelda asked with annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just a vacuum. I think our boyfriend might find it useful,\u201d Samus answered as she gave a secret wink to the cashier, who understood it as a need to be quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda frowned, but nodded in agreement.

'buying' stuff.

Her boyfriend?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed you carrying bags. 'If a guy carries clothes in a bag while following a girl, then it means he's either dating her or he's her slave.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKootie smiled as she added, 'Or in my case, my boyfriend is both.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChucking as she used her magic wand to disguise herself and create some cursed jewelry, she thought, 'Now to ruin their relationship.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you and Toadstool came across a 17 year old valley girl-esque salesperson at a jewelry stand. They had long blonde hair, too much makeup, and green clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! I have a special sale for cute guys like you! the price for any of my things is half-off!\" the salesperson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Will, do you want something to wear?\" Toadstool asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this,\" You said as you picked up a rather ordinary bracelet. Toadstool smiled and paid for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! I hope you enjoy it!\" the salesperson said as the exchange happened. As you put on the bracelet, she spotted mall security. \"Whoops! Gotta go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up her stand and ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... That was a thing,\" You muttered Toadstool nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kootie Pie ran past Samus, the bounty hunter sensed abounty hunting money opportunity. She said, \"Sorry, Zelda, but money awaits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samus ran after Kootie Pie, Zelda said, \"Samus! Get back here! I swear, you're almost as bad as Link!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, the bracelet was made to magically effect whoever you considered to be your girlfriend, which was Samus, Zelda, and Toadstool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic effect was...</span></div></div>",

So she had to stick with wearing a bathrobe, wearing only slippers and panties that now looked like a thong on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool sighed, as her now super-big boobs prevented her from wearing her favorite style of dresses. So she wore a large and loose t-shirt and pants. It was one of her Milli Vanilli shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was conflicted, as she felt jealous of the others' assets. her clothes could fit her, but barely. She had to forgo wearing a bra and did not like how her boobs seemed to bounce on their own and how her pants were really skint-tight.

Anyone he considers to be his girlfriend will change into a catgirl,\u201d The nurse answered. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s been enchanted to remain on him unless Kootie Pie Koopa takes it off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNya\u2026. So we\u2019re going to remain catgirls unless we force Kootie Pie to undo it? Zelda muttered, her ears lowering down in sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForcing bad guys to undo will be the final part. Chasing after her will the fun part,\u201d Samus replied, sounding oddly serious. She then asked the nurse \u201cAny other side effects?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you might gain more fur or even go into heat. While I was scanning you, your recent change was that your nails can now extend and become like cat claws. Blame magic for that, as human fingers normally can\u2019t handle that without losing the ability to grasp objects,\u201d The nurse answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So will we be able to go home?\" Toadstool asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With no problems whatsoever... unless it involves water. Y'know, cause you're kinda cats now,\" the Nurse replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.

You turn back around and see that Toadstool has joined the others and stripped out of her dress. \"Something's... happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the three ladies started getting... furrier. They retained the flowing locks on their heads, but they soon started growing fur where there was nothing more than just bare skin. You can only watch in heartache as the three of them writhed around during their transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's was relatively simple. The purple fur on her ears and tail soon spread across her body. The elegant fur was sleeked down and matted. It looked like you could glide your hand down her coat effortlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Toadstool. Her pink fur had poofed out across her body. She now looked like a pink powderpuff with a tail. You feel like you could lose your hand in her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast was Samus. Rather than the other two, Samus did not grow pure green fur like her tail would suggest. Along her back were several black stripes, making the end result seem like a martian tiger. With that, the transformations ended and the moaning died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you girls okay?\" You ask. The three rose and began to examine themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. These new looks will take some adjusting to, though.\" Toadstool replied. Samus, meanwhile, had adjusted just fine. Seeing cat Zelda behind her, Samus grew a devious grin as she damgled her tail in front of her, causing the elegant cat to bat at it with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you Samus, quit messing with these strange cat instincts.\" Zelda huffs, still batting. This causes the audience of you and Toadstool to start laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

She stood at an amazonian eight feet tall, putting you at eye level with her breasts. Said breasts were each around the size of your head and looked firm and perky. Her body looked slim and slender, but she seemed to carry a lot of tone to it, as you could see muscles in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair looked like Toadstool's, but it had Samus' blonde coloring with a highlight streak that matched Zelda's hair color. Her outfit was a leotard like Samus', only it was colored purple, and at the chest was Toadstool's iconic broach. Wait... she couldn't be..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toadstool? Zelda? Samus?\" You call out, hoping that this is just some joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... and no.\" The woman responds. Her voice carried some authority to it, yet also softness. \"Let us return to the castle where we may speak in private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman pulled you into a hug, pressing your face into her cleavage. You felt a sensation akin to a powerful wind all around you as you begin to feel weightless. Then, as quickly as it had started, it was over. You look around and see that you are in some sort of bedroom, with all your shopping around your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! How did we get here? How did you do that? Where even are we?\" You ask rapid fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are currently in the royal bedroom of Peach's castle. Those second two are the same answer, Fayore's wind, courtesy of Zelda.\" You tense up at the mention of Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she? What did you do to her? What about the others? Whmmmmph?!\" Your questions are muffled by some form of magic sealing your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm yourself cute one. Let me explain. The three you love are a part of me. They are being unwillingly fused together by some magic. I am the result of that fusion. My personality, body, even my wardrobe is a mixture of the three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her words calmed you a bit. But you still had questions. Unfortunately, the maguc on your mouth prevented you from asking them. \"I also possess the memories and abilities of the three. Meaning I have Zelda's magic, as we saw when I warped us here. I have Samus' combat abilities.\" To demonstrate, she puts you into a headlock and pulls you onto the bed, wrapping her arms and legs around you in such a way that you are left an immobile knot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly releases you to continue. \"And finally, Toadstool's diplomacy skills. But there is one thing that all three of them share. Something that I feel unconditionally as a result.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the magic that's silencing you dispel. \"What's that?\" You ask. Your answer comes in the form of the woman giving you a passionate kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They all love you very, very much Will.\" She giggles at your blushing face as she pulls you into another hug. \"So what shall we do now, my love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first things first, you need a name until we can find a way to undo this.\" Then you remembered that you were talking to a completely new person. \"N-not that you aren't great and all, it's just that...\" She silences you with a finger to your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh. It's okay, I understand. You simply wish to see them again. I hold no grudge. But I agree, a name should come first. What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... your body is hard on the outside like Samus, but at your core you are sweet like Toadstool. You are also a rarity of a woman like Zelda. Hmmm... hard outside, sweet inside, and rare to find. How about Pineapple, Princess Pineapple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds perfect. From now on, call me Pineapple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

You nervously replied, \"O...okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPineapple smiled right back, with a smile that both warmed your heart and made your pants that much tighter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not expect that Pineapple's first activity was to run around her diplomatic palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, it allowed you to get a good look at that divine derriere, barely covered by her purple leotard. That made the situation a bit better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she was a video game character, one that could run forever! In fact, she ran laps around you. That did allow you glimpses at her jiggling goddess boobs, also making it a bit better as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you leaned against a table covered with water bottles, Pineapple walked up and grabbed a water bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished it, you asked, \"You done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, with running. I have another fun activity in mind,\" Pineapple cooed as she leaned forward, letting her breasts swing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I am such a sucker for her girls...' </i>you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spotted her as she lifted weights. Weights that exceeded your own limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that Samus was a former Space Marine from the federation and probably did have upgrades from the Chozo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToadstool, or Peach as she let her friends like you call her, was able to carry a lot of things in Super Mario Bros 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure about Zelda, but she probably did have to keep in shape to fight Ganon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in All, you felt weak and kind of useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure you knew Karate, but Pineapple could take out armies in the time it took you to take out a group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought hit you, <i>'I'm the heart of this group. I keep her from going off the deep end.'</i><br>\r\nYou smiled, not feeling useless as you watched her lift weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was swimming. That did allow you to float around in nice cold water and get a look at Pineapple's swimsuit. You had a stopwatch to keep track of Pineapple's times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Samus, Toadstool, or Zelda, it would have been a modest purple two-piece bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Pineapple? It barely covered her nipples and pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombined with the coldwater, her nipples were poking out quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to her testing out her body. She swam rather fast and seemed quite proud that she broke the time limits of the trio she was made of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she said, \"Alright, I'm gonna take a little break from the tests and enjoy myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" You replied before Princess Pineapple tossed something at your head. You took it off your head and realized it was Pineapple's bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the now nude Pineapple, you saw she had a lusty smile. She cooed, \"If you don't run, I'm going to have my way with you. Right here, right now. Or you could run. I might be tired enough to let you escape or I could be more aroused than before I worked out. Who knows? It's your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to swim towards you, you realized that from her tests, she pretty much was an amazon. An amazon that probably had the sex drive of three women, since she was made up of three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a good chance that sex would lead to you getting hospitalized... unless she used her healing magic.</span></div></div>",

The shapes brought it to King Koopa, who put replaced the Wand\u2019s gem with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoopa Jr. asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that, King Dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just a present to me-self for doing such an evil scheme,\u201d King Koopa giggled.<i> \u2018And now I have the power of the Chaos Heart!

Only that version looked more like Peach, save for the pink/red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped when she noticed you and said in a angry tone, \"Who are you and why do I feel like kissing you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blame The Koopa royalty and how they do whatever they want,\" you said, feeling the urge to kiss her grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Those lousy turtle wannabes! How dare they flaunt their power! Down with the Koopa king, up with anarchy!\" Punk-Toadstool ranted as she continued your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great, from a cartoon environmentalist to a parody of a punk,' You thought as you began to circle round the pipe to avoid her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon! All I want to to get a good look at you. If you're good looking enough, then I'll give you a kiss to celebrate our alliance against Koopa and anyone else dumb enough to stand against us!\" Punk-Toadstool grumbled. Eventually, she cornered you and gave you the evilest of smiles. Holding your shoulders, she said, \"Yup, you're cute enough to kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I-\" you uttered before she picked you up and pressed her lips against yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss was rather enjoyable and the way she kept fondling your body made it better. You didn't do anything at first out of fear of what she'd do the moment she was free of the hypnotism, but eventually began to fondle her right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped the kiss and said, \"Y'know, we'll need to increase our gang before we go up against Koopa. I know some Pidgits who can hypnotize anyone. Any suggestions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea came to you, making you say, \"We'd be better off getting items that can hypnotize in a flash, like wands and hypnoguns. We can raid Roboland for the hypnogun, but that'd require you to put on a dress and act like Princess Toadstool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPunk-Toadstool stuck out her tongue in disgust before saying, \"That frilly fashion disaster? Eugh! Do I have to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd also get flying cars and whatever else we can talk Dr. Nerdnick into giving 'Princess Toadstool',\" You said with an evil smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPunk-Toadstool sighed before she muttered, \"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Punk-Toadstool was driving the flying RV as you looked over the pile of inventions that Punk-Toadstool flirted out of Nerdnick. You asked, \"Did you get the hypnogun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPunk-Toadstool smiled and answered, \"Yup, and anything else that got my interest. Heh, he even upgraded the hypnogun to not only mass-hypnotize any group into punks like me, but they'll obey me! Of course, you and I are immune, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a gun that can make anyone who kisses me into a punk?\" You asked. Punk-Toadstool produced a raygun and blasted you. You glared at her and said, \"Next time, warn me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPunk-Toadstool flipped you off before she returned her attention to the sky ahead of her. You found it amusing more than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Any suggestions for our Gang?\" You asked. You did feel a bit guilty for making Princess Toadstool into your lackey via addictive kisses, but another part of you liked the idea of creating a punk-styled empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPunk-Toadstool pondered the answer for a few moments before she said...</span></div></div>",

You wait for just the right moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that moment came when Koopa let out a large laugh, opening his maw wide enough for you to make your move. Quick as a flash, you throw the shrooms into his wide open mouth, causing him to cough for a second before they kicked in. Koopa shrunk down to the height of your foot before his height stabilized. Seeing this, his minions ceased their laughter and just watched in stunned silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing you runt? I'm your master.

I'm just doing what you wanted.\" You say as you dangle the former king over the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your kingdom is now mine. Your armies are mine. I'll be a better bad guy than you ever were. By the way, don't worry about your kids. I'll raise 'em as my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoopa lets out a string of squeeky curse words at your defiance. Having no more of this, you drop him into the pit and watch as the molten liquid melts him down to the bone before there was nothing left. With him gone, you turn back to the stunned minions. \"Troops!\" You shout, snapping them out of their stupor and making them stand in attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have disposed of King Koopa, so I am your king now. I will do what that has-been never could... win! I'll beat the Mario Brothers and their fellow heroes, all the maidens of this land will be ours, not just Toadstool, and Video Game Land will be united under <b>my</b> empire.

'cute', but they are competent,\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are they? Imps? Goblins? Gremlins?\" Morrigan asked as she followed after you. Upon seeing Koopa Troopas, Goombas, and other mario enemies, she said, \"Oh.... Turtles, mushrooms, snakes, birds, Mice,and other cute things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Watch what you say! I'm a mad Bomber!\" Mouser said before tossing a cartoon bomb at the succubus. It exploded, leading her covered in soot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Morrigan cried out, getting ready to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence!\" You said in a booming voice, aided by a spell. Using another spell to clean the room and the succubus, you said,\"Morrigan, I can boost you. Allow you to feed off more than just life force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as?\" Morrigan asked, curious if you could deliver what you offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The act of sex would feed you, as being excited would do the same,\" You said, thinking, <i>'And such spells would alter your personality and body to be more like the video game version, as well as make you genuinely loyal to me.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove it,\" Morrigan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with a wave of your hands, you cast the promised upgrade spell on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan fell to her knees, letting out an orgasmic cry as she felt her body change.  She hugged herself to make her boobs look bigger as she said in a way that sounded like another orgasm was on the way, \"You... You... You... got yourself a general!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear, You said as Morrigan cried out as the changes finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up like nothing had happened and said, \"I do hope I'll be your right hand, master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Boss, Morrigan.\" You said, looking around.

You can take the bags, regardless of whether you accept my offer or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus still aimed her arm cannon at you for a few moments before lowering it. \"I'll think about it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Samus took the bags and somehow put them in some subspace her suit had before she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat on a rock and smiled. You knew there was a good chance she'd refuse, so you enchanted various missiles and energy tanks in the general area. The magic would make her more willing to accept your offer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once she would accept, you'd give her a ring that would continue to enforce the magic, even when she took off her armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later at your castle, Mouser watched as Samus's ship landed.  The ship door opened up and you and Samus left it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you really do have his forces...\" Samus muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and we can prepare a room for you,\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hnn, no. I can stay in my ship. Thanks for the ring though,\" Samus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss, Morrigan came back with someone that tried to attack her,\" Mouser said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Who?\" You asked. Depending on who it was, you might be able to bribe them.</span></div></div>",

Seeing your approach, Morrigan runs up and kneels in front of you.  \"I'm sorry boss, I was in the middle of battle with Bully Koopa and his fleet. We were just about to capture him when these pirates opened fire on us. Bully got away, but we were able to capture their captain.\" She explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Morrigan. Bully and the others will come later. For now, let's see about this pirate of yours.\" You tell her with a reassuring pat on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the cell with your new captive in it. She sat there silently as you walked up with her hands bound behind her back. \"Captain Syrup, I presume?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me. What's it to you handsome?\" She asks back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start with why you attacked my army right when they were about to claim a major victory, shall we?\" You ask as you sit in front of the bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much to say. I saw the battle and figured I could use the chaos to grab some prince or commander and sell him off for a huge ransom. So I ordered my crew to open fire on your succubus and her troops. What I didn't expect was for the other guys to turn tail and run the second we started shooting. In the end, they got away and I got caught. That's about all there is to it.\" She explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear her tale and soak in her words. \"So tell me Syrup, if you had command of a larger fleet, better troops, and clearer incentive, would you have done any better?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, I mean, I guess so. I've only ever had the one ship and my men, and I only work for treasure or ransom.\" She replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss, you are seriously...?\" Morrigan starts before you cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have confidence in her skills. So Syrup, I'm giving you a choice. You can either join me as my third and final general, where I can promise you vast rewards and power. Or, you can sit in this cell and rot for the reminder of your days. Your choice.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that even a choice? Of course I'll join. Heck, promise treasure and I'll join without this whole bondage foreplay.\" She tells you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I trust that you'll give me your absolute loyalty?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you keep the gold coming, I'll give you everything I have.\" She answers. You motion for the guards to open her cell and uncuff her. She rises to meet your eye. \"Deal?\" She asks with outstretched hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" You meet her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

Cheatsy, I'm putting you under Syrup's direct command on the doomship fleet. I figure you two can work well together, and she seems to have no problem working with you.\" You order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course King dad.\" He says before getting up and walking over to his new captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just 'dad' will do, that goes for all of you. Next, Kooky. You are going to remain here at the castle as head of R&amp;D. You will develop new weapons using any new tech we acquire combined with our own and will only deploy when I tell you. Can I trust you to handle that?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dad. I won't disappoint.\" He replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would hope not. Kootie Pie, you're next. I want you to build a castle along the border to the mushroom kingdom. You'll be using it to keep an eye on them, and as a bonus, you get to keep the castle as your own.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see a glimmer in her eyes. \"My... my own castle?! All King Koopa ever gave me was my doomship and the occasional fort to stop the Mario Brothers, which never lasted long. Th-thank you daddy.\" She says before running up to hug you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome my little princess.\" You tell her as you pat her on the head and motion for her to get back in line with her brothers. \"Big Mouth, your turn. I'm having you go to Ganon's old territory and take charge in my stead. You'll also be in charge of keeping an eye on Hyrule and it's business and report it to me.\" You tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course father. I shall not fail you. Hyrule will not even sneeze without you knowing it. They shall live in fear of me being over their shoulder. They will...\" Bully goes to smack him again, but a glare from you both stops him as well as silences Big Mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, and Bully, since you were so polite as to raise your hand, I suppose I'll assign you next. You are going to be training the new recruits so they are battle ready. Understood?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Koopa in question quickly lowers his hand in panic. \"Y-yes dad. I can handle that.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Toughen them up, but don't abuse them.\" You order before addressing all of them. \"And that goes for all of you. The troops and citizens of my kingdom are not to be mistreated. Am I clear?\" You ask, getting nods from everyone, your generals included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Hip, Hop, you two are up. Since you're both young, I feel wrong putting you in combat, but I have confidence in you both. That's why I want you to fight alongside Morrigan and her forces. She can better teach you about magic and the world in general.\" You tell them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth twins agree and they go to stand next to the succubus like Cheatsy with Syrup. \"And what about me papa?\" Jr. asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, I wish to personally teach about leadership. So, you will be stationed here like Kooky, only your task will to be my student.\" You tell him. \"I hope you can learn from me and grow into a strong ruler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

What's our next matter of business?\" Morrigan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever hear of the Salad Kingdom?\" You asked, getting looks of confusion from almost everyone in the room. You had played <i>Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom</i> a few times when you were younger and were fond of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Syrup was the first to speak up, \"It's a kingdom where most of the inhabitants are vegetable people, though one of the princesses is a human and a group of thugs called farmies are also human. You plan on taking that over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"In a month or so, after everyone gets used to the changes I've done. As for Salad Kingdom, most of the combat is between the people there is done via Rock-paper-scissors and they all are honorable to obey the winner's single demand. So I'll send in Captain Syrup, Cheatsy, their crew, and a few squads, but I'll make sure to grant you all magic items that will let you read their minds, just to insure you win easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... any thoughts at <i>who </i>you'll put in charge of that?\" Cheatsy asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm kinda interested too, dad, since it'll be my students that'll be in those squads,\" Bully asked, trying to look tough by crossing his arms. He also looked quiet interested in the answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't, but it depends on how well it is conquered and how willing the people obey  and like us. I don't want to wind up like Minister Pumpkin and get overthrown by a Cucumber Knight in a matter of days,\" You said. \"I know they had giant robots, but I'm pretty sure they've been destroyed. Therefore the remains of those Giant robots should be of importance and brought to Kooky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, dad? Thank you!\" Kooky replied with a bow. \"I'll be sure to make the grandest giant robot ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be happy with one that's best described as 'boring but practical', Kooky. No need to get extravagant,\" You replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to hav'a deal with Eggplant Wizard?\" Hip asked. Hop then asked, \"Cause he's friends with King Hippo and he looks tough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I doubt he will. He's too busy serving Mother Brain, fighting Captain N and Princess Lana,\" Samus answered. \"But just in case... I suggest letting me tag along in my ship in stealth mode. I can handle anything Mother Brain throws at them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that does sound like a good idea, Samus. We'll do that,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about us?\" Morrigan asked, gesturing to Hip Hop, and a few magikoopas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scout Cornelia in the Final Fantasy worlds. See what items, spells, and anything else you can find and bring here,\" You replied. \"Recruit who is willing. Avoid fighting heroes, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan nodded.</span></div></div>",

When Mouser gulped in fear, you said, \"But as long as we're diplomatic and polite, we'll live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nY-yeah... Good thing you're the leader...\" Mouser replied nervously. \"King Koopa would have thrown his weight around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's be a tossup of if he fell to the underworld by Palutena's will or because he crashed his way there,\" You replied with a grin, getting a chuckle from Mouser. \"And before you ask, you may keep your distance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouser sighed with relief, \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised to see that Palutena was pretty chill for being in a dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hello! Are you the interrogator or the leader?\" Palutena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Alex and I am the leader. Why did you attack Morrigan?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was the only way I could get here with her,\" Palutena answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... doesn't make sense,\" You muttered. \"You could have simply asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, but you know how the forces of light and darkness act towards each other, right?\" Palutena replied cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Violently?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! It's mostly the followers that attack on-sight, but the leaders do sometimes let their emotions control them,\" Palutena sighed. Quickly cheering up, she asked, \"Can I be let out if I promise not to attack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay, and if you're near me, I'll prevent Morrigan from attacking you, as she is one of my generals,\" you said as you unlocked the cell door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? She's a general of yours? Do you have any other generals?\" Palutena innocently asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samus Aran...\" You replied, wondering if she either was crazy, trying something, or really was as innocent as she seemed to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, she's normally all business, but working with Kevin Keen and Princess Lana did make her open up to the idea of working with others. Maybe you'll be the lucky guy who marries her?\" Palutena commented, wining at the last statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you want to come here?\" You asked as you led her out of the dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out, you just led her around. Statues of King Koopa were taken down and replaced by either statues of you or of some notable minions, flowers to spruce things up, or benches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't like how the other rulers of Video Game Land distrust you, simply because of a few pictures that I'm pretty sure are fake. So I told them that I'd prevent you from being too bad, as you are still a human and thus will get my protection,\" Palutena answered. \"So I can be a hostage to prevent the others from attacking you, as I let the other rulers I would be trying this... Or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can become one of your generals! Since you're not a mean and evil person, it sounds like fun! It's been so long since I did anything other than be a goddess or a ruler. Sure there's potion brewing or researching, but those are hobbies!\" Palutena answered.</span></div></div>",

SHE... doing out of her cell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind the two of you, was Morrigan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith as an authorative voice as you could muster, you said, \"You are not to attack her unless she or her forces attack first, Morrigan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointing at Palutena, Morrigan growled, \"She is a goddess! A goddess of light! She will be detrimental to your cause!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She gave her word she won't attack and she offered to become one of my generals,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me that you refused her...\" Morrigan pleaded, giving a brief glare to the goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She offered and I let her. It's a good way for me to make sure I'm making good decisions. A sexy demon on one shoulder and an attractive goddess on the other, both offering advice. I believe I have made a good decision,\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalutena hugged one of your arms and cooed, \"And I agree!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan quickly hugged your other arm and glared at Palutena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resisted the urge to sigh, thinking, <i>'Why couldn't you be more like your video game self, Cartoon-Morrigan? She'd be amused by the idea of working with a goddess and probably plan on either having sex with her or corrupting her...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is your next plan?\"  Palutena asked, finding Morrigan's action amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a meeting between the rulers of Video game land?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, in about two weeks,\" Palutena answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two question. Can you sneak Morrigan into that meeting, Palutena?\" You asked the goddess as you looked at her. Then you looked at Morrigan and asked, \"Morrigan, can you hypnotize women or put in a command to be hypnotized if they hear a codeword from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan looked at you and cheerful said, \"Yes, I can make women into servants with my hypnotic eyes and can easily do the second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Palutena and she answered, \"Yes, I can. Either I can disguise her in servant's garb or... She can go in my form and wear my clothes! My garb can hide her demonic energy from any detectors and I can make a tiny version of myself to give her advice on how to pretend to be like me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go as your servant? Go as YOU!? You are a mad goddess!\" Morrigan growled as she lept away from you, readying herself for a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did note that both beauties did kind of look alike, especially with their green hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morrigan, calm down,\" You said. It took a moment, but Morrigan did so. You looked towards Palutena and asked, \"Any complaints about Morrigan hypnotizing Toadstool or Zelda into my servants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Servants? As in just servants or sex slaves?\" Palutena asked, tilting her head a little and had a wondering tone to her voice. \"And why not hypnotized brides?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if they're hypnotized servants and sign their kingdoms over to me, they'll still have their virginity and such. I may be evil, but I still have standards,\" You answered. \"As for marriage, I don't want any kids to be in a loveless and hateful relationship, even if I think the would-be mothers deserve to be in one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Palutena said something that really surprised Morrigan and you, to the point that both your jaws dropped. \"Really? Princess Zelda has one delightful derriere, while I'd like to see Toadstool give you a blowjob with those lovely lips of hers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shaking your head a little to get back in the game, you replied, \"Hypnotizing wears off, Palutena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not unless Morrigan and I both work together to re-write their minds! That would make it permanent!\" Palutena cheerful answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'And I thought Morrigan might be the darkest and evilest Ally I would have. Palutena's either testing me or there's something I don't know,' </i>You thought as you stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan spoke up first, \"Why suggest such a treatment for your previous allies? Is this a test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting you go and raising her hands in placating manner, Palutena said, \"Oh, it's because I believe in Alex's vision. Besides, Toadstool needs to realize that not all who worked for King Koopa are evil and Zelda's been a horrible tsundere towards more than just Link nowadays. Despite my power, both have been trying to push me out of our alliance, or at least try to reduce how much say I have. So... I want to both get revenge and help our leader, Alex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made a decision.</span></div></div>",

But Lady Palutena, he is with the forces of darkness, he stole holy arrows from Skyworld, he even has a demon concubine. Why would you serve him? When does a goddess even serve a king?\" He asks in a hyperactive manner. You and Morrigan both blush a tad at her being so bluntly referred to as a concubine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was forced to join the forces of darkness and is making the best of it. The arrows he took went to the slaying of Ganon, a feat Zelda and Link could only hope to achieve. That 'concubine' is Morrigan, one of his generals. A goddess can serve if she so chooses, however unusual it may sound, and I choose to serve Alex out of faith in his ideals.\" She answers him in a nonchalant tone, as if she was expecting these questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ideals could he have that could drive a goddess of light to serve a king of darkness?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain it later. For now, know that I answer to him, so you do by extension.\" She orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" He says before walking up to you, much to Morrigan's displeasure as she clutches your arm tighter. \"Hello, I am Pit, servant of the goddess of light and her captain of the guard.\" He says with a kneel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle a bit. \"I am Alex, new ruler of the Koopa Kingdom and soon all of Video Game Land. Rise Pit, there's no need to be so formal with me.\" You tell him as he stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summoned Pit here as a sign of faith. Until my centurions arrive in force, he will be my representative in your armies.

Pit gives her a concerned look at the mention of kidnapping, but a warm look from Palutena puts him at ease. \"Now come on, we need to find Samus and tell her the plan.\" You lead them out of the room and out to Samus' ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boss.

Thus, they'd fall under Morrigan's hypnotic eyes and then later Palutena will finish the job later,\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan smiled for a moment before realizing she'd be wearing the garb of a goddess and shuttered. \"Do you realize what you're asking of me? Her remnant power in her clothes might corrupt me! It's holy energy from Heaven!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalutena chuckled before she said, \"Goddess or demon, we get our power from the same source. It's affected by our actions and desires. It won't effect you, just hide your aura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan glared and was about to say something, but you asked with a stern tone, \"Morrigan, can you mimic Palutena?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan took a deep breath and shimmered for a moment. All of a sudden, she looked like Palutena, save for being in Morrigan's clothes. Then she spoke in Palutena's voice, \"Does this answer your question, Boss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalutena clasped her hands and happily said, \"Ah! Such skill! I could have used you to avoid those boring meetings about 'what land could be used as a go-kart race track' or 'what place could be used to host a fair'... Though that last one can lead to some fun... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are quite talented, Morrigan, Will wearing Palutena's clothes effect your eyes?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, but let's check,\" Morrigan cooed before she began to disrobe, still looking like Palutena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Not in front of them while you look like me!\" Palutena cried before grabbing Morrigan and dragging her to a nearby room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou uttered, \"Huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at Pit, you saw that he still looked quite uncomfortable with everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, The two walked out. If it wasn't for the expression of their eyes and body language, you would have sworn they just waited in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the one in Goddess Robes who sported a glare and had her shoulder's slumping, you said, \"You need to work on those eyes, Morrigan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one in Morrigan's clothes said, \"And you do need to learn the poise of a goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan sent a glare ar Palutena for a moment before she adjusted her posture and spoke, \"I am a succubus, I can use anyone's appearance with a glance and can mimic their posture with a glance. I just need political details as I cannot read minds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit gritted his teeth, as he once dealt with both a fake Palutena and a mind-controlled one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded before you said, \"I'm quite interested in those political details as well, since I will be ruling Video Game Land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be happy to tell you and let you look over the decrees I've been sent, Boss,\"Palutena said. She then looked at Pit and had a naughty urge come over her. She spun around a little, wiggled her butt at Pit, and asked, \"How do I look, Pit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You... You... Gah, this is too weird!\" Pit uttered, covering his eyes, blushing, and looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, still got it,\" Palutena chuckled.</span></div></div>",

Some of the things they demanded from her were insane. Toadstool actually demanded Palutena to allow her Toad engineers to construct a race track in her temple, going right through her own bedroom, and if Palutena declined then it would be a breach of the alliance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was worse. She wanted Palutena to request the goddess of nature Viridi, whom Palutena is at war with, to let down a massive rainstorm on Hyrule, not to water crops or fill a reservoir, but to fill up the royal wayer park. And again, if Palutena said no, then it was a breach of the alliance. It's like they weren't even hiding the fact that they were forcing her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese issues, among others, were to be discussed at this summit. Palutena then told you of some of her requests in the past. Once, while she was at war with Hades, she requested the pair of them to use their influence to tell the people that they were being tricked about a fake wish. They refused, saying that they had more important issues to deal with. And you were supposed to be the bad guy here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two weeks of practice, Morrigan had everything down pat. The look, the mannerisms, right down to the way she looked you in the eye, a look Zelda and Toadstool will soon be acquainted with. You recieved no word from Samus on the Koopaling hunt, but you're sure she's fine. You just need to focus on this meeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready for this?\" You ask Morrigan in her Palutena disguise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes boss. I can pass as a better Palutena than Palutena.\" She boasts, making the goddess of light roll her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riight. Just remember the plan. You get in there and start talking. Make things heated enough to get them to stare you in the eye so you can use your powers. With them under your control, contact me via telepathy and we'll approach the castle under the guise of surrender terms from the Koopa Kingdom. You use Toadstool to allow us entrance, then we come up, and you and I use our powers to rewrite them into the boss' servants. After that, they'll officially sign their respective kingdoms over to us. Then we'll be that much closer to peace.\" Palutena rants, currently dressed like Morrigan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right right. Don't worry, I won't let the boss down.\" Morrigan says with a wink to you before heading towards Toadstool's castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think she can handle this?\" Palutena asks once she's out of earshot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have confidence in her.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Palutena gets a telepathic message from Morrigan. \"It's time.\"</span></div></div>",

One mushroom guard asked, \"Halt! Who goes there!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The current ruler of the Koopa Kingdom. I wish to discuss the terms of surrender with Princess Toadstool, Princess  Zelda, and Princess Lana,\" You said with a kind smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Lana is not here at the moment, but those other two are,\" A Hylian guard replied. \"Where's King Koopa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had an unexpected fatal Lava trip and I was thrust into command,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go ask if they want to meet you. Stay there,\" A mushroom guard loudly said before walking inside the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, '<i>Palutena</i>' Princess Zelda, and Princess Toadstool walked out. The princesses were behind '<i>Palutena</i>', using her as a shield if something happened. Zelda looked somewhere between her cartoon incarnation and her Ocarina of time version, While Toadstool looked like a more attractive version of her cartoon version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're here to discuss some terms of surrender with us?\" Zelda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, me and my general wish to talk about them. Shall we talk here or inside?\" You asked, tilting your head a little to look a bit more silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside would be alright,\" Toadstool said, knowing there were plenty of guards that would come running if she cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalutena spoke in an husky voice\"I do have to ask, will there be any food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Zelda and Toadstool glared at the disguised Goddess, who did her half of the brainwashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour innocently-seeming smile gained a slightly evil edge as you watched the two princesses's expression go from egotistically angry to subserviently calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is fresh fruit,\" Toadstool said in a voice that was getting less angry as she spoke. \"Follow us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Palutena followed the Trio, the goddess thought, <i>'I hope Alex doesn't mind me and Morrigan having a bit of fun with Zelda and Toadstool. I certainly deserve some time with them on MY terms...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the meeting room, you saw it was elegantly decorated, celebrating heroes from the Mushroom Kingdom, Hyrule, a number of animal mascots, and even ones from Angel Land. You guessed the castle and the room was designed before Zelda and Toadstool were getting uppity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was wondering if the terms on this were fair for Hyrule, the Mushroom Kingdom, Angel Land, and the Koopa Kingdom?\" You asked as you handed a rather wordy contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Palutena</i>', Zelda, and Toadstool all looked the contract over for about a half hour. Zelda and Toadstool signed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Palutena? Aren't you going to sign it?\" Zelda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I will,\" '<i>Palutena</i>' said as the real Palutena signed it. The guards gasped when Palutena pulled back the hood of her cloak and revealed her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now I am the ruler of the Koopa Kingdom, The Mushroom Kingdom, and Hyrule,\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! I thought you were surrendering the Koopa Kingdom to Hyrule and the Mushroom Kingdom!?\" A Mushroom Guard exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the terms were fair. He is now the ruler, while we act in his will,\" Toadstool answered as you all stood up and headed to the window. \"So, everything is essentially the same, but we now have to answer to someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda added, \"And if we decide to, we can renounce our royal powers. We'd get a Stipend and live peacefully wherever we wanted. It would mean that he would have to send someone else to rule our kingdoms, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Toadstool and Zelda gasped as you gave their rears a quick grope. Their butts did feel quite nice They looked at you, not in anger, but seemingly expecting more and blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Morrigan and Palutena, they seemed... quite pleased with their work.</span></div></div>",

I won't be able to get the replacements for the destroyed parts for some time. Even then, I'll have to calibrate all of it to prevent it from exploding again.

Mine Dr. Wily's right hand man,\" Mega Man muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to say this, but in the main video games, Protoman was created by Dr. Light, and is ally to Mega Man and is one who is as sentient and emotional as any human, but it's because  a problem with his energy core. It provides him with much more energy and the the other stuff I mentioned, but it also had critical problem that would eventually make him stop functioning... until Dr. Wily repaired it in a way that let Protoman keep his independence,\" You ansswed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Wily? Why not me? I mean the other me,\" Dr. Light asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that Protoman was worried that you repairing him would take away his freedom to choose. He only went to Dr. Wily because he was desperate and having problems staying functional,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how awesome am I?\" Roll asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You're pretty much the awesome version of yourself. In the main video game canon, all the robots look like they're like 11 or so and are pretty innocent-minded and are pretty robotic in their thinking, save for Protoman and Duo. The video game Roll tends to be something of an assistant to Dr. Light and a cheerleader for Mega Man,\" You answered. Roll looked pretty disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is Duo? A robot I built?\" Dr. Light asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A robot from Outer space who is fighting something that can be best described as 'evil energy',\" You answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what else can you tell us?\" Mega Man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever think of making a new transformation for Rush? Maybe he can change into powered armor? Maybe a flying armor or an armor that heavily increases punching power? Perhaps a suit that can do both?\" You suggested. \"And make it so that Rush can become armor for both Mega Man and Roll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Light rubbed his chin as he pondered your words. \"It does sound like useful. Making it for Mega Man would be easier, but allowing Roll to fight on an equal level with Wily's robot Masters is a good idea. Roll, care to help me make the changes to Rush?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll cheered up and saluted as she said, \"I'm glad to help, Doc!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Mega Man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said, \"Ah, a family project. I'm glad to have started the ball rolling. It's always heartwarming to see a family get along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Light, Mega Man, and Roll all smiled at you before Dr. Light said, \"You can still help us. Do you have any skill with programming, soldering, or welding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit, but I'm probably better off being a go-fer for you all.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Light nodded.</span></div></div>",

It's getting rather late and I know the both of you need to recharge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll stretched as she said, \"Yeah, I think good rest is what we all need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did your best to hide the fact your eyes were drawn to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMega Man said, \"That's the best idea I've heard so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah, yeah yeah yeah!\" Rush said, or at least his head, as he was in pieces as he was being worked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Light looked towards you and said, \"We do have a guest room, but it's a bit dusty. Will that be alright, Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, then. Let's get Rush back together. We'll finish him in the morning,\" Dr. Light ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you were woken up by Eddie. He said, \"Wake up, Will! Dr. Light asked that you be awake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up, I'm up,\" you replied as you rubbed the sand out of your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, you were at the breakfast table, eating pancakes and eggs. So was Dr. Light. Mega Man, Roll, Rush, and Eddie were drinking cans of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... How close are you to completing Rush's new form?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty close, just some final touches and doublechecks. I think we can have tests started within two hours,\" Dr. Light answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to Roll and asked, \"So... Any good Martial Arts movies playing nearby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll's eyes lit up. \"Sure! There's a Bruce Lee Marathon at the movieplex in the Mall in three hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to go, then,\" You replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's a date!\" Roll cheerfully said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMega Man couldn't help but tease, \"A date-date? You two gonna get a meal afterwords?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just seeing a few movies, Mega. It's not an actual date...\" Rol said with annoyance in her voice. After pondering Mega Man's words and asked you, \"Alex, would you have any problems if we did... date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None. You're a cute lady who can stand up and defend herself. Any one would want to date someone like you,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll smiled. If she could blush, she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hn...\" Dr. Light uttered, concentrating on his breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Uh oh. protective father mode activated...'</i> You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Rush, Mega Man, and Roll were standing at one end of the Lab together. You and Dr. Light were standing at the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Light said, \"Alright. Rush. change into the Super Adapter armor with Mega Man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, Yup!\" Rush uttered before he began to glow and leap at Mega Man. A moment later, Mega Man's blue armor was red. His lower arms were bigger and there were two flat circular objects on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel, Mega Man?\" Dr. Light asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Powerful!\" Mega Man answered, flexing a little bit. \"Let's test out the flight option!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe circle objects shot out flames and let Mega Man fly around the room for a bit before he landed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as maneuverable as the Rush jet, but this is a form for power after all. Now go to the lifting machine and we'll test your strength,\" Dr. Light answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMega Man went to what looked like a device that had a barbell and lifted it up. Dr. Light slowly spun a dial. After a few minutes, Dr. Light stopped and said, \"Well, you're as strong as Gutsman, if not more so, Mega Man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it feels like I can take more!\" Mega Man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to lower the weight now, so we can let Roll try out the Super Adapter armor,\" Dr. Light said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so, Dr. Light,\" Mega Man replied as Dr. Light turned the Dial back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the dial was back to the original setting, Mega Man let go of the barbell and took a few steps back. Rush then transformed back to his normal self and leapt away from Mega Man, returning the Blue bomber back to his normal form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rush changed into the Super Adapter Armor on Roll, her armored form looked like the Hyper Roll form from Marvel Vs Capcom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's try your flight option, Roll,\" Dr. Light said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jets came from her back, but from some object you couldn't quite see She seemed faster than Mega Man, but her control was looser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the weight lifting,\" Dr. Light said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, Doc!\" Roll said as she landed. As she held the barbells and Dr. Light turned the dial, Roll said, \"A gal could get used to this power...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As nice as it is, it is emergency use only, Roll,\" Dr. Light said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, Right...\" Roll muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=== <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the tests, Mega Man and Rush went to the lab to give Rush a few energy biscuits and Roll went to her room to get the money for the tickets, Dr. Light motioned for you to follow him outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside, Dr. Light looked towards the forest and said, \"I understand you and Roll are going to see a few movies. I also remember that you complemented her on her beauty. I guess I see Mega Man and Roll as something as my children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments passed of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know where this is going. I promise that I'll let Roll set the limits and that I won't do anything that will make her feel uncomfortable,\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. But keep in mind to let her know if she makes you feel uncomfortable, as she is still new to the world and I don't want her to become something she'll regret later.\" Dr. Light replied. \"Now, I think you and Roll have a few movies to go to.\"</span></div></div>",

When he turned 18, he finally was able to buy hentai and H games. Over the next two years he collected a huge variety of Hentai and H games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis favorite H game being the hentai JRPG Dragon Knight. The games was about a wondering perverted hero Takeru, also ready to save a damsel in undress and get a photo of their naked body too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just got the Dragon Knight anime, he was in his bedroom of his little apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the DVD in his player. He was about to start getting relax, when the title appeared. He grinned, ready for hot and sexy fun. Then the imagine on the TV started flicking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped neither his TV or DVD player where going. He walked up to the TV, when suddenly a green vortex appeared in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante was quickly sucked into the vortex, as he went through the vortex he heard a feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Are you ready hero, to save the female city of Strawberries Fields. \" Said the Voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante was confuse, what was going on he shouted. After a minute he landed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groan in pain, as he slowly picked himself up. He dusted himself off, it took a few moments to get his bearings. Then he realized he wasn't in his apartment, no he was outside the gates of medieval looking city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was night, but it seems to be summer where ever he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dante looked around, suddenly four beautiful women, wearing skimpy and sexy bikini armor surrounded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Freeze!!\" Shouted one of the guards. Dante quickly put his hands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards asked him who he was and why was he here. Dante told them his name,and he didn't know how he got here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four guards escorted him into the city and to the castle in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante was brought in front of the queen, Dante was stunned. The queen was beautiful, with long blonde hair and blue eyes. She had a body that kills with large F cup breasts. She was wearing a light blue gown that left little to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Guard who is this man and why is he here ?\" Asked the Queen, the guard said his name is Dante and he claim he didn't know how he got her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Through him into the dungeon.\" Said the Queen, Dante was scared now. He was about to started crying when a glorious woman ran into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just as killer body as the queen, but she had long pink hair and green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wait my queen, this is the hero of Legend.\" Said the pink hair woman. Dante was confuse the hero of Legend. Then it hit him, he was in Dragon Knight, and some how he was in the place of Takeru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he was terrified, why was he here, how did he get here, and then remembering all the monster Takeru has to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he remember all the beautiful women Takeru had to have sex with, and all the photo he takes. Dante smirked, this could be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Luna, you sure this man is the legendary hero ?\" Asked the Queen, Luna nodded and said she got a vision from the goddess about this man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Fine, Dante if you defeat the evil in the goddess's tower, free the all the trapped slave and free my city from the evil. I will give you anything you desires.\" Said the Queen, Dante's heart wasn't doing the desiring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe agreed, Dante was give some armor and a sword. The. He was escorted out of the city, Luna come with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happen next ?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was snapped out if his fantasies by the screams for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante stared running, he could tell the screams where from a girl. Soon he found the girls, she was surrounded by three lizard monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante looked at the girl, she was on her knees, holding what was left of her clothes. It took a few moments but Dante recognized her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brown skin, with cat ears and tail in the colors of a white tiger. Her light green eyes and bright pink hair, with E cup breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Pink from Dragon Pink, Dante wondered how she was here. He stopped wondering when Pink let out another screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante pulled out his sword and charged the lizard monsters, he made quickly work of the monster. The monster's bodies dissolved into three bags. Dante smiled, must be his loot. He couldn't wait to see what he got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Pink, the catslave was crying her eyes out. Dante bended down and hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Stopped crying beautiful, your safe now.\" Said Dante, as he panted Pink's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Luna caught up, <br>\r\n\" Dante are you OK ?\" Asked Luna, Wanted said he was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, he helped Pink up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So what's your name and how did you got here ?\" Asked Dante, he was still curious as to why Pink was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPink stopped crying and told the two her story. She, her master Santa, Bobo and Pierce where traveling to the tower, to stopped the evil and free Strawberries Fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they where attacked by monster, Santa said to run. She tripped on some roots, she screamed for Santa to save her. He yelled sorry and he would come back for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe, Bobo and Pierce just left her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante sighed, he hated how Santa treated Pink in the manga/ OVA. Pink was such a nice and sweet girl, and yet Santa treated like dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dreamed of recusing her and making her his catslave. He got an idea, he hoped it work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Pink, this Santa is such a horrible master. Why don't you just leave him.\" Said Dante, smiling at Pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPink just lower her head, <br>\r\n\" I'm just a lowly catslave, who would want me.\" Said Pink, as she began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante smiled at her and started caressing her cheek. \" I would love to have such a beautiful catgirl with me.\" Said Dante, not wanting to called her a slave. Pink was so much more slave, she was a brave and caring girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPink blushed hearing those words from Dante, Santa had never said something so nice to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanta had only treated like a slave, he used her as bait, sold her several times, used her to paid off his debt and many other means things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was time to leave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante saw the confuse looked on Pink's face, no it was time to strike. He pulled Pink into a kiss, this shocked Pink. Causing her to dropped her shredded clothing, leaving her only in her white tiger skin collar with bell and purple boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter kissing for a minute, Dante looked into Pink's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" OK, Dante I will join you.\" Said Pink, he smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante blushed, seeing Pink completely naked. Pink realized she was naked and tried to cover herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanta had all her things, she wished she had some clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante went over to the bags, he hoped he could fine something for Pink to wear. The first bag had some gold coins in it, the next had a few healing potions. Then Dante check the last one, he smiled as he pulled out a gold and white tiger skin slave bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave the clothes to Pink, she said thanks. She put on the slave bikini.<br>\r\nShe grabbed Dante's arm and put it between her massive breasts. Dante blushed and smile at Pink, as the three headed towards the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna was a little jealous of Pink, she had a crush on Dante but didn't have the courage to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happen next ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why Santa and Bobo started walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was ambush by some monster, they was injured in the attack, but was able to destroyed them with her magic. Then she crawled under the tree, until she was able to travel again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Do you want to come with us ?\" Asked Dante, hoping she said yes.

They got ambush a large group of monster, but the important part was she wanted to go back and save her. Not like Santa or Bobo, she was kick Santa so hard in his balls if she ever see him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPierce looked at Dante and blushed, he did look cute Pierce thought.
