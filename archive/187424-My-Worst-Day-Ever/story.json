It is Friday the 13th and you have just gotten an F on the History test that you studied for for a total of 3 hours!!  You walk home and immediately trip, landing in a pile of mud.  You enter your house(after cleaning yourself up) and greet your mom with a kiss on her cheek.  \"Greg, I heard about your History test grade, and I am sorry, but you have to make up for it by going to the grocery store for me,\" she says as you grab a Coke.  You roll your eyes and leave right away, slamming the door behind you.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n  At the store, you are buying the usual when you spot your girlfriend, Dana, grabbing some bread.  You start walking toward her when suddenly a white light goes off, completely blinding you.  When everything clears, you see Dana, only she is towering above you!!  You look around and find yourself to be at least 2 inches tall.  You duck behind an aisle shelf.  Come one think...what do you do?\r<br>\n\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Dana's humming invaded the room and your ears, an oblivious song to the air.  You crawl into the purse hastily, a careless dive which results in a bleeding palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even feel pain in your hand, Dana stands and lifts the purse, you are flung over a make-up kit and onto a pack of tissues suddenly.  Your weight increases; the purse is swinging around Dana's shoulder swiftly.  Settled, you tear off a strip of tissue and wrap it around your bleeding hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg,\" Dana calls abruptly. \"You didn't run off already?\" The purse rocks and jerks as it impacts something beyond the cavern walls.  You hear Dana shuffling about, moving papers, and pillows, and you think a lamp may have been slid around, but soon enough light pervaded your secret cave.  Dana is looking down and scanning the purse, you try to hide yourself and your cut hand.  \"Oh, Greg,\" smiled Dana with relief.  \"Come on now.  Were you trying to stow away in my purse again?\"</span></div></div>",
