The two of them had decided to venture back to Kanto together, and crash at Ash's house for a while. They both agreed happily to the idea. Brock had already left for Kanto - there was urgent business for him to attend to at the Pewter City Gym, so he left on a ferry from Sunyshore City. Ash and Dawn had decided that before they went to Kanto, they would go see Dawn's mom and Professor Rowan and say their goodbyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, along the way, Dawn caught a shiny object in the corner of her eye. \"Ash, what's that?\" She said, pointing to it. She ran into the bushes to pick it up, and emerged with a glowing yellow stone. \"It's so pretty!\" She exclaimed. \"I wonder how much it would be worth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as it is pretty,\" Ash replied, \"I don't like the look of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not that, it just seems... odd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh walks over to Dawn and places his hand on the rock. Much to their surprise, the stone emits beams of light from all sides. \"What's going on?\" Dawn asks amidst all the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, something strange happens...  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No matter how hard they tried, they were unable to pull themselves away from eachother and kept on melding into one body. After a few seconds, the light from the stone faded and fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Dawn were officially creeped out. They looked down, through the one face, and screamed in horror. The body not only had a set of D-cup breasts, but a penis aswell. The hips were that of a man's, as were the legs, covered in menacing hair, but the shoulders were unbroadened and the arms were skinny and lanky. The face of this body shared traits from both Ash and Dawn; it had Dawn's mouth, but Ash's nose and eyes. Dawn's hair was on top, however it was now fully black like Ash's, and although she still had her hat and hair accessories, they were all the colour of Ash's cap. They also wore Dawn's scarf, shirt and skirt, however for some reason they also wore Ash's jeans and shoes. To the normal passer-by, they would have looked more like a girl than anything - albeit a poorly dressed one at that - but inside, and under the underpants, they were of two genders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God,\" They spoke, realising both their voices were present and saying the same thing. \"What happened to us?\" They stopped and thought, clearly in shock. \"We can't go out like this! We'll look like freaks! we need to undress, and get some of this stuff.\" But it was to no avail, as the clothes were magically stuck on them, and they were unable to take anything off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God, we can't be stuck like this forever!\" They cried.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was not there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\" asked Dawn and Ash, tears forming in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to relax and wait.\" they replied. \"If we go looking for the professor, we will be spotted for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Professor Rowan entered his office and let out a loud gasp upon seeing the fused form of Ash and Dawn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My God!\" he yelled. \"Ash! Dawn! What happened to you two!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know its us?\" asked Dash in his/her combined voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Rowan nodded. \"I can tell by the way you two smell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash took a step back. \"The way we what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn uses only one type of perfume and Ash only uses one type of deodorant. But never mind that. What happened to you two!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash showed professor Rowen the rock and explained what had happened.  When he/she finished, Rowen nodded in understanding. \"You two found a Tgos (Tea-goss)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Tgos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trans-Gender Ora Stone.\" replied Rowen. \"It transforms anyone who touches it into almost anything, depending upon what they are thinking at the time.  Also, the longer you hold the rock, the greater the chances of you changing again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how do we separate?\" asked Ash and Dawn, in their combined voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowen shrugged. \"What were you two thinking when you touched the rock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wished Ash could see my reasoning.\" he/she replied then said, \"I wished Dawn could see my reasoning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, try to understand the other's logic and you should separate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash closed his eyes, trying his best to to as Professor rowen suggested.  Then, a blinding light filled the office.  When the light faded, they found that they had separated but something else had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And with you now a undiscovered Pokemon, it is my duty to run a number of tests to see what makes a Neko Pokemon tick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of tests?\" asked Dawn, nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you have nothing to worry about it, Dawn.\" replied Rowen. he turned to Ash, who was already frightened. \"Neither do you Ash.  You see, because I know you were someone I knew, I will sedate you when I run the tests so you won't feel a thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then opens a drawer and pulls out a needle, filled with a clear liquid. \"The sooner we start, the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh backs away frightened, Dawn tries to stand between you and the professor but he gently moves her aside and corners you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing to be afraid of, Ash.\" he said. \"It's just a sedative.

Her hair turned from black to a light brown as she felt an itching in her head.

At the same time, she shrank in size until her skirt fell off of her, revealing her panties. She pulled off her sweater, now way too big for her, revealing her new look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://hotanimegirl.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/catgirl2.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://hotanimegirl.files.wordpress.com/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformation ended and Professor rowen was now looking at two Neko Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you even think about it, professor!\" screamed Dawn. \"I am n-Neka!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slapped a hand over her mouth as she realized that she was no longer able to speak English!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here, Dawn!\" yelled Ash, in her new language. \"We HAVE to get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn did not hesitate, they dodged the professor's attempt to capture them and jumped out the window with Pickachew close behind and ran out into the wild.

Did they get affected as well?\" Upon calling them out a massive sigh of relief came from them but they noticed something weird about pikachu. Yes it evolved but the way it looked was strange because it looked like an entirely different Pokemon. \"What happened to you?\" The newly evolved Pokemon spoke and surprised Alex by actually talking in the human tongue, \"I have no idea but I can see that somehow the two of you fused. It seems during that time I evolved but into a form I was not expecting. Yes I am a Raichu but apparently a mutant form of it. I've discovered that somehow I'm now able to see auras and I can actually control my projectile attacks with my mind for some reason. Hmm since you are in one body now that is both genders you will need a new name, I got it! Alex! Its a name which is one of the few gender neutral names out there.\" The now named Alex said, \"I like that name though to be honest speaking like I have voices at once is strange and weird because it makes me sound like I am echoing all the time.\" Just then Dextette registered the new Raichu and had different info than expectes. It said this: Alolan Raichu, a electric Psychic type Pokemon. This new version of Raichu sadly has no info on it. \"Makes sense that it would say that. Hmm better call Professor Oak and tell him what happened. Good thing there is a phone with the function where both ends can see each other over there.\" Then Raichu said, \"I do have a name myself and I am called Storm but maybe now I should be known as Psystorm.\" When Oak came on screen he was mystified to see Alex and even more upon seeing Psystorm. Upon returning to his senses Oak said, \"Now this is a first for me seeing a human that is actually two in one body. Also there's a Pokemon I haven't seen before next to you.\" Alex sighed and said, \"Its a Raichu.\" Oak said, \"That's not what a Raichu looks like at all.\" Alex then brought out hir pokedex and pulled up the page with Psystorm on it. \"It really is a Raichu after all. I admit I never saw a Pokemon that had the same evolution name but different shape until now.\" \"Also it seems that strangely you can use twice as much Pokemon than the typical limit enforced which is a first then again you are as I said before a fused human so you are able to withstand the stress it puts. There are certain advantages I can come up with in your new form aside from that. One when you fight you should be able to process thoughts twice as fast and I think that you should be twice as powerful than before overall your physical and mental aspects are twice as good as it originally once was. I am very interested in this new phenomena now and will want to see you asap Professor Oak out!\" \"Okay now that we know of the positive aspects of this it isn't as bad and frankly being able to do things twice as easily is actually quite the advantage overall.\" Just then the boat arrived that would take them to Kanto. \"Wanted to see my female half's parents but this event means that is out of the question. I suppose we should take the gem and depart.\" When Alex got onboard boy was shi in for a surprise because apparently 4 people were onboard. They were Ash's previous female traveling companions and apparently the champion of a region called Sinnoh alongside Sabrina. Just then the gem flashed again and this caused the 5 to fuse into one body that well viewers you will have to come up with it yourself. The new Alex looked at it's new form and realized that it was the gem that caused this to happen. If there was one thing going through the newly created being's mind it was simply \"What the heck is going on?!\" Eventually Alex calmed down realizing that this new body is as powerful as those that make it up combined. This also meant it could also have up to 36 Pokemon ready. \"Man how will I explain to those waiting for me at home?\" Just then a thought clicked in Alex's head, \"I know! Maybe I can change forms between each one so those that I can't reveal this to won't know what happened and also what caused me to look like this.\" After thinking it long enough Alex turned into Ash, then to Dawn, then misty, as well as May, and finally Cynthia and Sabrina before going back to its true form. \"That is good news for me.\" \"I must be a sort of demigod at this point. Better take a look in a mirror as to what I look like though. Oh wow!\" The clothing Alex wore was not what it was expecting at all. It was wearing some sort of dress that looked like it was flowing with each step. \"Anyways I had better take a needed nap after this weird day.\" And Alex fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

Her face was non-existant, however, she could still see, hear and think, as well as feel the wind toss her immobile state around in the soft wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while for it to dawn on her, but she realised that she had become a tree. \"I don't want to be a tree!\" Dawn cried in her head. \"Oh, please, please let me out of here!

I must have the stone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh cries out in fear and clutches tightly to Dawn's arm, burying her face in his shoulder. Dawn gets angry at the stranger for scaring her. \"And what do you need it for? It just so happens that we need this stupid thing as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man growls. \"If you won't be cooperative...\" He says in a low, dangerous voice, \"I'll just have to take it from you!\" He pulls out a Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's on, old man!\" Dawn shouts back.

Can it get any worse?!\" Ash calls it, practically tempting fate. As though on cue, the stone glows, throwing its cosmic die and getting a critical failure on Ash's luck roll. Dawn can't stop laughing as he glowed, his breasts growing larger, his shirt and coat were growing to compensate and his hips grew wider, but his pants weren't for some reason. As his (should we say \"her\" now?) hips swelled up, he started feeling his legs do the same. The somewhat painful sensation distracts Ash as her hair rapidly lengthens to her knees.

Ash looks at the damage. She looks over the tail , seeing it is definitely for real. Ash also checks his groin, and finds her 'girl parts' are still there, but conveniently hidden by scaly flaps for her discretion. Still, she felt a bit exposed. Thinking of her clothes, she checked them too. While still wearing her coat, T-shirt, and hat, she looked just like Misty did in her mermaid costume, but for one other difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My boobs got bigger, didn't they?\" Yep. Now on her chest Ash sported E cup breasts, and to his surprise looking down her shirt, the evil stone was nice enough to supply this ample bosom with a lacy bra to support it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Looks like May has a rival in the big boob competition, Ashley!!\" This annoys Ash to no end, and, as though second nature, manages to hop, almost Tigger-like, over to Dawn and wallop her over the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I may look like a girl, and sound like one, but my mind, soul, and name is still Ash.

Impossibly short. Wait a second!! How have you traveled with me all this time and you never had a wardrobe malfunction once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dawn shrugs her shoulders. \"I dunno. Magic skirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rrrriight... Magic skirt. Those barely dressed women on the corners of Vermilion City don't even wear skirts this short, though I don't know why they would wear so little.

Not 'aquaphobic,' just not fond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dawn breaks out laughing again. \"A mermaid that doesn't like water!!

Ash hops back to her side. \"Guess it tired of messing with you.\" Dawn tries to jest, worried over her situation. The first thing she noticed was her chest was tingling. Suddenly, her eyes changed from blue to brown as her face shifted. Dawn's hair in the front began to coalesce into two large bangs, but the back remained the same in length and shape as all of it became brunette with blue streaks. As she felt like she was gaining a few inches (which she was) her chest began to grow. B cup, C cup, D cup, E cup, F cup, stopping at G cup. Dawn nearly loses her balance from the shift in weight (and the shock), but suddenly, her back muscles strengthen (while not growing) to help sustain them. Just then, it seems like the changes stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ash chimes in, \"I'm guessing from the way you look, since I'm a Misty clone, you're becoming a May clone... although you still seem to have some of your features, like the back of your hair, the blue streaks, and some of your facial features... Actually, you kind of look like like a fusion of May and yourself, except you look like your 19, and your clothes are still 100% Dawn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As though to acknowledge Ash's statement, Dawn's clothes glow. Her shoes melt and shift, becoming like May's shoes, except high-heeled for some reason. Her skirt turns black, and through some miracle, becomes even shorter (by around 3/4\"), while white thong straps poke out above the top of the skirt. Her top mutates into something resembling May's shirt, but ends just under her breasts, exposing some underboob, and is zipped almost all the way down, exposing massively ridiculous amounts of cleavage. On her hands appear May's gloves, down to every detail, while at the same time her cap turned red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a few moments, the clothing transformation seemed to stop, leaving the only article of Dawn's untouched by the stone being her scarf. Dawn hastily examined herself, then became nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ash, why do I look like an R-rated fusion of myself and May. I swear, I look like some otaku's wet dream... not that I don't mind...\" She jiggles her breasts, as if to analyze them, while staring at the fourth wall with an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ash responds, \"I don't know what half those words mean, but your wardrobe is sort of, revealing, like those girls in Vermilion City we mentioned earlier... What is R-rated, by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dawn quietly mutters to herself, \"Poor, poor pokemon-obsessed Ash. Your mother never had the talk with you, apparently.\" Ash asks what she said, to be greeted with a quick, \"Oh, nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Looks like the stone is done. Well, we should get going if we hope to find a cure.\" Ash says to Dawn, making for town again hopping on her mermaid tail.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\"></div>Suddenly the light of the stone coalesces onto her tail and head as her legs become human shaped again only for more curvy and smooth than before. She also gets the knowledge of how to switch her legs back and forth between human and fish. Next is her long orange hair grows even longer reaching to the back of her knees and gaining a few black highlights in it it also becomes shinier, softer, and silkier than before. Another thing that happens is her hips become even shapelier than before while her butt inflates and becomes a perfect firm bubble butt. The next change is her lips become more pouty and change to red with a hint of a glossy shine to them, her eyelashes become longer and thicker giving her a sort of seductive look no matter what expression she takes. Suddenly the rest of her skin becomes just as smooth as her new legs and her breast shrink a little to a more manageable round and perky D-cup. Finally her clothes end up changing into a sexy 2 piece black bikini under a thin almost see through white button up shirt that is a size or 2 to big for her reaching to her mid thigh and left unbuttoned showing her flat nicely toned sexy stomach. She also seems to always look wet for some reason giving her an even more seductive look. When the light fades and Ash is viewable she looks down with a large smile on her face and starts rubbing her legs while mumbling about how happy she is to have her legs back. Then she notices the rest of the changes and says \"At least this time the changes aren't so bad.\"<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\"></div>Meanwhile with Dawn the light also hit her but only went to the crotch area before her clit ends up turning into a functional penis and her ovaries turn into a set of functioning balls as her pussy disappears and her skirt becomes a pair of pants and her panties become boxers in the same colors as the were before. But Dawn doesn't notice anything until she suddenly feels an uncomfortable feeling between his/her legs as a bulge forms on his/her shorts. When Ash finally stops checking out her changes and looks over at Dawn and sees the bulge she becomes confused because as far as she knows girls are not supposed to gain a bulge between there legs. When Dawn see Ash looking at him/her she/he becomes slightly self conscious till she finally says \"What are you looking at Ash.\" Ash just points down at his/her crotch and says \"i don't know Dawn but what is with the bulge and why does your skirt look like shorts. Dawn starts to look down while saying \"What bulge A-sh.\" he/she squeaks out the last part as he/she quickly pulls her shorts off showing her new extremely aroused 7\" long and 3\" wide penis when she (I'm gonna refer to her as she because its getting annoying to always say \"he/she\" and \"him/her\"cause she is mostly female just the equipment is male) screams in fear before looking at Ash and telling her to do something. But ash goes (who is slightly blushing as her knew female hormones are making her highly aroused causing a slight wet spot to form on the bikini bottoms) \"now why would i want to get rid of something like that you should be proud to have one that big.\" All the while sauntering over with a very seductive sway in her hips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"></div>what happens now...</span></div></div>",

As he stands back up, his face now looks like an adult Misty, and his hair is just like hers when not in the side pony. His legs thicken and narrow in the proper places, and smooth out all over as his body finishes taking a female shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, his clothes start to change, his coat sliding up his neck and becoming a furry boa as his T-shirt began to shrink and turn yellow. His breasts grew rapidly, from the buds the real Misty knew to mighty DD cup as his shirt becomes nothing more than a bikini top. His pants started to shrink and at first resembled Misty's trademark shorts, but then the legs melted, and it turned into a low-rise blue and yellow tartan miniskirt as his ass swelled and his undies became silk panties. His shoes morphed and became identical to Misty's sneakers, and from the waistline of the skirt came two suspender straps that practically fall off Ash's breasts. Ash's backpack even mutates into a tiny purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After the purse, it seems the changes have stopped. Ash looks over his (Now 'her') body and turning beet red. It was like someone turned Ash into a girl, then slipped in a \"Sexy Misty\" halloween costume. \"Am I...?\" Ash wonders, worried just far this female facade has gone, and pulls the hem of the skirt forward, looking down into her panties. She sees her 'malehood' still intact, in fact it was strangely bigger than it ever was as a boy, but notices a slit just below it. \"What... am I?\" A cold breeze goes by, and she feels her nipples and penis go erect, stretching her panties and poking out past the hem of her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

It nearly made him cry, but he was too filled with infantile bliss to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then he felt his diaper getting warm and moist, Shocked and horrified at what he was doing, he began to cry. Dawn noticed the infant's cry and proceeded to rock him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, what's wrong baby?\" Dawn checked Ash's diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone made a pee-pee!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn laid Ash on the ground and proceeded to change his diaper. The boy just laid there, too horrified to move. As soln as Dawn finished changing Ash, she scooped the tot into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama,\" Ash babbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where's this stone?\" Joahnna inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my purse,\" Dawn replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I see it?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His hands and feet turned to paws and his anatomy changed so that he was reliant on four legs instead of two. He kept shrinking, becoming more and more like an Eevee, until he finally reached 1' in height. He would be like any other Eevee if not for the fact that he was still wearing the diaper, formerly Dawn, which had also changed to remain snugly on him, regardless of size or shape. He also still somewhat had his spiked hair, mostly between his ears, and his hat, which was actually a little big for him. Luckily for him, he still had his memories, which was good because the nearby grass started rustling until a Pikachu jumped out--his Pikachu.<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Pikachu shouted upon seeing Ashvee, \"What are you doing with that hat?\" Ash was surprised he could understand his Pokemon, until he remembered he was one himself. \"That hat doesn't belong to you,\" Pikachu continued, snatching the hat from Ash's head, \"it belongs to my trainer.\" He put it on his head safe keeping, albiet it fit just as well as it did for Ashvee. He was just about to run off when Ash stopped him.<br>\r\nHe managed to quickly move in front of Pikachu, causing him to stop. \"Pikachu, it's me, Ash! Don't you recognize me?\" Pikachu looked at him closely, and seemed to slightly believe him, but not enough. \"Yeah, and I'm Darkrai,\" he said sarcastically, \"look, you may have similar hair, and you may have had his hat, but you honestly expect me to believe that my trainer just suddenly turned into an Eevee...a diapered one, at that.\" Ash blushed at the reminder of what he was wearing. Pikachu tried to leave a second time, but Ash once again ran ahead. \"Pikachu, please,\" he pleaded, just about ready to cry, \"you've got to believe me.\" Pikachu looked into the eyes of the Eevee and started feeling something. It was the bond he and Ash shared, an unseen force that gave more strength and courage than Victini ever could.<br>\r\nPikachu finally realized that this Eevee was indeed his trainer. \"Ash? Is that really you?\" He nodded. Pikachu pulled his head in for a hug, which Ash gladly took. \"I'm sorry man, I didn't know.\" Ash stepped out of the hug and looked at Pikachu, smiling. \"It's alright, I know this is hard to believe.\" Pikachu returned Ash's hat and put his paws on his...hips[?]. \"So, how did you get stuck like this?\"<br>\r\nAsh sweat nervously. \"Uhh, w-well, I--\" he was suddenly cutoff by a familiar voice. \"I think I can answer that!\" A strange mist slowly crept out of Ash's diaper and shaped itself until it looked like Dawn, a ghostly chibi version of Dawn, but Dawn none-the-less. \"By Arceus!\" Pikachu exclaimed, startled. Dawn turned to look at Ash, not too pleased. \"I can't believe you Ash,\" she started yelling, \"I turn into a diaper and your first thought is to put me on and pee in me!\" Ash blushed deeply as he heard Pikachu say \"Dude! Seriously?!\" Dawn wasn't finished. \"Do you even know how gross that feels?! It's a good thing I managed to get my spirit out before you did worse, but I'm still bound to it!\" Ash was having guilt weigh on him more than a Wailord, and looking at Pikachu, he saw only a disapproving glare. \"However, there are advantages to this, like being able to control how your diaper looks.\" As she said that, Ash felt his diaper slowly get thicker until it spread his hind-legs eight inches apart. Dawn smirked. \"I can also alter your bladder and bowel control.\" Ash's skin paled underneath his fur as he felt a familiar warmth in front of his diaper and an unfamiliar squishiness as his legs finally gave in to the thickness. \"Lastly I decide when your diaper is cleaned.\" Ash hoped that meant Dawn would return his diaper to normal, but instead, Ash wet and messed further. Dawn laughed at her friend's predicament, meanwhile Ash was about ready to cry from humiliation. At this point Pikachu started feeling sorry for Ash and tapped Dawn on the arm to get her attention and motioned for her to follow him behind a bush.<br>\r\nA couple of minutes later, Ash noticed his diaper returned to its former condition. Dawn floatedover, looking ready to apologize, when Ash said \"Dawn, I'm sorry.\" Dawn smiled. \"Apology accepted,\" she then started petting Ash, which he couldn't help but enjoy. \"Alright, you two,\" Pikachu broke out, \"I think it's time we go somewhere else.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the flash, Ash got up from his sitting position he had fallen into. He looked around and saw pikachu lying against a tree, unconscious, but unharmed. He saw the stone's glow was fading and went over to pick it up. It didn't flash like last time, maybe it had to little energy to do it again, maybe it only worked when multiple persons touched it, Ash didn't know. He then heard some low grunts and saw pikachu getting up and then stare at something. Ash looked at the same direction and saw Dawn frozen in place, arms in front of her eyes and almost in a fallen position. The slightest push would be enough to make her, yet she stood completely still.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Dawn, what's wrong?\" Ash asked. As he waited for the answer, which didn't come, he went over to her. He looked over her carefully, everything seemed to be normal except for her blank eyes, which didn't even show the least of emotion. Several minutes passed, with many Pok\u00e9mon coming and passing by, all wanting to see the strangely petrified human girl. Ash had sat down next to her, pikachu at his lap, watching her during the passing minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut that out already Dawn!\" Ash shouted as he jumped up and pushed Dawn out of her position. She just fall, not even moving anything to prevent her head from smashing onto the ground. Ash stood their amazed at her behavior.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Stop acting like this Dawn, get up.\" He said, after several seconds had passed again. To his surprise she did stood up, though in a very stiff way. Ash waved his hand in front of her eyes again, as she stood completely frozen again after getting back to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you?\" He asked her again, or rather himself as she again showed no reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is to weird. Alright, stay here and climb a tree for all I care, I'm leaving.\" Ash said as he turned around. He nodded to pikachu, but he seemed distracted by something again. So he looked back around sighing at first, but then looking in awe as he saw Dawn climb a tree. He couldn't believe it, never had he seen Dawn do something so fast and without asking and without complaining. The moment she had reached the top, she just sat there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn, get down from there, that's dangerous.\" Ash said, still trying to figure out what had made her move. And as he did, she came down again. Then he had a thought, or rather a theory and he couldn't wait to test it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn dance.\" Ash said when she had set foot on the ground again. And she did, though again quite stiff and with the same move over and over again. Swinging her arms a bit and turning around in a circle, was all she did for several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How far would you go?\" Ash wondered, as she just kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn, let me see your panties.\" Ash said. He and pikachu gaped as she did as told, anyone would have been murdered already for even asking a girl to drop her skirt or pants in front of someone. But she had just done that exact thing, without the faintest sense of shame or disgust. The panties didn't interest him, the mere miracle of the act had been enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn, pull your skirt back up.\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP\u00efkachu went over to here and shocked her in an attempt to get her back to normal, but she didn't move, even when he turned strengthened the attack, didn't she flinch for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagine all the things I could do with her, or make her do pikachu. But that'd be wrong, she's still my friend, we should go find some help. Or should we?\" Ash wondered. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His thighs were becoming more plump and rounded, and soon his ass began to grow larger and rounder as well. All of this expanding was making his pants so tight on him, and they really showed off his lovely new curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked so much like a girl now, and a hot one at that, so Dawn couldn't help but start getting aroused looking at his hourglass figure. She was trying to hid the growing bulge in her pants, but it was no use, it was rather obvious to Ash. Ash oddly felt a strange attraction, not for Dawn, but for the throbbing member between her legs. A jolt of lust ran through his mind as he imagined sucking her cock, he began blushing and started feeling odd again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, his scalp felt odd, so he took his hat off. As he did, his hair began rapidly growing out, and changing to a sexy, bright blonde color. It was messy, and a little longer that Dawn's hair. Ash suddenly had an urge to fix it up, and put on some make up, maybe even put on one of Dawn's cute mini-skirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn,\" Ash asked in his sweet new girlish voice, \"Would you mind lending me some of your make up? If I go around looking like this, I'll never get a boyfriend.\" Dawn couldn't believe what she had just heard, but was secretly happy. Ash was so cute and sexy right now, her cock twitched at the thought of him looking even more like a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn shyly replied \"S-sure, use whatever you like.\" She handed him her make-up bag, and couldn't help but notice that Ash's hands had become smaller, and more dainty like a girl. Ash happily started applying blush, eye shadow, fingernail polish, and even lipstick like a pro! After he was done with those, he began tackling his hair. Within minutes, Ash's hair was complete, he looked more like a girl than Dawn now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh took a look in Dawn's vanity mirror, and was quiet pleased with what he saw. He blew a kiss to his reflection, and gave a cute wink that almost made Dawn cream her pants, he was unbelievably cute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teehee,\" Ash giggled, \"I look nothing like an icky guy now, Ash just won't work any more.\" Ash gazed at Dawn, with a look of lust in his eyes. \"What do you think of Ashley?\" he said softly approaching Dawn. Dawn was speechless, as Ashley leaned in to kiss her on the lips. The kiss soon become more passionate, as Ashley felt the tingling sensation return in her pants. Her cock began shrinking into her, leaving a moist vagina ready and willing to be used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn took Ashley's shirt off, and began playing with he breasts before savagely ripping Ashely's new bra off. Dawn played with her nipples, and then she began playfully sucking on them. While Dawn was preoccupied with her breasts, she was slowly sliding her shirt off, and unbuttoning her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn didn't know how much longer she could hold out before giving into temptation, and trying out her brand new cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will she do?</span></div></div>",

Ash squirmed some in his seat, feeling the effects of the bra constraining him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how girls wear these all of the time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you figured out *how* and why we wear them, when you felt that breeze blow up your shirt earlier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh blushed toward this, and covered up his chest by crossing his arms over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I hope you're enjoying that new thing you've got down there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Dawn's turn to blush now, as she felt her new addition squirm a little inside the jeans she had to buy to contain it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't know how you can walk around with this thing sticking out all of the time...growing, shrinking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh rolled his eyes, failing to see the stone start to light up again, as his hand rested down touching one of it's sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what Dawn? You're right. I'd gladly have your part down there any day..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn scoffed and closed her eyes, also not noticing the stone getting brighter, as her hand touched a side of it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, Ash. But, only if I could have your formally flat chest. I might as well only have one thing swaying around, rather than three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point, the stone got so bright that it engulfed them once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt the light wash over him, wondering what would happen next. It didn't take long for his answer to come, in the form of an intense pulling sensation from his groin. Putting his hand down his pants, he felt the last remnants of his manhood slip out of it, down to form a clitoris, while his testes pulled up into his body, turning into ovaries. When it was all finished, he now had a full working set of female genitalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side, Dawn felt a prickling sensation in her chest from the light, as she put her hands up to her breasts. They were sinking and contracting back like quicksand, and at the end, her chest was as flat as any guy's. She managed to get one last bit of sensation from her nipples before they shrank into a male form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light faded they both looked to each other again; one with their hand down in his pants, and the other with a collapsed top, and knew what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we've...fully swapped sexes now...\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds, the light from the stone faded and fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was officially creep out. He looked down, through the one face, and screamed in horror. The body not only had a set of D-cup breasts, but a penis as-well. The hips were that of a man's, as were the legs, covered in menacing hair, but the shoulders were not broadened and the arms were skinny and lanky. The face of this body shared traits from both Ash and May; it had May's mouth, but Ash's nose and eyes. May's hair was on top, however it was now half black and brown between him and May, and although she still had her bandanna and hair accessories, they were all the color of Ash's cap. They also wore May's's shirt and biker shorts, however for some reason they also wore Ash's jeans and shoes. To the normal passer-by, they would have looked more like a girl than anything - albeit a poorly dressed one at that - but inside, and under the underpants, they were of two genders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God,\" He spoke, realizing both their voices were present and combined. \"What happened to us?\" He stopped and thought, clearly in shock. \"I can't go out like this! I'll look like freaks! I need to undress, and get some of this stuff.\" But it was to no avail, as the clothes were magically stuck on him, and were unable to take anything off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God, I can't be stuck like this forever!\" He cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust after he said that Dawn walks up and says..</span></div></div>",

As they did they caught a glimpse of themselves in the mirror. Misty was displeased at her now even smaller breasts, but her butt looked surprisingly good. Misty felt a swell of pride...only to then feel Ash's \"pride\" swell as well, causing her to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty: ASH! Don't look!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh: How?! We're the same person. You wanna do this blindfolded?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty then closed her eyes as she attempted to put on the swimsuit, but eventually gave up and looked. They put on a blue swimsuit, similar to Misty's gym wear with boycut shorts and a sport blue top, but the pants were a bit baggier to accommodate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the changing room they heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay: Hey Ash, how do I look?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay/Dawn struck a pose. They were wearing a somewhat sheer pink bikini bottom with a strapless pink top. Ash stared dumbstruck while Misty felt a pang of jealousy. Dawn/May's beasts had grown since fusing and was barely contained by the strapless top. She could see the fabric pushing the breasts together into a deep raving of cleavage, heaving with every breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn: May, do you HAVE TO show off my body like this?! It's kinda...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay: Hey! It's MY body too and I'll do what I want with it! Besides, we look great, right Ash?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty/Ash continued to feel jealous of May/Dawn's ample bosom. Those couldn't be real, Misty wanted to think. But she knew they were. She admired them. They looked good on May/Dawn. They-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn: Umm...hello? Earth to Ash? ...and Misty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh/Misty: HUH?! WHAT?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay: Sooooooooo, how do I...err...WE look?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh: Ummm...pretty good I gu-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty: You look great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly smile crossed May/Dawn's lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay: Reeeeeeeally?

Their now larger hips swaying with each step, barely contained in the already small bikini bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh/Misty also began to run after them. Ash was startled to feel the sway of his own hips, swinging almost in unison with May/Dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they hit the water, Ash felt his body dunk itself in and begin swimming with incredible grace. Misty, of course, loved the water. Ash liked it too, but not as much as Misty does. But he relaxed, it felt natural as their body swam there. Swimming was like second nature to him. She darted to the surface, arching almost like a dolphin as she grabbed another breath of air and swam below the waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay/Dawn just stared on in amazement. As Ash/Misty surfaced again, they began to applaud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn: Wow Ash, Misty, that was incredible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh giggled while scratching their head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh: Aw it was nuthin'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty: being the Cerulean gym leader and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something odd about their voices. Ash sounded a little more high pitched and nasal, while Misty sounded a bit lower and rougher. Ash/Misty didn't notice it though. It felt too natural to be wrong.</span></div></div>",

Then he smiled as he began to get naked and took the costume on. As his legs entered first, they fitted into the Costume like an glove. he continued with the rest of the Costume and only minutes later, he was an Lopunny. \"Amazing. I hope dawn is ok with that.

Walking over to a desk in her room may set  the letter down and began to silently open the small box. Opening it may removed a small black pen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay blink not really sure what to make of it. \"Why did wallace want to get this to me?\" She wondered sitting down in a wooden chair may sat the pen aside and cut open the letter. And it read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dear may,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm truly sorry how thease past few weeks have going for you, I've been caught in the current spot spotlight and haven't noticed how tried you were. So I am giving you a break from the rest of the tour, now to help you get a good vacation away from the public eye, enclosed in that box is a pen but it is no ordinary pen, it's has the power to turn anyone into a costume, now please enjoy your break and have fun and use the pen wisely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom wallace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n May sat still for a moement in complete disbelief, at what her letter was telling her* she picked up the pen and rolled it around in her hand. She noticed that it had two little red and green buttons on it.one said suit and the other said memory. Truly may thought this might be some sort of trick wallace was playing on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she did have a course side about this pen, and dawn was right in the other room so why not may figured.why not soon enough  may had walked into the other room and silently pointed the pen at the fifteen year old, who was looking out the window and shot her, instantly dawn just seemed to collaspe into herself, this greatly shocked may.</span></div></div>",

He confirms it by touching his Adam's apple, that felt different from before. He then looked down to find two breasts and Dawn's outfit on him. He touches the two breasts, the breasts bounced and he then moans. Ash \" The breasts are real, but what about down their?\". He slowly touches the place where his penis is usually, but when he touches it nothing was their he then moans again. Ash doubles checks by stretching the skirt more out to find a pair of panties he then stretched that too and put his hand down their to feel nothing and no hairs that he had before. Ash then panics by putting more his head straight then something moves on his head he then grabs off to find out its Dawn's hat. After Dawn's hat is off his hair fell down completely and Ash finds Dawn's short, yet long hair and her hair color. Ash gulps and says lightly \" No way I am... Dawn!\". Ash thinks \" What can I do... explore Dawn's body, take control of her life, and be a girl I wished secretly to be, by being someone like her, but its wrong of me to do to a friend, or find a way to let her have control of her body again and get back into my own?\".

I was just, uh, making the beds upstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please Delia, we haven't been neighbors for years for nothing. It's Samuel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt a sweat drop coming down the back of his head. But before he could respond, Oak had grabbed him by the hand and was leading him back to his lab. It seemed a lot smaller than it first was when he had just turned ten and started his Pok\u00e9mon journey. The lab was a mess as usual, but there were many new machines around. One of which was the large tank that Oak had brought him in front of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Delia. This is Bill's latest work. The transformer. It allows any person to enter it and come out as whatever they like. It's supposed to be reversible so don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought occurred in Ash's head. \"Um Prof-I mean, Samuel. Would it be possible for me to enter and come out as my son, for example?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? Well that's an odd idea. But yes I suppose so. It was meant for Pok\u00e9mon research but I guess that's possible. Would you like to give that a try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded and stepped into the chamber of the tank. Oak threw the switch and the door slammed shut. Gears in the machine began to twirl and a flash light filled the room. When it was done...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the light of hatching faded, Ash swore he heard Dawn's voice, but more... cutesy. \"Ash, wha happened to me?!\" Before Ash Dawn stood, but she was tiny, only slightly larger than Pikachu, looking like she was a year or two younger than Ash remembered her, dressed in her normal clothes, but in a yellow and black Pichu-themed color scheme, with her scarf now black and her skirt and boots a yellow hue, while oddly her hat was now pink, like Pichu's cheeks, the insignia in it, usually pink, was now black. More shocking was that poking out the hat were two giant Pichu ears, and lifting her skirt ever so slightly in the rear was a black Pichu tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Dawn, don't freak out...\" He pointed to the mirror in the room, and when she saw herself, she belted out a horrific scream, but also a moderate electrical discharge, frying Ash and Pikachu, then herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... I did it? Sowwy Ash.\" electric smoke rolling off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resulting discharge affected Pachirisu's egg, causing to hatch as well. Out came to everyone's shock another pokmon/girl hybrid, this one as tall as Dawn normally would be. She had short Carolina blue hair and wore a white shirt and a sky blue skirt almost identitical to Dawn's skirt, with sneakers on her feet. She had a necklace with charms that looked like her yellow cheeks on it, and sticking out a hole in the rear of the skirt was a Pachirisu's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master!!\" she blurts as she glomps Dawn. Then she sees her state and responds to it, \"What happened to you... Wait? What happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wha I wan ta know.\" Dawn says in in her apparently Pichu-induced cutesy talk, given Pichu being a baby pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can figure that out, or we can evolve you first.\" Pachirisu says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evolve me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might be my master, in any form, but I can't stand that baby talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they do first?</span></div></div>",

Then Paul says \"She's getting annoyed. What part of that you didn't understand?\" Then they looked at Paul and Ash and Pikachu got mad, so did Pachurisu. \"Chu pa chi pa! (Hey! We were only having a little fun.\" Ash then yelled \"PAUL! WHY MUST YOU BE RUDE!? WE ARE TRYING TO HELP HER, NOT SCOLD HER! EITHER HELP OR STAY OUT OF IT!\" PIKA PIKACHU!

Soon, the whole article was a scarlet hue. As Ash and dawn began to <br>\r\nnotice this, it began to change materials too. Quickly, the used-to-be sweater was a <br>\r\nshort, red, polyester shirt. This made Ash shoot into an upwards position.<br>\r\n\"What!? Not another change!\" he exclaimed, giving a reference to the title.<br>\r\n\"this can't be happenning!\" but it was. The top around the collar, which had somehow <br>\r\nretained its color, formed a v above the chest. Directly above that, the red formed a <br>\r\ncollar much like that of a suite. If the two on-looking trainers weren't in some sort of <br>\r\nhistaria, they would have noticed something familiar about this shirt... To top off the <br>\r\ntransformation, the chest seemed to fold over itself slightly, as if growing to <br>\r\naccomidate for a bust.\u00a0 </span></div></div>",

This was no help for hi boner though. It felt <br>\r\nas if his pants would burst. But being the spandex that they were, they could keep it up <br>\r\nfor weeks. Years even. <br>\r\n\"Maybe it will stop here?\" questioned Dawn.<br>\r\n\"somehow, I find that hard to believe.\" answered Ash feeling the next change coming <br>\r\non. He couldn't pinpoint the location of this one though. As he was searching for the <br>\r\nsource, he heard a strangled squeal from behind him. He spun around to find Dawn <br>\r\npointing at the ground around his feet. He bent over to see what she could possibly be <br>\r\nscared of now to find his belt slowly snaking its way back up his legs to where it fell <br>\r\nfrom when he lost his jeans. When it reached its target, the belt shrank itself to fit on <br>\r\nash with no belt loops. This caused ash to jerk backwards and fall onto Dawn. The two <br>\r\nlay sprawled on the ground, helpless as the belts changes took place. First, the belt <br>\r\nsplit itself into two pieces, one yellow, and one white. While the yellow halve stayed in <br>\r\nplace, the white sliver snuck its way under ash's shirt. It then began to elongate, <br>\r\nstopping directly below the crotch, causing even more pressure on the already pulsing <br>\r\nbulge. This created the illusion of a micro skirt over the dark blue biker shorts. The <br>\r\nyellow fraction however had stayed in place, but on the end near ash's ass, it started <br>\r\nto swell. The rapidly increasing baloon began to take a rectangular shape and gained <br>\r\nseperated pockets. The two trainers were starting to (finally) realize exactly what is <br>\r\ngoing on.

All that was (outwardly) left were the bandana, gloves, and <br>\r\nshoes, and ash would be walking around in (most of) mays old clothes! They stood <br>\r\nback finding it futile to interfere with the transformation. After a few seconds, ash <br>\r\nreached up to ajust his hat, but someting was wrong. The hatwas still it's normal <br>\r\nshape, but it was floppy and soft... Almost silk. Actually, it was silk. Ash's hat had <br>\r\nalready begun the first steps of transformation. Slowly, the rim began to creep back <br>\r\nand the hole in the back was covered by the same red and white silk as the rest of the <br>\r\nhat was made of. The plasic ajustable end began to chang into the same material also <br>\r\nand then started to tie itself into a knot halfway up Ash's head. The rim stopped <br>\r\nshrinking on the oposite side yet still about half-way up. On the opposite side of his <br>\r\nbody, another change had ocurred. His socks were weaving their way up to the top of <br>\r\nhis ankles and slowly darkening to a pitch black. Over thes socks was yet another <br>\r\nchange. He began to feel a string discomfort in his feet as his shoes narrowed and <br>\r\nlost their laces. They then turned the same scarlet as his shirt and gained yellow and <br>\r\nwhite stripes. As his outwards change finished, he pushed himself off of Dawn and <br>\r\nstagered over to the nearest tree. Dawn also rolled off the ground. As she regained <br>\r\nher balance, she stared at Ash and started snickering.<br>\r\n\"It's not funny!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n\"it isn't? Maybe you should look at yourself!\" she retaliated. Dawn dug into her pack <br>\r\nand found a mirror. She handed it to Ash who stared at himself, terrified.<br>\r\n\"I look like James while he's in one if his bad costumes!\" he said.

He began to <br>\r\nsqueeze out of mays red top, but it got stuck on <br>\r\nhis head and he had to call dawn over to help <br>\r\nstretch the collar. The shirt came off with a \"pop\" <br>\r\nand sent ash and dawn staggering in different <br>\r\ndirections. When they regained their balance, ash <br>\r\nlooked down at his chest. He was wearing a very <br>\r\nplain white undershirt and spandex bikeshorts <br>\r\nnow. As he was staring, the bootom of the shirt <br>\r\nbegan to rise. It came up to just below his chest <br>\r\nand stopped. In the back, dawn noticed the <br>\r\nsleeves becoming something much more familiar <br>\r\nto her. When the transformation seemed to be <br>\r\nover, ash turned aroud and asked \"so... What is <br>\r\nthis? Some sort of tank top?\"<br>\r\ndawn simply answered with. \"no. No, it's not <br>\r\ndone.\" ash glanced back down at the shirt in time <br>\r\nto see it change to a bright, shiny pink. Lace <br>\r\nstarted to tie itself around the edges and two spots <br>\r\nover the nipples began to balloon out slightly. <br>\r\nSuddenly, ash screamed as he realized what was <br>\r\nhappenning. Quickly, the part between the puffs <br>\r\nbegan to shrink down until it was but a bridge <br>\r\nbetween them. To the horror of the beholder, the <br>\r\nnow-obvious bra turned to a very soft silk. Without <br>\r\nthinking, Ash threw on the nearest shirt, which just <br>\r\nso happened to be mays! Ash was now wearing <br>\r\neverything that may had other than her...<br>\r\n\"uh-oh\" he said. \"Panties.\" He tried to tighten his <br>\r\nfanny-pack around his waist, but dawn was to fast. <br>\r\nShe dashed forwards and yanked down ash's <br>\r\nbiker shorts to find that his\u00a0<br>\r\nUsed-to-be red striped boxers were already the <br>\r\nsame shade pink as his bra. Lace was growing <br>\r\naround the edges and the legs were shortening <br>\r\npast brief-size. Soon enough, ash's \"boxers\" were <br>\r\nthe size of girls boy-shorts. But it didn't stop there. <br>\r\nIn fact, the legs didn't stop until they weren't even <br>\r\nthere. Still after that, the backs of the \"boxers\" <br>\r\nwere suck right up Ash's ass, sending chills down <br>\r\nhis spine. The new thong was still made of the <br>\r\nsame material as the old boxers, scratching at the <br>\r\ninsides of Ash's ass and, to his surprise, he was <br>\r\nactually relieved when they finally turned to silk. <br>\r\nAsh was now in mays complete set of clothes, <br>\r\npanties, bra and all. Shorts around his legs, he fell <br>\r\nto his knees, the thightness of the clothes being <br>\r\ntoo much for him. Dawn reached down to help him <br>\r\nup, but recoiled as she remembered one last thing <br>\r\nthat ash was missing. As if on que, Ash felt the <br>\r\ntell-tale tingle around his hands warning him of <br>\r\none last transformation. His biking glove began to <br>\r\ngrow fingers and gained a certain elasticity. When <br>\r\nhe looked down at his hands, ash was wearing the <br>\r\nsame white and blue gloves that were always <br>\r\nworn by may.

After searching around for a few minutes, he did <br>\r\nuncover her green, emerald version clothes, but that was really no help. He also found <br>\r\na much more comfortable looking pair of panties and decided to switch. With his thong <br>\r\nhalfway down his legs, he realized that he could just go without panties. He dropped <br>\r\nthe bikini (underwear. Not swimsuite) and threw off the thong. He then, half naked, <br>\r\nrealized that he still had no masculine pants. He found a pair of mays bike pants and <br>\r\ntried them on again. He had them on and was about to walk out of the tent, but on his <br>\r\nfirst step, he knew why girls wore panties. The pain was excruciating! It was like holing <br>\r\na torch to his lower parts! He threw off the bike-shorts and flew right into the bikini. It <br>\r\nwas pink with a generic looking pokeball on the back. These were also made of silk <br>\r\nand almost tore when he threw himself into them but barely held after taking their spot <br>\r\nright below the waist. He then stepped back into mays shorts and shrugged outside. <br>\r\nDawn was waiting for him to return in his regular clothing, but was dissapointed by the <br>\r\nsame old, tranny ash snuck back.\u00a0<br>\r\n\"god. This is really emaracing.\" he blushed as he spoke to Dawn.\u00a0<br>\r\n\"maybe we could buy you new clothes?\" she digested helpfully.\u00a0<br>\r\n\"actually, that might work!\"<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The friends trotted down to the nearest town when Ash realized something.<br>\r\n\"I can't be seen in these clothes!\" he exclaimed. \"I would die of embarassment!\" <br>\r\nsuddenly, dawn had an idea. She reached into her pack and pulled out a beret and <br>\r\ntwo flesh-colored pads.<br>\r\n\u00a0\"This could work.\" she said. \"these are falsies.\" she explained when she saw ash <br>\r\nstaring at the pads. \" they give someone the appearance of having breasts. I was <br>\r\ngoing to give them to an old friend of mine when we got home, but you can borrow <br>\r\nthem.\" With a little help from Dawn, Ash had stuffed the falsies into \"his\" bra and Dawn <br>\r\nhad given him a completely new, much more feminine hair style. She had to call out <br>\r\npiplup to tame his hair long enough to clean it out though. Ash now had the <br>\r\nappearance of a girl around his own age who had somehow obtained mays entire <br>\r\nwardrobe. Although he had one small flaw. The panties were still giving him a hard! He <br>\r\ngrabbed a few nearby leaves and rubbed some sap over them making a thick pad of <br>\r\nplants. He then shoved this down his pants and moved it into place. This gave him <br>\r\nwhat seemed to be a completely flat crotch. He still had trouble moving in mays <br>\r\nclothes considering their size, but he looked much more natural in them. The two <br>\r\nreached the town and nervously stepped through the boarders. They were able to <br>\r\nmake it through the city without attracting too much from they passers-by other than a <br>\r\nfew few wispers like \"poor girl, she really needs to buy some larger clothing!\" or <br>\r\n\"ummmmmm... Maybe someone should give her a razor...\" when they entered the <br>\r\nmart, Ash and Dawn began to look around for the mens clothing section but found <br>\r\nnothing. They eventually decided to ask for directions. The lady at the counter <br>\r\nanswered by telling them \"go down the potions section, and take a right at the ultra-<br>\r\nballs. You will find a stack of T.M.s. Then you have to \u00a0take five short steps to your <br>\r\nright, and your there. Mmm-kay?\" they both answered with an afirmative and walked <br>\r\nalong the path she had givin them. Before they reached their destination, Dawn felt the <br>\r\nurge to leave for the bathroom. She quickly told Ash who nerviosly nodded her off and <br>\r\nleft. Ash reached the technical machines and took a right. What he saw made him <br>\r\ndouble-take. There was a sign above him that read mens clothing, but that is not what <br>\r\nhe saw. Surrounding him were piles and piles of red, polyester shirts, white micro <br>\r\nskirts, and blue bike shorts. Upon closer inspection, Ash found other articles of mays <br>\r\nclothing, including her bandanas, gloves, shoes, and even her slightly arabic looking <br>\r\nco'ordinators dress and head-piece. He found piles of pokemon themed panties along <br>\r\nwith plain and lacy ones. Hundreds of bras of all colors and styles. All these, but no <br>\r\nmale clothes. He ran around the section in a panic. Finally, he decided that, iff all he <br>\r\ncould wear was mays clothes, he could at least find some that fit. He picked out one <br>\r\nofcalmost everything in his size and pulled out a large amount of cash from his fanny <br>\r\npack. He carried everything back to the desk and paid for all of it. He then waited at <br>\r\nthe door for Dawn who seemed to be taking a while. After a minute, dawn finally <br>\r\nshowed up at the door. She explained that there was a line at the bathroom and <br>\r\nnoticed what Ash had bought. \"Those are more of Mays clothes! What's going on <br>\r\nhere?\" ash told her about the strange mens section and she stared back to where the <br>\r\nsign was. Eventually, she got over it and they walked back to their camp.\u00a0 </span></div></div>",

Cut it out, Dawn!\" said Ash, blushing brightly. \"Boys aren't supposed to be wearing dresses! This is embarrassing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two watched as Ash's shirt turned pink then became lighter in texture as it developed a flowery design. At the same time, Ash felt something unfamiliar appear on his chest.  He lifted the top of his changing shirt and let out a loud moan of protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bra just appeared on me!\" he yelled, again doing his frustration dance. \"This can't be happening to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just clothing, Ash.\" said Dawn, calmly. \"Once the change is done, I'm sure you can change into some boy clothing later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you're right.\" said Ash. \"Looking at it that way, I guess this is nothing more than a harmless prank on the stone's part.\" he gave a short laugh. \"Who knew a stone could have a sense of humor!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the shirt, no completely pink, fused with the pink skirt, becoming a long, flowing dress. At the same time, his shoes fell apart, changing into sandals as his plain white socks changed into girlish tabby socks, causing Dawn to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't just look cute, Ash.\" she said. \"You look adorable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh frowned. \"Whatever. Can we find some place for me to change clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn smiled. \"Not yet.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she pulled out a camera and took a picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh gave out a girl like scream and vainly tried to hide himself. \"Come on, Dawn!\" he complained. \"Don't take pictures of me like this! I don't want my mom to think I had become weird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Ash.\" said Dawn with a wink. \"I won't use these pictures, unless I want something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sighed then gave a gasp as he felt something else changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now!?!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why me!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then buckled over, giving another yell of surprise. Only in a much high voice as he felt his hips widening and his bottom perking up. At the same time, Ash also felt his stomach cave in and become firm as his back did the same. Soon, he had a perfect hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to make a great girl!\" said Dawn. \"I think I'll rename you Ashley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked at Dawn, frustrated, then yelled out again, this time in a clearly feminine voice as his manhood suddenly become womanhood and he, now she, felt her legs press together in an unfamiliar way.

He(?) was in Dawn's body, so he had everything about her that made the guys in every town they passed practically drool at her feet.

They had absolutely no memories left of their previous lives, only the knowledge that they were rubber Pokemon. However, the moment they looked at each other, it was like love at first sight. After sharing a passionate kiss, the rubber Pikachu and Buneary scurried away into the woods to live out a new life with each other. That night, many Pokemon and humans swore they heard a lot of squeaking from deep in the woods, but no one discovered a thing. Years pass as people continue to look for the two trainers who seemingly vanished off the face of the earth while the two rubber Pokemon continue to live together far from society along with a baby rubber Buneary that they love so very much and would help raise. Eventually, the search for the two trainers was called off and many more years would pass, though time ignored the rubber Pokemon family as they continued to live in the forest, being able to avoid the trainers that would come into the forest searching for Pokemon to catch. To this day, they continue to do just that as one small rubber Pokemon family.</span></div></div>",

They had everyone search for the missing pair but they were nowhere to be found because of the fact that they were sky high and thus had to call it off.

But, because I have had the stone myself for so long, it occasionally changes me as well, if I'm in range of its power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any way to reverse this?\" asked Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEricka shook her head. \"I wish there was. Right now, we can only wait until the change runs its course and go from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, several hundred yards away, Ash let out a yell of his own as he found his sneakers and socks vanish, leaving his feet bare for a moment before they were replaced with ankle high socks and a pair of sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stone is changing me again!\" he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn looked at him thoughtfully. \"Somehow, I think this is different.\" she said. \"Normally, your clothing changes into another type. But now, it's like your swapping with someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird.\" said Ash. \"I wonder what the stone has in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Ash felt a breeze as his pants vanished, revealing his white briefs. Dawn blushed and giggled before turning away then turned back as she heard Ash give a yell of protest. He was now wearing a long red skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks like gym leader Ericka's skirt.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then lets get to her so we can switch back.\" said Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two hurried towards Ericka's gym as their clothing continued to change places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Ericka, she let out a scream as her skirt vanished, revealing her pink panties, then screamed again as a boy's pair of pants appeared in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you being swapped with?\" asked Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I don't know.\" replied Ericka. \"But, who ever it is, I'm sure he's just as annoyed by this development.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she felt her panties vanish, only to be replaced with a boy's pair of briefs. She gave a heavy shiver of disgust as she felt the cloth touching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not the boy's fault.\" she told herself. \"It's not his fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh let out a shiver of  disgust of his own as he felt the lace panties pressed against his groin and quickened his  step, trying to get to Ericka before another transformation could begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got closer, Ash felt a bra tightening around his chest and nearly fell over in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Dawn, looking back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bra just appeared around me chest!\" complained Ash. \"I don't want to be a girl again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's wrong with being a girl?\" asked Dawn, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" countered Ash. \"It's just not for me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn's face softened. \"Fair enough. Come on, we're almost there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Ericka's gym, she watched her long, ceremonial rope top vanish as a simple white T-shirt appeared in its place. Tears began to form in her eyes as she thought of what might come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang in there, leader Ericka.\" said Emily. \"I have a feeling this is almost over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEricka sadly shook her head. \"No, Emily. I have a sinking feeling that this is just the beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Ash, he felt a breeze on his chest as his bra was revealed to the open long enough for Dawn to see and giggle before Ericka's rope top appeared over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The change is almost over!\" said Dawn. \"We have to hurry before another transformation can begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ran through the front doors as Ash's cap vanished and was replaced with a red hair band.  They entered the main arena where they found Ericka, in Ash's clothing, near the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash Katchem!\" she yelled. \"Give me back my clothes this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You give me mine!\" countered Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no time for this!\" yelled Dawn, pushing Ash forward. \"I will give Ericka her clothing after Ash strips down and Emily can push Ash's clothing under the door. Move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Ericka ran into the next room, which was a water arena, and each entered one of many changing rooms.  They made quick work of changing clothing and were soon switched back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad this was fixable.\" said Dawn after seeing Ash and Ericka in their own clothing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Ericka both shivered off a certain coldness. \"I am so going to take a shower!\" they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey smiled and turned to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say it!\" yelled Dawn and Emily in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late.  The two said, \"Jinx.\" at the same time and the transformation rock glowed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dawn on the other hand had finally lost control and was clutching her sides as she laughed at the sight of Ash unable to pull off his diaper. Ash glared at Dawn and shouted, \"Dawn stop laughing and help me get this thing off!\" Dawn got her laughter under control and tried to undo the tapes of Ash's diaper only to find that she was also unable to remove it. Dawn tried everything she could think of and yet no matter what she or Ash did the diaper just refused to come off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end Ash just pulled his pants back up deciding to worry about the diaper later.

Ash's body shook and Ash noted that he didn't feel the need to go as badly. He shook again and the feeling vanished altogether. Ash wondered what was going on until he felt his diaper growing warm and wet. He immediately tried to stop the flow of warm urine into his diaper but it was impossible, his bladder refused to acknowledge his commands to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his bladder neared empty and the flow slowed Ash realized that he no longer had any control of his bladder. Thankfully, he hadn't given any signs when he was using his diaper so Dawn had no idea that Ash had just wet his diaper. As the two trainers stood up and stretched Ash suddenly became aware of a great pressure on his rear. He desperately had to poop and could just barely hold it in, so he still had some, although judging by how he felt not much, control over his bowels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Dawn started walking Ash doing his best not to let his walking show just how desperately he needed to poop. Ash however, was paying to much attention to his bowels and not enough attention to were he was walking. He tripped over a root and fell forward to the forest floor. As Dawn helped Ash up Ash realized that his fall had been enough for him to lose control and he began messing his diaper. Soft, mushy mess began to push its way into the back of his diaper and this time Ash was unable to hide his blush. As if the blush wasn't enough of a hint due to Dawn's proximity to him she could smell what Ash was doing in his diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes Ash was done and his mess had spread from his butt around his legs and up into his crotch. Dawn looked at Ash and said, \"Ash you really should try and get that diaper off again, sitting in a messy diaper will get you a rash.\" Ash blushed, not wanting to admit that he wasn't sure he could change himself never having changed a diaper before. Dawn seemed to realize this and although blushing heavily said, \"If you want Ash, I could try and change you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end...</span></div></div>",

His sneakers became a pair of pink and white high tops while his blue jeans almost instantly changed into a pair of yellow bike shorts and his black shirt changed into pink and white sleeveless shirt. The black, fingerless gloves he wore, turned pink then grew into a long, elegant pair of shoulder length, fingerless gloves. His cap then changed into a digital camera and piled itself around his neck while his black hair turned brown and styled itself into a girlish fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are now ready to enter the digital world.\" came a voice from the camera. \"You are now Kira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\" asked Ash, confused. \"I'm who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in a flash, Ash was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash!\" yelled Dawn, confused and frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she felt herself transforming as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does she become?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking at himself, Ash could not help smile. \"Well, at least I'm cute.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that girl!\" said Dawn, worried. \"It's Mimi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mimi?\" asked Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn pulled a mirror from her bag and allowed Ash to see for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's Mimi.\" he said. he looked at the stone. \"What trouble is she in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The negatives are after her.\" replied the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The negatives?\" asked Dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They exist in a completely different realm of reality.\" explained the stone. \"Only opposite of here.

She laid on the ground and he got on her. \"Now act like a slut and enjoy this Ash.\" Ash started licking Dawn's breasts. She giggled. Fifteen minutes later they were done, and Dawn changed him back. \"What the hell Dawn, I-\" Ash noticed his pokeballs. If he could open one, he could tell his pokemon to get her the ring!

Dawn screamed, \"Help me Ash!\" But that was for naught because the blast knocked Ash out. When Dawn saw that, she knew she had no choice but to accept her fate and turn into whatever the result was. Dawn started screaming in agony as her body started transforming. She started off by somehow becoming a young 20 year old woman. Then her clothes changed both shape and color. Then she really did scream because suddenly a strange pair of wings  emerged from her back that looked like a pair of iron bars that had strange jewels that were glowing themselves. 4th her hair changed color to blond and became longer and had a cute side ponytail of sorts. Finally her teeth became longer and her pupils turned red. After Dawn finished transforming she now looked like Flandre Scarlet but in the body of an adult.

Believe it or not...\" Ash blushed as he trailed off before he resumed saying, \"I actually have a weird umm... fe***h for vampires.\" This caused Dawn to blush herself. She then said, \"There's something I didn't know about you before. Is that why you always stay up late?\" Ash admitted that was true.

He pulled it back before may noticed and asked, <br>\r\n\"hey May? I really gotta go. bad. Do you mind if i... you know, step <br>\r\nbehind that tree over there?\"<br>\r\nMay rolled her eyes and answered affirmatively. Ash dashed back into <br>\r\nthe woods and yanked down his pants. what he saw was not pleasing. <br>\r\naround his waist was a pair of silky blue piplup panties. He stifled a <br>\r\ncry of shack and pulled up his pants. he knew this underwear. he had accidentally walked in on dawn in the morning and she had on nothing <br>\r\nbut these and a matching bra. Ash didn't know what to do, so he <br>\r\ndecided to just act as if it was nothing. He knew that he wouldn't be <br>\r\nable to keep up the charade for long, so he really needed to get to <br>\r\nhis tent where his other pairs are. The boy stepped from the woods and <br>\r\nawkwardly moved towards May. She cocked her head questioningly and Ash <br>\r\njust shrugged. The two turned around and headed to their campsite to <br>\r\npack up for the trip after they said their good-byes. when they made <br>\r\nit to their destination, the trainers dropped their packs and stepped <br>\r\nup to their respective tents. May immediately pulled the stakes out of <br>\r\nthe ground, but ash ducked into his shelter.<br>\r\n\"I left something in here.\" he half-lied. He zipped up to his <br>\r\nclothing bag and pulled it open. What was inside was so horrifying,it <br>\r\nmade the trainer fall into his wall, causing the tent to flip leaving <br>\r\nthe door, wide open. May peaked in to see what was wrong only to find <br>\r\nAsh in a jumble of assorted girls underwear. everything from plain <br>\r\nwhite cotton panties to a sexy set of lingerie.

He was unable to do any more than watch <br>\r\nas the used-to-be boxers shrank to what should be a bikini, but ended up more as a <br>\r\nthong for ash. The material then changed to a much softer silk and the transformation <br>\r\nwas over. The only good thing about this was the fact that it relieved ash of his girlish <br>\r\npose by pressing on the base of his dick, holding it in place. Even so, this made a <br>\r\nlarge lump appear near his ass which looked like shit, but was really the tip of his <br>\r\n\"tail\". <br>\r\n\"oh my god.\" they exlaimed in unison as Ash dropped the skirt back down.

Little did they know that something very, <br>\r\nvery strange was about to happen. As they were trotting down a hill, Ash's foot cought <br>\r\non a rock and sent him flying down the path. He landed face down on the grind, head <br>\r\nfacing towords the base of the hill. May ran up beside her friend, but stopped as she <br>\r\nnoticed something different about his pants. They were turning a light green! As they <br>\r\ndid so, they lost their denim feel and gained a certain elasticity. When the material had <br>\r\nfinished changing, the pants began to shrink. By the time Ash was off the ground, they <br>\r\nwere at his mid knee. Eventually, they got up to his upper thigh and almost reached <br>\r\nhis waist. The waistline then lost the belt loop and lowered to where it was almost <br>\r\ntouching the legs. The belt then changed to a light, lacy pink and split into two pieces. <br>\r\nThe pieces shrank and tied themselves into ribbons at the sides of his waist. His <br>\r\nboxers were poking out of the sides, perfectly visible to anyone but still not as bad as <br>\r\nwhat was about to happen next. His boxers split in half and slipped off of his legs <br>\r\nleaving him with only the green bikini and a huge bulge. He spun around and grabbed <br>\r\nthrough his pack, searching for spare pants, but the first thing he touched was the <br>\r\ngem. With another blinding flash, Ash's shirt had began to shrink. It stopped just below <br>\r\nhis chest and began to grow down from his collar to below his arms and his sleeves <br>\r\ndissappeared. This left him with a black and yellow tube top belly button sweater. Ash <br>\r\ndropped the backpack as this began to change more. First, it changed to the same <br>\r\ngreen, elastic material as the bottom with a blue stripe right above the chest. It then <br>\r\ntightened all over, but was less in two places over the nipples. From these spots, grew <br>\r\nan almost skirt-like strip of material with a white end. Finally, a strip of dark blue shot <br>\r\nout from the top of the... top and curved around his neck, attachin itself to the opposit <br>\r\nside making a neklace. May quicly recognized this as her green bikini that she wore <br>\r\nonly once or twice. As they were wondering how this happened, Ash's undershirt acted <br>\r\nlike his boxers and split off.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

First of all, each trainer's Poke Balls were affected and made it to where each Pokemon the ball was associated to was turned female, which made Pikachu, who had been watching the whole scene, suddenly gain a heart-shaped indention in his, or now her, tail. But even more so, unknown to either of them, the balls containing Ash's Gible and Dawn's Mamoswine, were changed the most as those Pokemon were suddenly turned into Miltanks. Next up were some physical changes as both Ash and Dawn grew a about a foot taller than they already were. Dawn's body also developed more into a bit of an hourglass shape while her hair grew a bit longer, with her hair accessories she's usually seen with disappearing, letting her hair down completely. Ash, however, had the biggest change as he also suddenly grew a pair of breasts while the rest of his body grew more curvy and he felt a weird sensation between his legs. Also his own hair become longer as well and resembled the hair that Misty had while dressed in the mermaid outfit. Even his zigzags on his cheeks were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what's going on Dawn?\" Ash questioned, his voice now sounding more feminine than before as he realized he wasn't a boy anymore, but now a blossoming woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know!\" Dawn answered, her voice sounding a bit more deeper as she realized they had both suddenly aged up a lot. But then both them and Pikachu, who was confused as to what was going on, all got splitting headaches, making them collapse to the ground. They didn't realize it, but their memories were being rewritten. For Ash, she now thought that she was a girl by the name of Winter who, along with her sisters Spring, Summer, and Autumn, help run the Mountain Hut Maid Cafe, but she took an extended leave from work to go on a journey with her best friend Pikachu and one of the cafe's Miltanks she had befriended. But now she felt like she was ready to go back to work at the cafe with all of the Pokemon she had gotten and help train them to be PokeMaids, with each one of them excited to help work with Winter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Dawn, who still kept most of her original memories, but had some slight alterations. Her memories of Ash were rewritten to include the new maid girl Winter instead and how, when the two of them worked together one time at the cafe, Dawn had a lot of fun working at the cafe along with her Pokemon and came to the decision that after she had competed in the Grand Festival, she would work with Winter in the cafe. Of course she would still be a Coordinator, but now she wanted to dedicate her free time to working at the cafe as one of it's maids, a decision Winter happily supported and even spent some time teaching Dawn how to work at the cafe. And now with plenty of practice over and both the Grand Festival and Sinnoh League over, Dawn was ready to start her new career as a maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally was Pikachu, who's meeting with Ash was replaced with a new memory of meeting a younger looking Winter and the maid-to-be at the time giving her some of the milk served at the cafe and them bonding over it before setting out on a long journey throughout Sinnoh together, getting lucky in meeting many legendary Pokemon and competing in the Sinnoh League. But she also now secretly harbored a crush for Dawn's Buneary and now with Winter and Dawn now going to be working at the cafe from now on, they could spend a lot of time with each other and maybe even become an item while working together as PokeMaids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes were now finished as Winter, Dawn, and Pikachu soon finally felt the pain go away as they all looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winter, are you okay?\" Dawn asked her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to worry Dawn, I'm more concerned about you.\" Winter answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, but...where are we?\" Dawn asked as they looked around to find themselves...</span></div></div>",

Come on, we're about to have a lot of customers!\" Spring said before heading back inside while Winter and Dawn made it back to their feet, about ready to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Dawn, are you ready to start your new life as a maid?\" Winter asked her traveling companion, who giggled before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am Winter, you taught me everything there is to be a cafe maid and now I'm ready to put it all to the test!\" Dawn answered, with Pikachu also giving in a squeak of determination before they all headed inside. Once inside, Winter and Dawn released their Miltanks from their Poke Balls and let them meet the other maids Miltanks while they got the rest of their Pokemon, except for Torterra who was too big, put into their own maid outfits and begun their own training to become PokeMaids. Meanwhile, Dawn began her new job in helping Winter and her sisters at the cafe. It was a bit tougher than she first thought as before, she only volunteered during the busy hour of the day where as now, she was working full shift. But she had a lot of fun as well as she felt herself getting closer to her fellow maids. And over the next few days, they all continued to work together while also helping the Pokemon learn to be maids.

She didn't know why, but it just felt right to be a maid. And her Pokemon definitely agreed with her as they all did their best to help her as well. But the biggest things that's happened to Dawn in the past couple of years was that she had finally won the Grand Festival and was now considered a top coordinator, but she still chose to work at the cafe rather than become a celebrity of any sort. And the reason why, even though she hasn't told anyone, was because of Winter. Why? Because she had a crush on her now. Dawn never thought she would develop any sort of crush on her fellow maid, let alone another female period, but that was the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today was another busy day. Due to Dawn's success as a coordinator, the cafe had become increasingly popular and became even more busy than ever. But the girls were all happy to serve each and every customer, but Dawn always found time to practice with her Pokemon for any future contests they would enter. And she now constantly wore her maid outfit too, replacing the outfit she had worn during her adventure with Winter years ago. To her, it was just like with being a maid, it just felt right to wear it even when she wasn't working. Only times she didn't wear it was when she performed in contests or when she was asleep. Anyway, Dawn had once again found some time to practice again, but shortly after performing a combo combining Piplup's new Hydro Pump with Buneary's new Thunderbolt, she began to wonder if she should tell Winter her feelings for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I tell her? I want to, but...what if she doesn't like me the way I like her...?\" Dawn asked herself, conflicted on what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dawn!\" suddenly came a familiar voice as Dawn jumped a bit due to her not expecting it.

As the lights faded, Ash appeared in full view. \"Ashley\"`s new body was painfully obviously feminine. She had an hourglass figure, with a firm pair of at least D-cup breasts, held in place with a not-so-flattering bra, with a firm behind to match, which wasn`t covered very well now, exposing her new panties. Her new hips were wide and perfect as \"child-bearing\" hips and her legs were very long even with the length of her socks, and her feet dainty. Her arms were slender and very delicate-looking with pink fingernails, painted of course. Her hair was now blonde and had grown to new new buttocks, and was almost silky in texture. Looking at Ashley, she looked like a mature version of the time Ash crossdressed to get into the Celadon Gym, but in Giselle`s outfit. Dawn finally stopped laughing, and Ashley asked, \"What`s wrong Dawn?\" then gasped at her new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you`d better see for yourself,\" Dawn replied as she pulled out a hand mirror. Ashley shrieked for a second or two as she looked at her reflection, and then used the mirror to help examine her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" Ashley asked.</span></div></div>",

The air was full of flying types <br>\r\nchirping out their cries. Ash and May yawned in unison as they always <br>\r\ndo on tv... Somehow... They agreed to find a nice clearing and rest <br>\r\nfor a moment. They had been up all the last night packing and could <br>\r\nhardly keep themselves moving. They found a great spot out to the side <br>\r\nof the road and dropped to the dew-covered ground, staring up at the <br>\r\nradiant blue sky.<br>\r\n\"It's such a nice morning.\" remarked May, spreading her legs out <br>\r\nbeneath her.

All he really wanted to do <br>\r\nis sleep. Eventually, May began to nod off and Ash took this as a cue <br>\r\nthat he could do the same. His masculinity would have been at risk if <br>\r\nhe had fallen asleep first. The trainer settled down and drifted off <br>\r\ninto a deep, deep slumber.<br>\r\nAsh was in his room back in pallet town. He was surrounded by his <br>\r\nold belongings such as his nes, n64, old tv and pokemon tournament <br>\r\nposters. He glanced around, wondering how he was back in his house. He <br>\r\nhadn't been back here in over six months... Suddenly, something caught <br>\r\nhis eye. It was red and blue, not very dominating. He wondered why his <br>\r\neyes were diverted in that direction. As he came to focus on the <br>\r\nobject, he noticed something. These were May's clothing! Where <br>\r\nwas May though? Suddenly, a figure just materialized into the outfit. <br>\r\nIt was May, but there was something not right... Her eyes. They were <br>\r\njust a blank, hazel stare. She crept closer and closer until, finally, <br>\r\nshe was close enough to just rub against the poor boy.<br>\r\n\"W-what are you going to do?\" he asked, stammering throughout his <br>\r\nspeech.<br>\r\n\"Nothing little cutie\" Replied the \"May\", \"Just fixing you up.\"<br>\r\nShe then stepped in, right up next to the boy. She spun around to his <br>\r\nback and leaned over.<br>\r\n\"Your going to need to relax now.\" She instructed. Ash wanted to <br>\r\nresist, but his will was seemingly nothing compared to the <br>\r\napparition's words. He felt his shoulders drop and his mind lay at <br>\r\nease.<br>\r\n\"what was I so scared of before.\" he began thinking. \"nothing is <br>\r\nwrong here. I feel no pain, I have no need for consciousness.\" with <br>\r\nthis, the ghostly Figure slipped into the distracted trainer's body. <br>\r\nIf he were thinking strait, this would have sent chill up his spine, <br>\r\nbut in his current state, he felt nothing.<br>\r\nMay awoke, startled. She had just had the strangest dream. <br>\r\nSomething about her being Ash and having herself slip into her/him. As <br>\r\nshe came to, she noticed something strange. On her body was a complete <br>\r\nset of Ash's clothes, down to the underwear. In fact, it was the exact <br>\r\noutfit he had been wearing that day! She scanned the clearing and <br>\r\nfound no sign of Ash anywhere.<br>\r\n\"He must have gone down to the stream or something while I was still <br>\r\nasleep.\" she told herself. She quickly grabbed her pack from a few <br>\r\nfeet away(which she could swear she was just using as a pillow!)and <br>\r\npulled out a spare set of clothing. She dropped Ash's pants and boxers <br>\r\nand pulled up her panties. They were pink and red and had a torchic <br>\r\nprinted on the crotch and \"Real Hottie\" across the back. The underwear <br>\r\nseemed a bit tighter than usual.<br>\r\n\"I think I need to start a new diet.\" she said to herself, grapping <br>\r\nher shorts. The coordinator pulled these over her legs, stretching <br>\r\nthem to the limit.<br>\r\n\"Maybe They're just too small for me now?\" she wondered, getting <br>\r\ncloser to the truth. She bent over to pull off Ash's sweatshirt when a <br>\r\nfigure stepped out of the woods.<br>\r\nMay stared out from the brush. She could see someone going through <br>\r\nher pack. As she pushed her way out of the thicket, she instantly <br>\r\nrecognized the guilty person... It was Ash. And he was in her <br>\r\nclothes!!!  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The laughing spree caused May <br>\r\nto fall to her knees, hugging her chest in a happy pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh now stared, puzzled by what exactly made launched the brunette into an abundance <br>\r\nof laughter. \"Why is Ash laughing,\" said the boy to himself as he started to approach the <br>\r\nnow rolling girl. \"And why is she in my clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh reached May just as she started to wind down. Her chest felt to tight to be used, but <br>\r\nthat was okay because she was now resting happily on her back. Opening her eyes, May <br>\r\nfound an unhappy almost disappointed looking Ash staring down at her. This was when <br>\r\nMay finally got a good view of Ash and how her clothing fit on him. Due to his lack of <br>\r\nbreasts, her red shirt was kind of baggy in certain places. Her tight biker shorts were <br>\r\nstretched tight over the boy's hairy legs, making May wonder if his legs were being cut off <br>\r\nfrom blood. Ash even had her socks and shoes on, which confused her the most because <br>\r\nAsh's feet were at least a size bigger than hers. To finish off the outfit, Ash had even put <br>\r\non May's gloves and bandana giving him a sort of lively... \"girly\" look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash Ketchum,\" began Ash who was glad that May had finally stopped laughing. \"What are <br>\r\nyou doing rummaging through my things and wearing my clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" inquired May as she stood up displaying the torchic panties. \"These are my <br>\r\nclothes, What are you talking about Ash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, me?\" said the black haired boy. \"What are you talking about? I'm May. Ash are you <br>\r\nokay?\" Ash then bent down down and placed his hand against May's forehead. \"Well you <br>\r\ndon't have a fever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I don't have a fever!\" shouted May, \"I'm not the one acting weird. I'm May, <br>\r\nyou're Ash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm May,\" said Ash as he sat down and dug into his pocket. He pulled out a <br>\r\nsmall card and handed it to May. It was May's coordinator card. Everything about it was <br>\r\nnormal, except for where May's picture would be there was a picture of Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay looked the card over and was surprised by the change in the card. \"What the heck is <br>\r\ngoing on,\" whispered May to herself.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His jeans turned a similar navy blue, and shortened slightly until they reached halfway up his shin, then tightened, becoming a pair of women's short trousers. His shoes turned black and transformed into a pair of sandals, revealing red nail polish on his toes as well, before the heel increased to around three inches.

As she stared at her hands feeling her chest, she noticed the skin on the back of them darken, her originally dainty and soft hand becoming stronger and calloused. Her entire body continued to transform, her curves smoothing out and being replaced by angles, changing from feminine to masculine. Three thin lines etched themselves along each cheek, a stylised spiral appeared on her stomach and her hair turned blond. Like Ash, her genitials painfully reversed themselves, becoming a penis and testicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Ash, the only remnants of Dawn the coordinator where the lok in her eyes.</span></div></div>",

His arms and legs became slimmer and his skin became smooth. His hands and feet shrank to petite sizes. His waist caved in and his stomach pushed forward and stayed that way. His hips then flared outwards forming very sexy curves underneath his pants. His penis underneath shrank into his body and formed a pair of ovaries, a vagina, as well as a womb. His butt then expanded to a sexy size, making his pants.a little loose. After that, his chest came to life, expanding to a pretty large size showing underneath his jacket and t-shirt.Now, his clothes don't fit everywhere. His face reshaped and became feminine. His lips became full and his nose became cute. His eyes turned from black to green. His forehead became a little larger. . Then his Adam's apple changed to a girl's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn snickered at her companion's new body, before she felt her own changing. Her small breasts quickly shrank into her body no longer showing underneath her dark over-shirt and white undershirt. She grew a few inches and a little weight. Her arms and legs became stronger as her hourglass figure straightened out tightening her dark over-shirt and white undershirt. Hair appeared in some places on her body and showing under her skirt. Then, a penis grew out of her former vagina sticking out of her panties, and her butt then became smaller loosing her skirt. Her penis is showing underneath her skirt. Now, her clothes don't fit perfectly. Then, her face began to rearrange itself, becoming more masculine. However, her eyes remained blue. A pair of lines appeared on her cheeks.Then her Adam's apple changed to a boy's<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this!\" says Dawn, with her new masculine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly more changes occur. Ash's spiky hair started to smooth out and grow longer. It ended down to near his shoulders. Then, it changed from black to pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding! Pink hair?!\" exclaims Ash with is new feminine voice. Dawn tries to resist the urge to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Dawn's hair started to change. Her blue hair started to shorten and became short. Then, it became spikier, kind of like how Ash's used to be. Then, it changed from blue to blond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, do you think you're becoming a girl and I'm becoming a guy?!\" asks Dawn in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so\" replies Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, Ash and Dawn were now Sakura and Naruto physically.</span></div></div>",

By the time it past his shoulders new changes began to occur. His eyes had become a reddish brown as eyeliner began to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his skin cool and become lighter and paler. At the same time it also became silky smooth too. Ash shuddered as he felt his entire body start to reform. He felt little he was fitting through a very tight space, his shoulders pressed inward giving his body a less wider frame. His stomach tucked itself in and spread out to his lower body. While his feet and calves began to shrink his thighs and hips ballooned out. Ash also felt a breeze between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn please! Stop this!\" he cried in a voice that wasn't his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn was rolling on the ground with laughter as decent sized breasts began to take shape on Ash's chest. All the muscle in his arms were gone and his hands took on a more delicate shape. From the neck down, he looked completely like a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was his face, he felt the bones rearrange themselves all around his jaw and nose. He would have looked like a young woman now to anyone. Ash though it was over until he felt like he was rising in an elevator. His height extended to a full grown woman's size. Dawn was on the verge of wetting herself and Ash blushed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A large gray hooded jacket with white fur at the bottom slowly covered her giggling form. A sly smile crept across Ash's face as he kept quiet about her changes. Dawn's shorts slithered like a snake down her legs, lengthening to a pair of skin tight navy colored pants. Her boots split open like a nut, forming the same bulky blue sandals Ash was wearing. A small pouch guarded with white tape appeared on her right leg. Last to appear was a dark metal headband like the one Ash had on his forehead, only Dawn's was worn around her neck like a handkerchief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn finally was able to control herself. \"Oh- Hahaha- I'm sorry Ash. It's just so- heheheh- funny! I mean, look at you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should take a good look at yourself.\" smiled Ash, still trying to adjust to his new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn's smiled faded in an instant. She stared down at herself and gasped, patting at her new wardrobe. She started playing with her new headpiece and then turned to Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who put these clothes on me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that the million dollar question...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh noticed something odd about Dawn's nose. It seemed to be discolored for some reason, paler than the rest of her skin. It was spreading too! It was almost like someone spilled a drink on the carpet and the color sunk in and expanded, only the carpet was Dawn's face! Her skin wasn't the only thing changing color. Her hair was developing a very dark blue hue that began from the ends of her hair. She hairstyle seemed to change with the alteration in color, becoming shorter with long bangs. Dawn spotted Ash staring at her and dove for a near by puddle of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm changing more!\" she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth her hair and skin were completely changed to a foreign look. Her eyes burned as they became a single shade of white. Her face reformed to match the look of a girl not that much older than her. Ash and Dawn had completely transformed.</span></div></div>",

At first Dawn looked shocked but now she was grinning ear to ear and rocking Ash in her arms. \"Oh Ash your so cute I could just eat you up\" said Dawn with a grin as she got up. \"Come on wittle guy lets go the store and get you some stuff\" said Dawn. \"Dawn put me down\" said Ash but Dawn ignored him. Soon they  were at the poke-mart and Dawn bought a baby bottle, some powdered milk, a vary small pillow and a few other items. Later on they were back where they were on the path and in Dawns tent. \"Ash your so cute I could just eat you up\" said Dawn in a baby voice. \"Dawn this is not funny now help me get back to normal\" said Ash. \"Oh hush now you just cranky cause you hungry\" said Dawn. \"I am not\" said Ash as Dawn put a bottle of milk in his mouth. \"And look what I have here for you\" said Dawn as Ash finished his bottle she took out five pink hair ribbons. \"What are those?\" asked Ash. \"Five wittle bows for the five wittle spikes on your cute wittle head\" said Dawn as she tied the bows on Ash then she decided to ___________.</span></div></div>",

As Ash opened his eyes again he noticed he was no longer with dawn, but in another route. He got up and looked around, he was sure he had seen this area before on his travels. He snapped his fingers as he say a ryhorn \"Ah yes i remember, this looks like the safari zone from kanto, but how did i get here, that stone but be a kind of teleportation item\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he wondered how this could of happened he failed to notice his body slowly change, His structure becoming shorter and shorter. Deciding it would be best to get to a phone to call Dawn Ash began to search for an exit from the Safari zone. as he walked along he continued to shrink, his clothes feeling oddly loose on his body. Cute pink fur began to slowly grow on his hands. However it didn\u2019t stay there as it began to crawl up his arm, slowly covering Ash's body in short pink fur. Ash scratched his arm, feeling a slight itch and jumped in shock as he felt the feeling of fur against fur, He stared at his arms as it spread onward to his chest, already covering his legs. \"What\u2019s going on?\" Ash shivered, feeling the last of the pink fur cover every inch of his body \"The stone must cause hallucinations that must be it\" he told himself, not willing to believe what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sat down trying to rethink the situation, he couldn\u2019t go past the guards\u2019 a big pink fluffed human, he would have to wait till night if he didn\u2019t want to make a fool of himself. As he sat there his body suddenly burst into change, His arms and legs began to shrink at a alarming rate, making ash yelp, as he reached the size of a Chansey. His trousers and boxers slid of with the size change making Ash blush as he tried to get up to put them back on but as he tried to take a step his changing legs made him slap. He looked back just in time to see his 2 legs disappear and leaving his feet, which changed too as the toes merged together into big waddle feet, a darker shade of pink then the rest of his body,  his arms had shrunk too, now mere stubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was freaking out, now calling for help, but nowone but the other safari pokemon could hear him. Without warning his body began to feel under pressure, but also bloated at the same time. suddenly Ash\u2019s head began to push down, making him grunt with fear as his head and torso formed into one shape. As his nose began to disappear his body began to grow again, but this time not in size but in weight. His stomach grumbled as he got fatter and fatter. his entire body was changing shape. He continued to fatten until he was almost like the shape of a big egg. His hair suddenly shuffled and split as it moved to the sides of his head, as they grew out into long strands of pink hair. His stomach itched horrible as Ash scratched it, suddenly feeling his egg pouch grow, he stared down over his round body not recognizing what his body was \"I-Im becoming a Chansey?\" He stuttered hardly believing his eyes, he suddenly doubled in pain as a short tail began to grow right above his rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked exactly like a Chansey now, however nature had to make the new Chansey in the image of other Chanseys. Ash groaned suddenly feeling a pressure in his groin area. He wriggled and moaned loudly, as his penis disappeared into him, his insides reforming into female reproductive organs With all Chanseys being 100% female Ash didn\u2019t have much chance of escaping his, or rather HER new future as a female. Ash panted heavily feeling the last changes in her body take place that allowed her to lay many eggs. As the changes in her body finally came to an end, Ash pushed himself into a sitting position again looking over her new body \"Ohgod what happened to me. im a Chansey, a-and female....i need to find dawn or get to professor oak before its to late.\" She said in a clearly higher pitched voice as she got up and tried once more to find a way out of there. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only was she no longer human, but she was no longer even male. She waddled about awkwardly, her feet making cuteish squeaking noises as her head tassels swished about some. She huffed and puffed to herself as she pouted a little but, \"This is so embarrassing...becoming a Chansey like this! I'm supposed to become a pokemon master not a pokemon!\" She whimpered a little as she waddled through the high grass, suddenly spotting a human shape nearby. \"H...hey! Someone's here! Maybe they can help! Ash would waddle closer, waving her stubby little arms softly, trying to get the figure's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course this would prove to be the opposite of what Ash wanted however. She would be noticed, but unfortunately the figure in question was that of a familiar looking pink haired woman in a nurse's uniform. It was a Nurse Joy, or one of her sisters at least. The woman smiled warmly as she laid her eyes on the Chansey, her hand softly against her face, \"Oh my goodness! Just what I was looking for, how lucky am I?\" Joy smiled happily, placing her hand on her set of safari balls, tossing one suddenly at the pokegirl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh would blink some, still waving her arms some, \"Hey! I need some help, can you hear me?!\" Ash would frown a little, wondering why the woman wasn't paying attention before suddenly feeling an odd sensation. Her body seemed to flash red as she gasped in surprise, finding herself being sucked downward into a strange spherical object, though it wouldn't be hard for her to realize what it was, \"A..ah! A safari ball?!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy watched eagerly as the Chansey was sucked inside the ball, the sphere softly beginning to wriggle one time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was fighting her hardest to get out, but would find it incredibly hard to do so. She wriggled as good as she could, her arms flailing within the ball as she whimpered some, \"N..no way this can't be...I can't be caught!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy's smile grew wider as she tensed up on the second wriggle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh continued to fight, trying her best to escape the ball. She didn't want to be someone's pokemon...she didn't want to be a Chansey! She didn't want any of this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK! Nurse Joy squealed in delight as she rushed over, picking the ball up in her hands and gushing over it. \"I did it! I got a Chansey all my own! Now I can finally start my own Pokecenter! Hehe, maybe I should let her out to thank her...\"</span></div></div>",

As Ash re-appeared she looked around slightly confused before Joy came out of nowhere and hugged her \"Oh my god, thanks for being my Pokemon Chansey!\" she giggled happily still not believing she had found a Chansey this easily. Ash's face blushed a little at this sudden hug before she flailed her short arms again \"Nonono im no a Chansey, im a human cant you help me please I don\u2019t want to be a pokemon\" she winced, However Joy didn\u2019t seem to understand what she was saying, all that was coming out of Ash's mouth was her name: Chansey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh wanted to run away, she most definitely didn\u2019t want to become a nurse, she wanted to be a pokemon master. But for some reason when she wanted to run her big feet didnt respond, She was Joys pokemon now and she only be able to run away if ordered to do so or if she released her, but what where the chances of someone releasing a Chansey, a pokemon as rare as she was. Joy broke the hug and petted Ash, sending mixed feelings of pleasure threw her body as she accidentally giggled cutely in response to it making Ash blush even more. Joy giggled too and walked to the exit of the safari zone \"C\u2019mon Chansey we need to get our centre started up\" she chimed as Ash couldn\u2019t do anything but follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked threw town Ash felt more and more embarrassed at everyone looking at her, seeing she had no clothes on, and looked so cute and fluffy. A few people stopped Joy and congratulated her on her rare find. All Ash could think about was how to get out of this mess. there had to be something she could do. However right now it looked like she was going to have to spend her life nursing. Joy noticed Chanseys worried look and petted her again, forcing a soft smile onto her face \"Don\u2019t worry Chansey it will be fun for both of us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they arrived at the centre... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked around, noticing he was in some kind of office, his desk practically covered with paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I...?\" he asked aloud. He stood up out of the chair he found himself in, but wobbled unsteadily. Looking down, he saw why; his feet were strapped into a pair of black high heeled sandals, which let him see his toenails were now painted a cherry red. He also noticed that he was wearing a pair of dark blue women's trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning as fast as he could in his heels, Ash quickly found a mirror on the wall and was horrified upon seing himself. A grey kimono-like blouse covered his torso, with a dark obi keeping it closed. But what really scared hm was the way his face had been made up; bright red lipstick matching his toenails (and, he soon noticed, his fingernails) and black eyeliner made his face look more feminine, as did the two short ponytails his hair had been tied into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh panicked and started to look around; he couldn't let anyone see him like this!</span></div></div>",

One minute your talking, the next your out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh Who're you...?\" Ash aske as he arose from off the ground. He noticed he was wearing strange clothes and was in a building of somesort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto Uzumaki, your pupil, the future Hokage of Konoha, y'know?\" Naruto explained.

Is that like a Pokemon Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You must not be feeling well. I better take you to see Granny Tsunade!\" Naruto exclaimed, grabbing Ash's hand and dragging him along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait! Hold on now!\" The pokemon trainer exclaimed as he was dragged. It was hard walking in his new, strange shoes while still disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto took him up a flight of stairs, Ash began to wonder where Pikachu and Dawn were.

Muffled, Ash tried to break his face away from whatever he landed in. To his shock and embarrassment, he was groping a rather large pair of breasts that belonged to...Dawn!!!??? At least, her face and hair were just like Dawn's but the woman's body was completely different. More mature one might say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dawn' sighed, grabbed Ash by the collar and tossed Ash on a nearby couch with a frightening amount of strength as Naruto stood in the doorway snickering. She pointed at the boy and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jiraiya appears to have had a little too much to drink, Naruto. I'll deal with him.\" She slammed the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to face Ash and he weakly put up his hands in defense. \"P-please, I'm sorry Miss! I-I didn't mean to land on you like that! I don't even know where I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the woman laughed. \"Relax Ash, I know it's you. It's good to see you again, for days now I thought I was stuck here alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Dawn? So it is you! I almost didn't recognize you for a second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn laughed again and held up her chest. \"You must mean these. You're one to talk about hard to recognize, Mister. Grey-hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ash looked in the mirror in the room and saw himself. He was in the some pretty goofy looking traditional Japanese clothing. But the most distinguished feature was his hair, now long and white like an old man's. He grabbed a handful of it to see if this was for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...old!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, a little over fifty as a matter of fact. The person they see me as, Lady Tsunade, is apparently the same age as you. According to Naruto's big mouth though, she uses some sort of anti-age magic to hide it though. A little deceitful if you ask me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Dawn what's going on? And why do you know so much about this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"Let me explain then. Apparently when you touched the stone we both got wrapped to this alternate dimension, filled with ninjas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-ninjas? What about Pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't exist here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Thought Ash. \"So much for seeing Pikachu and the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn continued. \"I woke up about a week ago like...this. And slowly tried to piece together what happened and where we are. Seems like I'm some sort of leader for a village of these guys. You on the other hand are an old hermit and a teacher for that Naruto kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh interrupted. \"How come I had to be the hermit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn stared back at him with a glare. \"Would you like to switch? These things are killing me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat-dropping, Ash calmly replied. \"No thanks...But that doesn't answer the biggest question. How do we get back home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was kind of waiting for you this whole time hoping you still had that stone. You have it right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Ash quickly checked his pockets.</span></div></div>",

And looking around, saw that Dawn was nowhere to be seen. \"What just happened?\" he wondered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he saw that his clothes had changed. Instead of his own, he was now wearing a red dress with a belt around his waist, a pair of brown gloves on his hands, a pair of white and brown girls shoes, and on his head was a feminine pink cowboy-like hat on his head. He was dressed like a girl! He was very embarrassed by this. \"What is going on here? Why am I suddenly dressed like this?\" he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood there in confusion, he noticed something strange. It was something that he would not expect to see consider how hot it felt. He watched as a snowflake fell down from the sky and land on the ground. And that wasn't all. Several more followed after it. And as that happened, the temperature suddenly shifted dramatially, and it became freezing. He gripped himself, and shivered. Wondering what to do, he saw another girl running towards him. Ash became embarrassed at being seen like this, but before he could say anything, the girl grabbed his wrist and dragged her with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Mimi! We've got to get out of this blizzard!\" the girl said as she pulled him into a cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did she just call me 'Mimi'?\" Ash thought to himself in confusion.</span></div></div>",

Without warning, she felt her panties change texture and become thick. She had done enough baby-sitting to know that she was wearing a diaper, even if she had not experienced the feeling of wearing one she was a baby herself. She knew her skirt would not be long enough to cover the diaper, growing red at the thought of Ash or anyone else seeing her like this. As the light faded, she gripped the bottom of her skirt, trying to pull it down enough to cover her diaper. However, she was surprised to notice that Ash was nowhere to be found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Dawn, what's taking you so long?\" A familiar voice stated from five or so yards away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn was surprised to see May pop up from a bush, partially shielding her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you finished getting dressed yet? We need to go.\" May stated lowering her hand from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May? But...where's Ash?\" Dawn stated, temporarily forgetting her new undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash? We've been traveling together alone for two weeks, Dawn? Are you feeling okay?\" May questioned, looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh yeah...just tired, I guess...\" Dawn stated, trying to make sense of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, let's get goin-...Dawn...are you wearing what I think you're wearing...?\" May asked cautiously, not believing what she was seeing poking out from Dawn's skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I...\" Dawn stuttered, face turning redder and redder, \"It..uh, it's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn looked at the stone she was holding, noticing that it had dulled into a standard stone, no longer glowing. She slipped it into hr backpack while she tried to think of an excuse, hoping it would be able to help her return, later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I\"...Dawn continued, weakly, no excuse coming to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking matters worse, Dawn felt herself involuntarily releasing her bladder, audibly splashing against the plastic of the diaper. She was nervous enough for it to happen involuntarily anyway, but she was sure that it was also the cause of the mysterious stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn...you just...\" May stated, not knowing how else to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn had no idea what to do. She could either try explaining the truth, but most likely just be dismissed as crazy and institutionalized, or she could lie and pretend that she had recently realized a physical need to wear them, even if that was embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, May, you see...\" Dawn started...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ok,\" Ash said, hurrying up his pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two hurried towards Dawn house, her shrinking speeding up as they ran. After awhile, Ash had to carry Dawn, because she was too short to keep up, especially with her clothes collapsing around her. By the time they had reached her house, she was only up to Ash's knees, but her shrinking had completely stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel that feeling of my body collapsing anymore\" Dawn stated, her head popping out of her shirt's collar, \"I guess I won't be getting any smaller than this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two entered her house, her mother sitting in the living room reading a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ash, it's good to see you.\" She stated, looking up from her book, \"Uh, but where's Dawn? And what are those clothes that you're holding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Dawn lost her footing on Ash's arm, and slipped through her massive skirt, her underwear wrapped around her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Dawn!? Is that you? What happened?\" Her mother questioned, looking at the small stature of her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I just started shrinking and it finally stopped at this height.\" Dawn stated, looking embarrassed, \"I'm going to need new clothes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, let's get you dressed first before we worry about anything else.\" She replied, \"Ash, why don't you go in the kitchen and make some lunch, dear, I'm sure this is awkward for both of you. Dawn, go into your room and wait there, I'll go to the attic and get some old clothes and meet you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn grabbed the rest of her clothes from Ash, and tried to wrap them around herself as well, merely creating an odd set of robes that were unstable and likely to fall off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, here, this should be easier...\" Dawn's mother said, scooping her daughter off the ground and cradling her like a child, the clothes wrapping around her resembling something of a blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up the stairs and carefully placed her daughter on the floor in her room, Dawn staring at all her now large possessions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait here and I'll be right back\", She stated, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn continued looking around, allowing the clothes to fall off her body now that she was alone. She walked over to her old teddy bear, marveling at its size compared to her. Dawn laid against its large, plush body, feeling comfortable for the first time since she started diminishing. Dawn's mother walked into the room at that time, smiling at the scene as she closed the door behind her. Dawn looked up, blushing a bit, both at her childish action, and at her own nudity. Dawn's mother was carrying a bundle of clothing, though Dawn couldn't make out what they looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, come on\" Dawn's mother stated, lifting Dawn up, \"Hmm, here should be good\", She placed her down on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the bundle on the chair below the desk, out of Dawn's eyesight. It seemed like more than was needed, based on the size, but Dawn was not sure if that was just a trick her mind was playing on her. Dawn's mother said nothing as she carefully laid Dawn down, confusing her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, Mom-\" Dawn said, getting cutoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be quicker if you don't talk, dear.\" Her mother said, clearly trying to avoid conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down towards the clothing bundle, and grabbed something, lifting it above the table. It was a plastic container of something, but Dawn could not tell what it was. Suddenly, her mother sprinkled the powdery contents of the container onto Dawn's privates, befuddling the teen. Her mother reached towards the bundle again, grabbing an object and causing a crinkling sound as it moved. Dawn looked confused at first, but her face turned bright red as the object came into her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-is that...?\" Dawn muttered, realization of what the powder was sinking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just lucky I didn't throw out the last pack when I started potty training you,\" Her mother stated, showing off the little Castform design on the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! I just shrunk down to the size of a small child, I didn't get any younger!\" Dawn shouted, sitting up and blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd act this way...\" Her mother sighed, \"Listen, dear, until we get this fixed, you ARE the size of a small child. These are the only types of clothes that are going to fit you, unless you want to walk around, dragging a pair of underwear with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, still...I...\" Dawn muttered, trying to think up a counter-argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides\", Her mother continued, \"At this size, you won't be able to use the toilet, and I won't risk you falling in and drowning\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn's face grew pale as her mother spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...want me to USE that...thing, too!?\" Dawn questioned, pointing to the diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until we get you fixed, dear.\" Her mother replied, \"It's the only safe alternative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn wanted to fight and wanted to scream, but merely laid back down, preparing herself for what was to come. Her mother took that as a signal to continue, even though her daughter was reluctant. She slid the diaper under Dawn, and taped up the sides. Dawn was amazed at how thick it was, her legs unable to come together due to the girth. Her mother than slid a red T-shirt with a Psyduck on it over her head and into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The little Castforms turn to their Water form when you're wet.\" Her mother teased, eliciting nothing a strong glare in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, I've had Ash getting your lunch ready while I got you dressed, so let's go down and get you some food\" Her mother stated, lifting Dawn up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, what about pants!?\" Dawn shouted, \"I can't go downstairs like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, dear, this was all I could find\" Her mother stated, \"Ash would have to find out sooner or later, so it might as well be now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn sighed as her mother carried her downstairs, and past the living room. As they entered the kitchen, Dawn saw a confused looking Ash, the table off to the side and out of Dawn's sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, I set it up\" Ash stated, seeing Dawn's mother, \"Not that-Dawn, what are you wearing...\" Ash burst out laughing seeing Dawn wearing the baby t-shirt and diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, you-\" Dawn shouted, her mother placing a hand over her mouth to stop the yelling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is her only choice until we fix this,\" Her mother said, \"Please be considerate of her...condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, sorry...\" Ash mumbled, \"Though I understand why you wanted me to set that up now\" Ash glanced over at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn turned at looked at the table, sighing at what she saw. </span></div></div>",

After about an hour, Dawn blushed as she realized that she had to relieve herself. Her bladder kept pushing her to go, but she blushed, not knowing what she should do.</span></div></div>",

Then, slowly, the changes moved up his legs. He could feel them becoming smooth and shapely before letting out a gasp as his manhood suddenly got pulled into his body before it quickly morphed into woman hood.  As this was happening, Ash saw that his blue jeans had changed into a pair of white girl's pants and that his drawers had morphed into a silk pair of panties, making him blush brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll never get used to this.\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned as he felt a tinge of pain from his ovaries and female reproductive organs forming into place within him, now her, just as her stomach and back curved inward.

She got back into her regular clothes and put the formal set back onto the rack.

Still, he blushed brightly, he knew this was just the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I remember the character, Tea, correctly, she dresses very professionally.\" whispered Ash. \"Maybe, after this is done, I can change into my regular clothes before anyone sees me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh paused, feeling black T-shirt shrinking and changing shape. He knew what it was about to become, as his clothes had been transformed before, and sighed upon feeling the caged sensation of wearing a black lace bra. With only his open jacket to cover it up, Ash was relieved when it lightened in thickness, becoming two garments. First was a light blue shirt to cover his new bra and the other was a blue, light women's jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's almost over.\" thought Ash, still blushing. \"Why can't this stone turn my clothing into something manly for a change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was Ash's briefs, which lightened in texture and shrank, becoming a pair of white lace panties before his socks shrank into ankle highs and his tennis shoes changed into black mary janes. The clothing transformation was over, Ash was now wearing Tea's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A guy can really get to resent this.\" he whispered to himself. \"I hope I can change into my regular clothes before that stone decides to change something else or worse, one of my friends see me wearing girl's clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Ash, one of his fears was about to come true...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They figured nothing would be, but in the wondrous and sometimes zany world they lived in, they still felt the urge to check.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssured that nothing was wrong with them, the two turned their attention to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" both of them asked in unison.  \"I'm fine,\" answered the two again in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think that was Ash?\" asked Dawn, still concerned about what the flash may have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looked like an evolutionary stone flash.  Or it was very similar at the least,\" answered Ash as he looked over the stone that now sat in his hands.  \"We should go ask someone in the next town about it.  Maybe someone around here has an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea Ash,\" answered Dawn as she spun in the direction of the next town and started on the way.  After placing the stone in his bag, Ash followed after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later the two decided to take a short break.  Walking off the main road a little, they were able to find a small clear in where they could set up camp.  A few minutes later, the two companions had set up a small camp and had set about making a bit of lunch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Ash set about looking over a pot of stew, Dawn was beginning to feel strange.  She felt as if something was scratching at the back of her mind, telling her to do something.  It was calling her, begging her, but she could not hear it.  She also found her boots becoming uncomfortable and, oddly enough, her butt was actually itching.  Her hands clinched themselves as they pawed one another.  She wanted to distance herself from... from... something.  She did not know what, but she had to do it quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash... I'ma... nya~.  I'm gonna take care of something...  Be right back,\" said Dawn as she started to walk towards the edge of the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but be back soon.  The stew will be ready soon,\" called Ash who was too fixated on the boiling pot to notice Dawn had already passed the treeline and was now in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Dawn do, fight or accept?</span></div></div>",

As she lurched over, hands on her knees and rear in the air, a small rip catches her ear, followed by an alien sensation from her spine and the cool air on her bum. After a few dry heaves that warrant no result, she stands back up to see the commotion, and nearly stumbles and falls at the sight. \"I... Is that... a tail?! Nya?\" Certainly enough, a grey tabby tail extending five feet from her rear was lifting up the rear of her skirt, showing off her bum to any forest critters (or ninja) that cared. Dawn, wholly embarrassed, tries to hold the seat of her skirt down, but her excited state is keeping her tail hiked. Just then, she felt a pulling on her ears. Taking her hands from skirt, she kneels down and opens her satchel, finding a mirror. With it, she watches as her now almost elven ears start to widen and move up her head, grey hairs slowly accruing on its surface. \"What... is... going... <b>ON</b>!!\" Dawn yells, the racket reverberating through the forest, and through her newly super sensitive ears. As the ears finish their migration, they knock her hat off her head. In trying to catch it, she instinctively snares the headband on the end of her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Dawn's yelling catches Ash's attention, and he comes running. As Ash starts to close, Dawn's chest swells, reaching DD size, her top seemingly stretching and morphing to accommodate her new bustline. Dawn starts shaking her head again. \"Nya, Feel so weird... It's like something keeps telling me to go somewhere and do something... But I don't want to...\" Ash shows as another flash lights the area...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, an ominous grey fog lifts from her, the desires filling her mind faded away into nothingness, leaving her mind unclouded. \"What was that...\" She uttered, taking her hat off her tail and trying to put it back on her head, but her new ears wouldn't have it. Finally, she tucked them under the hat, but it was uncomfortable, and her ears popped up sending her hat flying up. Dawn groaned, and busted out some scissors &amp; thread, and with some deftness made some slits in her favorite hat for her cat ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother draft up her skirt across her rear reminded her of her tail lifting her skirt up. Looking around to make sure there were no looky-loos, she removed the miniskirt and cut a hole in the rear and sewed the material taut to prevent unraveling. Dawn slipped it back on, sliding her tail through the new tail hole in the miniskirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's better, but still, what happened to me?\" Dawn pondered, wiggling her tail about, trying to adjust to the new limb. Suddenly, Ash bursts out of the bushes and into the area Dawn had transformed in. \"Dawn, what's wrong?! I heard your scream... Hey, you got a tail? What's going on? Are you a ditto? If you are, I'm going to catch you!!\" He grabs a pokeball as Dawn grabs her forehead and shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Ash, I'm not a Ditto. I don't know what happened, but suddenly I wanted to come out here, and then grew these ears and this tail. I'm still confused... Ash?\" The grey fog from before sucks itself into Ash's orifices, and Dawn begins to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich way will he go?</span></div></div>",

Dawn only stares back at him, realizing what just happened to her was about to happen again, but what she didn't know was there to be an extra act this time. Ash blanks out as an orange furred tail rips out of the seat of his jeans. As his ears started to change, Dawn noticed Ash's hips widen and his waist shrank. \"Huh?\" Dawn exclaimed, tail hiking up in curiosity. Dawn walked closer to the somewhat zombified Ash as his face began to feminize, lips becoming pouty, nose becoming button-like and petite, eyes growing larger and more expressive, eyelashes growing, and eyebrows thinning as cheekbones and other features became softer and narrower. Once the ears hit the top of his head, knocking his hat off, Dawn began to notice Ash's vest beginning to tent outward, much like how her shirt and vest did when she changed. \"Holy Houou!! It's turning Ash into a girl!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash's new breasts finished their growth at an astounding E-cup size (espicially for a 12-year old), <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">his</span> her clothes started shifting. \"What now?! Ash... ASH!! Wake up!!\" Dawn was getting very concerned. This was different. Apparently, since whatever had changed had to make Ash a girl, it must be adjusting Ash's clothes, Dawn concluded. She could only sit back and watch as Ash's jeans separate at the knees as his vest and shirt merge, the sleeves of the shirt shrinking away. His new shirt shrank further, becoming a taut tank top with the same coloration as the vest. The upper portion of the jeans shriveled up, the legs fusing together as the fabric changed from denim to polyester, and began pleating up, forming a blue tartan pleated miniskirt, complete with a tail hole in the rear. The lower half of the former jeans slid down to her knees and turned white. Creases form in it as it turns into wool, as ornate cherry trees and sakura blossoms begin decorating the sock-like leg warmers. Finally, although partially obscured by the leg warmers, Ash's shoes were still tennis shoes, but now looked more feminine, and had a thicker heel and sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried the strange instinct she felt before would overtake Ash, Dawn, grits her teeth, lowers her stance, draws back, and screams, \"<b>I SAID 'COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!!' NOW LET ME SEE THOSE EYES OPEN!!</b>\" Dawn slams her fist into Ash's jaw with all her might, an uppercut for the record books. Ash is sent flying backwards, landing on her ass. The jarring blow and subsequent impact on her bum snaps Ash out of the trance of the change. The strange grey fog leaves Ash, changing color to pink and flittering out of sight above them, as though to watch them. \"Why did you hit me, Dawn?\" Ash yelled, suddenly covering his mouth after hearing the mezzo-soprano voice coming from her mouth. Dawn pulls out a mirror and says, \"I figure it'll be quicker if I show you than try to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn hands Ash the mirror, and the shock of what she sees makes her lightheaded. A cute, clearly female face was staring back at him, with two large orange cat ears on her head. Interestingly though, the girl's hair was the same as his own. Clearly in shock, Dawn confirms her suspicions. \"Whatever changed me... changed you too, and made you a girl at the same time. You also tranced out while it happened. If I hadn't of decked you, you would of felt a strange urge to go somewhere. Did you feel an urge to go somewhere?\" Ash, still in shock, looking over her new body and wardrobe, simply nods. \"What's going on...?\" Ash says, scared, almost in tears. Dawn holds her, saying, \"I don't know. Best thing I can think of is head home to Twinleaf Town and ask Professor Rowan for help.\"</span></div></div>",

Exhausted, the stone dropped down from Ash's and Dawn's hand.<br>\r\nBoth trainers looked at each other in confusion and then back at the bizarre yet peculiar stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that all about?\" questioned Ash.<br>\r\n\"That was the weirdest light show ever.\" replied Dawn, shrugging her shoulders before heading back onto the main road. \"C'mon Ash, let's head on over to Sandgem Town before it gets dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEying the stone one last time, Ash simply turned away and caught up to Dawn as they continued their journey towards town. The horizon was drunken with shades of fiery red, orange and golden yellow as the sun began to hide beneath the trees, signalling the end of the day. The forest had grown silent and was gradually getting darker. This was as far as both trainers were going to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make camp here.\" Dawn exclaimed, placing her bag down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgreeing with her plan, Ash began building the tent. While he unraveling the plastic sheet, he noticed something \"odd\" with Dawn. He stopped constructing the pylons of the tent and approached her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Dawn?\"<br>\r\nLighting the campfire, Dawn stood up and answered. \"Yes, Ash?\"<br>\r\n\"Umm... is it me or did you grow a bit taller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up tall, Ash began measuring his height against Dawn. Dawn, who was normally just a few centimeters off Ash's height, was now at least 5-7 inches (15 - 17 centimeters) taller than him. Not only was Dawn's height a bit odd but her build was become a bit more curvaceous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, a bit taller? Yeah, I'm taller.\" Dawn replied with a light chuckle as Ash constantly checked his height and shoulder height against Dawn's. \"Well, I am a growing child after all. Maybe it's just a growth spurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, but growth spurts like that don't happen instantaneously!</i> Ash said to himself mentally before dismissing the idea altogether. With the tent finally built, sleeping bags rolled out and a warm campfire burning in the middle of them, both trainers basked within it's warmth next to each other. Though Dawn was blissfully comfortable sitting next to him, Ash couldn't help but ponder over the weird stone and Dawn's sudden changes. Recalling the events in his mind as he dazed into the campfire, he suddenly felt a rough nudge push against his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Thud!</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ash, you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of his trance, Ash picked himself off the ground and looked over towards a worried Dawn who was now becoming more voluptuous than the last time. In addition to her shape-shifting build, Dawn's clothes were awfully becoming overstretched. He could see multiple tear marks near the side of her black n' pink dress along with some cleavage bulging at the top and pink panties being revealed below her incredibly tight, short skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Since when did she become more... womanly?</i> Ash commented to himself, staring from Dawn's new inflated, firm breasts up to her eyes which were slowly turning into a shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"World to Ash? Hello Ash? Can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh? What?\" Ash responded, shaking his head.<br>\r\n\"Geez, what's wrong with you.\" Dawn exclaimed. \"I kept calling out to you but it looked like you were stoned there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching out her hand to help him up, a loud ripping noise ruptured throughout the campsite. Ash's face was completely stunned. Dawn's face was tomato red as she peered at her clothes which almost in twain thanks to the massive rips along the side of her dress. Immediately, she slapped Ash away frantically as she began to recover her falling pieces of her once dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash! Don't look at me!\" yelled Dawn, trying to shoo him away. \"Damn, I gotta have to buy more clothes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What in Acreus' name is going on?</i> Ash wondered, seeing Dawn's awkwardly new body changes.</span></div></div>",

From time to time, he would peep from the entrance flaps of the tent to see Dawn's blossoming <i>\"beauty\"</i> only to be yelled at harshly by her or get hit straight in the face by one of her solid punches. One thing he did catch from one of his peeping moments was Dawn's hair. Her long dark blue that had yellow clips holding parts of her hair was shifting. The shade of her hair was growing darker and darker, no longer resembling any color of blue but instead a monotonous black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow clips hoisting up sections of her long hair, both instantaneously snapped as her hair began to shift and extend itself. Her hair, growing wildly underneath her white beanie, began moving downwards passing her shoulder and waist till it slowed down it's progress, ending itself near the tip of her curvaceous, bare cheeks of her butt. But Dawn was still unaware of the changes that were occurring as she scrambled to acquire whatever pieces of fabrics that was trying to cover up her exposure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I should check one more time.</i> Ash concocted in his mind, creeping ever so closely to the flaps of the tent. His fantasies that were non-existent when he was around the regular Dawn were now overflowing his mind, intoxicating and poisoning his mind with perverted images of his dear friend. Extending his pinkie towards the crack of the tent, he gulped and began bending towards the exit-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Ash Ketchum, you pervert! I know you're about to peep at me again!!\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBusted! Ash frantically scrambled to the backside of the tent. Sweating profusely, he tried to calm himself down and answered back. \"No- No, I'm not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're lying right there!\" scolded Dawn. \"Your dirty mind gives it away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hang on! How can she read my mind?</i> Ash pondered to himself. <i>No, I'm overthinking it. She just got lucky there.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dawn, weird question but what am I thinking now?\" asked Ash as he recomposed himself. <br>\r\n\"How can I read your mind and how you're testing out your assumption to see if it's right, right?\" Dawn answered.<br>\r\n<i>Second time lucky? That can't right!</i><br>\r\n\"And now your thinking how I got that right?\" Dawn further answered.<br>\r\n<i>Holy mother of- !!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn poked her head inside the tent, spooking Ash as he stumbled backwards and landed on the ground. Her haunting red eyes was piercing straight into his soul as he trembled in fear. Somehow, this feeling of fear, he felt as if he had known it from somewhere. But from where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, I'm gonna need your jacket.\" ordered Dawn, eying his pale face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently nodding his head, he complied to her request. He took off his jacket and nervously passed it towards Dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ash.\" thanked Dawn. \" Umm- are you feeling okay. It's almost as if you seen a ghost-\"<br>\r\nI'm fine!\" interjected Ash. \"I'm totally fine! Fine as fine can be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow, Dawn rolled her piercing red eyes and left him alone inside the tent. Huddling towards the corner of the tent, Ash began rocking back and forth in an attempt to shake off the restlessness of gazing at her eerie red eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>That's definitely not a growth spurt right there!

Ash, frightened by what's happening to his friend, tried to calm himself down and work up any remaining form of courage that was lingering within him. It was just an appearance change right? Nothing bad would happen to him, right? Underneath all those changes, she's just Dawn! Ash smiled to himself as nodded to all those statement his mind made up. Standing up from his pitiful huddled up self, Ash approached towards the exit of the tent where he opened the flaps wide open and ventured forth towards the-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, about time you came out of that tent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's face exploded a bright red shade. Sitting in front of the campfire was Dawn, in a body of at least a young semi-naked 20 something-year-old female. Her top was exposing her massive C maybe borderline D-cup breasts along with some revealing cleavage from above and below her bosoms. Heck, even his jacket was not helping with covering up her bare, naked top. Her hourglass figure was so curvaceous, it almost perfect! At bottom, no longer was her cute pink panties there but instead a white frilled laced, black seductive lingerie, wrapped comfortably around the waist and in between. Her long, slender yet graceful legs. <b>It was literally a sight for sore eyes!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I, where, wah you...\" Ash stammered with a dumbfound personality as his eyes were locked on the beauty that was sitting in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry, I had to borrow your jacket.\" apologized Dawn, alluring the withdrawn yet heavily blushing Ash with her red eyes. \"My bra broke and none of my dresses could fit me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh- It-it-it's fine. Fine. Fine.\"<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you got a spare pair of jeans that I could borrow. It feels kinda cold out here.\"<br>\r\n\"Jeans- yes, yes. I got some. There- uh, there should be...\"<br>\r\n\"Ash, you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his journey, Ash never thought about girls. He was a one-track kind of guy, always setting his eyes for being a Pokemon Master. Not one single thought about girls tainted his pure mind, that is until his mind got derailed by tonight. Scurrying towards his backpack, Ash quickly grabbed any pair of jeans he could find in his bag and quickly lunged them towards Dawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gotta think of something else. Pure thoughts, anything!!</i> Ash thought to himself while attempting to avert gazing upon Dawn's <b><i>incredible</i></b>, <b><i>seductive</i></b>, <b><i>voluptuous</i></b>,<b> <i>amazing</i></b>- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell there goes his one-track mind there. And the whole train carriage with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping into his pair short, tight skinny jeans, Dawn invited Ash over to her. No longer ruled by any scene of conscience, Ash walked on over to where Dawn was and mindlessly sat down close to her. Dawn, smiling joyful, rested her head against his shoulder and hugged his arm tightly. Inside Ash's mind right now, he could hear his best friend Brock crying out to him to get closer to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Set the romantic mood! Cuddle her!\"</i> Brock cried out to him, mentally giving him a thumbs up image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResisting, Ash shook his head continued to stare into the campfire, nodding his head to every word Dawn spoke. His conscience was not out of this battle for control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ash, I'm kinda getting sleepy.\" Dawn whispered into his ear. \"I'm gonna go sleep in the tent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Dawn gently let go of Ash's arm and gracefully walk off towards the tent, taking off her white beanie as it revealed more of her lavishing, flowing black hair. Ash could only just stare blankly at her ravishing, lustful new appearance as she disappeared into the tent. The real struggle for his mind now commenced as both angel and devil mentally appeared inside his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get her!

I can't decide for myself!\" Ash cried to himself due to his indecisiveness.     <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Devilishly, Brock snickered and whispered into Ash's ear giving him suggestions on what to do in front of Dawn. Listening to ever wise advice Brock gave, Ash nodded while revealing a sly smirk before turning towards the tent. Towards his prey. Giving into his 'instinct', he approached the entrance of the tent and began concocting his plan. Snickering underneath his breath, he reached towards the curtain flap of the tent and viciously raised it wide open-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"So you were thinking about doing perverted things to me!!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's expression instantly dropped. No longer wild and acting on instinct. His face became terrified. Terrified to see Dawn who was standing in front of him, semi-naked and arms folded with a severely ticked off expression on her face. Snapping back into his conscience, he sheepishly laughed and bowed his head multiple times as a sign of forgiveness. But his forgiveness was down-right rejected as he saw Dawn's face becoming even more angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, heh, um... I'm sorry.\" Ash answered truthfully yet embarrassingly. \"I think I'm gonna go this way now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer red eyes flared up, bursting into blue flames inside her irises. Her black, silky long hair started to levitated as more blue flames started to coat around her figure, dancing wildly and outrageously. Several tiny will-o-wisps started spinning around her body as Ash's clothes that she was wearing started to twist, turn and fuse together. The fabrics extended around her body as they quickly clothed every single part of her bare body. In an instant, his jacket and his trousers had now become what appears to be a red n' black tamers outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite gloves. Blood red with yellow lines outfit. Oversize black line stretched across her stomach section. Dark stockings and crimson boots. Ash suddenly realized that he had ticked off the last person in this world that he would want to meet. Standing in front of him was the Mistress of Psychic, Gym Leader Sabrina!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear leaped at an insurmountable rate as he began to leg it out of the tent- only to realize that his body wasn't listening to him. Enveloped around his body was a neon glowing blue light, freezing any action that Ash attempted to commit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like gazing at my beautiful appearance, yes?\" coldly questioned Sabrina, no longer having any traces of Dawn's conscience. \"You love it so much that you were thinking of doing perverted things to me, is that correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh tried to talk but his jaw was jammed shut. Only a muffled cried could be heard but it could not interpreted. He tried to shake his head but every muscle in his body was frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm feeling a bit gracious tonight.\" Sabrina continued. Death staring at the helpless trainer with a sinister smile. \"If you love my body so much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was lifted up into the air. His eyes widened in horror as the Mistress of Psychic was about inflict his punishment. Her outstretched hands focused on Ash's stiff body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"...perhaps you would one yourself as well?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh screamed in declination but it was far too late. He could feel his bones crack and break under the pressure. His body's temperature flared up. His face was going red. His body structure was breaking and shifting constantly as they began to take a new form. Ash's body was obeying every single command as Sabrina waved her hands vigorously yet violently. He continued to scream in pain but only indescribable muffled sounds could emerge from his tightened jaw. Emerging from his chest was a large set of erected D-cup breasts. His teenage man torso was degenerated instant and reconstructed in a perfect hourglass figure. His face became smooth and feminine. He couldn't believe his eyes! Just as Sabrina was staring towards below his equator, he constantly pleaded to her to make it stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that? You want me to get rid the very thing that defines your masculinity?\" Sabrina announced in a tormenting tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>No! Don't do that!?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I will gladly dispose of it then!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer outreached, telekinesis hand was grasping his region. Ash could feel it as if she was actually touching it! With one swift crush of he hand. Ash winced in pain as his testicles were plucked off like grapes. Hearing her maniacal laugh, his testicles began to forcefully shrivel back inside his body, forming painful ovaries from within. His manhood started to shred itself like a banana, cruelly stripping itself one by one as it sunk back into his almost feminine body. His masculinity was now completely replaced with a narrow clitoris. His body couldn't take the painful punishment any longer. But the treatment was far from finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thighs, shifted and inflated, giving him child-bearing legs to compliment his new womanhood. Lastly she grasped his throat from a distance with her hand. Ash could talk now! But the only things that were coming out of his luscious lips were screams. Sabrina crushed his throat as he shouted out every remaining manhood. His manly voice was reaching higher and higher until finally his new voice permanently kicked in place. Finishing off his punishment, Sabrina pulled down his hair, forcefully extending itself to the point where it was shoulder-length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Finally...</i>\" Ash said, panting and heaving with his new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said that we're done, dear Ashley?\" Sabrina replied back in a mocking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>We're not done yet!?</b>          </span></div></div>",

Soon the whirlwind of glittery lights gradually dissipated back into the stone, returning the forest and the trainers back to normal. The stone which was resting in the palm of both Ash and Dawn soon plummeted straight down onto the grassy patch in exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That light show was amazing!\" Dawn cried out in joy. \"Let's activate it again!\"<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, try it out!\" Ash cheered her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnthusiastic, Dawn picked up the stone again and began spasmodically shaking the stone in an attempt to start up another breath-taking experience. Ash, who was near Dawn, was roaring out with laughter as Dawn crazily danced up and down with the stone in her right hand. The both of them were laughing and having such a blast that they didn't notice what had occurred. The thin black bracelet with two silver beads that was resting on Dawn's right wrist had widen itself. The beads were no longer existent as it melded back into the bracelet. The soft black material that wrapped around her wrist began to harden, becoming a metal bangle. That metal bangle started to growing thicker and thicker to the point where it looked like a mini weight of a dumbbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn, who was bouncing up and down vigorous energy, was soon completely deprived of energy as she dropped straight down onto the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, so much for trying to get the stone to make that light show.\" Dawn sighed in exhaustion. \"When did my wrist become so heavy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the stone out of Dawn's hand, Ash noticed the new accessory attached to her wrist. \"Hey, that's new. Since when did you buy that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn lifted her right arm and saw the bulky black bangle, which now has a neon green florescent light glowing around the middle. Puzzled but not bothered about it, she replied back to Ash casually. \"I didn't buy this? But doesn't it look pretty, the glowing lights! Shame it doesn't come in pairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked over to her other wrist and was astonished what was happening. Protruding out of her wrist was another black n' green bulky bangle that look exactly identical to the other one. Pointing it out to Dawn, she turned over to other but was rather surprised then shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Matching pairs! That's so awesome!\" Dawn blissfully cheered.<br>\r\n\"But don't you think it's weird?\" Ash exclaimed, not falling for the blissfully ignorant attitude that Dawn was conveying. \"You got those bangles out of nowhere!\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's a stone that grant wishes!\" proclaimed Dawn<br>\r\n\"Oh come on that's not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>RRRIIIIPPPPPP!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud tear echoed throughout the forest. Dawn looked over towards her back and saw a massive horizontal tear in the middle of her black n' pink dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, my dress ripped and it's my favorite one! It's probably getting too small for me.\" cried Dawn.<br>\r\n\"Hey, let's stop to make camp. I'm sure you can get stitched up by then.\" assured Ash as he began unpacking his camping equipment out from his bag.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right. I wish I had some new clothes with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sun setting beyond the horizon and the forest growing darker, both Ash and Dawn diligently worked hard to build up camp. The warm toasty campfire ignited in the middle, tent unfolded and constructed and the sleeping bags rolled, it looked like it was gonna be a peaceful and serene night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ash, I'm gonna take a shower.\" Dawn said, grabbing a \"shower in a can\" from her bag. \"Don't come this way, alright?\"<br>\r\n\"Like I would wanna peep at you nake-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ash could finish, he got hit in the head by Dawn's flying bag before face-planting himself straight into the dirt patch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"You pervert!\"</b> Dawn exclaimed loudly before storming off behind the tent in a huff.<br>\r\n\"What's her problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering from her unexpected attack, Ash lounged around near the warmth of the campfire. Not long after he felt relaxed, he heard Dawn muffled mumbling to herself before calling out for him. Ash turned his head towards the tent and saw Dawn in her-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ash, look what I found!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the top, Dawn was wearing a striped pink camisole, revealing her curvy waist and cute bellybutton. Bottom part was a skinny pair of white trousers and a belt with a hexagon-shaped buckle. Her once pink boots were now replaced with pink loafers to compliment her sudden new attire. All up, Dawn was very ecstatic about her new clothes that she didn't a little strut around in them as if she was posing for the walkway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't so adorable! I love it!\" said Dawn gleeful, posing in front of Ash.<br>\r\n\"Where did you get those clothes?\" he asked, raising an eyebrow at her new wardrobe.<br>\r\n\"I don't know. When I finished showering I turned towards my torn-up dress and there it was! These <i>fabulous</i> clothes appeared!\" she responded in a carefree way.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they kinda look cute on you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh snapped out of his fixated gaze and stood up immediately. New clothes appearing out of nowhere, something was definitely going wrong here! \"Hold up, aren't you a little bit curious as to how those clothes got there? Or how you suddenly got those new bangles without even noticing them in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it, you're just jealous cause you didn't get any new clothes!\" retorted Dawn, glancing over at Ash in a jeering fashion.<br>\r\n\"What? How does it relate to- Look, those clothes could be cursed or something-\"<br>\r\nDawn quickly shut down Ash. <br>\r\n\"And you're telling me to take them off!? No chance pervert! Just for that, you're sleeping outside of the tent!\"<br>\r\n\"What! But-\"<br>\r\n\"But nothing! <b>Good Night!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Dawn stormed off into the tent before zipping up the entrance leaving Ash with a \"what-is-this-I-don't-even\" face. <i>Well, whatever problem Dawn is having, it's not my problem.</i> Ash thought to himself as he huddle in front of the campfire. So much for a peaceful night but little did they know, this was just the start of their predicament.   </span></div></div>",

He reached back, and noticed that his hair was growing at a rather fast rate. Pulling some of it forward, with Dawn watching, he noticed that it had started to lighten as well, from his usuall black to a light-blue colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a strand of it forward to her hair, and noticed that it matched, perfectly, while it continued to grow down Ash's back, to reach the same length as hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your hair...it looks like mine now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh started to say something, but was taken by surprise as he felt himself shrink some. Before, he was a little higher than Dawn...and, now, they stood eye to eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" he said aloud. He was starting to grow quite frightened by this all.</span></div></div>",

His dick and nuts were still there, but it was his underwear that were the problem: They had turned into panties and were crushing his penis. \"What the hell!?\" yelled Ash. \"I've heard of a wardrobe malfunction, but this is just ridiculous!\" Following that outburst, Ash's undershirt changed into a bra, which made Ash freak out even more. \"Dawn, what the fuck is happening to me!?!\" said Ash.

This proved to be a bad decision as his undershirt changed while breasts formed on his chest; Dawn watched in shock at the undershirt rose up and turned white, transforming into a white bra that was ready before the mounds had stopped growing. She watched them fill the small plain bra to a \"T\", and then turned a very shocked Ash around to read the label on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"34A...Same as me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, same as -\" Ash was caught off-guard for a moment, and had to cough a few times. He held his hand to his throat, and felt something collapse and shrink down to nothing, while his throat cleared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Same as you.\" he finished, in a voice that almost perfectly matched Dawn's. He looked down and remembered his new chest, and covered himself up while blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash...I think you're turning into a copy of me!\"</span></div></div>",
