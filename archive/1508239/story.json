Naruto thought \u2018Oh crap, I don\u2019t know where I am.\u2019 After walking around for hours trying to find his way back to the village he gave up and just lied down on the ground exhausted and thought, \u2018So this is how I die huh. It doesn\u2019t matter since no one will miss me besides the old man.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he crawled to a tree to sleep under he saw something in the distance and using his remaining strength he crawled to the clearing and saw a huge mansion. He went towards it and stared in awe. Naruto went to open the door, as soon as he touched the doorknob his hand got cut. Naruto jumped back and screamed. \u201cOUCH WHAT KIND OF RETARD HAS A SPIKED DOORKNOB.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorknob then glowed and the door opened and, after getting over his hiisy fit, he went inside. \u2018THIS PLACE IS FUCKING HUGE\u2019 he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed it was. The place was four stories high, had a living room full of fresh furniture, a kitchen the size of his whole apartment, and the bedrooms were able to fit at least 17 people. So all in all Naruto was shocked. With energy he didn\u2019t even know he had he had he started running through the house looking at everything his blue eyes could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got back downstairs after looking at the whole house he noticed a picture and looked at it. It was a picture of a man with long spicky blonde hair in a standard jonin outfit except he was wearing a whit trenchcoat with red flames at the bottom and the kanji for \u2018fourth\u2019 in the middle. Next to him was a woman with long red hair that went down to her lower back wearing anormal black shirt and jonin style pants, she also looked 8 months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stares at the picture for several minutes before he recognized it. \u2018That must be The Fourth Hokage and his wife. They look so happy together. I wish I was happy like that.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept on looking until he saw something poking out of the side of the picture. As curious as he is he pulled it out of the picture and now he was holding 2 pieces of paper in his hand. He looked at the two pieces of paper and started to read them. They said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Naruto,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are reading this then you are either 16 or a chunin. First of all I would like to say is that I am Minato Namikaze, the Fourth Hokage. I am also your father. If the old man hasn\u2019t already told you then this letter will. On the date of your birth, on October 10th the terrible beast kyuubi no kitsune attacked. We are running out of time so I am going to use the \u2018Reaper Death Seal\u2019 to deal it into something, but I can only seal into a new born baby. That baby was you Naruto. I am so sorry, that technique was a last result and nothing alse worked. I have good news though. We have a bloodline. That bloodline allows us to have advanced chakra control, and gives us power of the sub-elements. Every Namikaze has that ability to control a sub-element. The sub-elements possible are ice, wood, magma, sand, and storm. All the other information are in scrolls locked inside the Namikaze vault(just wipe some blood on the vault and it will open). Once again son I am sorry for cursing you I just hope that we can meet again in the afterlife so I can apologize. I love you son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato Namikaze<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourth Hokage<br>\r\n<br>\r\np.s. to find out wkat happened to your mother read the other letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\np.s.s if you see an old looking guy with long white hair give him a hard kick in the ass for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was beyond shocked, his father the fourth hokage had sealed the kyuubi in him and condemned him to a life of loneliness. Then the shock turned to anger as he thought just one word, \u2018kyuubi\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was too tired to be angry so he just went over to a couch and went to sleep only to wake up in a sewer like place. He heard some low growling and decided to follow the sound only to end up in front of a huge cage with the kanji for \u2018seal\u2019 in the middle. He went towards the cage and stopped 10 feet in front of it. Then a huge pair of claws come shooting out of the cage and stopped right in front of his face. He flinched a little bit, but still stayed standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe claws went back in and a thundering voice said, \u201cSo my container comes to visit.\u201d Naruto just stared emotionlessly at thr giant fox. The fox was impressed, \u2018Even a kage level shinobi would be scarred of me but this kid just stares at me.\u2019 The kyuubi looked in his eyes and almost gasped. \u2018Those eyes! If I wasn\u2019t the lord of hell I would be scared. Those are the most cold, and emotionless eyes I have ever seen. Not even seasoned shinobi have eyes that lifeless.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto eyes suddenly filled with anger and hate, \u201cTHIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT. IF YOU HADN\u2019T ATTACKED I COULD\u2019VE HAD A FAMILY. WHY? Why did you attack\u201d he screamed, but quieted down at the end and started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kyuubi just said in an equally quiet voice, \u201cKit it wasn\u2019t my choice to attack.\u201d Naruto looked into the eyes of the kyuubi and saw true sadness. The kyuubi continued, \u201cI was just going for some food since my mate just gave birth to my kit and she was weak.\u201d The kyuubi eyes started to water at this point(A/N: Hey, even if you\u2019re an all power full demon you still have feeling especially for your mate. Back to the story.) \u201cI came home to find my mate and newborn kit slaughtered\u201d Naruto gasped at this \u201cI wanted to find the one responsible for this so I searched the den and I found a leaf headband. I went into rage and charged towards the leaf, shortly after I was sealed into you by your father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was completely shell shocked and did something he rarely did, he bowed and apologized. \u201cI am very sorry for yelling at you kyuubi.\u201d The kyuubi just waved him of with a paw saying, \u201cit\u2019s all right kit. All is forgiven.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto got up and grinned sheepishly and then turned serious, \u201cKyuubi I need to leave the village to be able to defend myself and to get stronger or I\u2019m going to die and if my hunch is correct if I die you die. The kyuubi was shocked and replied,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are correct kit. I am actually surprised that a boy of 3 years is so smart.\u201d Naruto smirked and said, \u201cWell when you have angry mobs chasing you all your life you have to grow up fast and learn quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwise words from a wise young man.\u201d Kyuubi replied. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s time to wake up kit. When you wake up read your mother\u2019s letter, then let me take control to get you back to your old apartment and write a note and then we\u2019ll come back, gather all the scrolls and leave the village.\u201d Naruto nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then woke up and after rubbing the sleep out of his eyes he found his mother\u2019s letter and started to read it. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Naruto,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are reading this then you have already read your father\u2019s note. I am sorry for leaving you my son but there were complications during your birth and I\u2019m not going to make it. Nom don\u2019t go thinking its your fault cause it\u2019s not. Nom as it said in your father\u2019s note I also have a bloodline. It\u2019s a doujutsu called Rinnegan. This bloodline has special abilities that give you affinities to all five elements and the rest of the Rinnegan\u2019s are in the scrolls in the vault. Right now you are the last holder of the Rinnegan because it\u2019s birthplace was the Uzumaki Country and it no longer exists because it was wiped out bu a batallion of Earth and Lightning country. I was on a mission when it happened so I fled to Konoha and met your faher. Remember son I will always love you. So this is goodbye my little boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina Uzumaki<br>\r\n<br>\r\np.s. like your father if you see an old man with white hairs kick him in the balls for me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed a bit as he dried his tears. He then said in his mind, \u2018Okay kyuubi, you can take over now.\u2019 (A/N: Sorry I didn\u2019t mention earlier, but kyuubi established a mental connection between them and told Naruto. Back to the story.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi nodded as Naruto\u2019s eyes turned red and he raced back to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he dot there he pulled out a piece of paper and wrote a note to the sandaime. It said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear old man,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are reading this then I am no longer in the village. The reason I have left is because I need to get stronger to defend myself against the ninja and civilians that attack me. The kyuubi is helping me and yes I know about him and when I get back I will tell you why he attacked. See you in 10 years old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto Uzumaki Namikaze<br>\r\n<br>\r\np.s. I also hnow about my heritage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the note on the table and went back to the Namikaze compound. When he go there he got all the scrolls, put them into a larger scroll and headed for the gate.(A/N: kyuubi also taught him basic sealing. Back to the story.) when sandaime found the note he let out a few tears, \u2018I\u2019m sorry Naruto\u2019 meanwhile naruto had just snuck throught the gates never to be seen for the next 10 years<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It\u2019s been 10 long years since Naruto left the village. The villagers partied but they were all stopped and arrested by the anbu and sent to Ibiki. The sandaime was eagerly waiting for his return. \u2018It\u2019s been 10 long years since that day Naruto. I hope that you come back soon\u2026. My grandson.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the main entrance of the village a figure about 5\u201910 in. tall was walking towards the gate. He was wearing a blue trenchcoat with red flames at the bottom. It also had the kanji for \u2018fire, water, Earth, wind, and lightning\u2019 in an X pattern and in the middle was the kanji for \u2018Sojokou Senkou\u2019(Elemental Flash). He was also wearing a black muscle shirt that showed off his 8 pack abs. He was also wearing blue shinobi pants with a sword strapped to his side, and was also wearing black shinobi sandals. His hair was just as wild, spicky and yellow as his father\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis person was none other than Naruto Uzumaki Namikaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was nearing the gates and asked his tenant, \u2018hey kyuu do you think I should put up a transformation to hide myself until I get to the tower.\u2019 \u201cYeah kit, you probably should since they probably still hate you.\u201d Naruto sighed, \u2018okay I\u2019ll put the transformation up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe transformed and looked like a 35 year old man. He approached the gate and the guard on the left said, \u201cHalt! Name and biusness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShingo Mattsumoto and I\u2019m here to visit an old friend.\u201d Said the disguised Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right go ahead, but please don\u2019t cause any trouble or you will be tossed out\u201d said the guard on the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Shingo\u2019 nodded and walked all the way to the Hokagr Tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the office of the Hokage Sasuke Sarutobi was battling the grearest of all enemies known to kages, paperwork. Sarutobi sighed and said outloud, \u201cNaruto, please come back and take this job away so I can go back to retirement \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may just take you up on that offer old man\u201d said a voice. Sarutobi looked up only to meet a 35 year old brown haired man. Sarutobi said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, but who are you? And only one person may call me old man and ha has been gone for 10 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops let me take care of that and them he put his hands in the ram seal and said, \u201cRelease.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi just about had a heart attack when he looked into the face of someone he thought was dead and could only utter one word, \u201cMinato\u201d. Naruto laughed and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry old man but I\u2019m not my old man. Instead I\u2019m Naruto Uzumaki Namikaze.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobo went into a deeper shock and did the only thing that a kage would never do. He fainted. Naruto just sighed and waited for him to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi woke up and thought all that was a dream but then he saw Naruto in a corner calmly reading a book. Sarutobi just sighed and sat back up in his chair and asked Naruto how his training trip was. Naruto just responded that he could beat his father without even tying because his power merged with the kyuubi. Sarutobi was shocked that Naruto was so strong and said, \u201cyout just like your father. Mastering so many jutsu and becoming so strong at such a young age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just grinned and said,\u201d I\u2019m just that good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi also grinned and said, \u201cWell Naruto I suppose you are going to the ninja academy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed and said, \u201cto be honest, I really don\u2019 want to be with a bunch of brats who don\u2019t know shit about being a ninja.\u201d He sighed again, \u201cBut if its to become the best then I\u2019ll do what I have to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll write a note to the teachers of the graduating class that they will have a new student for the graduating exams.\u201d Said Sarutobi. He then pulled out a black headband that went down his back like a ponytail. Naruto put iy on and said goosbye before he disappeared in a flash of lightning. Sarutobi saw the kanji on the back of his trenchcoat and muttered two words, \u201cNo way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka Umino was 25 years old, had brown hair that was tied ina ponytail similar to shikamaru, had a normal normal chunin outfit on and had a large scar across his nose. He just got a letter from the hokage that they would have a new graduating student. He didn\u2019t think someone could get in just after the exam, but if he was recommended personally by the hokage then he must be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant teacher Mizuki also looked like a normal chunin except that he had grey hair that was covered by a bandana style headband. If you looked closely you good see a evil glint behind his eyes. He, like Iruka, was also surprised that the hokage allowed someone in so late after they just had the genin exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka decided it was time to start to start the class so he said, \u201cSettle down class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened, \u201cplease settle down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reaction<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka developed a tick mark above his head and using his devil head jutsu he yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHUT THE FUCK UP.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class immediately quieted down because even the ever stoic Uchiha and Aburame were frightened of that jutsu. Iruka\u2019s head went back to its normal size and he said, \u201cWell class today is the day that you graduate and become shinobi. Before we get on to the team assignments we have a new student joining us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was shocked that there was a new student after they just went through 6 years of the academy and some new guy can just waltz in here and automatically graduate without taking a single class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everyone\u2019s favorite banshee bit- I mean Sakura voiced everyone\u2019s thought, \u201cIruka sensei, how come we had to go through 6 years of the academy and then some new guy can just waltz right in here without taking a single class.\u201d Several others nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka sighed, \u201c He was given permission from the hokage to be here because the hokage says he\u2019s, and I quote, \u2018A prodigy not scene since Itachi Uchiha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Itachi\u2019s name Sasuke listened intently. It was no big secret that Sasuke absolutely loathed his brother for what he did. He killed the entire Uchiha clan leaving only him and his twin sister Saya left alive. Just then the door opens and everyone holds there breath in anticipation to see who it is. Naruto walked in with an aura of coolness that Sasuke could only dream about. He was wearing what he wore to meet the hokage except the trenchcoat. He surveyed the class and he noticed that all but one girl(coughsakuracough) were eyeing him with looks of lust and hunger. He ignored most of the class except for a select few that caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was a girl that had shiny gray hair that went down to her shoulder blades, had coal black eyes, and she wore a mask across the lower half of her face. She wore a black tanktop that hugged her curves perfectly, and had small ample c-cup breasts. She also had on blue shinobi pants and blue shinobi sandals. \u2018She must be from the Hatake clan. So that is Kakashi and Anko\u2019s child. Her name is Kira Hatake.\u2019 He gave her a wink and she blushed. Other girls gave her a death glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second one who caught his eye was The Ice Queen Of The Academy Saya Uchiha herself. She wore the standard Uchiha clothes that consisted of a navy blue tank top with the Uchiha symbol on her back and, instead of white shorts like her brother; she had on black biker shorts that hugged her hips perfectly. She also had midnight blue hair that went down to her mid-back, small c-cup breasts and luscious legs. \u2018One of the two Uchiha clan survivors. If what kyuubi told me about C.R.A(Clan Restoration Act) is true then I might be able to have some fun in the near future with all these lovely ladies, but for now I think I\u2019ll get to know them.\u2019 He flashed her a foxy grin that had all the girls, especially Saya, blush and have a mini orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final one that caught his eye was Yukina Nara, a girl from the Nara clan. She was different then your average Nara because she wasn\u2019t as lazy as every other Nara and she actually trained and didn\u2019t think \u2018everything\u2019 was troublesome. She wore a fishnet shirt with a small tan jacket, like her cousin Shikamaru, along with black pants that weren\u2019t too loose nor too tight. She had mid. C-cup breasts with ling brown hair that went a little lower than her shoulders. \u2018A Nara that doesn\u2019t think everything is troublesome. That\u2019s new. If my spies serve me correctly then these 3 are known the ice queens of the academy and they got it right perfectly. When we get older I think we\u2019ll have a lot of fun together.\u2019 Thought Naruto. as her a look of love and she blushed heavily and he quickly gave this look to all 3 girls and they all blushed and looked away. He thought that was enough fun\u2026..for now. He decided to introduce himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, my name in Naruto Uzumaki Namikaze, it\u2019s nice to meet you all.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s back.\u2019 He thought happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizuki, however, had different thoughts, \u2018the demon boy is back that could ruin my plans\u2019 he thought angrily. He then added as an afterthought \u2018maybe I can use this to my advantage.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student\u2019s thoughts were this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018He looks HOT.\u2019 Thought all the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018He looks weak\u2019 from Kiba and the emo prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018He\u2019ll never be as strong as strong as my Sasuke-kun\u2019 thought the pink whore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Is this the boy that my father told me stories about. He also is very cute.\u2019 Thought Kira with a small blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018He looks strong. I think I\u2019ll ask this handsome young man to spar with me later\u2019 thought Saya with the same blush as Kira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018this boy looks good and I can tell he is strong by the aura he producing. He is also a major hottie.\u2019 Thought Yukina with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018munch, munch, munch\u2019 from Choji<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018troublesome\u2019 from Shikamaru<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018\u2026\u2026..\u2019 from Shino<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Iruka got over his shock he asked Naruto to sit next to Kira. He nodded and say next to Kira who still had a blush on her face. He then started to explain the exams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToday is the genin exam. It will consist of the parts. The written exam, weapons accuracy, and ninjutsu.\u201d They nodded and they began. When they were finished the scores are the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto: 100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukina:98<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke:96<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura:95<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya:93<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira:93<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata:91<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno:89<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShino:88<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji:86<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru:75<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba:50<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right class the written part is done and the top three scores are Sasuke with a 96. Yukina with a 98 and Naruto with perfect 100.\u201d Iruka announced<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was a little pist off, \u2018how is that nobody smarter than me, an elite Uchiha.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018that just proves my point that he is strong because you have to be really smart to get a better score than a Nara.\u2019 Came from Yukina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201clets go outside for the weapon and ninjutsu part\u201d said Iruka. When they went outside they started. The scores were:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto:10/10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke:9/10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya:8/10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukina, Kira:7/10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura, Ino, Shino, Choji, Hinata:6/10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru:5/10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba:4/10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat ends the weapons portion and the top 3 scores are Saya with 8/10, then Sasuke with 9/10 and finally Naruto with 10/10.\u201d Iruka announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was now royally ticked, \u2018the loser beat mw again. I\u2019ll show him an the ninjutsu exam and reclaim my title as #1, since it only belongs to uchiha and not blonde haired idiots.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya thoughts were of awe, \u2018wow, not since the fourth hokage has anyone got a perfect score.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto still looked bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka then announced that it was time for the ninjutsu part of the exam. \u201cto pass this all you have to do is the transformation, substitution, and clone techniques and for extra credit you can do a jutsu you learned outside of the academy.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all did the required techniques and some did the extra credit. Kiba did his \u2018fang over fang\u2019, Choji did his \u2018partial expansion jutsu.\u2019, Shino did his \u2018bug clone\u2019, Hinata did her families \u20188 trigrames air palms\u2019 (A/N Hinata is also wearing a mask just like Naruto except that hers is of shyness. She is going to take the mask of once she becomes a genin. Back to the story.) Shikamaru did his \u2018shadow possession jutsu\u2019, Ino did her \u2018mind transfer jutsu, and Sasuke did his \u2018fireball jutsu\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave an arrogant smirk at Naruto that just screamed \u2018beat that\u2019 Naruto still looked bored as he performed the required jutsu with no hand seals, whish shocked the class and caused a certain Uchiha to seethe, and for the extra credit jutsu he asked for people to stand back and he went through 5 hand seals ending on tiger and shouted out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFIRE STYLE: INFERNO FIRE BLAST(A/N: why no one thought of that I\u2019ll never know.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction they got was a giant black fireball shot out of his mouth and shot towards a couple of trees and they all exploded. When the smoke cleared they saw a 15 fett deep crater that was about 1 mile in diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was either staring at awe, fear, or jealsy. When he found his voice Iruka asked, \u201c W-What w-was that Naruto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto answered, \u201cthat was I jutsu I invented called fire style inferno fire blast. I got that name because it has the fires of a furnace and is more of a blast then a ball it works like this, you gather chakra to your chest, then you have to compress it to its greatest form and then just blow it out of you. That technique is an s-rank jutsu because it consumes the ckakra quality of a mid-jonin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was shocked that he invented an s-rank technique and he was only their age. Sasuke was shaking in barely suppressed rage, \u2018 how did he get so powerful. He better not get too comfortable because as soon as I get my sharingan I will take your jutsu.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay class, the genin exams are now over. It\u2019s now time for lunch so come back in half an hour for team assignments.\u201d They all nodded and left for lunch while Iruka went to make up the teams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto sat on top of the roof of the academy eating some fruit and a sandwich. He sensed 3 people behind him. He turned around to see Saya, Kira and Yukina. He decided to ask what they were doing up here. \u201cwhat are you ladies doing up here? Can I help you with something?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira answered, \u201cActually we were all coming up to see you when w ran into each other\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback jutsu<br>\r\nKira was running towards the stairs when she ran into Saya and Yukina. \u201cwhere are you two going? She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukina answered, \u201cwe were going to see if Naruto-kun is up there. What about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Naruto-kun\u2019 thought Kira with a raised eyebrow. \u201cI was also going up there to talk to him. I wanted to know if he was the boy my father told stories about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya asked, \u201cWhat did your father tell him about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira decided to tell them \u201cokay, it all started when I was 4...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback within flashback<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKira it\u2019s time for bed\u201d said a younger looking Kakashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201conly if you tell me a story\u201d said a 4-year-old Kira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi sighed, \u201cokay but only if you go to bed right after, promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise\u201d said Kira in cute voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cokay here\u2019s a story about a boy I once knew. This boy was very strong and mature for his age. He fought for everything even though no one acknowledged him or even cared that he existed. The reason he was treated like this was of a burden that he carried. What he carried caused a lot of pain and torment. It was beyond his control, but no one cared and they usually just ignored him or glare at him. Some of them went as far to beat him. But he never gave in and he always fought back and tried again. You see Kira the moral of this story is that even if you are down you are not ever out. Remember this boy and if you ever see him you should be his friend because he really needs friends.\u201d Stated Kakashi<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwhat was his name\u201d said Kira sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chis name is Naruto Uzumaki.\u201d With that Kira fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd flashback within flashback<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukina and Saya were shocked and almost in tears. \u201cthat was the story he told you.\u201d Asked Saya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira nodded and Saya and Yukina looked like they were gonna break down. There was silence for a few seconds before Kira asked, \u201care we gonna go see him now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukina and Saya wiped their eyes and nodded as they followed Kira up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback jutsu release<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was shocked that Kakashi said that about him. \u201cthanks for telling me that Kira-chan\u201d said Naruto Kira blushed, while the other 2 girls through her envious looks. \u201cso what would you like to talk about\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent the next 15 minutes talking to each other and they joked to each other. Naruto near died laughing when Saya told him how she pranked Sasuke an turned his hair pink for a whole month, and when Kira helped her mother (A/N: if you forgot her mother you should go back to chapter 3. back to the story.) hide all her father\u2019s icha icha paradise and replace it with the yaoi version. He hadn\u2019t laughed this hard in his whole entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was 5 minutes until they had to go back into the classroom and Kira and Yukina went back t get a good seat. Naruto and Saya were just leaving when Saya tripped over a hole in the ground and she fell with a yelp. Naruto looked back and saw Saya on the ground clutching her ankle. \u201cSaya, are you okay?\u201d asked Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya shook her head as tears came out of her beautiful onyx eyes. \u201c I t-t-tripped and m-my ank-kle h-h-hurts.\u201d She said with her voice shaking the whole time. Naruto walked over to her and helped her to the ledge where she sat down with her eyes still watering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto asked which ankle it was and she responded saying that it was her left ankle. Naruto nodded and carefully removed her shoe and added chakra to his hands and started to massage her foot and ankle. Saya gasped as she felt pleasure she never felt before and saw that it was Naruto who was rubbing her bare foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only had one thought in her head and it was, \u2018oh my kami, that feels good. I should hurt myself more often if this is the special treatment I get. I definitely want him more noooooooooowwwwwww.\u2019 She gave off a very soft moan. She was in heaven now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto heard the moan and it turned him on a little bit. He decided to have a little fun and increased the chakra in his hands, which got the reaction he wanted. Saya moaned even louder and she got a little wet. Naruto then decided that it was almost time for class to start again so he used some minor medical jutsu and her ankle healed instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was disappointed that the pleasure she was feeling was gone. Naruto gave her ankle a kiss and slipped her shoe back on. Saya moaned from the kiss. She always had very sensitive feet and loved having a massage done on them but she sometimes hated being tickled because even if you slightly brush them with your finger she will laugh out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her shoe was bacon Naruto said, \u201clets go back to class okay Saya.\u201d She nodded, still having a rosy red blush on her face. Naruto noticed the blush and decided to tease her a bit, \u201cif you liked the massage so much then you can come to my place to receive a spa treatment for free if you like Saya-chan.\u201d He said as seductively as he could. Saya blushed so hard that she did something so unlike her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto caught her as she fell. He laughed. He looked at her peaceful face. He decided, \u2018ahhh why not?\u2019 he thought as he gave her a very soft kiss on her lips. Saya gave a soft moan as she silently woke up without him noticing. She mumbled, \u201cI love you Naruto-kun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto opened hi eyes wide and took a good look at her and could tell she was awake and bent down to her ear and said in a whisper. \u201cI love you to Saya-chan.\u201d Then he kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya\u2019s eyes snapped open and she kissed him back. Naruto licked her lips, asking for entrance which she happily did. Their tongues wrestled for dominance, which Naruto won. He tilted her head back to deepen the kiss and she moaned happily. After 3 minutes they stopped to catch their breath. \u201cdoes this mean we\u2019re bf and gf\u201d said Saya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just kissed her and said, \u201cdoes this answer your question.\u201d Saya just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201clets go back to the classroom Saya-tenshi\u201d Naruto said. Saya blushed scarlet and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back to the classroom, everyone else was already back in the classroom. Naruto and Saya sat next to Kira and Yukina who asked where they were. Before they could answer Iruka came back into the classroom. ( skip speech and first six teams because it\u2019s boring and they aren\u2019t important enough)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cteam 7 is Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno, and Sai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam 8 is Hinata Hyuuga, Kiba Inuzuka, and Shino Aburame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam 9 is Kira Hatake, Saya Uchiha, Yukina Nara and Naruto Namikaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam 10 is Ino Yamanaka, Shikamaru Nara, and Choji Akimichi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe jonin sensei will be here shortly. I have other business to take care of so goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the sensei came and went. A beautiful read eyed woman came in for team 8. A bearded man with a cigarette in his mouth dressed in a standard jonin outfit came for team 10. only team 7 and team 9 were left. Sasuke decided that he wanted answers from the blonde so he went over to Naruto, with Sakura following like the little whore she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chey idiot, where did you learn how to do jutsu like that? As an Uchiha I have a right to any fire jutsu you invented and any other jutsu you know. So you better tell me or you will regret it.\u201d Said Sasuke arrogantly. Sakura nodded like a lost puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at the Uchiha with cold blue eyes that it even made the 3 behind him shiver uncontrollably. \u201cNo you stuck up, worthless Uchiha.\u201d Said Naruto with a perfect monotones voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was enraged and yelled, \u201cA clanless nobody like you doesn\u2019t deserve power like that. Power like that belongs only to elite Uchiha not idiots like you\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto lost it and he punched Sasuke so hard that he flew right into the wall with his nose broken. Everyone was shocked, but that shock turned to fear as he pulled out his katana and it ignited into lightning chakra and he was just about to gut him like a fish when he felt 3 pairs of arms wrap around him. One belonged to Saya and the other 2 belonged to Kira and Yukina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cplease stop Naru-kun.\u201d Begged Saya with tears in her eyes. \u201che may be an asshole but he\u2019s still my brother. Please don\u2019t kill him.\u201d The other 2 just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto calmed down and his lightning chakra disappeared and he looked at Sasuke with anger in his eyes and said in his monotone, \u201cnext time they won\u2019t be here to save you. If you ever bothered to look at my family history you would now that I am from the Namikaze clan, the founding clan of Konoha.\u201d He started to walk back to his seat when he looked back at Sasuke and said, \u201cand when your sharingan activates, don\u2019t bother trying to copy my jutsu because my Rinnegan, plus the seal I invented prevents the sharingan from copying my jutsu.\u201d He then sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was seething because he couldn\u2019t get any of his jutsu. \u2018just you wait Naruto Namikaze. I will find a way to get your jutsu and then I\u2019ll kill you and then your next Itachi.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after another 10 minutes a jonin with a fishnet shirt, mini skirt, with a trench coat on walked into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi mom\u201d said Kira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Kira-chan\u201d said the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cexcuse me but who are you?\u201d said Saya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh me. I am team 9\u2019s sensei Anko Hatake\u201d said Anko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cmeet me on the roof.\u201d Said Anko disappearing via shunshin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go ladies\u201d said Naruto as he grabbed them all around the waist, causing them all to blush, and disappearing in a flash of lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke seethed, Sakura watched awed, and Sai watched silently,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey appeared on the roof to see Anko eating dango. Anko looked at them and said let\u2019s introduce ourselves. I\u2019ll go first, my name is Anko Hatake. My likes are Kaka-kun, Kira-chan, dango, and red bean soup. My dislikes are the snake sannin Oro-teme. My hobbies are\u201d she blushes a bit \u201cyour to young to know. My dream is to kill Orochimaru and to see Kira-chan grow up and be happily married.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira blushed and said, \u201c mooooomm, not in front of everyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko laughed and said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you go next Kira-chan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira reluctantly nodded and said, \u201cmy name is Kira Hatake. My likes are my parents and\u201d she blushes a bit and looks at Naruto \u201cmiso soup with eggplant. My dislikes are anyone who hurt people for no reason and my mom when she embarrasses me. My hobbies are training and hanging with my friends my dream is to lead the Hatake clan\u201d \u2018and to marry Naru-kun.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko noticed that her daughter was looking at Naruto when she said her likes and smiled inwardly, \u2018so she likes Naruto eh. Not that I don\u2019t approve, but if he hurts her in any way I\u2019ll feed him to my snakes.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cnext you in the blue,\u201d said Anko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cmy name is Saya Uchiha, my likes are training and Naru-kun. My dislikes are my stupid little brother and my stupid older brother, and fangirls. My hobbies are training and spending time with Naru-kun. My dream is to marry Naru-kun and be a strong ninja.\u201d Saya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018so she also likes Naruto. He is going to have lots of girl problems later.\u2019 Thought Anko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cnext you with in the brown\u201d said Anko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cmy name is Yukina Nara. My likes are making shadow techniques and Naruto-kun. My dislikes are the Nara clan\u2019s laziness. My hobbies are making techniques for my clan and my dream is to try to make the Nara clan less lazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cthat is a great dream\u201d Anko said. \u2018so she has a dream to change an entire clan. That is a tough dream and with Naruto by her side I have no doubt she can do it.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201clastly the blonde one,\u201d Anko said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cmy name is Naruto Uzumaki Namikaze. My likes are Saya-hime, Kira-hime, Yukina-hime\u201d causing all to blush and Anko to smile \u201cand inventing new jutsu. My dislikes are arrogant assholes, stupid fangirls, and people who blame them for something they had no control over. My hobbies are training and spending time with these 3 lovely ladies\u201d again causing them to blush scarlet and Anko to smile mischievously \u201cand my dream is to become the strongest and to change this village for the better,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018so spending 10 years on his own really taught him something. I hope you achieve your dream Naruto.\u2019 Anko thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll right tomorrow we are going to be having a test to see if you are all worthy of having the rank of genin because of the 30 of you that graduate only 12, sometimes 13, will become genin. There is a failure rate of 66. Anyway come to training ground 44 tomorrow at 9 o\u2019 clock. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d Explained Anko as she disappeared with shushin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen an anbu came out of the corner and said, \u201c Naruto-san, the council, and the hokage request your presence at a meeting.\u201d He then disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned to the 3 girls, \u201cit appears they want to talk to me about something. I\u2019ll talk to you guys when I\u2019m done.\u201d He walked over and gave a small kiss on the cheek to all 3 of them and left in a flash of fire,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at each other, \u201cI\u2019m not losing to any of you\u201d they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He opened it to the very back and it said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Naruto Namikaze<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAliases: Sojoukou Senkou<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRank: ssss-rank ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStatus: flee-on-sight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbilities: has strong elemental attacks. Moves faster than the speed of light. Supposed to have a rare doujutsu but no one has gotten close enough to tell and live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs responsible for wiping out 1000 earth shinobi with only 1 attack. Was also able to kill the fifth tschikage. Also responsible for killing 800 lightning shinobe along with the third raikage in two moves. This is a very dangerous enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto finished reading and responded, \u201cI\u2019m just that awesome aren\u2019t I old man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi laughed and said, \u201cthat you are Naruto. Now we have to get this meeting over with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the council chambers the noticed that everyone was already in there. The council is composed of the Hyuuga, Nara, Yamanaka, Akimichi, Aburame, and Inuzuka clan heads. That is the ninja half. The other is the civilian half, which is composed of mostly merchants and the head of the civilians Yasha Haruno, mother of, Sakura Haruno. She was the main voter for having Naruto executed when he was a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp top is where the hokage and elders sit the elders are Homura Mitokado, Koharu Utatane, and Danzo. They were all against Naruto for the same reasons as everyone else. When Naruto and Sarutobi got in the room the council, upon seeing Naruto, gasped in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was wearing his cloak and all the clothes he had on earlier and he was a perfect carbon copy of the fourth hokage. Except the for the whisker marks Naruto looked just like his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sarutobi sat down and cleared his voice the council was awake again. \u201cSo would you mind telling me what the hell I\u2019m doing here.\u201d Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyou will treat us with respect you little brat\u201d said a fat civilian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just looked at him and said \u201cI\u2019ll speak to you pig fuckers anyway l want, and respect is earned not given you artard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shinobi half snickered to themselves while the civilians and elders spluttered in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwhat did you want to talk to about.\u201d Said Sarutobi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwe wanted to see if what we read in the bingo book is true or not.\u201d Homura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cthe answer is yes. Everything you read is true.\u201d Sarutobi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanzo stood up in anger, \u201cthen that brat must be executed. He is too powerful to be left alive. Root kill the kyuubi brat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoot anbu came out if nowhere and started to attack Naruto. Naruto dodged all of their attacks and drew his sword and fused it with fire ckakra. He cut them all up and as soon as it hit them they all turned to ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanzo was truly frightened and tried to make a run for it but Naruto was faster and he stabbed him in the back with the sword and he turned to ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, even the hokage, was scared of his power. Naruto slowly turned and looked at them with his cold blue eyes, that were once filled with life, that were now devoid of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201canyone else want to try anything.\u201d Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all shook their heads in fear. Sarutobi looks at the remains of Danzo and sighed, \u201cwas it really necessary to kill him Naruto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, \u201cyes it was because I have spies that have reports that he was working with Earth and Lightning in attempts to destroy Konoha so that he could rebuild it and rule it himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi was surprised, \u201cI see\u201d was all he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not all the ringleader behind this is none other than that snake in the grass Orochimaru.\u201d Naruto responded hatefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi was sad that his crazed ex-student still wanted revenge on the leaf. Then Naruto said, \u201cthey don\u2019t have nearly enough numbers to attack us yet.\u201d The council agreed and they now got back on topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nara head stood up and said, \u201cthe real reason we called you hear is to disuss your abilities and see whether or not they are bloodlines. Kami this is such a drag.\u201d He sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded. \u201cokay to answer your questions yes my abilities are a bloodline. Listen because I\u2019m only going to say this once.\u201d They all nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cmy first bloodline allows me to have the ability to use sub-elements. The sub-elements possible are ice, wood, magma, sand, and storm. To get the ice ability you must possess the elements water and wind, for wood its earth and water, sand is wind and earth, magma is fire and earth, and storm is water, wind and lightning. Storm is the hardest to have because it takes 3 elemental affinities. My father and me were the first people to have storm since the founder of the clan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone tried to absorb this information. \u201cwho was tour father.?\u201d Asked the Hyuuga head, fearing the answer. Naruto smiled mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a hint. In battle he moved in a flash. He was in love with the color red, and his favorite number is four.\u201d Naruto said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was trying to figure out his riddle until the Nara head eyes shot open so much that they threatened to pop out if his sockets. \u201cN-No way\u201d he stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at him, because it most have been someone important to make the Nara loose their usual bored expression. Naruto had a grin on that threatened to split his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see that you figured it out. You are right, my father is the one and only Minato Namikaze. The Fourth Hokage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shinobi side\u2019s eyes threatened to pop out of their skulls just like Shikaku\u2019s did. The civilian half were glaring at him thinking that the demon is trying to trick them. The elders also glared at him. The hokage kept a straight face since he already knew about his heritage. The Haruno clan head stood up ad screeched, \u201cThere is no way that demon is related to Minato. It\u2019s just a trick. The demon is trying to trick you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a kunai imbedded itself in the wall and the Haruno had a cut on her cheek. Then there was a flash of blue and Naruto was right behind her. \u2018When did he\u2026?\u2019 thought Yasha when she and everybody else looked where he was a second ago they saw a small puddle of water that just disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Idiot\u2019s\u2019 thought the hokage \u2018he\u2019s called the Sojokou Senkou for a reason.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else was simply amazed as none of them saw him move. Even the hokage barely saw him move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen to me. I am not the little boy you used as your punching bag. If anyone of you threatens me you will experience a long and painful death.\u201d Naruto said in perfect monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomura, who was either very brave or very stupid (I think It\u2019s the later more than the former. Back to the story.) stood up and said, \u201cIs that a threat you little brat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s a promise.\u201d Naruto responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then flashed back to where he was and said to Sarutobi. \u201cI really don\u2019t fell like telling them about my second bloodline so here\u2019s a scroll that explains the basics of the bloodline. There is also a little surprise for you at the bottom of the scroll okay old man.\u201d He finished throwing him the scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi caught it and said, \u201cok Naruto I\u2019ll tell them.\u201d Naruto nods and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi glares at the civilian half and says, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t even be telling you assholes anything, but since Naruto asked me to, I will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unrolls scroll and reads out loud:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloodline is called the Rinnegen. The Rinnegan is the most powerful of the 3 legendary eye techniques. The reason it is the most powerful is because it gives the user affinities to all 5 elements, whish combined with my father\u2019s bloodline that would make me an elemental master, and the other ability is that it allows us to spread our subconscious into other dead bodies and allows them to come back to life for a short period of time. They will also get the Rinnegan when they come back. The Rinnegan will disappear when they go back to the dead. Have a good day you cock sucking piece of shit pussy, motherfuckers of the civilian and elders of the council. By the way old man for the surprise I told you about just open up the seal at the bottom in your office, (he didn\u2019t read this part out loud.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe council looked shocked at his choice of words while the shinobi and hokage laughed out load. When everybody got back in their heads the Inuzuka clan head announced, \u201cyou know that he now falls under the C.R.A (Clan Restoration Act) right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat I do Tsume, that I do.\u201d Sarutobi said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto actually left a clone there to hear the rest of the meeting. When he learned of the C.R.A. he was jumping for joy. He was mostly happy that he could date Saya, Kira and, Yukina without leaving any of them heartbroken. He just hoped that they would agree to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContrary to what some people believe he was far from dense. He knew that those 3 liked him for him. He couldn\u2019t wait to see them. He kept walking around for a bit before he saw Yukina sitting on a bench enjoying the clouds. ( A/N she may not be as lazy as other Nara\u2019s but she does enjoy watching the clouds back to the story.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gave smirk as he snuck up behind her and pit his arms around her waist. Her breath caught in her throat. She slowly turned and saw Naruto holding her. She blushed cherry red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here Naruto-kun?\u201d asked Yukina as she relaxed in Naruto\u2019s arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just came to talk to you, Saya, and Kira about my meeting with the council fuckers.\u201d Naruto responded. Yukina blushed at his choice of words and reprimanded him for using dirty words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of looking for them they found Saya at an apartment complex. Naruto wondered why she was here but decided to ask her later. After telling her what they were going to do they went hunting for Kira. They found her at a dango shop. They all went to training ground 44.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what did you guys talk about Naru-kun.?\u201d Kira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto started the story from start to finish and when he was done all 3 of them were shocked that he was the son of the fourth hokage and he had 2 strong bloodlines. What shocked them the most was when he told them of his status in the bingo book<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwow\u201d they all said in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cshouldn\u2019t you be a jonin then.\u201d Said Kira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could be jonin if I wanted to, but I don\u2019t want any special treatment just because of who my family was.\u201d Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cthere are two more things I have to tell you.\u201d Naruto the told them the story of when he was 3. where he ran, what he found, he told them about everything that led to him leaving the village for 10 years, including the kyuubi. When he was done with the story they all had tears in their eyes and without warning they all tackled Naruto to the ground and started crying into his chest. He was shocked that they didn\u2019t run or try to kill him so he put his arms around them and whispered soothing words into their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyou went through all that and you\u2019re still yourself?\u201d questioned Saya with tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have an unbreakable will so I can pretty much go through anything.\u201d Naruto said. \u201cI have 1 more thing to tell you guys and it could either make things good or make things very bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then told them about how the council put the C.R.A on him since he was the last of his clans. When he was done all 3 of them had a blush on their face that could put Hinata to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya was the first to speak and she said,\u201d actually Naru-kun I\u2019m bisexual so I wouldn\u2019t mind sharing.\u201d Yukina and Kira just nodded as they were to embarrassed to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Naruto\u2019s turn to have a tear in his eye. He found 3 girls who new his secrets and they still wanted to be with him. He then made 2 shadow clones and they all kissed them. One clone was with a tongue battle with Yukina who looked like she was in heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone with Saya was also is tongue battle but the clone had a hand on the back of her head while the other hand was on her ass causing her to moan a bit. The real Naruto had yanked Kira\u2019s mask, and she had flawless skin too, and also started a very fierce kiss that was a little rough but it was gentle and full of love and Kira was in Heaven. \u2018is this what being in love feels like.\u2019 Was her only thought as she was completely dominated by Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they all broke apart for air the only thing they could say was \u201cWow\u201d and then they fainted from sensual overload. Naruto grinned as the 3 clones carried them back to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back to his house it was near nighttime as the sun just went down and it was now dark outside. When he got there he tucked them all in. when he put Kira to bed he lingered a little longer to look at her face. He noticed that she had perfect skin, a cute childlike nose and a perfect shaped mouth. He ran his fingers over cheek and gave her a small kiss to the cheek. She gave a small smile and Naruto smiled. He turned off the light, and went to his room for some sleep. \u2018this was the best day of my life.\u2019 Was the last thought that went through his head before he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was the first one up. It was 5 o\u2019 clock. He went and did his morning training which was just an all out fight with 2000 clones. He shouted to his clones, \u201c bring it on\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201ccharge\u201d the clones shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put out a blast of chakra which destroyed about 100 clones. He entered a taijutsu stance he invented called the Elemental fist. When a clone charged he delivered a swift uppercut that destroyed the clone. Then he kicked a clone behind him. Using the momentum he did a front flip, pulled out his sword and infused it with earth chakra. He slammed the blade into the ground and it sent out a shockwave that leveled the earth and caused spikes to rise and skew the clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then put his sword away as he bit his finger and drew the blood over a seal on his arm. Then a black staff with a steel top. He called out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFIRE STYLE: RAGING FIRE BLAST<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge blast of fire came out of his staff and it incinerated a lot of clones. He stuck his staff in the ground, did 12 hand seals ending in the snake seal. He called out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMAGMA STYLE: MAGMA BULET JUTSU<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuge blasts of molten magma came out of his mouth and surrounded all of them. He did the hand seal hare and shouted:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMAGMA STYLE: MAGMA PRISON JUTSU<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magma around them rose up until it made an impenetrable prison. Naruto smirked at his clones and did 20 hand seals ending in horse and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTORM STYLE: OMEGA TWISTER JUTSU<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge twister surrounded them and it destroyed the magma making it fly everywhere, striking a few clones. It picked up trees, bushes and chunks of earth. It also picked up the rest of the clones and the debris killed some of them. The rest (which were about 500.) were able to dodge the debris. Naruto, upon seeing this, smirked and did a few more hand seals and said in a whisper:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTORM STYLE: SLICING TORNADO<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind in the tornado turned sharp and it cut the rest of the clones to dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tornado disappeared and Naruto heard clapping and turned around to see Kira, Saya, and Yukina clapping. He also noticed that his shirt was ripped a bit. He smirked as he ripped the rest off exposing his well-chiseled chest and his 8-pack abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 3 off them blushed heavily as he disappeared and reappeared behind them in a gust of wind. He wrapped his arms around the 3 of them and whispered seductively to them, \u201cDid you like what you saw,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey blushed and nodded. Naruto made a few clones and they got behind Kira and Saya, while he stayed on Yukina, and started kissing them on their necks. They gasped and their eyes rolled back as they relaxed in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Naruto was softly sucking on Yukina\u2019s neck, leaving a small hicky. Yukina was in a state of pure bliss as she relaxed in her boyfriend\u2019s arms. Naruto and his clones then stopped and the 3 girls pouted because the pleasure they were feeling was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201csorry we have to stop because our exam is in 10 minutes.\u201d Naruto said sadly, since he was enjoying himself to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all got dressed, ate breakfast and sped to training ground 44. they met Anko there sitting patiently until she spotted them and was immediately in front of Kira scarring her a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Where were you last night young lady? Your father near had a heart attack when you didn\u2019t get home last night. If it wasn\u2019t for the hokage showing up and telling him not worry he would have torn through half of Konoha.\u201d Anko said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira was really scared now since her mother had never gotten this angry at her before, but thankfully Naruto came to the rescue,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cactually Mrs. Hatake, Kira-chan was training with me, Saya-chan, and Yukina-chan. They trained to hard and passed out so I took them to my house where they stayed there the night. We didn\u2019t do anything last night I swear.\u201d Naruto said calmly not wavering in the slightest bit when he saw Anko\u2019s furious glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko then smiled and said \u201c did you happen to see under her mask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised his eyebrow and said, \u201c yes I did. I saw her face when I gave her some water to get some of her fluids back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko\u2019s grin got even bigger, \u201cif that is true then you need to come the Hatake clan house later tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sweat dropped, \u201cok I\u2019ll be there later tonight\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else was confused. \u201call right it\u2019s now time for your real genin exam. All you have to do is find, capture and get these 3 bells from me.\u201d Anko said as she held up 3 bells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cbut there are only 3 bells and there\u2019s 4 of us.\u201d Saya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. It means that only 3 of you will pass. I want all of you to come at me with the intent to kill and begin.\u201d Anko explained and then disappeared into the ground. Before anyone could do anything, Naruto grabbed all 3 of them and disappeared into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reappeared on a tree branch. Naruto let go of them and said, \u201cit\u2019s a trick. We have to work together to get the bells.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201call right here\u2019s the plan\u2026..\u201d said Naruto as he told them the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko was bored. The little brats haven\u2019t attacked yet and there was almost no time left. Then Kira came out of the forest and faced her mother. \u201cso Kira-chan, you want to try and take the bells. Well let\u2019s see what you got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira then did hand seals and called out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWIND STYLE:WIND BLADE JUTSU<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko barely dodged it because she didn\u2019t expect Kira to know that jutsu. \u201cKira, where did you learn that jutsu?\u201d Anko asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chehehehehe that\u2019s because I\u2019m not Kira.\u201d \u2018Kira\u2019 said as she poofed and in her place was Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto did hand seals and shouted:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMAGMA STYLE: MAGMA RIVER JUTSU<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth cracked all around her and a river of magma appeared around her. She cursed as she tried to jump when a cry of:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFIRE STYLE: DRAGON FLAME JUTSU<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe twirled in the air as she narrowly dodged the flames, but it nicked her coat and it caught on fire. She took off the coat and threw it to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe landed out of the river of magma and found that she couldn\u2019t move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHADOW POCCESION JUTSU success\u201d Yukina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko couldn\u2019t believe that she was caught by a bunch of kids. She then smirked and said, \u201c:you may have caught me but once your shadow goes on for about 30 seconds I\u2019ll be able to escape since you don\u2019t have a lot of chakra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukina cursed, she was right she didn\u2019t have enough chakra and Anko could brake free in about 15 seconds. That is if Naruto didn\u2019t come to the rescue, and with that he said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cnot if I have anything to say about it, SEALING JUTSU: TRIANGLE SEAL.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe created 2 shadow clones and the got into a triangle formation. They started to glow and then they were connected with a weird gray chakra. It made a triangle and Anko got trapped in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko and everyone else were awed at the site of the 30-foot triangle. Naruto smirked and said, \u201cI would give up if I were you Anko-sensei. I can easily keep you in this until your chakra runs out or I can make the triangle explode and you will be dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko sighed , \u201cfine I give up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto dropped the jutsu, and Anko gave him the 3 bells. \u201cnow who gets the bells?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tossed the 3 bells to the girls and said, \u201cwe all pass. The test was of teamwork and we all worked together. As soon as the test began we I told them of the true purpose and we made a plan. The plan worked and we got the bells.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyour right. The test was about teamwork. You all worked together and looked out for each other. I want you all to memorize this phrase \u2018 A person who breaks the rules is called trash, but those who abandon their friends and comrades are lower than trash.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all took these words to heart as Anko announced that they would start missions tomorrow and she shunshined away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto asked if they would like to go for something to eat. They agreed and went to eat, all happy that they were all ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On a street in town we find one Hinata Hyuga walking down the street uncharacteristic thought going through her head. \u2018All right, tonight is the night that I remove this mask of weakness and show my real self.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived at the Hyuga mansion in only 5 minutes. \u201c Excuse Me,\u201d she said in an even more emotionless voice then Hiashi himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards were a little scared since this was not the shy, quiet Hinata they knew. They shakily nodded and they let Hinata in the compound. As she passed the guards looked into her eyes and saw that they were devoid of life. \u2018It looks like Hiashi-sama finally broke her. I\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t help you Hinata-sama.\u2019 Was the thought that went through the guard\u2019s heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was walking down the hall when she came across her little sister and her cousin Neji walking down the hall. You see, when her father gave up on Hinata\u2019s training when she was 6 her father assigned Neji to guard Hanabi instead of guarding a and I quote \u2018Failure to the Hyuga.\u2019 (what a dick)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi noticed her sister walking their way and she sneered at her. It was no secret that Hanabi disliked her sister. Her father had already drilled into Hanabi that power was everything and if anyone was weaker than you they were trash or commoners. ( again what a dick.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell look who it is Neji. It\u2019s the failure of the Hyuga clan.\u201d Hanabi taunted. Neji said nothing but you could tell that he was agreeing with Hanabi by looking in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata said in a cold voice, \u201cHello Hanabi, and hello to you to Neji. If you would please move so I can go to my meeting with father.\u201d She spat the word father like it was the foulest poison in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi and even Neji were shocked at her tone. It was colder than ice. The wordlessly stepped aside and Hinata walked through them down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi and Neji stood there for a few seconds before they followed Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Hyuga training dojo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiashi and Hyuga elders were all seated in the dojo waiting for Hinata to show up. Hinata showed up and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Hinata it seems that you have passed your genin exams. For once you have not brought shame to the Hyuga name. To see your skills we will have you spar with Hanabi in an all out match. All the Hyuga will be watching. I will fetch Hanabi and prepare her for the match so don\u2019t be late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyes father\u201d was all Hinata said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the Hyuga training grounds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was sitting on the ground while meditating. Hiashi and Hanabi had just entered and all the Hyuga members they walked by bowed their heads while the branch members scowled at them in their heads. Even some of the less arrogant main members scowled at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cthis match between my daughter Hanabi and the failure Hinata will now begin.\u201d Hiashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost all the members scowled outwardly at that remark. Hinata stayed in her meditated, making no indication that she heard her so-called father. All she did was stand up and open her eyes. Her eyes, that were once full of happiness are no dull, were unique among the clan because she was the only one that had lavender in her eyes. All the other Hyuga had just plain white eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hiashi said begin Hanabi charged at Hinata thinking that she could end this battle in one blow. Boy was she wrong. She was about to hit Hinata when she just disappeared .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she hit was an after image. Then she turned around only to meet a gentle fist, which was far from gentle, to the gut. Hanabi lurched forward and coughed up some blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elders as well as Hiashi were shocked since they didn\u2019t think Hinata possessed that kind of speed and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi was still coughing while Hinata was looking down at her with an unreadable expression on her face. When Hanabi looked up and saw her sister\u2019s eyes she felt even more fear than when her father was glaring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell back and landed on her ass. \u201c H-hinata\u201d she stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata just raised her hand and charged chakra into it. \u201cit seems you are the weak one now pathetic little sister.\u201d She said in a cold voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi actually had tears in her eyes. Hinata then kicked her in the air and shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEIGHT TRIGRAMS: MOUNTAIN CRUSHER<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hanabi started falling back down she was caught in a blinding flash of white light before she was propelled through the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was now shocked that Hinata had finished Hanabi in 3 strikes. She stood there with her hand stretched out. A few seconds passed before she turned and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiashi getting out of his shock called for the medics. They came and checked Hanabi. She had a fractured jaw, two broken ribs and her left arm was completely crushed. Hiashi told them to get her to the medical facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elders also didn\u2019t look too happy. \u201cHiashi, what have you been teaching her?\u201d asked one of the elders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t teach her any of that. I didn\u2019t even know she knew those techniques.\u201d Hiashi said in his defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwell someone had to teach it to her since she could never learn those techniques on her own.\u201d Another elder said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cactually yes she could\u201d said a voice. They turned and saw that the voice belonged to one of the guards that talked to Hinata earlier. His name was Shingo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d Hiashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShingo decided to tell them the whole story. \u201c It all started when Hinata was 6. when you stopped training her in the gentle fist arts she had to find some other way to learn. So she came to the branch side to ask for help. We gave her the help that no one else would. The reason she never came to the main side was because years of being around Hiashi-sama made her think that all main branch members were as arrogant and as cruel as you were.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main branch members, even the arrogant members, hung their head in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard continued, \u201c after she spent a year of learning with us she could beat all of us individually and the strongest of us combined. She then started looking at clan techniques. She took some of them and learned them in the middle of the night. She was simply amazing when she showed us that she learned all the clan techniques. She is a natural genius if she is taught the right way. She managed to but up with you abusing her for almost all her life. She put up a mask of shyness to make herself look weak. She is, without a doubt, the strongest Hyuga alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone there could hardly believe what they had heard. Hinata, shy little Hinata, was the strongest Hyuga alive. Hiashi was feeling a lot of guilt swelling inside of him. All the branch and even all the main branch members were looking at Hiashi with unmasked anger. The elders didn\u2019t seem to care. (fucking old farts)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cthat\u2019s not all. After that incident when she was 9 years old. She was broken. She no longer smiled.\u201d The guard had tears in his eyes now. \u201c she no longer had life in her eyes any longer. Those eyes were blank and emotionless. I wish that she could smile again. We have tried everything, but nothing works. We fear that because of that incident she will never smile again.\u201d Finished the guard, not bothering to stop the tears that were falling out of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll members were openly crying, even the emotionless Neji who hadn\u2019t cried since his father died and Hiashi who hadn\u2019t shed a tear since his wife died. The elders were wondering something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Hiashi, what was this incident.\u201d Asked an elder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll members were paying attention now. Hiashi started to tell them,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c It all started when she lost a spar to Hanabi\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nflashback jutsu<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was on the floor with bruises and cuts all over her body. She had just finished sparring against her 4-year-old sister Hanabi. She had lost because she didn\u2019t want to hurt her sister. Her father had called her into his office to talk with her. The worst thing was is that all the injuries she had were not from the spar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could you lose to a child who is 5 years younger than you.\u201d Hiashi shouted as he slapped her across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I t-tri-ed m-my b-b-be-est.\u201d she stuttered out as she cried from the pain she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiashi ignored her as he screamed, \u201cYou have brought shame to our name and now it is time for your punishment.\u201d He pulled a whip out from under his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was truly frightened and tried to run but Hiashi was quicker as he made 2 clones. The held her down and ripped of her shirt exposing her back. If anybody walked by that room they might here the sounds of a child being tortured, sounds of whips cracking, and whimpers telling the owner to please stop which only increased the screaming,.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback jutsu release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hiashi finished everyone was glaring at him. 1 or 2 elders were also glaring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the elders who was glaring said, \u201cI suggest that you try to make up for the harsh treatment you caused her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless he goes through the same pain I went through, I can never forgive the man I once called my father.\u201d Said a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked up to see Hinata standing on the roof. She was in different clothes though. She was now in black biker shorts that hugged her hips perfectly. She was also wearing a long-sleeved black shirt with a red vest over it that had the Hyuga symbol on the back. She was also wearing black shinobi sandals and apparently she had a genjutsu on her hair because it now went down to her shoulder blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looked right at Hiashi and said, \u201cUntil you have felt the pain I have felt I can never forgive you.\u201d Then she disappeared in flurry of leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hyuga all got over their shock and went back inside, but not before giving one last glare to Hiashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiashi sank to his knees and cried while he thought this to himself. \u2018I am so sorry Hinata. I will find a way to make this up to you somehow. I swear it on your mother\u2019s grave.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Sarutobi\u2019s office he was currently reading a little orange book while giggling perversely, while his clones did his work, wait clones. He learned to beat paperwork in the scroll he read to the council. He felt rather stupid when he read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback jutsu<br>\r\nSarutobi was in his office facing a kage\u2019s worst enemy. PAPERWORK. He was getting frustrated because no matter how much he did it kept growing. He suddenly remembered the scroll that Naruto had sent him. He opened the scroll to the bottom, saw the seal and opened it. What he read was something that nearly made him have heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018If you want to beat paperwork. Just try shadow clones.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had a picture of a chibi Naruto holding his hand in the peace sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi did something that no one ever saw him do. He started hitting his head on the desk saying, \u201cstupid stupid stupid\u201d over and over again. He made some clones and had them do the paperwork while he pulled out a little orange book and started to read while giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback jutsu release<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi looked at the clock and saw that was time for him to go get the results from the jonin. He shunshined to the meeting room, waiting for the jonin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 5 minutes the room was packed with jonin. They were only missing Kakashi who showed up another 5 minutes later. The hokage threatened to ban him from the bookstore if he didn\u2019t show up in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right let\u2019s hear which teams passed and which teams failed.\u201d Sarutobi announced<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeam 1, failed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeam 2, failed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeam 3, failed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeam 4 failed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeam 5 failed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeam 6 failed miserably\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeam 7 passed barely\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got everyone\u2019s attention since Kakashi never passes a team. Before questions can be asked the hokage said that they will finish first and then ask questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeam 8 passed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeam 9 passed with flying colors\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeam 10 passed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor all the teams that passed I would like you to explain how they passed.\u201d Sarutobi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai went first, \u201cMy team consists of Hinata Hyuga, Kiba Inuzuka, And Shino Aburame. As far as I can tell is that with a little work they can become a perfect tracking squad. Hinata, from what I read, was supposed to be shy and quiet, but she was very perceptive, and figured out the true meaning of the test immediately and got the other two to work with her. She has complete mastery over her byakugan and seems to have invented techniques of her own. If I had to guess she held back during the test and could be at least jonin level right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone had to pick to pick their jaws of the floor as they heard her description of Hinata. Kurenia continued:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKiba is a loud, brash, and very arrogant boy. I\u2019ll have to work on that in the future. Shino is just like your typical Aburame; he is quiet, coolheaded and only talks when he needs to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma went next, \u201c my team is just like the normal Ino-Shika-Cho trio. Ino is a typical fangirl, but she is making improvement. Shikamaru is like any other Nara. A lazy, non-motivated, cloud-watching boy. The same with Choji, he\u2019s your typical Akimichi. They have the potential to become a capture/interrogation squad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi went next, \u201cmy team is made up of Sasuke Uchiha. Sakura Haruno, and Sai. They barely passed though. Sakura is the worst-case scenario of a fangirl. When Sasuke is anywhere near her. If me and Sai were dangling off a cliff and out of chakra, about to die and Sasuke had a scratch on him she would let us die. Sasuke has potential, but he is way to arrogant. He feels that if anyone has powerful techniques he doesn\u2019t know, being an Uchiha gives him the right to those techniques. Sai is different though. He used to be a part of roots but since Danzo was killed he has tried to make friends with his teammates but they flat out ignored him. He made friends with me and if it was up to me I would have failed them and made Sai my apprentice, but the council forced me to pass him. If Sasuke and Sakura would learn to work with Sai they could become an assassination squad. With Sasuke\u2019s speed, Sakura\u2019s genjutsu and Sai for support.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwhy is the council forcing you to pass the Uchiha.\u201d Kurenai asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cthey said if I didn\u2019t they would demote me to chunin and soil my father\u2019s grave further than they already have.\u201d Kakashi said sadly. Anko gave him a hug as he leaned on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hokage was pissed, \u201cI will have a talk with them after this meeting is done.\u201d Sarutobi said angrily. He motioned for Anko to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy team is probably the most advanced one. It consists of Kira Hatake, Saya Uchiha, Yukina Nara, and Naruto Namikaze. My team is quite unique. Naruto figured out the test as soon as it began. He grabbed the other 3 and teleported to a safer location. They came up with a brilliant plan. First Naruto transformed to look like Kira and attacked me with a high-level wind jutsu. He then did some kind of magma jutsu and and I was surrounded by molten magma. I tried to get out of there but Saya nicked me with a b-ranked fire jutsu. I got away but when I landed Yukina trapped me in her shadow jutsu and to make sure I couldn\u2019t make sure I couldn\u2019t escape Naruto caught me in a sealing jutsu that slowly drained my chakra. He told me to give up or he would make the prison blow up. If I had to guess that Yukina is low-chunin rank. Saya is high-chunin rank. Me and Kakashi-kun trained Kira so we know that she is at least high-chunin. Naruto, fro what I could tell is sannin or maybe even kage level. He was holding back a lot during the exam and I could tell that if ha wanted to beat me, he could have done it in one move.\u201d Anko finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone shuddered at the thought of Naruto going out. All the jonin in the room don\u2019t think any ill feelings towards him. They all considered him a comrade to the leaf..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi cleared his throat, getting everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cThank you for this information. Team missions will begin tomorrow. Now if you will excuse me I have a council to raise hell upon.\u201d Sarutobi said with an evil laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else sweat dropped. Anko then remembered something. \u201cOh yeah, Kakashi-kun we will be having company tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi raised an eyebrow, \u201cReally now. Who will be coming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko smiled and replied, \u201c you\u2019ll see later tonight. Now let\u2019s go home and freshen up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi nodded and they left. Pretty soon everyone else left to go do there own things. Asuma and Kurenai went home to do things..uh\u2026 lovers do.(fuck like rabbits in heat.) Kakashi and Anko went home to get things ready for their dinner guest. Lastly Sarutobi went to raise hell on those unsuspecting old farts and pig fuckers of the council.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kira had just dropped Yukina and Saya off back at their homes. Naruto was gonna ask Saya why she lived in that run down apartment tomorrow. Right now Naruto and Kira were making their way to the Hatake clan compound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you nervous about meeting me father Naru-kun?\u201d Kira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Not really, since I\u2019ve met tons of crazy people. I don\u2019t think your dad can be too crazy. It\u2019s your mom that scares me.\u201d Naruto responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Naru-kun, mom can be a big softy once you get to know her.\u201d Kira said, as they got closer to the house. Naruto got a grin on his face that scarred Kira a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a softy eh? Do you think you\u2019re any tougher?\u201d Naruto said with the grin still on his face. Kira slowly nodded. \u201c Well then little miss toughie, are you tough enough to survive against this?\u201d he questioned as he began to\u2026.tickle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chehehehe \u2026.. ahhhhh hahahahahaha okay, ahaa, I haha give hahahahahahahaha up \u2026ahhhhhhhh hahaha.\u201d Kira said between laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stopped his torture and once Kira regained her breath. She glared at Naruto but he just laughed. She then pouted. \u201c That was mean Naru-kun.\u201d Though she secretly enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, here let me make it up to you.\u201d Naruto said as he pulled her mask down a bit to give her a small kiss on the mouth. Kira sighed into the kiss, but was disappointed when it ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, we have to get to your house.\u201d Naruto said. Kira nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhen the got to the Hatake clan house, Naruto took note of its size. It was smaller than most clan compounds. It looks to be the size of a normal oversized house. It was the color gray and it had about 2-3 sections to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw Anko out there to greet them. \u201cAnko-sensei\u201d Naruto called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko looked towards the source of the voice and saw that it was Naruto. \u201cHey Naruto, Kira-chan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi mom\u201d Kira called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko led them inside the compound and it looked like the inside of a normal house. He looked around until his eyes landed on a man with gravity defying gray hair. He was wearing an ash gray tee shirt, along with a pair of blue jeans. He was wearing normal civilian shoes and he had a mask covering the lower half of his face just like Kira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Naruto, Kira.\u201d Stated the man<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chow do you know Naru0kun, father.\u201d Kira questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Naru-kun\u2019 the man thought, \u201cRemember Kira, I told you stories about him when you were little.\u201d Kira blushed embarrassed while Naruto laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKakashi Hatake\u201d he said sticking his hand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto took his hand saying, \u201cNaruto Namikaze at your service.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is nice to officially meet you Naruto. I think dinner is almost ready. So let\u2019s go eat.\u201d Kakashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had a nice dinner. They had some teriyaki chicken with some white rice. The dinner was also filled with some tempura and eggplant. The dinner was filled with some idle chitchat, a few laughs here and there, the normal stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they werwe done they retired to the living room. Anko started to talk, \u201cThe reason I called you here was to discuss something with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised an eyebrow, \u201cWhat would you like to talk about.\u201d Naruto said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you seen under Kira\u2019s mask?\u201d Anko asked seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she asked this question several things happened at once,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi choked on his own spit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sweat dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi looked at Anko, \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that he actually\u2026\u201d Anko nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto decided to answer the question, \u201cYes, I have seen behind her mask before. Was that a bad thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko shook her head to his question and asked Kira, \u201cDid you let him look under your mask or did he force it off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira still looked confused as she answered, \u201cHe didn\u2019t force it off of me. I let him take it off.\u201d Anko nodded and then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you mind telling me what this is all about.\u201d Naruto said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen a woman of the Hatake clan lets a male see under her mask by law they are now married.\u201d Kakashi answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kira were shocked, but that shock soon turned to joy as Kira gave Naruto a big hug. Naruto snapping out of his shock, smiled and hugged her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they broke apart Naruto noticed that both Kakashi and Anko were looking at them happily. Naruto then turned serious, \u201cYou realize that she is now a member of the Namikaze clan\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both nodded and said, \u201cYes we do, but we would rather see her with someone we know then someone who will just hit her and quit her later. Even though you two haven\u2019t known each other for long we can tell by looking in your eyes that you love each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira and Naruto just looked at each other and said, \u201c I love you Kira Hatake. Even though we have only known each other for a month I can honestly say it was love at first sight. Will you marry me?\u201d Naruto asked getting on one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira had tears in her eyes as she replied, \u201cYes Naruto Namikaze, I will marry you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto got up, pulled her mask down and gave her a passionate kiss that made sparkd fly between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi and Anko looked on with tears in their eyes. Their little girl was all grown up and she was engaged to a good man. They knew Naruto would protect her with his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He just had the emergency meeting and he was not happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback jutsu<br>\r\nSarutobi had just called the council into a meeting. When they were all got in there they could tell he was not happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh no, did he find out?\u2019 was the thought that went through most of the civilians heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe reason I have called you hear is to tell you something I have discovered recently.\u201d Sarutobi said calmly... a little to calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust tell us what you are planning on telling us Sarutobi.\u201d Koharu stated rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi looked at her with a straight face, \u201cYou will watch how you speak to me Koharu. I am the hokage and I can easily disband this council for a bunch of reasons. So watch your tongue or I may just remove it.\u201d He said in a cold voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoharu gulped as everyone backed away from Sarutobi. They had never seen him this angry since he saw the second hokage fall in battle back in the second great shinobi war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I was saying. It has come to my attention that you,\u201d he said pointing at the civilian half, \u201chave been threatening one of my ninja to pass one Sasuke Uchiha. How do you all plead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe plead guilty.\u201d Said the Haruno head like it was no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do realize I can put you all in jail for threatening a fellow shinobi of the leaf.\u201d Sarutobi said seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe civilian half looked a little scared, but the Haruno head again answered in bored voice, \u201cWe had to pass him to make sure the sharingan stays in our village.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf Sasuke is so important then why not force Anko to pass Saya too?\u201d Sarutobi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Homura answered, \u201cWhen Saya was born. She was born different then most Uchiha. When she turned six she was as powerful as an Uchiha with two sharingan tomoe. But she was born differently, she was born with a tumor in her eyes. It prevented her from ever unlocking the sharingan. The also will never be able to pass it on. So she was basically worthless to the Uchiha clan, and disowned at 7 when they found out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi was surprised that the Uchiha would do that just to make themselves look more powerful and not show any weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRegardless, you still did not have the authority to pass the Uchiha. That authority is strictly in the power of the jonin sensei.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat may be true, but it\u2019s too late now since he has already been passed.\u201d Said the Haruno head smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but he no longer a citizen of the leaf, but a Shinobi and therefore under my command.\u201d Sarutobi stated smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe civilians frowned at this. It was true. When someone became a ninja they were under the control of the ninja council instead of the civilian side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then since you have forced Sasuke to graduate when he wasn\u2019t supposed to he will have to do triple the amount of d-rank mission before he does a c-rank mission, and only the sensei can recommend him for the chunin exams.\u201d Sarutobi stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe civilians stood up and one shouted in outrage, \u201cThat is not fair hokage-sama.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Sarutobi stood up and yelled. \u201cI am the hokage and I make the punishments. You civilians have stepped out of line ever since the first hokage ruled. Mark my words, the next time any of you step out of line I will have you all executed for insubordination. This meeting is over\u201d he then shunshined out of the room leaving everybody speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then came back in and said, \u201cI forgot my pipe.\u201d He picked the pipe up and shunshined again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sweat dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback jutsu release<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto, hurry up and turn 21 so I can retire.\u201d Sarutobi said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made some clones, had them do the work while he read his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Naruto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sneezed. \u201cIs something wrong Naru-kun.\u201d Kira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, someone must be talking about me. I am famous you know.\u201d Naruto said striking a pose. Kira laughed at his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked down the streets a bit until Naruto said, \u201cKira, I know that we are now engaged, but I think we should try and get to know each other better. I don\u2019t want to move things on to fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira nodded signifying that she agreed. \u201cI agree, I think we should go on a couple dates to get to know each other more. You should probably do the same with Saya and Yukina.\u201d Naruto nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwell we already had dinner at your place so I think we can go train for a bit. I could teach you some new jutsu.\u201d Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira, at the mention of new jutsu, started jumping around like a little kid on Christmas morning. \u201c Oh thank you Naru-kun, thank you. \u201c she said giving him a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyour welcome Kira-chan.\u201d Naruto responded as he returned the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decided to go to training ground 17. when they got there Naruto pulled out a plain white card. \u201cKira-chan, this is known as an elemental card. When you pump chakra into it, different things can happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwhat kind of things?\u201d Kira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cif it catches on fire it shows that your elemental affinity is fire, it gets wet for water, crumbles for lightning, turns to dust for earth and splits in half for wind.\u201d Naruto explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira nodded as Naruto handed her the card. She pumped chakra into it and the card split in two pieces, one half of it burned and the other half crumpled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto whistled, \u201cWow Kira-chan. You have 2 affinities. You have one for lightning and one for fire. Normally you have to be at least low jonin level to get even one affinity. But two, you must be pretty strong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira blushed at his praise. \u201cthank you Naru-kun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyour welcome\u201d he replied. \u201c For now I am going to teach you a fire jutsu so stand back.\u201d She stood back as Naruto went through some hand seals before calling out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFIRE STYLE: PHEONIX FLAMETHROWER JUTSU<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA widely spread stream of blue fire came out of his mouth. It warped into a phoenix head and it sprayed fire out of its mouth on to the ground below. Then it dived down and exploded on impact with the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned around to see Kira\u2019s wide eyed expression. He nearly laughed at it. He walked over to her and he closed her mouth. She got out of her stupor and practically yelled out. \u201cthat was the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Naruto did chuckle. \u201cyes that is one amazing jutsu. That is an s-rank fire jutsu of my own invention. Since you are now a member of the Namikaze clan you will have access to our techniques.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cthat technique I showed you is a very complicated. It what probably be in the forbidden scroll since it takes up chakra equal to that of a low jonin. But thanks to me fusing with kyuubi, my chakra reserves barely gave 1 of my chakra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira was surprised that Naruto had so much chakra. She decided to start practicing the jutsu. She did the hand seals, called out the name and a normal sized phoenix came out. The only problem was that this phoenix was nowhere near the size of Naruto\u2019s and the fire wasn\u2019t blue, but red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira felt sad that she couldn\u2019t do it. Naruto, upon noticing, tried to cheer her up, \u201cit\u2019s okay Kira-chan, that is an s-rank jutsu for a reason. If you keep practicing, you\u2019ll get it in no time.\u201d Kira brightened up at this. She went right back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4 HOURS LATER<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira was on the ground panting. She had managed to get most of the jutsu done. The only things that were wrong was that her phoenix was only half the size of Naruto\u2019s and the fire wasn\u2019t blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cthat was good.\u201d She heard him say. \u201cyou almost got the whole technique down. The only problem now is that we have to work on is building your chakra reserves. Do you know the tree walking exercise?\u201d she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwhat about the water walking?\u201d Naruto asked. Kira shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cthen tomorrow we are going to work on the water walking. We are also going to get Saya and Yukina her to work on these exercises.\u201d She nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m too tired to get up. Will you carry me home, please?\u201d Kira asked with the puppy eye jutsu. SSSS-rank ninja or not, Naruto could never resist the puppy eye jutsu. He caved<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201call right Kira. I\u2019ll carry you home.\u201d Naruto responded. He picked her up bridal style, eliciting a squeak from her, and started to carry her back to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got back to the house he noticed that Kira had fallen asleep in his arms. He opened the door and saw Kakashi and Anko sitting on the couch watching T.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey could you tell me where Kira\u2019s room is?\u201d Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were about to answer when they saw Kira in Naruto\u2019s arms. They immediately rushed over to him and started to hound him with questions. Naruto soon got irritated and shouted, \u201cBe quiet.\u201d They shut up almost instantly. Amazingly Kira stayed asleep through all the shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were just training and she got tired and asked if I would carry her home. I agreed and she fell asleep in my arms.\u201d Naruto explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey relaxed a bit and apologized for shouting. Naruto waved them of saying it was okay. Kakashi asked a question that was on his mind, \u201cWhat exactly were teaching her Naruto?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was teaching her about elemental affinities.\u201d Naruto responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko and Kakashi were shocked, \u201cIsn\u2019t she a little to young to learn about that stuff?\u201d Anko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto set Kira down on the couch as he responded, \u201capparently she isn\u2019t because she has an affinity to fire and lightning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both so shocked that they thought they were going to faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was teaching her a fire technique that I created called the phoenix flamethrower. It\u2019s an S-rank jutsu. She almost mastered it all she really needs to do is build up her chakra reserves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Anko fainted. Kakashi was barely holding onto consciousness. Naruto was done talking and went home but not before shouting a goodnight to Kakashi and giving a small kiss on the cheek to Kira. Kakashi picked Kira up and put her in her own bed and said a goodnight to her. He then went back down stairs, got Anko and he put her in bed. Then he got in bed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto got home he was tired so he went to bed after changing into his night time clothes. He then had wonderful dreams about Kira, Saya and Yukina. Not perverted dreams, but dreams of the future where all 3 of them were happy and having their kids play together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe now find Naruto, Saya, Yukina, and Kira working on building their chakra reserves. It turns out that all of them knew the tree walking exercise and Saya knew the water walking exercise. Right now Kira and Yukina were working on water walking while Naruto was working with Saya on kunai balancing. They were currently waiting for Anko to show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 15 minutes later that Anko had finally shown up. In that time Kira and Yukina had learned the water walking and Saya had almost gotten the kunai balancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what have you all been doing here?\u201d Anko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey told her that Naruto was helping them with chakra control exercises. To which Anko responded,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Naruto, that makes one less thing I have to teach you little squirts.\u201d They all sweat dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let\u2019s go get a mission okay.\u201d Said Anko. They nodded and followed her to the hokage\u2019s office where they would soon discover the horror of D-rank missions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 MONTH LATER<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter a long month of D-rank mission\u2019s team 9 could only say one thing about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHEY SUCK MORE ASS THAN SASUKE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had cleaned gutters, babysitted babies, pulled weeds and the worst of them all. They chased the daimyo wife\u2019s cat 5 TIMES.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were now in the hokage\u2019s office getting a new mission. Then Naruto said to the hokage, \u201cHokage-sama, I think we have done enough D-rank to qualify for at least 4 C-rank missions\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi was a little scared since Naruto only called him by that title when he was serious or when he was pissed. There was nothing serious so he must be pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka, who was helping with missions today, said to Naruto, \u201cYou might be ready for higher missions, but are your teammates ready for a higher mission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko stepped up and said, \u201cI think my team is more than ready for a C-rank mission. Hell my team could probably take on several B-rank missions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you really think your team is ready for missions like that then here.\u201d Sarutobi said tossing them s scroll that was labeled C-rank. \u201cPlease bring in the client.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA middle aged man wearing a sleeveless brown shirt, tan pants, and a rain hat, drinking a bottle of sake came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cthese are the brats that are supposed to protect me. The only one that looks strong is the blonde and the blonde one. All the others look weak.\u201d The man said a little drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto quickly made 4 clones to hold them all back. While they were trying to escape the real Naruto walked right up to Tazuna and told him in a calm voice. \u201cI assure you that we are all capable ninja. Our sensei is an elite jonin. The rest of us can take care of ourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf your sure, but I would feel more comfortable if there was one more team.\u201d Tazuna said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Sarutobi, Naruto and Anko caught his nervousness, but decided to ignore it. \u201cIf your sure then I suppose we could make this a joint mission.\u201d Sarutobi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then team 7 and 8 walked through the door. Sasuke upon seeing Naruto, was not very happy. \u201chmph, if it isn\u2019t the idiot of the century. What are you doing in here anyway you moron?\u201d Sasuke said rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you must know Sasgay, we were receiving a C-rank mission from the hokage.\u201d Naruto said in a monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was Kiba who responded, \u201cWhat. Why would they give a higher mission to a blonde haired idiot like you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Kurenia and Kakashi bonked them over their heads and told them to watch their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cactually I was just about to call in team 8, you will be going on joint c-rank mission-\u201c the hokage was interrupted by the shrill voice of the pink-haired banshee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cbut hokage-sama why are they going instead of us. They aren\u2019t as strong as my Sasuke-kun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other genins looked pissed at her for saying they were weaker then somebody else when she was the weakest one out of all the people here. In fact Sai decided to voice his opinion of that comment,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour one to talk since you\u2019re the weakest one of us here, you pink-haired whore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi decided to intervene before someone got sent to the hospital. \u201cThat is enough you two. Sai you need to not always insult your teammates.\u201d Sai just nodded. Sakura looked smug. That soon ended when Kakashi added, \u201cAnd you need to learn to keep your big mouth shut and not interrupt the Hokage. Sai is right though, of all the genins you\u2019re the weakest and it will stay that way unless you stop stalking Sasuke and start training. Oh and FYI Sasuke is no the strongest there are a lot of genins that stronger then him so stop fawning over him all the time because it is very creepy.\u201d Kakashi said all this not once talking his face away from the book he was reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked ready to cry, Sasuke was livid at not being the strongest genin in the village. (A/N: for your information duckass, just because you\u2019re an Uchiha doesn\u2019t entitle you to being the strongest. All it entitles you to is the right to suck dick like the flaming fag you are. (sorry if your gay, I have nothing against gay people)). Sai had a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was laughing his ass off. Shino didn\u2019t even look like he heard anything. Hinata had a slight smirk on her face since she found the whole thing a little amusing. Kurenai was shaking her head at how weak Sakura was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls of team 9 were all giggling to themselves while Naruto said, \u201cBuuuuuurn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hokage cleared his throat, \u201cAs I was saying, I will be sending team 9 and team 8 on a joint C-rank mission to Wave Country. You will be protecting Mr. Tazuna while he finishes building a bridge in his country. You are just to protect him from natural thieves and bandits. Meet at the East gate in 2 hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teams nodded and left. Now only team 7 was left. \u201cWill we be taking a mission Hokage-sama?\u201d Sai asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, oh yes. Team 7 your mission is to catch the cat Tora. Hurry along now before he gets away.\u201d Sarutobi said while ushered them out of the room. They wordlessly left the room while. Sasuke still had a pissed off look on his face. Sakura still looked like she was going to cry. Sai still had a smile on his face, and Kakashi still had his nose buried in his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 HOURS LATER AT THE EAST GATE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nall the teams were there at the gate waiting for their sensei and the client. The decided to catch up with the other teams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto went to talk to Hinata. \u201cHello Hinata.\u201d Naruto said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata saw him, and nodded to him. Naruto noticed that she was acting a lot differently then she did back in the academy. \u201cYour acting a lot differently then you did back in the academy. In the academy I thought you were the shy, cute type, but I can see that you are the badass, hot type. So, what caused you to change?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Hinata had been her other self she would have blushed cherry red and fainted, but since she was the new Hinata she only had a tinge of pink on her face as she answered, \u201cThe shinobi are masters of deception, so I made myself a mask that showed myself to be weak and shy so people would underestimate me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, but why did you do it?\u201d asked Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata then told Naruto about everything. From when her father gave up on her training, to her befriending the branch family, to her mastering all the techniques. She told him about everything, she didn\u2019t know why, but she felt she could trust this guy. She even told him of the torture she got when she was 9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto heard the story he felt anger, happiness and sadness. Anger at Hiashi and almost all the Hyuga. Happiness that Hinata had mastered very complicated techniques. Sadness because shi must have an almost as bad childhood as he had. He ushered Hinata to come to him. She hesitated before she did. When she was close enough Naruto wrapped his arms around her waist and teleported somewhere else. No one noticed that they even left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSOMEWHERE IN THE FORREST<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they landed in the forrest Naruto let go of Hinata who ready to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the big idea blondie.\u201d Hinata screamed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto ignored the comment and said in a nice voice, \u201cI\u2019m going to heal those scars on your back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caused Hinata to stiffen for a minute before she looked up at him. \u201cCan you really do that?\u201d she asked with a tint of hope in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I can, but your going to have to trust me.\u201d Naruto said in a serious, but kind, voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cokay\u201d she said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto told her to take off her shirt and lie on her stomach. She was a little hesitant doing this in front of a guy, but did it non-the-less. (he turned around when she did it for all you perverts out there.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she lied down Naruto noticed that her entire back was covered in bandages. He slowly removed the bandages and saw the nastiest whip marks he had ever seen. (and that is really saying something.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was disgusted that her own father did this to her. \u2018and they call me demon\u2019 Naruto thought sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe charged his hands with medical chakra except that it was red instead of green. (side-effect from absorbing Kyuubi.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe touched the bottom of her back softly and ran his hands up her back and slowly the wounds began to heal. When he was done the scars and wounds were all gone. Her back was smooth as the day she was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cit\u2019s okay I\u2019m done now and you have no more wounds on your back.\u201d Naruto said soothingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata, for the first time since her mother died when she was 5 felt happy. Once she had everything back on she gave Naruto a little peck on the cheek and thanked him for healing her. She smiled truly for the first time in over 8 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back it looked like no one even noticed they were gone. 5 minutes later both Kurenai and Anko showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU\u2019RE LATE\u201d shouted everyone but Naruto, Shino, and Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had to find the client. He was in a bar almost passed out.\u201d said Anko not showing the slightest bit that she heard them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started walking along the path and then they saw a puddle. They all new that it was a disguise but Kiba had to comment, \u201cthat has got to be the lamest disguise in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sighed at Kiba\u2019s stupidity as the two ninja in there sped towards them. Naruto reacted and drew his sword. He charged it with lightning chakra and stuck it in the chain. The lightning went up the chain and electrocuted them. They detached their chains before it could do major damage. They made a dash for the client before they nicked Kiba with their claws. Then Yukina caught them in her shadow technique. They couldn\u2019t move, then Naruto shouted out to Hinata \u201cIncapacitate them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did and they were out like lights. Naruto ran over to Kiba and checked his wound, \u201cTheir claws have some poison on them. We need to let the poison bleed out.\u201d Naruto said seriously. He cut Kiba\u2019s hand and let the poison bleed out. He wrapped his hand after words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTazuna we need to have a talk.\u201d Kurenai said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(skip Tazuna\u2019s talk)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is serious. This is beyond our skill. The only ninja here who are even close to being ready for this kind of danger are Kurenai/Anko sensei, me and Hinata. We should probably go back.\u201d Naruto said. \u201cbut what kind of ninja would we be if we abandoned a client.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko nodded \u201cNaruto is right normally we would go back and get some reinforcements, but we got all the man power we need.\u201d Anko turned to look at Kurenai \u201cYou may stay with us if you please, but it would be better if you leave and go back to the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai smirked and said to Anko, \u201cAnd miss all the fun, you got to be kidding. Besides my students need some action to make it in the shinobi world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko nodded, \u201cAll right it looks like we will be going on with the mission old man\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much.\u201d Tazuna said happily with tears in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let\u2019s go.\u201d Said Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone wordlessly went on the path. They were now more alert. The demon brothers were left tied up for anbu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone in the tree said to himself, \u201cWell looks like I\u2019ll get to fight the Sojokou Senkou sooner than I thought. Be prepared because my sword will claim your life.\u201d He then disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
