And every time she brings her snapped her arm back down, they think for sure that they'd fall down below. Their bodies grew numb and ears went deaf, the only thing that reminded them of still being alive was the sweet buttery smell of Katie's finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"V for victory!\" Katie posed at the screen.

After half an hour the tiny family were almost halfway to their destination when all of a sudden a deafening nose could be heard, then it stops, after a couple seconds it started again. That's when they realize it's a phone and Katie gets up to answer it. They could barely make out what Katie was saying, but what they heard made them start sprinting to the side of the shoe. \"Hi Susan, of course I'm able to come over. Let me get my shoes on and I will be right over.\" Katie then hangs up the phone and walks back to the couch to get her shoes. The Howards and Ray stopped in their tracks as Katie's face appears over the shoe, they try to get her attention but they are way to small to be seen by the unaware 11 year old. As Katie picks up the shoe they are in the micro family members start tumbling towards the toe end of the shoe.As they looked back they could see her barefoot start to enter the shoe and heading right for them.

Try as they might to escape, the slippery slopes of her tongue prevented any of them from escaping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" the giant girl giggled as she took her first taste of the ice cream sandwich. She made extra care not to use her finger that her microscopic family had previously inhabited, completely forgetting that she licked them clean. Katie slowly started licking and slurping away at the ice cream, wanting to savor this one rather than scarf it down like the two before it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did however, her family was trapped underneath the immense weight of the sandwich, only to be used as an expansion of the 11 year-old's tongue. All they could taste or see was the chocolate bar followed by a glacier of vanilla ice cream. As they screamed Katie unintentionally force fed them what could easily be their last meal. The shrunken family finally ceased their unheard screams the mix of vanilla and saliva successfully downed them out. The pressure alone beginning to become too much for their little bodies to handle. Just as they were beginning to accept their fate, some of the pressure lifted as Katie pulled the ice cream back out of her mouth, with her family still trapped in their vanilla prison. Katie's father opened his eyes as he once again heard the screams of his wife and oldest daughter being almost drowned out by the innocent laughter of his youngest. He looked down as the distance between himself and his daughter's mountainous tongue grew greater, only to realize that the ice cream was one scream short. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me! Please don't...\" Ray screamed, trying to swim through Katie's marches of saliva, vanilla, and cookie bits flooding the tip of her tongue. Katie's father reached for his friend's hand, knowing full wall that the distance between them was too great. Seeing that Katie had yet to close her mouth, her father couldn't help but hope for his friend's safe return. Only after he began to pray did a large object pass by the ice cream sandwich full speed to Katie's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a can of root beer that Ray himself had brought for Katie just as he did every time that he came over to work with her dad. Ray's field of view was cut from the outside world, as the open can reached Katie's lips. The soft drink hit Ray's body hard like a hurricane, knocking him back. Try as he might to hold on, all it did was cause the incoming tides to forcefully press his body again the little girl's taste buds as she happily drank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... nothing like root beer and ice cream,\" Katie swallowed, unknown to her of the once full grown man she just barely tasted. Assuming it was little more than a random sprinkle, she opened her mouth once again revealing that Ray was nowhere to be seen. Stricken with the worst grief imaginable,  Katie's only snapped out of it once he saw his daughter's intense and close up gaze to his exact location...</span></div></div>",

A few seconds later light spilled back in as Katie opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie grabbed a napkin from the counter and spat in to it. \"Gross...\" she said, bringing it to her face.

A loud gurgle from her stomach pulled her attention to her tummy, and her memories of the recent past back to her mind. She didn't drop them or hadn't put them anywhere before she took the keys, she were finished with both of her ice creams, she had licked her free hand clean to get the keys, and while doing so, she had unintentionally licked the fingers of the hand her family was on. And that feeling in her stomach, as if something was hitting her? It must have been her family, trying to tell her that she ate them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie started to panic even more. Her family was in her stomach and she was the only one who could take them out. Trying to think back, to remember anything that could help her get her family out of her stomach, she suddenly recalled the syrup her mother drank whenever she coughed much, and she clearly remembered that her mother would vomit afterwards. Running to their bathroom, pushing the small chair she used to reach the sink in order to brush her teeth to reach to the mirror. Opening it up, she quickly found the syrup of her interest. Being clever enough for a child lock, she opened it and drunk two gulp of the syrup. Running back to the kitchen, with ipecac syrup, lots of ice-cream and her family sloshing around in her tummy, although she could no longer feel them thumping her stomach, Katie quickly took the bowl on the table and placed it on the ground, feeling rather nauseous. She leaned down over it and in a few seconds, she spilled the contents of her stomach in to the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter resting for a few seconds to pull herself back together, the youngest of the family, now trusted - or was trusted - with their well being for now, picked the magnifying glass she left in the living room and started to look for her family in the bile she just puked up. Holding her nose and trying her best not to gag, she finally saw her father, partially submerged in a soft milky mound. Moving the magnifying glass closer she saw...</span></div></div>",

The different massive pink structures seem to all be sticking out of a vast large cave. She tries to start walking but after standing in the one spot for so long her feet become stuck to the foamy surface, causing her to fall onto the ground on her back, which causes her to stick more. \"What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\nMeanwhile Katie is finishing preparing the food and drinks for the girls and goes to get changed, walking past the table filled with cookies, chips and dip, soft drinks and some open gum packets on a plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\nSuddenly Christy sees Katie walk past her and she screams \"Katie!

She sets her eyes on Derek, Ray and Shelly, each of which are starting to wake up too. When she looks up, she spots a large bottle of 7up hovering over her like a ship and some plates around her with cookies and sweets. Christy looks down again and screams when she realizes where they landed, on a plate of open gum packets. She needed to get Katie's attention now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\nKatie hears the doorbell ring signalling her friends arrival. She opens the door and in come her best friends from school Amy, Lori and Kate. \"Hi guys, come on in, there's food and drink in the back.\" \"Cool, I can't believe your parents left you alone here for so long, where are they?\" Amy asks. Katie tries to think for a minute. \"hmm, I don't remember, I saw them earlier but I forgot. oh well, I'm sure I'll remember soon. Let's go out back.\" \"Okay\" replied the girls simultaneously and together they went through the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\nThe family heard some voices in the distance, deep but with a hint of youth.

He took one last look around and saw the other girls opening their own monstrous mouths for their gums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REMEMBER, FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE\" Kate's voice boomed over Shelly as she screamed, her minuscule voice not changing anything<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M SO GOING TO WIN THIS!\" Amy's voice carried over Ray, too scared to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET'S DO THIS.\" Katie stated, not hearing her father, Derek, yelling at her, begging her to stop and look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_640x430/public/istock_000010991152_small.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/defa...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the little people screamed in horror as their gums were placed on the large tongues together and were suddenly launched into the different caverns, each one hot and wet. Light was shut off in Ray and Derek's worlds as Katie and Amy like chew with their mouth closed. Their lands folded in on themselves and they were surrounded by gum on all sides. This all happened in the span of 2 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek's world rocked forward and he knew he laid on the molar of his little baby girl, which was about to mash him to pulp without even realizing. The girls started chewing and Derek felt extreme pressure above and below him. \"This is it.\" he thought, but then the pressure left as soon as it started and then it began again, incredibly fast. Derek realized that the gum acts as a barrier which stops him from being crushed but it doesn't stop the relentless pain and pressure he is feeling with each chew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhh\" he screams in pain as his bones feel like they will break with each chew. <b>MASH</b> \"plea\" <b>MASH</b> \"Kati\" <b>MASH</b> \"Sto\" <b>MASH MASH MASH MASH</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was going through torture and then he realized that if he was surviving this, albeit with unbearable suffering, then so to we his wife, daughter and best friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly mouth was open in pain but no noise came out as her sides were being squeezed unrelentingly by  Kate's molars. With each chew, she would get a glimpse of light through the teeth as Kate chews with her mouth opened up, before she would be tossed back to face the cheek wall or throat and more gum would swallow her up and release her somewhere else on the landscape with each chomp. <b>MASH MASH MASH MASH MASH MASH</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay's world was in upheaval as Amy tossed her piece of gum and Rays only hope between her left and right sides of her mouth constantly while chewing with each toss. Her mouth opened sometimes to say something, causing the enormous tongue to flick in all directions to form a word, trashing Ray all over, he couldn't even hear what she was saying over each chomp and flick. He was in severe pain and wanted to throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrisy was weeping and crying heavily as she was smashed twice every second. She made another futile attempt for help to save her from the torture of Amy's mouth. \"Plea\" <b>MASH</b> \"help\" <b>MASH</b> \"me\" <b>MASH</b> \"pleas\" <b>MASH MASH MASH</b> Christy's voice was lost in the gum around her and Amy's only reaction was chewing harder while gleefully laughing and chatting to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\n\"I've *shlick* got a good feeling *shlick* about this one guys, it's gonna be *shlick* my longest yet\" Lori told the girls as she chewed loudly and then smiled and chewed harder<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy giggled at her, \"ew, Close your mouth while chewing\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let's play some games.\" Katie offered, which all the girls agreed to and they carried on with their peaceful lives chewing away at their gum happily, feeling good about life, each one torturing a beloved member of the Howard family and friend without remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\nEach one of the hostages of these 11 year old's mouths prayed for death after about 5 minutes of when they started but the gum wouldn't let it be and kept them alive in their suffering. Minutes of chewing turned into Hours of chewing which turned into whole days of chewing. The girls went their own ways home, waving goodbye and still chewing away on their respective family member. The family and Ray prayed and begged and screamed but their relentless tormentors would continue to destroy their hopes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls chewed their gum pieces all the time. The only time the family of little people were given any break from their pain and hell was when these monolithic creatures would sleep, shower or get nice, hot food to eat. The little people were overjoyed to be out if the mouths only for their hopes to be in vain when large fingers picked them up and lifted them up to the open mouths to begin again. Food would get stuck between teeth which would mix with the gum and be forced upon their prisoners, feeding them without their consent, keeping them alive in hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was the first to give up after a week. She was forced to stay with her aunt after the first day when her family never showed up. After a week, her hopes were torn as there was no trace of them and she was forced to live with family relatives. She was in class very depressed when she decided she wasn't in the mood for her gum, she just wanted her family. She took out her gum with her father still alive yet badly beaten up and stuck it to the underside of her desk before leaving her class. Derek was expecting her to pick him up for yet another round of torture when she suddenly left him there, causing him to panic and soon die of starvation hanging from his daughters school desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\n\"*shlick* I'm really sorry *shlick* about your family Katie\" Lori said as she casually chewed loudly on Katie's sister. The 4 girls were talking and feeling sorry for Katie who lost her family without reason. Amy and Lori were chewing on her family and friend like it was nothing, which to them it was. \"Thanks, hey, are you still chewing on the same gum?\" \"Yea, of course.\" they replied. \"I've got mine in my pocket here.\" replied Kate as she took out a wrapper and revealed her piece. Shelly awoke to light and saw her daughter looking down at her. \"Katie, honey, down here!\" But she was too small. \"Why aren't you chewing on it now then?\" Katie says while looking at the gum. \"No, please honey\" Shelly could only say. \"Huh, I dunno.\" Kate said as she popped her gum into her mouth and began chewing. Shelly screamed again \"Noooo\"<b>MASH MASH</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\nAfter 2 weeks, Amy gave up on her piece. She thought she had enough of it and decided to 'dispose' of it. Of course, Amy isn't like most people when it comes to her gum and instead of throwing it away, she likes to swallow it instead. Ray was in the worst kind of torture and pain the last fortnight when his world of chewing stopped. Ray was slightly glad for his temporary break only to be suddenly lurched toward the back of Amy's throat. Before he knew it, 'GULP' his world was falling. He then realized what had happened. \"Noooo, please, not like this, nooooo-\" his final screams vanished beneath the acid sea of this 11 year old as she ate a human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate surrendered after 3 weeks and dumped her gum on the pavement. \"someone else's problem\" she thought. Shelly fell from the sky with a plop and lay in her prison watching gargantuan creatures walk above her. She needed to get out but the gum help after 3 weeks of saliva. Then a jogger came by and Shelly screamed as her runner landed on her. Shelly thought she ws dead but instead she was getting glimpses of light every half a second followed by a <b>BOOM</b> and severe pressure and pain. Shelly and her gum were stuck to the bottom of this athletes runner. \"No\" <b>BOOM</b> \"Please God\" <b>BOOM</b>\"No\". She would die later on from suffocation or starvation, but not after experiencing a heavy workout and run at the hands of an unknown athlete, just trying to keep fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, while Lori beat her 3 friends and passed her record of a month chewing, she still wanted to continue with her piece and so she carried on chewing her prisoner (which Lori calls gum) cruelly without care. Why would she care, to her it's just a piece of gum. Christy cried and cried in pain as Lori kept chomping down on her day after day after day until she became bored with her and got rid of her her own way. By then, Christy had forgotten almost who she was.</span></div></div>",

People in California were horrified to see their morning sun replaced by a front door taller than the atmosphere.  Astronauts aboard the International Space Station were unable to do anything as they hurtled towards the massive structure, leaving a tiny scorch mark on the doorknob.  Thunderous earthquakes rocked the world as something moved inside the house.  The door opened revealing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie opened the door, and looked about the empty space.  There was a small patch of sandy ground that led to a large puddle.  Katie was confused: where's the neighborhood?  She looks about before cupping her hands to her mouth and calling out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"HELLOOO?  ANYBODY OUT THERE?</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting a moment to hear a reply, Katie decides to walk towards the puddle and take a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound reverberated around the globe, instantly deafening all within a few hundred miles of the new goddess.  The world watched in horror as a 30-mile long foot lifted in the air, before descending on Fresno.  The city never stood a chance; the entire population was pulverized in an instant.  A record-setting earthquake shatters every building in the state, and knocks everyone prone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess has taken a single step.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other leg swings forward, and an identical foot lands just outside of San Francisco.  The combination of an earthquake and sandstorm blasts the rubble, sending people and debris flying for miles.  Her right foot then lifts off of Fresno, leaving behind a 2 mile deep crater, before landing alongside the other foot.  The goddess lifts a foot over the city, allowing thousands of tons of debris to rain on the survivors below.  A single toe dips into the water, creating a massive tidal wave that washes away the Golden Gate Bridge.  The foot returns to its original position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was confused.  The whole area was nearly flat, and felt like super soft sand.  She walked over to the water, and dipped a toe in.  It felt cool, but was incredibly shallow; she couldn't even fit her big toe underwater!  She sighs, and looks about before noticing a small patch of gray at her feet.  She stoops over, and takes a closer look at the city.  It looks like some kind of mold.  Something tickles her nose; she gives a huge sniffle before sneezing.  She watches as dust kicks up about her, and slowly settles back down.  Her curiosity partially satisfied, she stands back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole world shook as the goddess lowered her head to the city.  For a moment, the survivors celebrated, thinking they were finally saved.  They realized the truth when the mile-wide eyes scanned over them with a look of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, an airliner was flying away from the city when an enormous hole entered their path.  A rush of wind sucked the aircraft into the nostril, before smashing against a single nose hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarther below, the survivors are frozen in fear as the nose passes above them.  Suddenly, a gale like no other sucks anything and everything into the air.  Before anybody could reach the heavenly void, the mouth nearby opens, and a deluge of sound, air, and water blasts out.  The blast sends the whole city airborne.  Nobody remained alive there to watch as the goddess rose up to her original height.</span></div></div>",

She looks about the empty space, and notices some green to her right.  Maybe it will be edible?  She leans over and scoops up a small chunk, smells it, then tosses it into her mouth.  The flavor's a little weird, but it doesn't taste bad.  She gets down on her hands and knees and licks up some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe military were stumped.  They couldn't think of a single weapons that could harm the girl.  Hell, even signalling her seemed impossible at this size. All they could do is watch the nightmare.  And it did grow worse.  The people  in Portland, Oregon were all watching as the goddess demolished California, then turn and look directly at them.  The massive feet approached with their tell-tale earthquakes,but this time she stopped short of the sprawling forests.  As she leaned over, a monstrous hand reached for the tiny city.  The fingers effortlessly dig into the ground, and lift the entire city up in the air, leaving behind a hole miles deep.  People held on for dear life as their sky was replaced with two enormous nostrils.  As the goddess inhaled, those who weren't able to hang on were sucked into her nose, never to be seen again.  The few who survived consider themselves lucky, until their city was shoved into a cavernous maw.  The ground beneath them dissolved in an instant, leaving the terrified survivors afloat in an ocean of saliva.  This too was short-lived, as the goddess swallowed the city and its people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to enjoy the taste, and laid down on her hands and knees.  This movement rattled the northwest to their bones, but not as much as the next sight to behold.  A miles-wide tongue extended from an enormous maw, and began to sweep across Oregon.  There was no escape: if you were in its path your were either stuck to the surface or crushed underneath.  Anywhere the tongue touched became a slimy wasteland, devoid of any life and covered in a thick bog of spit.  In this manner, the entire state of Oregon was wiped off the map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an unexpected turn of events, Katie's neighbor Jim managed to survive the growth spurt, and was now hanging onto the side of the massive house.  He sees Katie in the distance, seemingly unaware of the destruction she's causing.  Jim realizes what the device was, and fires it again at Katie.  What setting was it on this time?</span></div></div>",

It collapses like a doll house, sending state-sized chunks of wood and debris flying around the world.  The shockwave of Katie falling implodes the United States, killing everyone in a single blast of pressure.  Katie still grows, topping 10,000 miles as she beats the Earth in size.

She had finally cornered it to this one abandoned lot, which didn't seem to hold anything except for a broken machine. \"Max! Where are you?\" she called out.

The tinies finally understood what they were looking at - a person! Granted, they were larger than any planet ever encountered, but the answer seemed to be staring at them the entire time. Well, at least it was <i>now</i>. A moon-sized globe stared down upon the house, the eye of this goddess, the decider of their fates. The humans hoped that this woman would show them mercy, even if she couldn't see them with a microscope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's eyes widened in surprise as she saw the house. <i>Wow,</i> she thought, <i>it</i> is <i>real!</i> The plumbing was accurate, the inside was detailed, even the door seemed to work.

Well, at least it was insignificant to <i>her</i>. Hurricane-like winds tugged at the shrunken quintet, tearing them apart from each other's grasp. They screamed, trying to hold on, but it was too much. All five of them landed on a different toe of Susan\u2019s right foot, each lost in their own fleshy world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek landed on a random skin cell on Susan\u2019s big toe, which was to him at least a mile in length. He tried to see if he could find the rest of his family, but discovered that he was in fact on a skin flake inside the minuscule indentation between the two joints on one\u2019s toe. There was no way he could climb up the Grand Canyon-sized walls. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u201cHello? Shelley? Christy? Katie?\u201d</font> he called out, his pathetic cries bouncing off the walls of skin, audible by no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly tumbled onto the Hispanic giantess\u2019 toenail next to Derek\u2019s toe. She dusted herself off on impact and tried to walk, but the toenail was freshly painted by Susan less than 5 minutes. The paint was like a reddish-purplish swamp that was drying fast. The microscopic woman tried wading at top speed, but soon realized it would take a long time before she got anywhere, as the hardened paint trapped her in place. She sighed. Hopefully the rest of her family (and Ray) were safe and sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Ray, he found himself on the soft webbing in between the second and third toes of this utter goddess. To him, this looked like two massive walls of skin that threatened to crush him and his small island of flesh as the gigantic girl moved her digits. That is, if he wasn\u2019t small enough to be uncrushable by this humongous human\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristy Howard felt pain smack her like a firm glove as she hit some strange, nonhuman surface. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u201cOWwww!!\u201d</font> she yelped out, clutching her damaged ankle. \u201cWhere is everyone? Where am I?\u201d she pondered. She was positive she had landed somewhere on this girl\u2019s foot, just like the rest of her family. She peered off the edge of this ledge she was on, seeing nothing but flesh-colored terrain below. Just then, light shone behind her. The confused tiny turned around to see a prism large enough to be a house, only reflecting enough light to illuminate a mote of dust. Suddenly, the pieces began to fall together. She remembered seeing a toe ring on Susan that she had gotten on her last birthday, with a small gemstone at its center. She was roaming around on the small piece of metal frame of the ring itself! She dropped to her knees, giving up on doing anything. Christy layed down on the metal that was her new home, possibly for eternity and after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pain, however, was nothing in comparison to Katie\u2019s, the causer of the entire dilemma. She had been unfortunate enough to get stuck upside down under her best friend\u2019s pinkie when she lifted it ever so slightly. She was \u201clucky\u201d enough to end up inside one of the tiny toe prints found on one\u2019s feet, tightly bound by a small amount of sweat. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u201cMom? Dad? Anyone?\u201d</font> the incredibly little sister of the Howards cried out in desperation. Before she got some semblance of an answer, however, the ground began to tremble with extreme vigor as Susan began to walk home, tired with waiting for someone to come. This only caused gallons and gallons more sweat to pour onto the microscopic Katie, nearly drowning her a few times. It also got a lot more hotter, which obviously didn't help matters. Alone and lost, she began to cry. There was no point. At this sheer insignificant size, she had no chance of finding her family, much less returning to normal size. And worst of all, this was all her fault. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u201cI'm sorry\u201d</font> she whispered, even though no even the smallest insect would hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 5 of the germ-sized people on Susan\u2019s right foot could do nothing but despair as the normal-sized Hispanic girl...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, Derek swam in silence, starring up at the giant girls rear with a look of pure awe, \"wow... its so... big...\" he said to himself as he continued starring, completely entranced by the giant rear that may be the men`s demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight huff, Alice sighed as she sat on the toilet seat, putting her whole weight onto it while she laid her elbows on her young legs, leaning her hands against her face. \"This may be a long one..\" she said silently to herself as she began contorting her muscles and attempted to push the excrement that was within her butt. She continued with no luck before pushing a little too hard resulting in a rush of yellow liquid to stream from her lowers. \"oh. Guess I had to pee too\" she said giggling as she enjoyed the sensation of her bladder emptying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Christy could only watch in a mix of horror and awe as the young goddess sat before her, her legs spread wider than a lady should have, showing off just how much larger the girl was compared to the tiny \"older\" sister. Christy starred in a trance, examining Alice`s huge crotch before as she went about her business completely unaware. Before long however, Alice sighed loudly as a strong, yellow current exploded from her crotch right before Christy`s eyes illuminating her sight in gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow in the toilet bowl, however, Derek and Ray swam absently to only be surprised by a sudden torrent of yellow liquid quickly splashing down next to them, covering them in the liquid as they attempted to stay above water. Although Alice only urinated for a few brief seconds, it seemed like 10`s of minutes had passed for the men below as they battled the young giantess` bodily waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the golden stream had subsided and only trickles were left for the men to battle as they regained their breath from the intense battle. \"Holy crap... we could have... we could have drowned under her... her...\", \"pee.\" Derek said, completing Ray`s sentence as they both stared above both in a new found horror and awe. Although she was young, Alice was healthy and often held in going to the washroom so as to prevent missing class resulting in her long bathroom breaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to- oh.. oh no...\" Derek said as he stared up at the sight before him. \"Whats... wrong?...\" Ray said as he looked up as well. After the torrential rain that was Alice`s urine, it seemed Alice wasn`t quite done as the two men appeared to be right above her sphincter. And it was twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like Alice isn`t done, but is it a false alarm?</span></div></div>",

Katie reluctantly nods. As soon as Alice says these words, Derek sees Katie`s spoon dive in to the potato mass again this time scooping up Ray and Christy with the snot they are stuck in.

But, right before Katie swallows, Alice surprisingly kisses Katie passionately moving her tongue between Katie`s and taking the potato snot family filled mash with her. As the cafeteria is empty, no one sees these two girls kissing as the potato mash moves from mouth to mouth ultimately landing in Alice`s. \"Wh-what was that for?\" Asks Katie who is taken back from the surprise kiss. \"Oh I always wanted to try that since I see my sister doing it and the food actually looked pretty good.\" Katie replies as she swallows Katies horrified siblings along with the mash. Meanwhile, Derek watches this happen with shock saying \"I always thought Alice was a little bit different.\" still shocked of his kids death in his little girls bestfriends stomach. \"Now time for the rest of that snot filled food!\" says Alice with excitement.

When she closed it she felt a bit of food on her toungue, it must've fallen out from between her teeth, or so she thought. She pushed it around her mouth with her toungue absent mindedly, as she argued with her younger sister Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me Kates they're only ants, I had a wild imagination too when I was your age.\"<br>\r\n\"No way they were lil people, I think they were Ray and Dad!\"<br>\r\n\"I give up, there's no use arguing with you. If you find your bugs again go show mum or something, cause if I find 'em, I'll squish them flat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to her bedroom before Katie could get in another word. As she sat down ontop of her bed she felt the piece of food again, now stuck to her lip - but strangley it was moving. She walked over to her mirror to check it out. Another ant, and so conviently placed. Someone once told her bugs were a good source of protein, time to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered what Katie said. \"Dad I see you!\" She said, voice heavy with sarcasm. \"But you look so tastey!\" She withdrew her toungue from her mouth and began to trace it accross her lips ever so slowly. Just before it reached the bug she stopped. \"Run Dad run!\" she said, and poked the tip of her toungue out again. \"The giant pink serpants coming for more. More stomachs just so hungry I can't help myself!\" The bug was almost at the edge of her lip, she couldn't have that could she. She swung it over to block the bugs retreat, and began to slowly slide it toward it again. Just before it reached him she began to laugh. \"I'm sorry Dad but my tummy needs you. No, Dad, No!\" and with that she swept it up into her mouth and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek looked down at the almighty gapping cave beneath him as he plummetted towards his daughter's pretty mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christie, no!\" He screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose luscious lips held open to their full extent, almost as if they were waiting for him to arrive. He landed on Christie's soft moist tongue with a squeltch. Her lips were parted slightly and a sliver of light illuminated his new environment. The cave stretched around him, the walls made of a dripping, slippery pinkish substance. On one side, huge white boulders the size of houses sorrounded the exit to the outside world. On the other, a deep dark tunnel to the world beneath beckoned, above which a great slimy pendulum swung back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the great pink whale that was his daughter's toungue began to move. The giant muscle picked him up and pushed him against her soft cheek, the slide him up to the rough roof of her mouth, then back down and around. For the first few seconds it followed this calm pattern before it suddenly went crazy. It moved like it was possessed, back and forth making whip like motions. Sometimes he was flung into daylight, before being drawn back into the cavern and the noise that went with it was deafening. Eventually the beast deposited him battered and bruised onto Christies vast lip before retreating back to its lair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world blurred past him as Christie began to move, before the image eventually stablised. He was infront of a massive mirror, and he could see himself, a mere speck stuck ontop of Christie's enormous lip. He began moving horisontally scaling the lip as to not fall off, maybe he could attract some attention. He did. As he gazed into the mirror, into his daughters beautiful face her saw her eye's fixed upon him. Unfortunately it wasn't the kind look of recognition he expected, there was mockery, superioty and disgust in that stare, and it scared him. He expected her to squish him or blow him off, but instead she did something even worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad I see you!\" her enormous voice boomed. Suddenly he was filled with hope.<br>\r\n\"Christie, Christie please help me, can you hear me darling?\" He screamed. Something wasn't quite right, her stare hadn't changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you look so tastey!\" The reply chilled him to the bones, and he finally understood his fate. She thought he was a bug, and was joking with herself in response to Katie.<br>\r\n\"No Christy, no! Please it's really me! Please Goddammit recognise me!\" He heard a noise from inside her mouth and the demon that assulted him earlier withdrew from its hidey-hole ready for its meal. He began climbing away from it as fast as he could, but as he knew he was helpless. He could here it scraping accross her lip as it slowly moved towards him. Mockingly slow, but fast enough to outrun him. But he kept at it, determined he wouldn't end this way, devoured by his own hungry daughter, she blissfully unaware of his trauma. It was to no avail though, the toungue with nearly upon him. Suddenly it left again, and Christie opened her mouth to speak. Was it over, would he survive? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run Dad Run!\" she taunted. He nearly broke down into tears. She was teasing with him, playing with him, cruelly like a child with a bug. That's all he was to her now, a bug to a goddess. A bug to his daughter. He had to keep on going, he couldn't give up. He saw the great snake slither out a bit before reating once again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The giant pink serpants coming for more. More stomachs just so hungry I can't help myself!\" she boomed once again. Tears began to flow down his cheeks. He couldn't take it anymore. Luckily he was nearing the edge of her lips, she might let him go. Not likely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toungue emerged once more, spittle flying everywhere, with more speed and ferocity. Again it was almost upon him and again, just before it ended she taunted him again, it was to be the one last time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she begain to laugh, before sentencing him to death.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Dad but my tummy needs you. No, Dad, No!\" and with that his daughters toungue emergy one last time, in all its magnificants and glory, trendils of spit dripping down from it. It descend upon him, struck him and dragged him screaming into her hot steamy maw, a morsel, lunch overdue. With one great heave it pushed him towards her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know to you I'm merely a yummy snack, but Christy I love you.\" His last thoughts as he entered the dark tunnel to his daughters stomach, his ultimate destination, his doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She was practically giggling with glee as she moved her right boot in front of you. The tip of her boot was taller than you! How pathetic, you thought. Lindsay then leaned back on her heel, lifting her right boot hundreds of feet in the air, at least that's what it seemed to you. \"So long little buggy\" Lindsay said down to you, in an icy, evil tone.<br>\r\nThis was it, crushed by your wife, Lindsay,'s right booted foot. What a way to go.<br>\r\nThen you saw her foot begin to move. \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!\" You screamed, as the colossal boot began to lower, sentencing your death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she suddenly stopped. You were relieved. But, not after you heard this: \"Nah, this is too merciful. I want to feel you struggle!\" Lindsay said with an evil grin, as she gripped her right boot. You were curious and terrified on how she could possibly make this worse. Then she pulled on her boot, tugging it off, revealing her giant socked foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a wave of smelly, sweaty feet assaulted you, you realized this will be 20 times worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then wiggled her massive socked toes, spreading the stench and adding to the humiliation. \"Things can't get much worse.\" you muttered, but then, just then, they got MUCH worse.<br>\r\nLindsay grabbed her sock, and slowly worked it off, slowly revealing more and more of her bare sole, slowly making the stench around you even stinkier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took her removed sock, dangled it in front of you. It was covered in her foot sweat (the worse kind of sweat a girl can give off!) and it reeked. She then tossed the sock over her shoulder, having it land very near Derek. You would feel sorry for him, because soon the smell would work its way into the shot glass, but wouldn't be getting out, making your best friend have to deal with the horrific stench of your wife's feet, but you were too scared about your fate, and being crushed under the source of the stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay then slowly lowered her foot down, the stench somehow getting stronger and stronger every half-second.<br>\r\nYou started screaming for mercy, but it was apparent it wasn't coming.<br>\r\nYou finally had the instinct to run, but you were frozen with fear. You tried running so hard, but all that resulted in was falling on your back, now on the floor, gazing up as Lindsay lowered her smelly ped.<br>\r\nThis had all happened in mere seconds, though it felt as if it were an hour or more. Finally, Lindsay's smelly sole made contact. You would rather have been crushed under her boot, no matter how slowly, then have to be this close to Lindsay's smelly bare foot. Finally her foot blanketed you, leaving you nothing to see but the underside of her sole, and no fresh air, only her stale foot odor. You started squirming like crazy, hoping some way it would save you. But all you did was make Lindsay think her idea as better and better, getting a dominative pleasure of having you squirm under her stinky sole. You heard her say something, but you couldn't hear what it was...all you know is that she was really excited and happy. Which is the last thing you need.<br>\r\nYou were now 100% under Lindsay's foot, and it was the smelliest god damn thing you have ever smelled. Lindsay then moved her foot around, until you were peering up at her from between her toes. Then it hit you, her toes smelled even worse. \"How is this possible?!\" you thought. Then her toes scrunched, shoving you head into her toe crevice, making it all the smellier. Once Lindsay kills you, you hope to God you go to Heaven, because Hell is right here. then from far above, you hear \"Lick\" being uttered mercilessly from Lindsay's mouth. You were dumbfounded. She wasn't content with making you experience the worst smell the universe have to offer, but now you  must lick it's source? Is this woman crazy?! \"Lick between my smelly toes!\" She said, pushing down on your body painfully. \"She doesn't know the definition of smelly 'till she's underneath her foot.\" You mutter. Lindsay then wiggled her toes, squishing your head all around. Gathering your courage, you finally opened your mouth, placed it in her toe crevice, and moved it around, licking between Lindsay's toes. Her foot tasted as bad as it smelled, and that's saying something. You cannot believe your wife, Lindsay, has totally dominated you with the lowest and smelliest part of her body--that's how small you are.</span></div></div>",

In what seemed like light spped she had snatched Ray between her big and second toe and squeezed.  It wasn't terribly tight but the speed at which it happened left Ray disoriented.<br>\r\n\"Now for the dressing\"  Shelly said.  She slowly wrapped the nylon around her foot.  When I say slow, I mean slow.  It seemed like it took at least a minute for it to pass her heel.  Once there, she released her toe grip and Ray fell forward into the nylon mesh.  As she did this she raised her foot so that both Derek and Lyndsay could see.  <br>\r\n\"So honey, you wanted to get hot and sweaty with another woman did you?  Well fine, you have my permission to do so with your best friend's wife\"  Lyndsay said mockingly.  \"That's of course if Shelly wants you\"<br>\r\n\"Oooh yes I think I'd like that\" Shelly said continuing the game.<br>\r\nThe only question was what to do next for Shelly.

You freaked, because you did NOT want to go in her smelly boot with her stinky foot. She then hovered her socked foot above the entrance to her boot. \"Welcome to complete and total hell.\" She said menacingly. She then preceded to lower her foot into the smelly darkness that is the inside of her boot.<br>\r\nOnce her foot was fully inside her stinky boot, she wiggled her toes, making the smelly experience all the worse for you.<br>\r\nYou realized now you might as well call Lindsay your goddess, she pretty much is to you, and there's no way you can escape her stinky wrath. You were trapped under her foot, with your head in between her toes, in her sock, inside of her smelly boot! Your. Life. Sucks. <br>\r\nYou can then feel Lindsay walking, which is torturous. When she reached her car, she climbed in, briefly putting all of her wait on you, then she got in, closed the door, buckled up, started the car, and pushed down on the pedal, squishing you. After about 20 minutes of this pedal-pushing torment, she arrived home. Lindsay and Marissa walked to the house, walking in. Sucks for you, Lindsay did NOT take off her stinky boots. </span></div></div>",

The first option was to scratch her head and dig her nails into the skin the group is in. The other option was to rub her head, knocking the group into her iced coffee.</span></div></div>",

Even though Derek was moments away from his wife possiblly ending his life with one step of her shoe, he was incredibly turned on by his wife having his fate in her hands like a beautiful, hot-tempered, and uncaring goddess that would crush any man who got in her way like an insect.

Derek and Ray looked up at the beautiful goddess-sized woman that was now laying on the floor to get a closer look at the shrunken men. Shelly then pulled out a magnifying glass looked at the two helpless men that were now jumping for joy because someone had found them. \"Honey how do you guys shrink?\" Shelly asked. Derek then told his wife about how Katie accidently shrunk them down to size and then had broken their machine. \"Well Derek, it's a good thing I didn't mistake you and Ray for bugs.\" she said. \"We know Shelly\" Derek said. \"Now can you please...\" \"Hold on a second Derek.\" Shelly said with a look on her face that only Derek knew too well. \"I just realized that at this size you two are at my mercy.\" Shelly said. Derek and Ray gulped as Shelly grinned at them. Derek feared what his wife was thinking about going to do to him and his best friend. He feared this because Shelly was a feminist who believed that women are superior to men. Because Shelly believed that women should completely dominate their husbands Derek was often beaten by his wife and forced to have kinky sex with her. Shelly would often handcuff Derek to the bed and punch and kick his manhood several times. She had also just recently installed a electric shocking device that was locked around his balls and shocked him if he misbehaved or if she just had a bad day and wanted to take her anger out on her husband. Since he was now an inch tall his wife who had complete control over him had even more control over him. Disgusted by his best friend's timid behavior, Ray decided to stand up to his best friend's wife because he knew Derek was a wuss when standing up to his wife at his normal height. \"Shelly\"!\" Ray said loudly. \"I know Derek lets you push him around, but I will not stand here and take...\" Suddenly, Shelly dropped the magnifying glass and the impact made Derek and Ray fall backwards on the floor. Shelly giggled at them after they fell because it showed them that she was the all-powerful goddess that could make their lives a living hell at her whim. Shelly then picked up Derek and Ray between her thumb and pointer fingernails, holding one of them in each of her hands. \"Now slaves.\" Shelly said as the pathetic men dangled helplessly by the beautiful woman's fingernails. \"Should I tell Ray's wife about the two of you or should I just keep both of you for myself?\" she asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Filled with an almost otherworldly sense of power, power that came as the result of having her 1 inch tall father at her feet, Christy had decided on an action that at first, simply seemed like a harmless bit of kidding.  Her dad had frequently commented on how bad her feet smelled and she, as was her laid back, joking demeanor, went along with his \"rants.\"  Too be sure, her feet smelled strong, probably a little more so than the average 18 year old girl's, but that could mostly be blamed on her intense athletic prowess and active lifestyle.  She'd often asked herself, slightly embarrassed despite her Dad's mostly intentional exaggerated complaints, what person's feet wouldn't smell after going for a five mile run, or after playing soccer for two hours in a pair of stuffy cleats?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as a burgeoning young woman, Christy had also been experimenting sexually.  Along the way, she had discovered the wonders of certain men having what was known as a foot fetish.  She enjoyed this, as a few of her male friends had been extremely interested in rubbing and kneading her feet.  She'd sort of decided that at least he friend Timmy had had a foot fetish, and not just for female feet, but for smelly feet.  He certainly seemed to enjoy being around her feet right after a soccer game or after running.  Judging from the way he sorta shook when her big, smelly, sock-covered feet were in his lap, she figured it wouldn't take much to make him happy.  So, coupled with her new-found knowledge of foot fetishes, particularly ones that focused on smelly girl's feet, Christy wondered with mild curiosity if her own father was attracted to woman's feet.  The more he mentioned her feet, the surer she was that her dad liked her smelly feet.  The possiblity of her own father being attracted to the smell of his daughter's feet didn't necessarily sicken her.  It was really weird but, given the wide array of fetishes he could have, she felt the enjoyment of rank girl feet was rather tame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when she'd come upon her shrunken father a little while go, she realized exactly what had happened.  Her father Derek, had obviously perfected his shrinking machine.  From there, with him so close to her feet, it just seemed like a fun, playful way to tease her little Daddy, while possibly even fulfilling his fetish for her smelly feet.  The sight of her giantess form and gargantuian-sized, sock-covered feet had filled Derek with a feeling of pure, unadulterated awe.  From finding him instantly shrunk down in size to coming across his oldest daughter and being so close to her pungent feet, was almost to much for him to take in.  For the record, Derek did in fact have a secret fetish focused on smelly female feet.  And to his everlasting shame, that attraction had morphed into a deep, almost pathological attraction to Christy's feet.  Furthermore, against all paternal instincts, he also was attracted to the idea of his daughter dominating him beneath her feet.  The smellier, the better.  Or, at least, that's what he thought while in fantasyland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when his daughter had actually begun to demean him and to suggest that he should actually smell her feet, he though two things.  First, it crossed his fragile little mind that there was a good chance that Christy knew of his fetish somehow.  Second, once he saw how serious she was about having him smell her feet, the very real dangers of such \"playfullness\" occurred to him.  At his size, not only would it take only a slight miststep by his daughter for him to be turned into a tiny red smear on the bottom fo her foot, the effect of actually breathing in such a powerful stench on such a tiny body could be catastrophic.  And sure enough, the sight, and then the almost supernatural, vilely ripe stench of his daughter's teen feet had brought him to his knees.  Her socks were potent and could have ended him right there alone, but when she removed her sweaty socks, he didn't stand a chance.  Just as his vision faded, as the haughty, superior grin that Christy often flashed in moments of triumph lingered for a few moments, Derek realized the awful truth:  He was absolutely no match for his own daughter's feet.  He wasn't at any size being the size of a flea ensured his doom if she wasn't careful.  No doubt, Christy simply believed she was having a little fun at his expense.  If she knew of his fetish, then she was definitely horsing around with him.  His last conscious thought before the rank, pungent smell of his daughter's foot forced him into a deep sleep, was whether or not his daughter was actually punishing him for having a foot fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristy marveled at the sight before her.  Her little Daddy-toy had simply given up, and passed out just from smelling her feet for a few sniffs.  Thinking of her recent education into fetishes and aspects of domination, she then thought of it in terms of submission.  Yes, her Daddy had submitted to her superior feet, to all their smelly, feminine, daughter glory!  What a loser, she thought.  She loved to little flea, but honestly, what man begs like he had?  What sort of father wasn't even a match for his own daughter's feet, even at his size?  And finally, what was keeping her from actually seeing how much of her feet he could physically take before she broke him?  She didn't mean this physically, per se.  Rather, she wondered if she simply kept him close to her feet, how long it would take before she could get him to admit certain things to her.  For one, thinking like a cruel dominatrix she'd read about on some website, she thought it'd be exciting to use nothing more than the smell of her feet to break her Dad down emotionally to the point where he begged to remain at them forever?  Wow, I'm sick, she jokingly thought.  She wouldn't keep him that way of course, but could you imagine him ever being the same afterwords?  He'd never be able to look her in the eye or relate to her as a superior ever again.  No, she'd always figuratively have her Dad wrapped around her finger.  Looking down at his prostrate form, she thought, no, I'll always have him wrapped around my toe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her Dad still unconscious next to her big toe, Christy decided to place her foot over him, but not to where it contacted him.  Scrunching her mighty toes briefly, she then placed her foot over her father's comatose body so that her heel touched the ground.  She then gently again scrunched her toes inf front, leaving a brief pocket for her father to lay beneath the toe arches.  Christy smiled at the sight.  She felt wise beyond her 18 years, powerful, like the ultimate foot goddess.  When her flea-sized Daddy awoke, what a sight he'd be confronted with!  Not only would the very pungent, ripe smell of her unwashed barefeet permeate his entire being, he'd be looking directly into the deep, wrinkly folds of her foot fleish.  She wanted him to see it, to smell it, and to know without dbout that he was going to eventually be scrunched and tightly packed within those pungent folds soon.  To add to the scenery and atmosphere, Christy placed her white athletic socks and soccer cleats on the sides of his body.  She hoped the combined sight and smell further broke her Daddy and destroyed what little remained of his self-esteem.   </span></div></div>",

Katie shook her head and bawled into her hands. \u201cDaddy, who's that?\u201d Christy demanded, flirtasiously smiling at the black-haired cutie. Another black-haired boy walked in, with an <i>amazing</i> six pack and long black hair that fell around his angular face. \u201cAh, sweetheart, come here,\u201d said the new boy and dropped his giant-like body to a crouch.

In it was Christy, who was arguing loudly with a black-haired teenage Derek and Ray, who had dozed off against her thumb in a ball similiar to that of a cat\u2019s. Jake reached forward, his fingers dancing along the end of Katie's pants and she froze, afraid he\u2019d touch her innapropriately. But, as it turns out, he just wanted the gun.

All three of the shrunken parents now stand in shock as the once small 11 year old is now the tallest thing they have ever seen. She slowly approaches, her footsteps create almost unbearable booms and quakes. She enters a little further, the parents huddle together as Katie's giant flip flops land on both sides of them. Their gaze moves upward along her long smooth legs, that disappear into shorts, and on to the underside of her chin. They see the muscles in her legs tense and a slight quiver in her thighs as she slowly taps her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM? DAD?\" Her voice echoes, causing them to cover their ears and scream for her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decide to run to the foot that wasn't tapping and try to gain her attention by making her feel them. Boosting each other up onto her sandals, they barely made it. Katie turns away and begins to walk back downstairs. Derek, Ray and Shelley are holding on to Katie's house sized toes for dear life as the world passes by at a blistering speed. It's hard to get a grip at an 1/8th of an inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks into the kitchen and grabs a bag of popcorn, putting it into the microwave. As she waits for it to be done, the parents decide to take advantage of this and climb to the top of her foot. They begin to pound and pinch and scream, but they quickly realize she cant even feel them. The microwaves beeper goes off and she pours the popcorn into a bowl. They hold on tight again as the world buzzes by. She enters the living room, where she sees Christy getting a movie ready for the 2 of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE THEY NOT JOINING?\" Christy asks Katie. Her voice is even more loud then Katie's was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I COULDN'T FIND THEM.\" Katie responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HMM, THEY MUST'VE GONE OUT THEN. OH WELL, MORE POPCORN FOR US!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tiny parents could barely make out what each giantess was saying, their voices were deafening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie casually sat down next to Christy and slid her flip flops off. She then kicked her feet up and propped them up on the coffee table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parents tried to hold on as Katie put her feet on the table, but it was no use.
